Good morning, and welcome to the Macy's call scheduled to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings. I am Karen Hoguet, CFO of the company. Any transcription or other reproduction of the statements made in this call without our consent is prohibited. A replay of the call will be available on our website, www.macysinc.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after the call concludes. Please refer to the Investor Relations section of our website for discussion and reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures discussed this morning.
Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
As we announced in early January, we had a disappointing November-December. Fortunately, with the cold weather in the new year, business did improve in January, and we did better than expected at the time of our January announcement. And earnings were stronger as a result. Comp owned plus licensed sales declined 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year. EPS on a diluted basis, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges for the quarter, was $2.09 as compared to our most recent guidance of $1.85 to $1.90. And for the full year, EPS on that same net basis was $3.77, down 14% from last year.
During the fourth quarter, we launched, through our advisors, the marketing of potential partnership and joint venture transactions for our real estate, both our multi-stores and our 4 flagship stores. The demand has been very strong, which is encouraging, but it is premature to comment further at this point. 
I will now talk about our performance in the quarter and highlight some of the bright spots in an otherwise weak quarter and year. I will then talk about our outlook for the next few years as well as provide guidance on our key planning assumptions for 2016. 
So let's start with the fourth quarter. Sales in the quarter were $8.9 billion, down 5.3% from last year. And as I said a minute ago, on a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 4.3%. Similar to this third quarter, we had approximately a 4% decline in the number of transactions, a 1% decrease in the average unit retail, and units per transaction were up about 1%.
We've talked about overall weakness in our sales and particular weakness in the cold weather businesses, but we did have some categories that performed quite well in the quarter: cosmetics, fragrances, furniture and mattresses as well as active. Geographically, our business was strongest in the west where weather was less of a factor. This is true both in-store and online. 
Overall, our digital business continued on a very strong pace. Digit continues to grow rapidly for purchasing, but it is also becoming even more important for browsing and researching. 
Best of all, for us, is in Omnichannel retailer. Customers are increasingly going back and forth between digital devices and stores. We continue to make progress this year on improving our mobile technology as well as optimizing fulfillment capabilities in the stores, including utilizing our BOPS, or Buying Online Pick Up in Store, as a great way to satisfy demand. Unfortunately, the decline in international tourist sales did not lessen during the fourth quarter and hurt our comp performance by approximately 1 point. This was less of an impact than experienced in the third quarter, but that is because international tourism is less important for us in the holiday period.
Bloomingdale's had a more challenging quarter than Macy's, largely due to the geographic mix of locations with even heavier concentrations of tourist stores. And for Bloomingdale's, too, the digital growth was strong. 
Gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 37.4%, down 290 basis points from last year. At the start of the quarter, you will remember that we expected a lower than last year gross margin rate. However, our actual rates was worse than expected as a result of the weak holiday sales and our desire to start 2016 with the right inventory level.
We were pleased that we ended the year with our inventory up 1.6% or, on a comp basis, up 0.7%. We took the needed markdowns to make sure that we both cleared seasonal goods and priced what was left properly for February-March selling. 
For the year as a whole, the gross margin rate dropped 90 basis points versus the prior year. SG&A in the quarter was $2.2 billion, down 5% from last year, and as a percent of sales, SG&A was flat to last year. Included in the SG&A were asset sale gains of approximately $114 million. This compares to $36 million last year. Included in this number is $84 million associated with the Brooklyn transaction, $18 million for the sale of one of our Mission Valley stores in San Diego and approximately $12 million in other miscellaneous asset sale gains.
Credit income was $280 million in the quarter, up approximately $40 million over last year. As we transitioned to our new credit system platform in the fall of 2015, we benefited from stronger-than-expected portfolio yields. Going forward, we are closely monitoring a rise in delinquency levels that could generate some increase in losses in 2016, as I'll discuss later. 
SG&A in the quarter also benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals and our flexing of expense with the lower sales. So the impact of the real estate transactions, stronger-than-expected credit results and other expense reductions enabled us to more than offset the increases in other expense areas and our investments in growth.
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $270 million or $4 million higher than a year ago. Operating income, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges, was $1.1 billion, down 23% from last year. And as a percent of sales, operating and EBIT on this basis was 12.6%, down from 15.5% last year. 
In the quarter, we booked $177 million of charges associated with store closings and restructuring. $37 million of this was for additional noncash asset impairments. Interest expense in the quarter was $93 million. Booked tax expense was $300 million or 35.6% of pretax income. On an annual basis, our effective tax rate was 36.2%, flat with last year. This is a little better than expected, primarily due to state tax settlements.
The net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest, which is related to our China joint venture, was $1 million. Let me remind you how the accounting for China works.
As you know, we own 65% of the venture, but we consolidate their financials and include 100% of the sales, margin, expense, et cetera, on -- in our statement. So on the P&L, we then break out the portion of the net income or, in this case, the loss, which Macy's does not own on this line.
Net income attributable to Macy's in the quarter was $544 million or $659 million, excluding store closing and restructuring costs. This compares to last year's $793 million or $857 million, excluding similar charges and last year's make-whole premium for the early retirement of debt.
Diluted share count was 314.8 million shares in the quarter, which is 10% lower than a year ago due to the $2 billion of stock repurchased during fiscal 2015.
Earnings per share on a diluted basis was $1.73 or $2.09, excluding store closings and restructuring charges. And this compares to $2.44 last year on the same basis.
Cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, in 2015, was still $892 million even in a disappointing year. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was just short of $2 billion, $725 million below last year. This is due primarily to lower net income. And net cash used from investing activities was $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than last year, but it would have been $90 million lower, excluding the Bluemercury acquisition.
As a result of the EBITDA decline, our leverage ratio increased from 2.6x last year to 3.0x this year, assuming the same 9.3x factor for rent capitalization and the excluding the debt issued in the fourth quarter, which was raised to pay off 2016 maturities. This is higher than our target range of 2.5 to 2.8x. As our EBITDA returns to levels achieved in recent years, we expect to get this ratio back into the target range.
So let's move on to the future. As Terry keeps telling our team, a setback is a setup for a comeback. And we are all focused on learning from 2015 to improve our results in 2016 and beyond. Our long-term goals for financial performance remain unchanged. We are still focused on achieving an annual comp sales increase of at least 2%, with an EBITDA rate of 14% and an ROIC of 22%, both of which we achieved in 2014. This will not happen all in 1 year, but we do hope that we are turning the corner as we start the new year. 
And while 2015 was disappointing, we did pilot some initiatives that are expected to help us in 2016 and beyond. I'll mention just 5 of them. One, jewelry. As you know, we tested a new approach to our fine jewelry and watch business in 2015. It involves strengthening selling skills, including changes needed to talent, training and compensation; also included improved associate availability, more direct supervision and a higher quality product offering. Fine jewelry serves as a backbone to our wedding initiative. And based on the success of the pilot, we are rolling this approach out across the country. 300 of our stores will be live this fall and the balance of our stores, a year later.
Number two, Last Act [ph] and Backstage. As an outgrowth of our research behind the pilot of our off-price concept, as you know, called Backstage, we decided to test a simplified pricing approach for clearance in our apparel areas in the Macy's stores. We took deeper price reductions on our second and third markdowns but then excluded these goods from coupons and additional discounts. We also moved these goods to separate spaces on our apparel floors, generally one in the men's and one in the women's areas. Customer reaction was very positive. Sales were higher, sell-through faster and gross margin higher, with very few complaints from customers about not being able to use coupons.
Based on this successful test, we have already rolled this out to all of our Macy's stores. 
We also opened our 6 pilot Backstage stores this past fall. We continue to learn from these stores and plan to continue our testing in 2016. In addition to these freestanding stores, plus one more that we will be opening in 2016, we will be testing putting Backstage stores within approximately 15 Macy's locations. We believe this could be an exciting way to drive traffic to our Macy doors and to offer some price points and categories, for example, home decor, baby gear, toys, et cetera, that we don't currently carry at Macy's. 
The third initiative is our top-door strategy. We began executing this fall a strategy to accelerate and drive further growth in our top 150 locations.
We are working to improve all aspects of these stores from product, to presentation, to customer service, to special events. We want to give customers more reasons to come to these stores that are located in the best malls and freestanding locations in the country.
Four is Bluemercury. Bluemercury has been part of the Macy's family for just under a year. We've opened 15 new stores in 2015 after the deal closed, including 8 in markets where we either had no or limited market share before. This brought the total number of locations to 77. We also opened our first 4 stores within Macy's. These shops bring to our Macy's customers new brands as well as new services.
We are very excited about these. 
We are also including the Bluemercury team, along with Macy's and Bloomingdale's, to strategize how to maximize the company's digital offering in beauty. As you know, we are very focused on this category as one of the company's significant growth opportunities, and we are happy having Bluemercury as part of our strategy.
And fifth is mobile. Mobile is a major priority for the company. Sales on mobile devices more than doubled in 2015, fueled by large increases in both traffic and also conversion. It is the fastest-growing digital channel. We think mobile first and are very focused on making both customer-facing enhancements and also improvements in functionality that will ultimately further improve the customer experience.
We believe all 5 of these initiatives that I just talked about will help performance in 2016 but are likely to have a bigger impact in 2017 and beyond. We are very focused on improving our execution in 2016, and at the same time, we are evolving our M.O.M. strategy to meet the needs of our changing customer and competitive environment. I will talk about what we call M.O.M. 2.0 in a few minutes, but let me first summarize our key planning assumptions for 2016.
We are assuming that our comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis will decline approximately 1% in 2016. And with the impact of the store closures, this would lead to a total sales decline of approximately 2%. It isn't, though, until the fourth quarter that we expect our comp owned plus licensed sales to turn positive. We believe this to be the prudent assumption, given the environment and our performance heading into the year. We view this year to be one of resetting and rebuilding. 
We are still expecting a modest increase in our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales in 2016, as we stated in our press release on January 6. This is assumed to be driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, although we don't expect the gross margin rate will get all the way back to the level achieved in 2014 all in 1 year.
Expense dollars are expected to be flattish in -- to the 2015 level, and as a result of the sales decline, the rate as a percent of sales is assumed to increase. We have implemented the previously announced restructuring, and we've taken the other actions that will reduce expense by approximately the $400 million in 2016. These actions that have been taken will enable us to offset increases in wages as well as the investments we are making to enhance our growth in the areas mentioned such as digital, top doors, Bluemercury, Backstage and China.
Included in the SG&A guidance, our asset sale gains of approximately $235 million, including an estimated $86 million of the gain for Brooklyn. The remainder of the Brooklyn gain is expected to be booked in 2017. The gain for Brooklyn will be booked quarterly based on the amount of construction we complete each quarter. We anticipate that about 1/4 of that expected gain of the $86 million will be booked in the first half of the year, with the other remainder in the back half of the year. But please note that it could change by quarter and even by year based on the construction schedule.
We are also assuming approximately $150 million for gains from other asset sales. We are not including in our guidance, though, any impact from the potential transactions related to Herald Square Union Square, downtown Minneapolis, downtown Chicago or if we do a more comprehensive joint venture structure for the mall stores.
Credit profitability is expected to decline slightly in 2016 from 2015, as sales decline and the profitability of our portfolio stabilizes at a historic high rate or possibly decline slightly with higher interest rates and potentially higher delinquency trends.
Retirement-related expense is assumed to decline by approximately $25 million in 2016, due primarily to a change to using the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs. 
Depreciation and amortization is assumed at approximately $1,070,000,000 based on our capital budget of $900 million for 2016.
Interest expense is assumed at approximately $365 million, and our assumption for the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is approximately $10 million in 2016. But know that this is hard to estimate.  Our assumed effective tax rate is 37%. 
So with all of these assumptions, our diluted EPS guidance is $3.80 to $3.90 as compared to the $3.77 for 2015. As you model earnings-per-share by quarter, the first and third quarters are assumed to be, with these assumptions, below 2015 levels. As I said earlier, comp sales are expected to be below a year ago in the first 9 months of the year. Also, gross margin rate is assumed to decline in the first and third quarters. In the first, because of the lingering impact of the tough fourth quarter, and in the third quarter because of the strong 2015 performance.
Also, asset sale gains are expected to be lower than 2015 in these quarters, although that easily could change based on the timing of transactions. We assume that the earnings growth in the second and fourth quarters will more than offset the declines in the first and third quarters, so that as you could tell from our guidance for the full year, earnings-per-share would exceed 2015.
One more item to mention. In 2016, we are expecting that settlement accounting relating to our retirement plans will begin to apply. This is not included in our guidance and will be broken out as a separate line item on our P&L. This occurs in a year when lump sum payments associated with our retirement plans exceed a materiality threshold equal to the sum of the planned service cost and interest cost. As this threshold is exceeded, there is a noncash charge that recognizes a portion of the plan's deferred unrecognized losses. Recognition begins in the quarter in which the threshold is crossed and then continues for the remainder of the year. Freezing our plans has lowered this threshold materially. We are assuming that we will exceed the threshold this year due to store closings or voluntary separation program, restructurings, small -- and small, balanced force-outs, in addition to our regular distribution activity. Our current estimate is that we will have a charge in fiscal 2016 of approximately $135 million for the year, with approximately $15 million booked in the first half of the year and the remaining in the back half of the year. As I said earlier, these noncash charges are not included in guidance, but I didn't want you to be surprised when you see this new line item on our P&L as we go through 2016.
We also hope that by year-end, we will have executed some real estate transactions. But as I said earlier, it is impossible to predict what will be done, when it will be done or what the financial benefit will be. And as I mentioned earlier, these transactions are not included in our guidance.
So while we are all disappointed about 2015, the team here is energized about improving the company's sales and earnings trends in 2016 as a foundation for growth in the years ahead. We are a very competitive team, and no one is thrilled about how 2015 turned out even if some of the factors of downward pressure were out of our control. And as I quoted Terry earlier, we are all believing that a setback is a setup for a comeback. 
Recently, about 600 senior executives, including all of the Macy's district and regional store leaders as well as the heads of technology, digital, merchandising, planning, marketing and support organizations, met to hear how we have refined our business strategies going into 2016. The presentation centered on M.O.M., which continues to be our guide. We are evolving the meaning of M.O.M. to coincide with where the customer is heading. My Macy's is migrating from a focus on localization to one of personalization. Omnichannel today means providing omni choices for our customers, in-stores and digital, especially mobile. And Magic Selling is shifting focus to new techniques for building Magic Connections with shoppers. Under these redefined M.O.M. strategies, we have defined very specific initiatives for the future, each driven by a team of high-performing and creative executives.
They are grouped into 5 buckets: one, acquiring new customers and deepen loyalty; two, win with distinctive product; three, push the digital frontier; four, expand through new formats; and five, create signature experiences.
The response to this refreshed direction among our senior team was very enthusiastic. They can see that we are driving our company to where the puck is headed not to where it is or used to be. We are thinking ahead and are confident we can return to the profitable growth trajectory we saw in the 6 years prior to 2015 and to the 14% EBITDA rate we posted in 2014.
A primary focus today is on growing what we might call our core Omnichannel business. And meanwhile, we are taking the early steps, testing and learning toward longer-term growth vehicles, including off-price and international. We think you will continue to find that Macy's, Inc. is a company to watch and that we are evolving as we position ourselves to be the customers' first choice for fashion, value and convenience in the years and decades ahead. 
Thanks for your interest, and now I'll take your questions."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
As we announced in early January, we had a disappointing November, December. Fortunately, with the cold weather in the new year, business did improve in January and we did better than expected at the time of our January announcement and earnings were stronger as a result. Comp owned plus licensed sales declined 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year. EPS on a diluted basis, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges for the quarter, were $2.09 as compared to our most recent guidance of $1.85 to $1.90. And for the full year, EPS on that same basis was $3.77, down 14% from last year.
During the fourth quarter, we launched, through our advisers, the marketing of potential partnership and joint venture transactions for our real estate, both our multi-stores and our 4 flagship stores. The demand has been very strong, which is encouraging, but it is premature to comment further at this point. 
I will now talk about our performance in the quarter and highlight some of the bright spots in an otherwise weak quarter and year. I will then talk about our outlook for the next few years as well as provide guidance on our key planning assumptions for 2016. 
So let's start with the fourth quarter. Sales in the quarter were $8.9 billion, down 5.3% from last year. And as I said a minute ago, on a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 4.3%. Similar to the third quarter, we had approximately a 4% decline in the number of transactions, a 1% decrease in the average unit retail and units per transaction were up about 1%.
We've talked about overall weakness in our sales and particular weakness in the cold weather businesses, but we did have some categories that performed quite well in the quarter: cosmetics, fragrances, furniture and mattresses as well as active. Geographically, our business was strongest in the West where weather was less of a factor. This was true both in-store and online. 
Overall, our digital business continued on a very strong pace. Digit continues to grow rapidly for purchasing, but it is also becoming even more important for browsing and researching. Best of all, for us, is in Omnichannel retailer. Customers are increasingly going back and forth between digital devices and stores. 
We continue to make progress this year on improving our mobile technology as well as optimizing fulfillment capabilities in the stores, including utilizing our BOPS, or Buying Online - Pickup in Store, as a great way to satisfy demand. 
Unfortunately, the decline in international tourist sales did not lessen during the fourth quarter and hurt our comp performance by approximately 1 point. This was less of an impact than experienced in the third quarter, but that is because international tourism is less important for us in the holiday period.
Bloomingdale's had a more challenging quarter than Macy's, largely due to the geographic mix of locations with even heavier concentrations of tourist stores. And for Bloomingdale's, too, the digital growth was strong. 
Gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 37.4%, down 290 basis points from last year. At the start of the quarter, you will remember that we expected a lower than last year gross margin rate. However, our actual rate was worse than expected as a result of the weak holiday sales and our desire to start 2016 with the right inventory level.
We were pleased that we ended the year with our inventory up 1.6%, or on a comp basis, up 0.7%. We took the needed markdowns to make sure that we both cleared seasonal goods and priced what was left properly for February-March selling. 
For the year as a whole, the gross margin rate dropped 90 basis points versus the prior year. 
SG&A in the quarter was $2.2 billion, down 5% from last year, and as a percent of sales, SG&A was flat to last year. Included in the SG&A were asset sale gains of approximately $114 million. This compares to $36 million last year. Included in this number is $84 million associated with the Brooklyn transaction, $18 million for the sale of one of our Mission Valley stores in San Diego and approximately $12 million in other miscellaneous asset sale gains.
Credit income was $280 million in the quarter, up approximately $40 million over last year. As we transitioned to our new credit system platform in the fall of 2015, we benefited from stronger-than-expected portfolio yields. Going forward, we are closely monitoring a rise in delinquency levels that could generate some increase in losses in 2016 as I'll discuss later. 
SG&A in the quarter also benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals and our flexing of expense with the lower sales. 
So the impact of the real estate transactions, stronger-than-expected credit results and other expense reductions enabled us to more than offset the increases in other expense areas and our investments in growth.
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $270 million or $4 million higher than a year ago. 
Operating income, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges, was $1.1 billion, down 23% from last year. And as a percent of sales, operating EBIT on this basis was 12.6%, down from 15.5% last year. 
In the quarter, we booked $177 million of charges associated with store closings and restructuring. $37 million of this was for additional noncash asset impairments. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $93 million. 
Booked tax expense was $300 million or 35.6% of pretax income. On an annual basis, our effective tax rate was 36.2%, flat with last year. This is a little better than expected primarily due to state tax settlements.
The net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest, which is related to our China joint venture, was $1 million. 
Let me remind you how the accounting for China works. As you know, we own 65% of the venture, but we consolidate their financials and include 100% of the sales, margin, expense, et cetera, on -- in our statement. So on the P&L, we then break out the portion of the net income, or in this case, the loss, which Macy's does not own on this line.
Net income attributable to Macy's in the quarter was $544 million or $659 million, excluding store closing and restructuring costs. This compares to last year's $793 million or $857 million, excluding similar charges and last year's make-whole premium for the early retirement of debt.
Diluted share count was 314.8 million shares in the quarter, which is 10% lower than a year ago due to the $2 billion of stock repurchased during fiscal 2015.
Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.73 or $2.09, excluding store closings and restructuring charges. And this compares to $2.44 last year on the same basis.
Cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, in 2015 was still $892 million even in a disappointing year. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was just short of $2 billion, $725 million below last year. This is due primarily to lower net income. And net cash used from investing activities was $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than last year, but it would have been $90 million lower, excluding the Bluemercury acquisition.
As a result of the EBITDA decline, our leverage ratio increased from 2.6x last year to 3.0x this year, assuming the same 9.3x factor for rent capitalization and excluding the debt issued in the fourth quarter, which was raised to pay off 2016 maturities. This is higher than our target range of 2.5 to 2.8x. As our EBITDA returns to levels achieved in recent years, we expect to get this ratio back into the target range.
So let's move on to the future. As Terry keeps telling our team, ""a setback is a setup for a comeback"" and we are all focused on learning from 2015 to improve our results in 2016 and beyond. Our long-term goals for financial performance remain unchanged. We are still focused on achieving an annual comp sales increase of at least 2%, with an EBITDA rate of 14% and an ROIC of 22%, both of which we achieved in 2014. This will not happen all in 1 year, but we do hope that we are turning the corner as we start the new year. 
And while 2015 was disappointing, we did pilot some initiatives that are expected to help us in 2016 and beyond. I'll mention just 5 of them. One, jewelry. As you know, we tested a new approach to our fine jewelry and watch business in 2015. It involved strengthening selling skills including changes needed to talent, training and compensation, also included improved associate availability, more direct supervision and a higher quality product offering. Fine jewelry serves as a backbone to our wedding initiative. And based on the success of the pilot, we are rolling this approach out across the country. 300 of our stores will be live this fall and the balance of our stores a year later.
Number two, Last Act and Backstage. As an outgrowth of our research behind the pilot of our off-price concept, as you know, called Backstage, we decided to test a simplified pricing approach for clearance in our apparel areas in the Macy's stores. We took deeper price reductions on our second and third markdowns, but then excluded these goods from coupons and additional discounts. We also moved these goods to separate spaces on our apparel floors, generally one in the men's and one in the women's areas. Customer reaction was very positive. Sales were higher, sell-through faster and gross margin higher with very few complaints from customers about not being able to use coupons. Based on this successful test, we have already rolled this out to all of our Macy's stores. 
We also opened our 6 pilot Backstage stores this past fall. We continue to learn from these stores and plan to continue our testing in 2016. In addition to these freestanding stores, plus one more that we will be opening in 2016, we will be testing putting Backstage stores within approximately 15 Macy's locations. We believe this could be an exciting way to drive traffic to our Macy doors and to offer some price points and categories, for example, home decor, baby gear, toys, et cetera, that we don't currently carry at Macy's. 
The third initiative is our top door strategy. We began executing this fall a strategy to accelerate and drive further growth in our top 150 locations.
We are working to improve all aspects of these stores from product, to presentation, to customer service, to special events. We want to give customers more reasons to come to these stores that are located in the best malls and freestanding locations in the country.
Four is Bluemercury. Bluemercury has been part of the Macy's family for just under a year. We've opened 15 new stores in 2015 after the deal closed, including 8 in markets where we either had no or limited market share before. This brought the total number of locations to 77. We also opened our first 4 stores within Macy's. These shops bring to our Macy's customers new brands as well as new services. We are very excited about these. 
We are also including the Bluemercury team, along with Macy's and Bloomingdale's, to strategize how to maximize the company's digital offering in beauty. As you know, we are very focused on this category as one of the company's significant growth opportunities and we are happy having Bluemercury as part of our strategy.
And fifth is mobile. Mobile is a major priority for the company. Sales on mobile devices more than doubled in 2015, fueled by large increases in both traffic and also conversion. It is the fastest-growing digital channel. We think mobile first and are very focused on making both customer-facing enhancements and also improvements in functionality that will ultimately further improve the customer experience.
We believe all 5 of these initiatives that I just talked about will help performance in 2016 but are likely to have a bigger impact in 2017 and beyond. We are very focused on improving our execution in 2016, and at the same time, we are evolving our M.O.M. strategy to meet the needs of our changing customer and competitive environment. 
I will talk about what we call M.O.M. 2.0 in a few minutes, but let me first summarize our key planning assumptions for 2016.
We are assuming that our comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis will decline approximately 1% in 2016, and with the impact of the store closures, this would lead to a total sales decline of approximately 2%. It isn't though until the fourth quarter that we expect our comp owned plus licensed sales to turn positive. We believe this to be the prudent assumption, given the environment and our performance heading into the year. We view this year to be one of resetting and rebuilding. 
We are still expecting a modest increase in our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales in 2016 as we stated in our press release on January 6. This is assumed to be driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, although we don't expect the gross margin rate will get all the way back to the level achieved in 2014 all in 1 year.
Expense dollars are expected to be flattish in -- to the 2015 level, and as a result of the sales decline, the rate as a percent of sales is assumed to increase. We have implemented the previously announced restructuring, and we've taken the other actions that will reduce expense by approximately to $400 million in 2016. These actions that have been taken will enable us to offset increases in wages as well as the investments we are making to enhance our growth in the areas mentioned such as digital, top doors, Bluemercury, Backstage and China.
Included in the SG&A guidance are asset sale gains of approximately $235 million including an estimated $86 million of the gain for Brooklyn. The remainder of the Brooklyn gain is expected to be booked in 2017. The gain for Brooklyn will be booked quarterly based on the amount of construction we complete each quarter. We anticipate that about 1/4 of that expected gain of the $86 million will be booked in the first half of the year with the other remainder in the back half of the year. But please note that it could change by quarter and even by year based on the construction schedule.
We are also assuming approximately $150 million for gains from other asset sales. We are not including in our guidance, though, any impact from the potential transactions related to Herald Square, Union Square, downtown Minneapolis, downtown Chicago or if we do a more comprehensive joint venture structure for the mall stores.
Credit profitability is expected to decline slightly in 2016 from 2015, as sales decline and the profitability of our portfolio stabilizes at a historic high rate or possibly decline slightly with higher interest rates and potentially higher delinquency trends.
Retirement-related expense is assumed to decline by approximately $25 million in 2016, due primarily to a change to using the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs. 
Depreciation and amortization is assumed at approximately $1,070,000,000 based on our capital budget of $900 million for 2016.
Interest expense is assumed at approximately $365 million. 
And our assumption for the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is approximately $10 million in 2016, but know that this is hard to estimate.  
Our assumed effective tax rate is 37%. 
So with all of these assumptions, our diluted EPS guidance is $3.80 to $3.90 as compared to the $3.77 for 2015. As you model earnings per share by quarter, the first and third quarters are assumed to be, with these assumptions, below 2015 levels. As I said earlier, comp sales are expected to be below a year ago in the first 9 months of the year. Also, gross margin rate is assumed to decline in the first and third quarters, in the first because of the lingering impact of the tough fourth quarter and in the third quarter because of the strong 2015 performance.
Also, asset sale gains are expected to be lower than 2015 in these quarters, although that easily could change based on the timing of transactions. We assume that the earnings growth in the second and fourth quarters will more than offset the declines in the first and third quarters, so that as you could tell from our guidance for the full year, earnings per share would exceed 2015.
One more item to mention. In 2016, we are expecting that settlement accounting relating to our retirement plans will begin to apply. This is not included in our guidance and will be broken out as a separate line item on our P&L. This occurs in a year when lump sum payments associated with our retirement plans exceed a materiality threshold equal to the sum of the planned service costs and interest costs. As this threshold is exceeded, there is a noncash charge that recognizes a portion of the plan's deferred unrecognized losses. Recognition begins in the quarter in which the threshold is crossed and then continues for the remainder of the year. Freezing our plans has lowered this threshold materially. We are assuming that we will exceed the threshold this year due to store closings or voluntary separation program, restructurings, small -- and small, balanced force-outs, in addition to our regular distribution activity. Our current estimate is that we will have a charge in fiscal 2016 of approximately $135 million for the year with approximately $15 million booked in the first half of the year and the remaining in the back half of the year. As I said earlier, these noncash charges are not included in guidance, but I didn't want you to be surprised when you see this new line item on our P&L as we go through 2016.
We also hope that by year-end, we will have executed some real estate transactions. But as I said earlier, it is impossible to predict what will be done, when it will be done or what the financial benefit will be. And as I mentioned earlier, these transactions are not included in our guidance.
So while we are all disappointed about 2015, the team here is energized about improving the company's sales and earnings trends in 2016 as a foundation for growth in the years ahead. We are a very competitive team and no one is thrilled about how 2015 turned out even if some of the factors of downward pressure were out of our control. And as I quoted Terry earlier, we are all believing that a setback is a setup for a comeback. 
Recently, about 600 senior executives including all of the Macy's district and regional store leaders as well as the heads of technology, digital, merchandising, planning, marketing and support organizations met to hear how we have refined our business strategies going into 2016. The presentation centered on M.O.M., which continues to be our guide. We are evolving the meaning of M.O.M. to coincide with where the customer is heading. My Macy's is migrating from a focus on localization to one of personalization. Omnichannel today means providing omni choices for our customers, in-stores and digital, especially mobile. And Magic Selling is shifting focus to new techniques for building magic connections with shoppers. 
Under these redefined M.O.M. strategies, we have defined very specific initiatives for the future, each driven by a team of high-performing and creative executives. They are grouped into 5 buckets: one, acquire new customers and deepen loyalty; two, win with distinctive product; three, push the digital frontier; four, expand through new formats; and five, create signature experiences.
The response to this refreshed direction among our senior team was very enthusiastic. They can see that we are driving our company to where the puck is headed not to where it is or used to be. We are thinking ahead and are confident we can return to the profitable growth trajectory we saw in the 6 years prior to 2015 and to the 14% EBITDA rate we posted in 2014.
Our primary focus today is on growing what we might call our core Omnichannel business, and meanwhile, we are taking the early steps, testing and learning toward longer-term growth vehicles including off-price and international. We think you will continue to find that Macy's, Inc. is a company to watch and that we are evolving as we position ourselves to be the customers' first choice for fashion, value and convenience in the years and decades ahead.

So I think there's a lot of investment being made in digital growth, which, by the way, is not all digital sales. Part of that is Omnichannel investments, so the customers can easily go back and forth between stores and the Internet.

Again, more investing to grow those for the long term, which, I think, you'd expect us to do. So those will be where the biggest investments are."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
As we announced in early January, we had a disappointing November, December. Fortunately, with the cold weather in the new year, business did improve in January and we did better than expected at the time of our January announcement and earnings were stronger as a result. Comp owned plus licensed sales declined 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year. EPS on a diluted basis, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges for the quarter, was $2.09 as compared to our most recent guidance of $1.85 to $1.90. And for the full year, EPS on that same basis was $3.77, down 14% from last year.
During the fourth quarter, we launched, through our advisers, the marketing of potential partnership and joint venture transactions for our real estate, both our mall-based stores and our 4 flagship stores. The demand has been very strong, which is encouraging, but it is premature to comment further at this point. 
I will now talk about our performance in the quarter and highlight some of the bright spots in an otherwise weak quarter and year. I will then talk about our outlook for the next few years as well as provide guidance on our key planning assumptions for 2016. 
So let's start with the fourth quarter. Sales in the quarter were $8.9 billion, down 5.3% from last year. And as I said a minute ago, on a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 4.3%. Similar to the third quarter, we had approximately a 4% decline in the number of transactions, a 1% decrease in the average unit retail and units per transaction were up about 1%.
We've talked about overall weakness in our sales and particular weakness in the cold weather businesses, but we did have some categories that performed quite well in the quarter: cosmetics, fragrances, furniture and mattresses as well as active. Geographically, our business was strongest in the West where weather was less of a factor. This was true both in-store and online. 
Overall, our digital business continued on a very strong pace. Digit [ph] continues to grow rapidly for purchasing, but it is also becoming even more important for browsing and researching. Best of all, for us, is in Omnichannel retailer. Customers are increasingly going back and forth between digital devices and stores. 
We continue to make progress this year on improving our mobile technology as well as optimizing fulfillment capabilities in the stores, including utilizing our BOPS, or Buying Online - Pickup in Store, as a great way to satisfy demand. 
Unfortunately, the decline in international tourist sales did not lessen during the fourth quarter and hurt our comp performance by approximately 1 point. This was less of an impact than experienced in the third quarter, but that is because international tourism is less important for us in the holiday period.
Bloomingdale's had a more challenging quarter than Macy's, largely due to the geographic mix of locations with even heavier concentrations of tourist stores. And for Bloomingdale's, too, the digital growth was strong. 
Gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 37.4%, down 290 basis points from last year. At the start of the quarter, you will remember that we expected a lower than last year gross margin rate. However, our actual rate was worse than expected as a result of the weak holiday sales and our desire to start 2016 with the right inventory level.
We were pleased that we ended the year with our inventory up 1.6%, or on a comp basis, up 0.7%. We took the needed markdowns to make sure that we both cleared seasonal goods and priced what was left properly for February-March selling. 
For the year as a whole, the gross margin rate dropped 90 basis points versus the prior year. 
SG&A in the quarter was $2.2 billion, down 5% from last year, and as a percent of sales, SG&A was flat to last year. Included in the SG&A were asset sale gains of approximately $114 million. This compares to $36 million last year. Included in this number is $84 million associated with the Brooklyn transaction, $18 million for the sale of one of our Mission Valley stores in San Diego and approximately $12 million in other miscellaneous asset sale gains.
Credit income was $280 million in the quarter, up approximately $40 million over last year. As we transitioned to our new credit system platform in the fall of 2015, we benefited from stronger-than-expected portfolio yields. Going forward, we are closely monitoring a rise in delinquency levels that could generate some increase in losses in 2016 as I'll discuss later. 
SG&A in the quarter also benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals and our flexing of expense with the lower sales. 
So the impact of the real estate transactions, stronger-than-expected credit results and other expense reductions enabled us to more than offset the increases in other expense areas and our investments in growth.
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $270 million or $4 million higher than a year ago. 
Operating income, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges, was $1.1 billion, down 23% from last year. And as a percent of sales, operating EBIT on this basis was 12.6%, down from 15.5% last year. 
In the quarter, we booked $177 million of charges associated with store closings and restructuring. $37 million of this was for additional noncash asset impairments. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $93 million. 
Booked tax expense was $300 million or 35.6% of pretax income. On an annual basis, our effective tax rate was 36.2%, flat with last year. This is a little better than expected primarily due to state tax settlements.
The net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest, which is related to our China joint venture, was $1 million. 
Let me remind you how the accounting for China works. As you know, we own 65% of the venture, but we consolidate their financials and include 100% of the sales, margin, expense, et cetera, on -- in our statement. So on the P&L, we then break out the portion of the net income, or in this case, the loss, which Macy's does not own on this line.
Net income attributable to Macy's in the quarter was $544 million or $659 million, excluding store closing and restructuring costs. This compares to last year's $793 million or $857 million, excluding similar charges and last year's make-whole premium for the early retirement of debt.
Diluted share count was 314.8 million shares in the quarter, which is 10% lower than a year ago due to the $2 billion of stock repurchased during fiscal 2015.
Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.73 or $2.09, excluding store closings and restructuring charges. And this compares to $2.44 last year on the same basis.
Cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, in 2015 was still $892 million even in a disappointing year. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was just short of $2 billion, $725 million below last year. This is due primarily to lower net income. And net cash used from investing activities was $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than last year, but it would have been $90 million lower, excluding the Bluemercury acquisition.
As a result of the EBITDA decline, our leverage ratio increased from 2.6x last year to 3.0x this year, assuming the same 9.3x factor for rent capitalization and excluding the debt issued in the fourth quarter, which was raised to pay off 2016 maturities. This is higher than our target range of 2.5 to 2.8x. As our EBITDA returns to levels achieved in recent years, we expect to get this ratio back into the target range.
So let's move on to the future. As Terry keeps telling our team, ""a setback is a setup for a comeback"" and we are all focused on learning from 2015 to improve our results in 2016 and beyond. Our long-term goals for financial performance remain unchanged. We are still focused on achieving an annual comp sales increase of at least 2%, with an EBITDA rate of 14% and an ROIC of 22%, both of which we achieved in 2014. This will not happen all in 1 year, but we do hope that we are turning the corner as we start the New Year. 
And while 2015 was disappointing, we did pilot some initiatives that are expected to help us in 2016 and beyond. I'll mention just 5 of them. One, jewelry. As you know, we tested a new approach to our fine jewelry and watch business in 2015. It involved strengthening selling skills including changes needed to talent, training and compensation; also included improved associate availability; more direct supervision and a higher quality product offering. Fine jewelry serves as a backbone to our wedding initiative. And based on the success of the pilot, we are rolling this approach out across the country. 300 of our stores will be live this fall and the balance of our stores, a year later.
Number two, Last Act and Backstage. As an outgrowth of our research behind the pilot of our off-price concept, as you know, called Backstage, we decided to test a simplified pricing approach for clearance in our apparel areas in the Macy's stores. We took deeper price reductions on our second and third markdowns, but then excluded these goods from coupons and additional discounts. We also moved these goods to separate spaces on our apparel floors, generally one in the men's and one in the women's areas. Customer reaction was very positive. Sales were higher, sell-through faster and gross margin higher with very few complaints from customers about not being able to use coupons. Based on this successful test, we have already rolled this out to all of our Macy's stores. 
We also opened our 6 pilot Backstage stores this past fall. We continue to learn from these stores and plan to continue our testing in 2016. In addition to these freestanding stores, plus one more that we will be opening in 2016, we will be testing putting Backstage stores within approximately 15 Macy's locations. We believe this could be an exciting way to drive traffic to our Macy doors and to offer some price points and categories, for example, home decor, baby gear, toys, et cetera, that we don't currently carry at Macy's. 
The third initiative is our top door strategy. We began executing this fall a strategy to accelerate and drive further growth in our top 150 locations.
We are working to improve all aspects of these stores from product, to presentation, to customer service, to special events. We want to give customers more reasons to come to these stores that are located in the best malls and freestanding locations in the country.
Four is Bluemercury. Bluemercury has been part of the Macy's family for just under a year. We've opened 15 new stores in 2015 after the deal closed, including 8 in markets where we either had no or limited market share before. This brought the total number of locations to 77. We also opened our first 4 stores within Macy's. These shops bring to our Macy's customers new brands as well as new services. We are very excited about these. 
We are also including the Bluemercury team, along with Macy's and Bloomingdale's, to strategize how to maximize the company's digital offering in beauty. As you know, we are very focused on this category as one of the company's significant growth opportunities and we are happy having Bluemercury as part of our strategy.
And fifth is mobile. Mobile is a major priority for the company. Sales on mobile devices more than doubled in 2015, fueled by large increases in both traffic and also conversion. It is the fastest-growing digital channel. We think mobile first and are very focused on making both customer-facing enhancements and also improvements in functionality that will ultimately further improve the customer experience.
We believe all 5 of these initiatives that I just talked about will help performance in 2016 but are likely to have a bigger impact in 2017 and beyond. We are very focused on improving our execution in 2016, and at the same time, we are evolving our M.O.M. strategy to meet the needs of our changing customer and competitive environment. 
I will talk about what we call M.O.M. 2.0 in a few minutes, but let me first summarize our key planning assumptions for 2016.
We are assuming that our comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis will decline approximately 1% in 2016, and with the impact of the store closures, this would lead to a total sales decline of approximately 2%. It isn't, though, until the fourth quarter that we expect our comp owned plus licensed sales to turn positive. We believe this to be the prudent assumption, given the environment and our performance heading into the year. We view this year to be one of resetting and rebuilding. 
We are still expecting a modest increase in our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales in 2016 as we stated in our press release on January 6. This is assumed to be driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, although we don't expect the gross margin rate will get all the way back to the level achieved in 2014 all in 1 year.
Expense dollars are expected to be flattish in -- to the 2015 level, and as a result of the sales decline, the rate as a percent of sales is assumed to increase. We have implemented the previously announced restructuring, and we've taken the other actions that will reduce expense by approximately the $400 million in 2016. These actions that have been taken will enable us to offset increases in wages as well as the investments we are making to enhance our growth in the areas mentioned such as digital, top doors, Bluemercury, Backstage and China.
Included in the SG&A guidance are asset sale gains of approximately $235 million including an estimated $86 million of the gain for Brooklyn. The remainder of the Brooklyn gain is expected to be booked in 2017. The gain for Brooklyn will be booked quarterly based on the amount of construction we complete each quarter. We anticipate that about 1/4 of that expected gain of the $86 million will be booked in the first half of the year with the other -- remainder in the back half of the year. But please note that it could change by quarter and even by year based on that construction schedule.
We are also assuming approximately $150 million for gains from other asset sales. We are not including in our guidance, though, any impact from the potential transactions related to Herald Square, Union Square, downtown Minneapolis, downtown Chicago or if we do a more comprehensive joint venture structure for the mall stores.
Credit profitability is expected to decline slightly in 2016 from 2015, as sales decline and the profitability of our portfolio stabilizes at a historic high rate or possibly decline slightly with higher interest rates and potentially higher delinquency trends.
Retirement-related expense is assumed to decline by approximately $25 million in 2016, due primarily to a change to using the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs. 
Depreciation and amortization is assumed at approximately $1,070,000,000 based on our capital budget of $900 million for 2016.
Interest expense is assumed at approximately $365 million. And our assumption for the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is approximately $10 million in 2016, but know that this is hard to estimate. 
Our assumed effective tax rate is 37%. 
So with all of these assumptions, our diluted EPS guidance is $3.80 to $3.90 as compared to the $3.77 for 2015. As you model earnings per share by quarter, the first and third quarters are assumed to be, with these assumptions, below 2015 levels. As I said earlier, comp sales are expected to be below a year ago in the first 9 months of the year. Also, gross margin rate is assumed to decline in the first and third quarters, in the first because of the lingering impact of the tough fourth quarter and in the third quarter because of the strong 2015 performance.
Also, asset sale gains are expected to be lower than 2015 in these quarters, although that easily could change based on the timing of transactions. We assume that the earnings growth in the second and fourth quarters will more than offset the declines in the first and third quarters, so that as you could tell from our guidance for the full year, earnings per share would exceed 2015.
One more item to mention. In 2016, we are expecting that settlement accounting relating to our retirement plans will begin to apply. This is not included in our guidance and will be broken out as a separate line item on our P&L. This occurs in a year when lump sum payments associated with our retirement plans exceed a materiality threshold equal to the sum of the planned service costs and interest costs. If this threshold is exceeded, there is a noncash charge that recognizes a portion of the plan's deferred unrecognized losses. Recognition begins in the quarter in which the threshold is crossed and then continues for the remainder of the year. 
Freezing our plans has lowered this threshold materially. We are assuming that we will exceed the threshold this year due to store closings, our voluntary separation program, restructurings, small -- and small, balanced force-outs, in addition to our regular distribution activity. Our current estimate is that we will have a charge in fiscal 2016 of approximately $135 million for the year with approximately $15 million booked in the first half of the year and the remaining in the back half of the year. As I said earlier, these noncash charges are not included in guidance, but I didn't want you to be surprised when you see this new line item on our P&L as we go through 2016.
We also hope that by year-end, we will have executed some real estate transactions. But as I said earlier, it is impossible to predict what will be done, when it will be done or what the financial benefit will be. And as I mentioned earlier, these transactions are not included in our guidance.
So while we are all disappointed about 2015, the team here is energized about improving the company's sales and earnings trends in 2016 as a foundation for growth in the years ahead. We are a very competitive team and no one is thrilled about how 2015 turned out even if some of the factors of downward pressure were out of our control. And as I quoted Terry earlier, we're all believing that a setback is a setup for a comeback. 
Recently, about 600 senior executives including all of the Macy's district and regional store leaders as well as the heads of technology, digital, merchandising, planning, marketing and support organizations met to hear how we have refined our business strategies going into 2016. The presentation centered on M.O.M., which continues to be our guide. We are evolving the meaning of M.O.M. to coincide with where the customer is heading. My Macy's is migrating from a focus on localization to one of personalization. Omnichannel today means providing omni choices for our customers, in stores and digital, especially mobile. And Magic Selling is shifting focus to new techniques for building magic connections with shoppers. 
Under these redefined M.O.M. strategies, we have defined very specific initiatives for the future, each driven by a team of high-performing and creative executives. They are grouped into 5 buckets: one, acquire new customers and deepen loyalty; two, win with distinctive product; three, push the digital frontier; four, expand through new formats and five, create signature experiences.
The response to this refreshed direction among our senior team was very enthusiastic. They can see that we are driving our company to where the puck is headed not to where it is or used to be. We are thinking ahead and are confident we can return to the profitable growth trajectory we saw in the 6 years prior to 2015 and to the 14% EBITDA rate we posted in 2014.
Our primary focus today is on growing what we might call our core Omnichannel business, and meanwhile, we are taking the early steps, testing and learning toward longer-term growth vehicles including off-price and international. We think you will continue to find that Macy's, Inc. is a company to watch and that we are evolving as we position ourselves to be the customers' first choice for fashion, value and convenience in the years and decades ahead. 
Thanks for your interest, and now I'll take your questions."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
As we announced in early January, we had a disappointing November, December. Fortunately, with the cold weather in the new year, business did improve in January and we did better than expected at the time of our January announcement and earnings were stronger as a result. Comp owned plus licensed sales declined 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the full year. EPS on a diluted basis, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges for the quarter, was $2.09 as compared to our most recent guidance of $1.85 to $1.90. And for the full year, EPS on that same basis was $3.77, down 14% from last year.
During the fourth quarter, we launched, through our advisers, the marketing of potential partnership and joint venture transactions for our real estate, both our mall-based stores and our 4 flagship stores. The demand has been very strong, which is encouraging, but it is premature to comment further at this point. 
I will now talk about our performance in the quarter and highlight some of the bright spots in an otherwise weak quarter and year. I will then talk about our outlook for the next few years as well as provide guidance on our key planning assumptions for 2016. 
So let's start with the fourth quarter. Sales in the quarter were $8.9 billion, down 5.3% from last year. And as I said a minute ago, on a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 4.3%. Similar to the third quarter, we had approximately a 4% decline in the number of transactions, a 1% decrease in the average unit retail and units per transaction were up about 1%.
We've talked about overall weakness in our sales and particular weakness in the cold weather businesses, but we did have some categories that performed quite well in the quarter: cosmetics, fragrances, furniture and mattresses as well as active. Geographically, our business was strongest in the West where weather was less of a factor. This was true both in-store and online. 
Overall, our digital business continued on a very strong pace. Digit [ph] continues to grow rapidly for purchasing, but it is also becoming even more important for browsing and researching. Best of all, for us, is in Omnichannel retailer. Customers are increasingly going back and forth between digital devices and stores. 
We continue to make progress this year on improving our mobile technology as well as optimizing fulfillment capabilities in the stores, including utilizing our BOPS, or Buying Online - Pickup in Store, as a great way to satisfy demand. 
Unfortunately, the decline in international tourist sales did not lessen during the fourth quarter and hurt our comp performance by approximately 1 point. This was less of an impact than experienced in the third quarter, but that is because international tourism is less important for us in the holiday period.
Bloomingdale's had a more challenging quarter than Macy's, largely due to the geographic mix of locations with even heavier concentrations of tourist stores. And for Bloomingdale's, too, the digital growth was strong. 
Gross margin rate in the fourth quarter was 37.4%, down 290 basis points from last year. At the start of the quarter, you will remember that we expected a lower than last year gross margin rate. However, our actual rate was worse than expected as a result of the weak holiday sales and our desire to start 2016 with the right inventory level.
We were pleased that we ended the year with our inventory up 1.6%, or on a comp basis, up 0.7%. We took the needed markdowns to make sure that we both cleared seasonal goods and priced what was left properly for February-March selling. 
For the year as a whole, the gross margin rate dropped 90 basis points versus the prior year. 
SG&A in the quarter was $2.2 billion, down 5% from last year, and as a percent of sales, SG&A was flat to last year. Included in the SG&A were asset sale gains of approximately $114 million. This compares to $36 million last year. Included in this number is $84 million associated with the Brooklyn transaction, $18 million for the sale of one of our Mission Valley stores in San Diego and approximately $12 million in other miscellaneous asset sale gains.
Credit income was $280 million in the quarter, up approximately $40 million over last year. As we transitioned to our new credit system platform in the fall of 2015, we benefited from stronger-than-expected portfolio yields. Going forward, we are closely monitoring a rise in delinquency levels that could generate some increase in losses in 2016 as I'll discuss later. 
SG&A in the quarter also benefited from lower incentive compensation accruals and our flexing of expense with the lower sales. 
So the impact of the real estate transactions, stronger-than-expected credit results and other expense reductions enabled us to more than offset the increases in other expense areas and our investments in growth.
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $270 million or $4 million higher than a year ago. 
Operating income, excluding store closing and restructuring-related charges, was $1.1 billion, down 23% from last year. And as a percent of sales, operating EBIT on this basis was 12.6%, down from 15.5% last year. 
In the quarter, we booked $177 million of charges associated with store closings and restructuring. $37 million of this was for additional noncash asset impairments. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $93 million. 
Booked tax expense was $300 million or 35.6% of pretax income. On an annual basis, our effective tax rate was 36.2%, flat with last year. This is a little better than expected primarily due to state tax settlements.
The net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest, which is related to our China joint venture, was $1 million. 
Let me remind you how the accounting for China works. As you know, we own 65% of the venture, but we consolidate their financials and include 100% of the sales, margin, expense, et cetera, on -- in our statement. So on the P&L, we then break out the portion of the net income, or in this case, the loss, which Macy's does not own on this line.
Net income attributable to Macy's in the quarter was $544 million or $659 million, excluding store closing and restructuring costs. This compares to last year's $793 million or $857 million, excluding similar charges and last year's make-whole premium for the early retirement of debt.
Diluted share count was 314.8 million shares in the quarter, which is 10% lower than a year ago due to the $2 billion of stock repurchased during fiscal 2015.
Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.73 or $2.09, excluding store closings and restructuring charges. And this compares to $2.44 last year on the same basis.
Cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, in 2015 was still $892 million even in a disappointing year. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was just short of $2 billion, $725 million below last year. This is due primarily to lower net income. And net cash used from investing activities was $1.1 billion, $122 million higher than last year, but it would have been $90 million lower, excluding the Bluemercury acquisition.
As a result of the EBITDA decline, our leverage ratio increased from 2.6x last year to 3.0x this year, assuming the same 9.3x factor for rent capitalization and excluding the debt issued in the fourth quarter, which was raised to pay off 2016 maturities. This is higher than our target range of 2.5 to 2.8x. As our EBITDA returns to levels achieved in recent years, we expect to get this ratio back into the target range.
So let's move on to the future. As Terry keeps telling our team, ""a setback is a setup for a comeback"" and we are all focused on learning from 2015 to improve our results in 2016 and beyond. Our long-term goals for financial performance remain unchanged. We are still focused on achieving an annual comp sales increase of at least 2%, with an EBITDA rate of 14% and an ROIC of 22%, both of which we achieved in 2014. This will not happen all in 1 year, but we do hope that we are turning the corner as we start the New Year. 
And while 2015 was disappointing, we did pilot some initiatives that are expected to help us in 2016 and beyond. I'll mention just 5 of them. One, jewelry. As you know, we tested a new approach to our fine jewelry and watch business in 2015. It involved strengthening selling skills including changes needed to talent, training and compensation; also included improved associate availability; more direct supervision and a higher quality product offering. Fine jewelry serves as a backbone to our wedding initiative. And based on the success of the pilot, we are rolling this approach out across the country. 300 of our stores will be live this fall and the balance of our stores, a year later.
Number two, Last Act and Backstage. As an outgrowth of our research behind the pilot of our off-price concept, as you know, called Backstage, we decided to test a simplified pricing approach for clearance in our apparel areas in the Macy's stores. We took deeper price reductions on our second and third markdowns, but then excluded these goods from coupons and additional discounts. We also moved these goods to separate spaces on our apparel floors, generally one in the men's and one in the women's areas. Customer reaction was very positive. Sales were higher, sell-through faster and gross margin higher with very few complaints from customers about not being able to use coupons. Based on this successful test, we have already rolled this out to all of our Macy's stores. 
We also opened our 6 pilot Backstage stores this past fall. We continue to learn from these stores and plan to continue our testing in 2016. In addition to these freestanding stores, plus one more that we will be opening in 2016, we will be testing putting Backstage stores within approximately 15 Macy's locations. We believe this could be an exciting way to drive traffic to our Macy doors and to offer some price points and categories, for example, home decor, baby gear, toys, et cetera, that we don't currently carry at Macy's. 
The third initiative is our top door strategy. We began executing this fall a strategy to accelerate and drive further growth in our top 150 locations.
We are working to improve all aspects of these stores from product, to presentation, to customer service, to special events. We want to give customers more reasons to come to these stores that are located in the best malls and freestanding locations in the country.
Four is Bluemercury. Bluemercury has been part of the Macy's family for just under a year. We've opened 15 new stores in 2015 after the deal closed, including 8 in markets where we either had no or limited market share before. This brought the total number of locations to 77. We also opened our first 4 stores within Macy's. These shops bring to our Macy's customers new brands as well as new services. We are very excited about these. 
We are also including the Bluemercury team, along with Macy's and Bloomingdale's, to strategize how to maximize the company's digital offering in beauty. As you know, we are very focused on this category as one of the company's significant growth opportunities and we are happy having Bluemercury as part of our strategy.
And fifth is mobile. Mobile is a major priority for the company. Sales on mobile devices more than doubled in 2015, fueled by large increases in both traffic and also conversion. It is the fastest-growing digital channel. We think mobile first and are very focused on making both customer-facing enhancements and also improvements in functionality that will ultimately further improve the customer experience.
We believe all 5 of these initiatives that I just talked about will help performance in 2016 but are likely to have a bigger impact in 2017 and beyond. We are very focused on improving our execution in 2016, and at the same time, we are evolving our M.O.M. strategy to meet the needs of our changing customer and competitive environment. 
I will talk about what we call M.O.M. 2.0 in a few minutes, but let me first summarize our key planning assumptions for 2016.
We are assuming that our comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis will decline approximately 1% in 2016, and with the impact of the store closures, this would lead to a total sales decline of approximately 2%. It isn't, though, until the fourth quarter that we expect our comp owned plus licensed sales to turn positive. We believe this to be the prudent assumption, given the environment and our performance heading into the year. We view this year to be one of resetting and rebuilding. 
We are still expecting a modest increase in our EBITDA rate as a percent of sales in 2016 as we stated in our press release on January 6. This is assumed to be driven by an increase in our gross margin rate, although we don't expect the gross margin rate will get all the way back to the level achieved in 2014 all in 1 year.
Expense dollars are expected to be flattish in -- to the 2015 level, and as a result of the sales decline, the rate as a percent of sales is assumed to increase. We have implemented the previously announced restructuring, and we've taken the other actions that will reduce expense by approximately the $400 million in 2016. These actions that have been taken will enable us to offset increases in wages as well as the investments we are making to enhance our growth in the areas mentioned such as digital, top doors, Bluemercury, Backstage and China.
Included in the SG&A guidance are asset sale gains of approximately $235 million including an estimated $86 million of the gain for Brooklyn. The remainder of the Brooklyn gain is expected to be booked in 2017. The gain for Brooklyn will be booked quarterly based on the amount of construction we complete each quarter. We anticipate that about 1/4 of that expected gain of the $86 million will be booked in the first half of the year with the other -- remainder in the back half of the year. But please note that it could change by quarter and even by year based on that construction schedule.
We are also assuming approximately $150 million for gains from other asset sales. We are not including in our guidance, though, any impact from the potential transactions related to Herald Square, Union Square, downtown Minneapolis, downtown Chicago or if we do a more comprehensive joint venture structure for the mall stores.
Credit profitability is expected to decline slightly in 2016 from 2015, as sales decline and the profitability of our portfolio stabilizes at a historic high rate or possibly decline slightly with higher interest rates and potentially higher delinquency trends.
Retirement-related expense is assumed to decline by approximately $25 million in 2016, due primarily to a change to using the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs. 
Depreciation and amortization is assumed at approximately $1,070,000,000 based on our capital budget of $900 million for 2016.
Interest expense is assumed at approximately $365 million. And our assumption for the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest is approximately $10 million in 2016, but know that this is hard to estimate. 
Our assumed effective tax rate is 37%. 
So with all of these assumptions, our diluted EPS guidance is $3.80 to $3.90 as compared to the $3.77 for 2015. As you model earnings per share by quarter, the first and third quarters are assumed to be, with these assumptions, below 2015 levels. As I said earlier, comp sales are expected to be below a year ago in the first 9 months of the year. Also, gross margin rate is assumed to decline in the first and third quarters, in the first because of the lingering impact of the tough fourth quarter and in the third quarter because of the strong 2015 performance.
Also, asset sale gains are expected to be lower than 2015 in these quarters, although that easily could change based on the timing of transactions. We assume that the earnings growth in the second and fourth quarters will more than offset the declines in the first and third quarters, so that as you could tell from our guidance for the full year, earnings per share would exceed 2015.
One more item to mention. In 2016, we are expecting that settlement accounting relating to our retirement plans will begin to apply. This is not included in our guidance and will be broken out as a separate line item on our P&L. This occurs in a year when lump sum payments associated with our retirement plans exceed a materiality threshold equal to the sum of the planned service costs and interest costs. If this threshold is exceeded, there is a noncash charge that recognizes a portion of the plan's deferred unrecognized losses. Recognition begins in the quarter in which the threshold is crossed and then continues for the remainder of the year. 
Freezing our plans has lowered this threshold materially. We are assuming that we will exceed the threshold this year due to store closings, our voluntary separation program, restructurings, small -- and small, balanced force-outs, in addition to our regular distribution activity. Our current estimate is that we will have a charge in fiscal 2016 of approximately $135 million for the year with approximately $15 million booked in the first half of the year and the remaining in the back half of the year. As I said earlier, these noncash charges are not included in guidance, but I didn't want you to be surprised when you see this new line item on our P&L as we go through 2016.
We also hope that by year-end, we will have executed some real estate transactions. But as I said earlier, it is impossible to predict what will be done, when it will be done or what the financial benefit will be. And as I mentioned earlier, these transactions are not included in our guidance.
So while we are all disappointed about 2015, the team here is energized about improving the company's sales and earnings trends in 2016 as a foundation for growth in the years ahead. We are a very competitive team and no one is thrilled about how 2015 turned out even if some of the factors of downward pressure were out of our control. And as I quoted Terry earlier, we're all believing that a setback is a setup for a comeback. 
Recently, about 600 senior executives including all of the Macy's district and regional store leaders as well as the heads of technology, digital, merchandising, planning, marketing and support organizations met to hear how we have refined our business strategies going into 2016. The presentation centered on M.O.M., which continues to be our guide. We are evolving the meaning of M.O.M. to coincide with where the customer is heading. My Macy's is migrating from a focus on localization to one of personalization. Omnichannel today means providing omni choices for our customers, in stores and digital, especially mobile. And Magic Selling is shifting focus to new techniques for building magic connections with shoppers. 
Under these redefined M.O.M. strategies, we have defined very specific initiatives for the future, each driven by a team of high-performing and creative executives. They are grouped into 5 buckets: one, acquire new customers and deepen loyalty; two, win with distinctive product; three, push the digital frontier; four, expand through new formats and five, create signature experiences.
The response to this refreshed direction among our senior team was very enthusiastic. They can see that we are driving our company to where the puck is headed not to where it is or used to be. We are thinking ahead and are confident we can return to the profitable growth trajectory we saw in the 6 years prior to 2015 and to the 14% EBITDA rate we posted in 2014.
Our primary focus today is on growing what we might call our core Omnichannel business, and meanwhile, we are taking the early steps, testing and learning toward longer-term growth vehicles including off-price and international. We think you will continue to find that Macy's, Inc. is a company to watch and that we are evolving as we position ourselves to be the customers' first choice for fashion, value and convenience in the years and decades ahead.

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
Sales in the first quarter were $5,771,000,000 or 7.4% below last year due both to the stores that we've closed in 2015 and the decline in comp sales. While we had planned comps sales to be below last year in the first quarter, our 5.6% decline on an owned-plus-licensed basis was worse than expected. On a 2-year basis, the comp sales were down 2.9% per year.
While the quarter started stronger, the business weakened considerably versus our expectations beginning in mid-March, and that trend continued through April. 
As Terry said in our press release, we are seeing weakness in consumer spending levels in apparel and related categories. The number of transactions declined 7% in the quarter, which is far worse than what was experienced last year. This is a proxy, as you know, for traffic. AUR, average unit retail, was up slightly, and units per transaction was up approximately 1%. 
Additionally, we continue to be negatively impacted by reduced spending by international tourists.
Sales on international tourist credit cards were down 20% in the quarter on top of a 21% drop last year in the first quarter. This reduction in spending impacted our comp by a little less than a point versus last year. This was disappointing and had a disproportionately negative impact on our Center Core businesses, given what these visitors buy. 
Given that our stores are concentrated in major tourist markets, this is a big factor for us, and we are no longer confident that it will improve anytime soon. While we are focusing on increasing our share of the domestic tourist business, we don't think we can offset all of the loss on the international side. 
There were some businesses in the quarter that performed relatively well: fine jewelry, dresses, active, fragrances, coats, men's tailored clothing, housewares and furniture. However, the significant weakness in other parts of our assortments more than offset these good news stories. The softer businesses included handbags, fashion watches, women's shoes, kids, men's furnishings and luggage.
Regionally, we continue to see weakness in our major tourist markets, which, as mentioned before, are many of our largest markets. Our performance in Texas was also disappointing. We achieved our strongest performances in markets across the country that are less dependent on international tourism but are also smaller such as North Carolina; Southern Virginia; Columbus, Ohio; Oregon; and New England. 
Digital sales continued strong, still growing double digits, but it, too, grew less rapidly than anticipated. 
Bloomingdale’s trends were also weak due to the same trends impacting Macy's. 
One major success in the quarter was the rollout of Last Act, our centralized clearance areas for most of women's and men's apparel within the Macy's stores. Merchandise in these parts of our stores are marked with a clearance price, and they are not eligible for additional discounts nor coupons.
Sales of these goods were up high single digits, driven entirely by the higher average unit retail. 
Backstage, our off-price concept, also had a good quarter. We are particularly pleased with how our first 2 Backstage in-stores opened, one in Nanuet, New York and the other in Waterbury, Connecticut. We are hoping these stores bring in new customers as well as add share of wallet of existing customers.
So far, both objectives are being reached, but it is premature to climb success. We just opened 4 more, and we expect to open approximately 9 more this year. If this strategy works, we could roll it out to approximately 250 to 300 of our Macy's stores. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 39.1%, up 10 basis points from last year's level. We ended the quarter with comp inventory down 0.8%. Total inventory was down 3.2% due both to the comp drop as well as the closed stores.
While we are satisfied with our overall inventory level, the slowness in selling of warm weather goods will put pressure on our gross margin rate in the second quarter. 
SG&A in the first quarter, excluding the retirement plan related settlement charges, was $1.966 billion, down $57 million or 2.8% below last year. In the quarter, we benefited from the restructuring completed at year-end. The expense flexed on the lower sales and lower retirement expense, offset in part by Omnichannel-related expense as well as the expense additions associated with Bluemercury, Backstage and China. 
Credit income was $182 million in the quarter, $3 million above last year. While our proprietary credit card penetration of 45.9% was 100 basis points above last year, credit sales were below last year due to the overall sales trend. We still expect credit income to be slightly below last year on an annual basis, primarily as a result of the sales decline. 
Exit sales gains in the quarter were $14 million, $4 million associated with Brooklyn and $10 million for other asset sales. This compares to $20 million in the first quarter last year.
During the fourth quarter conference call a few months ago, we explained that we would have noncash charges for settlement accounting related to our retirement plans going forward. We expected these charges to be triggered because of the increase in lump sum distributions associated with our store closings, voluntary separation program and organizational restructuring. This charge was $13 million in the quarter, and we are still assuming approximately $135 million for the full year. These charges, as you saw, are broken out separately on the P&L and are not included in our guidance. 
Operating income, excluding these settlement charges, was $289 million, down from last year's $409 million. As a percent of sales, operating income on this basis was 5% as compared to 6.6% last year.
Interest expense was $98 million. Tax expense was $63 million with an effective rate of 35.4%, down from last year's 38.5%, due to the timing of some tax settlements. We still expect the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. 
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1 million versus none last year.
Net income attributable to Macy's, excluding the settlement charges, was $125 million as compared to $193 million a year ago. 
Average share count on a diluted basis was 313.5 million shares, down 9.5% from last year's 346.5 million shares.
EPS on a diluted basis, excluding the settlement charges, was $0.40 as compared to $0.56 a share last year. 
In the quarter, cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, was a use of $203 million this year versus a use of $328 million last year. The major variances were last year's Bluemercury acquisition, offset by lower net income, and [indiscernible] coming from previously escrowed funds from asset sales this year.
During the quarter, we bought back $129 million of stock, or 3 million shares, under our repurchase program versus $385 million last year. 
As you saw in our press release, we are focusing our efforts in 3 areas to improve our performance this year: one, speed up and scale up things that are working. This includes initiatives such as our jewelry pilot; Backstage in-store; beauty, including Bluemercury expansion; active; and Last Act.
Two, we will excite customers with greater newness and more exclusive merchandise. You saw some examples of this in our press release, of exciting new collaborations and brands being introduced at Macy's. 
We also have a renewed focus on products that can only be found at Macy's and at Bloomingdale’s, including our private brands, exclusive brands and exclusive products from the major brands.
And third, we are digging deeper to find expense reduction opportunities to free up money to invest in improving customer service, both in-store and online. Technology will obviously play a major role here. 
While we hope to see some improvement in our sales trends during the second quarter, most of these actions are expected to have a bigger impact in the fall and particularly in the fourth quarter.
With the evolving role of our stores, understanding opportunities with our real estate has become increasingly important. Douglas Sesler, our new Executive Vice President of Real Estate, has jumped right in and is learning fast. He is continuing the work in progress to explore potential opportunities for creating value through joint ventures or other partnerships for our mall-based properties as well as our flagship properties. This is very complex, but I can say that the interest is very strong, and I believe we will have some good options. But it will take time to evaluate. At the same time, he and our real estate team are seeking to monetize unproductive real estate. 
While we are excited about our business-driving initiatives, we have lowered our expectations for the year, particularly the second quarter. For the year as a whole, we are now expecting comp owned plus licensed sales to be down 3% to down 4%. The upper end of this guidance, the down 3%, implies a similar trend for the remaining 9 months of the year to the first quarter trend on a 2-year basis, the down 2.9% per year.
As stated earlier, most of our new initiatives will not have a meaningful impact until the back half of the year. As a result, we don't expect comp sales in the second quarter to be significantly better than that in the first quarter. 
Also, as you know, the year-over-year comparisons get easier in the third and fourth quarters, given the weakness last year. We also are hoping for a more normal winter. 
We are now assuming that our gross margin rate for the full year will be approximately flat to last year. And as mentioned earlier, we are working hard to reduce expense dollars, given the lower sales outlook, while trying very hard to minimize any impact to our customers.
Expense dollars are now assumed to be below last year for the full year, but the rate as a percent of sales will still be higher. 
We are no longer expecting to be able to increase our EBITDA as a percent of sales this year, but we still believe that we will return to our 14% target, which we achieved just 2 years ago in 2014.
Our EPS guidance for the year is now $3.15 to $3.40 per share, excluding settlement charges. 
All of us have been reading a stream of negative news stories about various retailers over the past several weeks. Clearly, our industry is in something of a rough patch. We know we are not alone. But the consumer seems to be doing okay. Employment is steady, and wages continue to rise. The consumer savings rate remains high, and most macroeconomic indicators are better than flat. So it's reasonable to conclude that the consumer will return to more aggressive discretionary spending at some point, hopefully, sooner than later.
As we described today, we at Macy's Inc. are taking tangible action now to mitigate the current headwinds and drive profitable sales. And as the overall tide rises, we believe we will be very well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities. 
We have always said that a down period in our industry is a great time for us to pursue gains and long-term market share. We are not counting on consumers to spend more this year, but we are working hard to give them reasons to shop more with us. 
As Terry has said, a setback is a setup for a comeback. That is how we are looking at the business even if our comeback is taking longer than expected to take root. We have a lot of newness in our pipeline. Not everything will work, of course, but we think that our proposition for the customer will be fresh and compelling in 2016, especially as we head into the all-important fourth quarter. And we are absolutely not pulling back our commitment to digital and Omnichannel retailing. Mobile remains a very high priority, and we continue to invest. 
You may have seen that a leading trade publication last month ranked Macy's, Inc. as the sixth largest online retailer in America. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to see double-digit year-over-year sales increases in online sales. 
While we have already somewhat downsized our fleet of stores, we continue to see value and opportunity in physical locations that sync with desktops, websites, apps and mobile in giving customers choices and meeting demand in new and different ways.
We would all prefer to be talking about sales and earnings increases today. We have confidence in our management team and organization to lead us in the direction of a recovery. And we are thankful for the heritage of innovation and the strength of outstanding brands on which we will continue to build.
So now it's time for questions. Can we have the first question?"

So we really don't have to do anything to change that piece of it. And the replenishment is not just what we would call basics. There is some fashion on replenishment as well. So that adjusts with sales trends automatically. But that's in part why relooked at the fall plan when we did. We're hopeful that what we've seen in the last -- end of the quarter is unusual and the trends will improve. But we thought we should not take the risk of waiting so that we could make a meaningful adjustment to our inventory and receipt plans as well as expense for the back half of the year. Your second question on how do you plan after a winter like last year. That's one of the interesting questions we've all been debating. We are actually planning it to be -- sorry, cold-weather merchandise to be relatively flat with last year. But if there is, what we would call, a normal winter, that would give us upside opportunity. Now 2014 was an unusually cold winter, so we're sort of looking at half of the difference between '14 as being what we think is reasonable, and that's over $100 million in additional cold-weather merchandise sales. So that would be helpful to the bottom -- to the top line."

We've done that before, and usually, the first couple of weeks of a quarter don't necessarily predict it. Had I done that in February, the first quarter would have been very different. So for now, we're assuming that what we saw in the first quarter could continue on a 2-year basis. Again, we hope we're wrong, and we hope there's improvement and there was something fluky in the last 6 weeks of the quarter. But I don't know enough to say that. And I don't know about going back to '08. I'll do that and look more into it. I'm not sure. When you look at the economic trends, you would say that's not the case, but I'm not sure."

Savings rates are high, which tells you that either they're purposefully saving more or that there's some of that savings that can be used for discretionary spending if they get motivated to do so. Some of it is spending in different categories: health, restaurants, travel. I'm not sure, but I would say we, too, are somewhat puzzled by the data that we're seeing on the consumer and the track that we're seeing in the stores and on the site. So I think we will watch.

And I think these exclusive products, whether it be from a major brand or our own private brand, will be helpful to making that happen."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
Sales in the first quarter were $5,771,000,000 or 7.4% below last year due both to the stores that we've closed in 2015 and the decline in comp sales. While we had planned comps sales to be below last year in the first quarter, our 5.6% decline on an owned plus licensed basis was worse than expected. On a 2-year basis, the comp sales were down 2.9% per year.
While the quarter started stronger, the business weakened considerably versus our expectations beginning in mid-March, and that trend continued through April. 
As Terry said in our press release, we are seeing weakness in consumer spending levels in apparel and related categories. The number of transactions declined 7% in the quarter, which is far worse than what was experienced last year. This is the proxy, as you know, for traffic. AUR, average unit retail, was up slightly, and units per transaction was up approximately 1%. 
Additionally, we continue to be negatively impacted by reduced spending by international tourists. Sales on international tourist credit cards were down 20% in the quarter on top of a 21% drop last year in the first quarter. This reduction in spending impacted our comp by a little less than a point versus last year. This was disappointing and had a disproportionately negative impact on our Center Core businesses, given what these visitors buy. 
Given that our stores are concentrated in major tourist markets, this is a big factor for us, and we are no longer confident that it will improve anytime soon. While we are focusing on increasing our share of the domestic tourist business, we don't think we can offset all of the loss on the international side. 
There were some businesses in the quarter that performed relatively well: fine jewelry, dresses, active, fragrances, coats, men's tailored clothing, housewares and furniture. However, the significant weakness in other parts of our assortments more than offset these good news stories. The softer businesses included handbags, fashion watches, women's shoes, kids, men's furnishings and luggage.
Regionally, we continued to see weakness in our major tourist markets, which, as mentioned before, are many of our largest markets. Our performance in Texas was also disappointing. We achieved our strongest performances in markets across the country that are less dependent on international tourism but are also smaller such as North Carolina; Southern Virginia; Columbus, Ohio; Oregon; and New England. 
Digital sales continued strong, still growing double digits, but it, too, grew less rapidly than anticipated. 
Bloomingdale’s trends were also weak due to the same trends impacting Macy's. 
One major success in the quarter was the rollout of Last Act, our centralized clearance areas for most of women's and men's apparel within the Macy's stores. Merchandise in these parts of our stores are marked with a clearance price, and they are not eligible for additional discounts nor coupons.
Sales of these goods were up high single digits, driven entirely by the higher average unit retail. 
Backstage, our off-price concept, also had a good quarter. We are particularly pleased with how our first 2 Backstage in-stores opened, one in Nanuet, New York and the other in Waterbury, Connecticut. We are hoping these stores bring in new customers as well as add share of wallet of existing customers.
So far, both objectives are being reached, but it is premature to climb success. We just opened 4 more, and we expect to open approximately 9 more this year. If this strategy works, we could roll it out to approximately 250 to 300 of our Macy's stores. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 39.1%, up 10 basis points from last year's level. We ended the quarter with comp inventory down 0.8%. Total inventory was down 3.2% due both to the comp drop as well as the closed stores. While we are satisfied with our overall inventory level, the slowness in selling of warm weather goods will put pressure on our gross margin rate in the second quarter. 
SG&A in the first quarter, excluding the retirement plan related settlement charges, was $1.966 billion, down $57 million or 2.8% below last year. In the quarter, we benefited from the restructuring completed at year-end. The expense flexed on the lower sales and lower retirement expense, offset in part by Omnichannel-related expense as well as the expense additions associated with Bluemercury, Backstage and China. 
Credit income was $182 million in the quarter, $3 million above last year. While our proprietary credit card penetration of 45.9% was 100 basis points above last year, credit sales were below last year due to the overall sales trend. We still expect credit income to be slightly below last year on an annual basis, primarily as a result of the sales decline. 
Asset sales gains in the quarter were $14 million, $4 million associated with Brooklyn and $10 million for other asset sales. This compares to $20 million in the first quarter last year.
During the fourth quarter conference call a few months ago, we explained that we would have noncash charges for settlement accounting related to our retirement plans going forward. We expected these charges to be triggered because of the increase in lump sum distributions associated with our store closings, voluntary separation program and organizational restructuring. This charge was $13 million in the quarter, and we are still assuming approximately $135 million for the full year. These charges, as you saw, were broken out separately on the P&L and are not included in our guidance.
Operating income, excluding these settlement charges, was $289 million, down from last year's $409 million. As a percent of sales, operating income on this basis was 5% as compared to 6.6% last year.
Interest expense was $98 million. Tax expense was $63 million with an effective rate of 35.4%, down from last year's 38.5%, due to the timing of some tax settlements. We still expect the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. 
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1 million versus none last year.
Net income attributable to Macy's, excluding the settlement charges, was $125 million as compared to $193 million a year ago. 
Average share count on a diluted basis was 313.5 million shares, down 9.5% from last year's 346.5 million shares.
EPS on a diluted basis, excluding the settlement charges, was $0.40 as compared to $0.56 a share last year. 
In the quarter, cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, was a use of $203 million this year versus a use of $328 million last year. The major variances were last year's Bluemercury acquisition, offset by lower net income, and less cash coming from previously escrowed funds from asset sales this year.
During the quarter, we bought back $129 million of stock or 3 million shares under our repurchase program versus $385 million last year. 
As you saw in our press release, we are focusing our efforts in 3 areas to improve our performance this year: one, speed up and scale up things that are working. This includes initiatives such as our jewelry pilot; Backstage in-store; beauty, including Bluemercury expansion; active; and Last Act. Two, we will excite customers with greater newness and more exclusive merchandise. You saw some examples of this in our press release, of exciting new collaborations and brands being introduced at Macy's. We also have a renewed focus on product that can only be found at Macy's and at Bloomingdale’s, including our private brands, exclusive brands and exclusive product from the major brands. And third, we are digging deeper to find expense reduction opportunities to free up money to invest in improving customer service, both in-store and online. Technology will obviously play a major role here. 
While we hope to see some improvement in our sales trends during the second quarter, most of these actions are expected to have a bigger impact in the fall and particularly in the fourth quarter.
With the evolving role of our stores, understanding opportunities with our real estate has become increasingly important. Douglas Sesler, our new Executive Vice President of Real Estate, has jumped right in and is learning fast. He is continuing the work in progress to explore potential opportunities for creating value through joint ventures or other partnerships for our mall-based properties as well as our flagship properties. This is very complex, but I can say that the interest is very strong, and I believe we will have some good options. But it will take time to evaluate. At the same time, he and our real estate team are seeking to monetize unproductive real estate. 
While we are excited about our business-driving initiatives, we have lowered our expectations for the year, particularly the second quarter. For the year as a whole, we are now expecting comp owned plus licensed sales to be down 3% to down 4%. The upper end of this guidance, the down 3%, implies a similar trend for the remaining 9 months of the year to the first quarter trend on a 2-year basis, the down 2.9% per year.
As stated earlier, most of our new initiatives will not have a meaningful impact until the back half of the year. As a result, we don't expect comp sales in the second quarter to be significantly better than that in the first quarter. Also, as you know, the year-over-year comparisons get easier in the third and fourth quarters given the weakness last year. We also are hoping for a more normal winter. 
We are now assuming that our gross margin rate for the full year will be approximately flat to last year. And as mentioned earlier, we are working hard to reduce expense dollars given the lower sales outlook, while trying very hard to minimize any impact to our customers.
Expense dollars are now assumed to be below last year for the full year, but the rate as a percent of sales will still be higher. 
We are no longer expecting to be able to increase our EBITDA as a percent of sales this year, but we still believe that we will return to our 14% target, which we achieved just 2 years ago in 2014.
Our EPS guidance for the year is now $3.15 to $3.40 per share, excluding settlement charges. 
All of us have been reading the stream of negative news stories about various retailers over the past several weeks. Clearly, our industry is in something of a rough patch. We know we are not alone. But the consumer seems to be doing okay. Employment is steady, and wages continue to rise. The consumer savings rate remains high, and most macroeconomic indicators are better than flat. So it's reasonable to conclude that the consumer will return to more aggressive discretionary spending at some point, hopefully, sooner than later.
As we described today, we at Macy's, Inc. are taking tangible action now to mitigate the current headwinds and drive profitable sales. And as the overall tide rises, we believe we will be very well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities. 
We have always said that a down period in our industry is a great time for us to pursue gains in long-term market share. We are not counting on consumers to spend more this year, but we are working hard to give them reasons to shop more with us. 
As Terry has said, a setback is a setup for a comeback. That is how we are looking at the business even if our comeback is taking longer than expected to take root. We have a lot of newness in our pipeline. Not everything will work, of course, but we think that our proposition for the customer will be fresh and compelling in 2016, especially as we head into the all-important fourth quarter. And we are absolutely not pulling back our commitment to digital and Omnichannel retailing. Mobile remains a very high priority, and we continue to invest. 
You may have seen that a leading trade publication last month ranked Macy's, Inc. as the sixth largest online retailer in America. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to see double-digit year-over-year sales increases in online sales. 
While we have already somewhat downsized our fleet of stores, we continue to see value and opportunity in physical locations that sync with desktops, websites, apps and mobile in giving customers choices and meeting demand in new and different ways.
We would all prefer to be talking about sales and earnings increases today. We have confidence in our management team and organization to lead us in the direction of a recovery. And we are thankful for the heritage of innovation and the strength of outstanding brands on which we will continue to build.
So now it's time for questions. Who has the first question?"

So we really don't have to do anything to change that piece of it. And the replenishment is not just what we would call basics. There is some fashion on replenishment as well. So that adjusts with sales trends automatically. But that's in part why we relooked at the fall plan when we did. We're hopeful that what we've seen in the last -- in the end of the quarter is unusual and the trends will improve. But we thought we should not take the risk of waiting so that we could make a meaningful adjustment to our inventory and receipt plans as well as expense for the back half of the year. Your second question on how do you plan after a winter like last year. That's one of the interesting questions we've all been debating. We are actually planning it to be  -- sorry, cold-weather merchandise to be relatively flat with last year. But if there is what we would call a normal winter, that would give us upside opportunity. Now 2014 was an unusually cold winter, so we're sort of looking at half of the difference between '14 as being what we think is reasonable, and that's over $100 million in additional cold-weather merchandise sales. So that would be helpful to the bottom -- to the top line."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
Sales in the first quarter were $5,771,000,000 or 7.4% below last year due both to the stores that we've closed in 2015 and the decline in comp sales. While we had planned comps sales to be below last year in the first quarter, our 5.6% decline on an owned plus licensed basis was worse than expected. On a 2-year basis, the comp sales were down 2.9% per year.
While the quarter started stronger, the business weakened considerably versus our expectations beginning in mid-March, and that trend continued through April. 
As Terry said in our press release, we are seeing weakness in consumer spending levels in apparel and related categories. The number of transactions declined 7% in the quarter, which is far worse than what was experienced last year. This is the proxy, as you know, for traffic. AUR, average unit retail, was up slightly, and units per transaction was up approximately 1%. 
Additionally, we continue to be negatively impacted by reduced spending by international tourists. Sales on international tourist credit cards were down 20% in the quarter on top of a 21% drop last year in the first quarter. This reduction in spending impacted our comp by a little less than a point versus last year. This was disappointing and had a disproportionately negative impact on our Center Core businesses, given what these visitors buy. 
Given that our stores are concentrated in major tourist markets, this is a big factor for us, and we are no longer confident that it will improve anytime soon. While we are focusing on increasing our share of the domestic tourist business, we don't think we can offset all of the loss on the international side. 
There were some businesses in the quarter that performed relatively well: fine jewelry, dresses, active, fragrances, coats, men's tailored clothing, housewares and furniture. However, the significant weakness in other parts of our assortments more than offset these good news stories. The softer businesses included handbags, fashion watches, women's shoes, kids, men's furnishings and luggage.
Regionally, we continued to see weakness in our major tourist markets, which, as mentioned before, are many of our largest markets. Our performance in Texas was also disappointing. We achieved our strongest performances in markets across the country that are less dependent on international tourism but are also smaller such as North Carolina; Southern Virginia; Columbus, Ohio; Oregon; and New England. 
Digital sales continued strong, still growing double digits, but it, too, grew less rapidly than anticipated. 
Bloomingdale’s trends were also weak due to the same trends impacting Macy's. 
One major success in the quarter was the rollout of Last Act, our centralized clearance areas for most of women's and men's apparel within the Macy's stores. Merchandise in these parts of our stores are marked with a clearance price, and they are not eligible for additional discounts nor coupons.
Sales of these goods were up high single digits, driven entirely by the higher average unit retail. 
Backstage, our off-price concept, also had a good quarter. We are particularly pleased with how our first 2 Backstage in-stores opened, one in Nanuet, New York and the other in Waterbury, Connecticut. We are hoping these stores bring in new customers as well as add share of wallet of existing customers.
So far, both objectives are being reached, but it is premature to climb success. We just opened 4 more, and we expect to open approximately 9 more this year. If this strategy works, we could roll it out to approximately 250 to 300 of our Macy's stores. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 39.1%, up 10 basis points from last year's level. We ended the quarter with comp inventory down 0.8%. Total inventory was down 3.2% due both to the comp drop as well as the closed stores. While we are satisfied with our overall inventory level, the slowness in selling of warm weather goods will put pressure on our gross margin rate in the second quarter. 
SG&A in the first quarter, excluding the retirement plan related settlement charges, was $1.966 billion, down $57 million or 2.8% below last year. In the quarter, we benefited from the restructuring completed at year-end. The expense flexed on the lower sales and lower retirement expense, offset in part by Omnichannel-related expense as well as the expense additions associated with Bluemercury, Backstage and China. 
Credit income was $182 million in the quarter, $3 million above last year. While our proprietary credit card penetration of 45.9% was 100 basis points above last year, credit sales were below last year due to the overall sales trend. We still expect credit income to be slightly below last year on an annual basis, primarily as a result of the sales decline. 
Asset sales gains in the quarter were $14 million, $4 million associated with Brooklyn and $10 million for other asset sales. This compares to $20 million in the first quarter last year.
During the fourth quarter conference call a few months ago, we explained that we would have noncash charges for settlement accounting related to our retirement plans going forward. We expected these charges to be triggered because of the increase in lump sum distributions associated with our store closings, voluntary separation program and organizational restructuring. This charge was $13 million in the quarter, and we are still assuming approximately $135 million for the full year. These charges, as you saw, were broken out separately on the P&L and are not included in our guidance.
Operating income, excluding these settlement charges, was $289 million, down from last year's $409 million. As a percent of sales, operating income on this basis was 5% as compared to 6.6% last year.
Interest expense was $98 million. Tax expense was $63 million with an effective rate of 35.4%, down from last year's 38.5%, due to the timing of some tax settlements. We still expect the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. 
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1 million versus none last year.
Net income attributable to Macy's, excluding the settlement charges, was $125 million as compared to $193 million a year ago. 
Average share count on a diluted basis was 313.5 million shares, down 9.5% from last year's 346.5 million shares.
EPS on a diluted basis, excluding the settlement charges, was $0.40 as compared to $0.56 a share last year. 
In the quarter, cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, was a use of $203 million this year versus a use of $328 million last year. The major variances were last year's Bluemercury acquisition, offset by lower net income, and less cash coming from previously escrowed funds from asset sales this year.
During the quarter, we bought back $129 million of stock or 3 million shares under our repurchase program versus $385 million last year. 
As you saw in our press release, we are focusing our efforts in 3 areas to improve our performance this year: one, speed up and scale up things that are working. This includes initiatives such as our jewelry pilot; Backstage in-store; beauty, including Bluemercury expansion; active; and Last Act. Two, we will excite customers with greater newness and more exclusive merchandise. You saw some examples of this in our press release, of exciting new collaborations and brands being introduced at Macy's. We also have a renewed focus on product that can only be found at Macy's and at Bloomingdale’s, including our private brands, exclusive brands and exclusive product from the major brands. And third, we are digging deeper to find expense reduction opportunities to free up money to invest in improving customer service, both in-store and online. Technology will obviously play a major role here. 
While we hope to see some improvement in our sales trends during the second quarter, most of these actions are expected to have a bigger impact in the fall and particularly in the fourth quarter.
With the evolving role of our stores, understanding opportunities with our real estate has become increasingly important. Douglas Sesler, our new Executive Vice President of Real Estate, has jumped right in and is learning fast. He is continuing the work in progress to explore potential opportunities for creating value through joint ventures or other partnerships for our mall-based properties as well as our flagship properties. This is very complex, but I can say that the interest is very strong, and I believe we will have some good options. But it will take time to evaluate. At the same time, he and our real estate team are seeking to monetize unproductive real estate. 
While we are excited about our business-driving initiatives, we have lowered our expectations for the year, particularly the second quarter. For the year as a whole, we are now expecting comp owned plus licensed sales to be down 3% to down 4%. The upper end of this guidance, the down 3%, implies a similar trend for the remaining 9 months of the year to the first quarter trend on a 2-year basis, the down 2.9% per year.
As stated earlier, most of our new initiatives will not have a meaningful impact until the back half of the year. As a result, we don't expect comp sales in the second quarter to be significantly better than that in the first quarter. Also, as you know, the year-over-year comparisons get easier in the third and fourth quarters given the weakness last year. We also are hoping for a more normal winter. 
We are now assuming that our gross margin rate for the full year will be approximately flat to last year. And as mentioned earlier, we are working hard to reduce expense dollars given the lower sales outlook, while trying very hard to minimize any impact to our customers.
Expense dollars are now assumed to be below last year for the full year, but the rate as a percent of sales will still be higher. 
We are no longer expecting to be able to increase our EBITDA as a percent of sales this year, but we still believe that we will return to our 14% target, which we achieved just 2 years ago in 2014.
Our EPS guidance for the year is now $3.15 to $3.40 per share, excluding settlement charges. 
All of us have been reading the stream of negative news stories about various retailers over the past several weeks. Clearly, our industry is in something of a rough patch. We know we are not alone. But the consumer seems to be doing okay. Employment is steady, and wages continue to rise. The consumer savings rate remains high, and most macroeconomic indicators are better than flat. So it's reasonable to conclude that the consumer will return to more aggressive discretionary spending at some point, hopefully, sooner than later.
As we described today, we at Macy's, Inc. are taking tangible action now to mitigate the current headwinds and drive profitable sales. And as the overall tide rises, we believe we will be very well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities. 
We have always said that a down period in our industry is a great time for us to pursue gains in long-term market share. We are not counting on consumers to spend more this year, but we are working hard to give them reasons to shop more with us. 
As Terry has said, a setback is a setup for a comeback. That is how we are looking at the business even if our comeback is taking longer than expected to take root. We have a lot of newness in our pipeline. Not everything will work, of course, but we think that our proposition for the customer will be fresh and compelling in 2016, especially as we head into the all-important fourth quarter. And we are absolutely not pulling back our commitment to digital and Omnichannel retailing. Mobile remains a very high priority, and we continue to invest. 
You may have seen that a leading trade publication last month ranked Macy's, Inc. as the sixth largest online retailer in America. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to see double-digit year-over-year sales increases in online sales. 
While we have already somewhat downsized our fleet of stores, we continue to see value and opportunity in physical locations that sync with desktops, websites, apps and mobile in giving customers choices and meeting demand in new and different ways.
We would all prefer to be talking about sales and earnings increases today. We have confidence in our management team and organization to lead us in the direction of a recovery. And we are thankful for the heritage of innovation and the strength of outstanding brands on which we will continue to build.

So we really don't have to do anything to change that piece of it. And the replenishment is not just what we would call basics. There is some fashion on replenishment as well. So that adjusts with sales trends automatically. But that's in part why we relooked at the fall plan when we did. We're hopeful that what we've seen in the last -- in the end of the quarter is unusual and the trends will improve. But we thought we should not take the risk of waiting so that we could make a meaningful adjustment to our inventory and receipt plans as well as expense for the back half of the year. Your second question on how do you plan after a winter like last year. That's one of the interesting questions we've all been debating. We are actually planning it to be  -- sorry, cold-weather merchandise to be relatively flat with last year. But if there is what we would call a normal winter, that would give us upside opportunity. Now 2014 was an unusually cold winter, so we're sort of looking at half of the difference between '14 as being what we think is reasonable, and that's over $100 million in additional cold-weather merchandise sales. So that would be helpful to the bottom -- to the top line."

And to your point, some of the things that we're looking at are the health and wellness arena. So we'll see as we go. But again, agree with the basic theory that you have there. In terms of Center Core, I would say a couple of things. One is the jewelry pilot rollout should be very helpful to that area, and we think that will be good. I think also we're testing a shoe pilot similar to the jewelry -- well, similar in terms of its focus on a specific category, different strategies out in California this fall. And we're hopeful that, that will help the shoe business. We've got a lot up our sleeves in the Beauty area, including the rollout of some more Bluemercury stores. So we do think it will get better. I don't know that it will return to the growth that we've had in recent years this fall, but we're hopeful."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recent Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
Sales in the first quarter were $5,771,000,000 or 7.4% below last year due both to the stores that we've closed in 2015 and the decline in comp sales. While we had planned comps sales to be below last year in the first quarter, our 5.6% decline on an owned plus licensed basis was worse than expected. On a 2-year basis, the comp sales were down 2.9% per year.
While the quarter started stronger, the business weakened considerably versus our expectations beginning in mid-March, and that trend continued through April. 
As Terry said in our press release, we are seeing weakness in consumer spending levels in apparel and related categories. The number of transactions declined 7% in the quarter, which is far worse than what was experienced last year. This is the proxy, as you know, for traffic. AUR, average unit retail, was up slightly, and units per transaction was up approximately 1%. 
Additionally, we continue to be negatively impacted by reduced spending by international tourists. Sales on international tourist credit cards were down 20% in the quarter on top of a 21% drop last year in the first quarter. This reduction in spending impacted our comp by a little less than a point versus last year. This was disappointing and had a disproportionately negative impact on our Center Core businesses, given what these visitors buy. 
Given that our stores are concentrated in major tourist markets, this is a big factor for us, and we are no longer confident that it will improve anytime soon. While we are focusing on increasing our share of the domestic tourist business, we don't think we can offset all of the loss on the international side. 
There were some businesses in the quarter that performed relatively well: fine jewelry, dresses, active, fragrances, coats, men's tailored clothing, housewares and furniture. However, the significant weakness in other parts of our assortments more than offset these good news stories. The softer businesses included handbags, fashion watches, women's shoes, kids, men's furnishings and luggage.
Regionally, we continued to see weakness in our major tourist markets, which, as mentioned before, are many of our largest markets. Our performance in Texas was also disappointing. We achieved our strongest performances in markets across the country that are less dependent on international tourism but are also smaller such as North Carolina; Southern Virginia; Columbus, Ohio; Oregon; and New England. 
Digital sales continued strong, still growing double digits, but it, too, grew less rapidly than anticipated. 
Bloomingdale’s trends were also weak due to the same trends impacting Macy's. 
One major success in the quarter was the rollout of Last Act, our centralized clearance areas for most of women's and men's apparel within the Macy's stores. Merchandise in these parts of our stores are marked with a clearance price, and they are not eligible for additional discounts nor coupons.
Sales of these goods were up high single digits, driven entirely by the higher average unit retail. 
Backstage, our off-price concept, also had a good quarter. We are particularly pleased with how our first 2 Backstage in-stores opened, one in Nanuet, New York and the other in Waterbury, Connecticut. We are hoping these stores bring in new customers as well as add share of wallet of existing customers.
So far, both objectives are being reached, but it is premature to claim success. We just opened 4 more, and we expect to open approximately 9 more this year. If this strategy works, we could roll it out to approximately 250 to 300 of our Macy's stores. 
Gross margin in the first quarter was 39.1%, up 10 basis points from last year's level. We ended the quarter with comp inventory down 0.8%. Total inventory was down 3.2% due both to the comp drop as well as the closed stores. While we are satisfied with our overall inventory level, the slowness in selling of warm weather goods will put pressure on our gross margin rate in the second quarter. 
SG&A in the first quarter, excluding the retirement plan related settlement charges, was $1.966 billion, down $57 million or 2.8% below last year. In the quarter, we benefited from the restructuring completed at year-end. The expense flexed on the lower sales and lower retirement expense, offset in part by Omnichannel-related expense as well as the expense additions associated with Bluemercury, Backstage and China. 
Credit income was $182 million in the quarter, $3 million above last year. While our proprietary credit card penetration of 45.9% was 100 basis points above last year, credit sales were below last year due to the overall sales trend. We still expect credit income to be slightly below last year on an annual basis, primarily as a result of the sales decline. 
Asset sales gains in the quarter were $14 million, $4 million associated with Brooklyn and $10 million for other asset sales. This compares to $20 million in the first quarter last year.
During the fourth quarter conference call a few months ago, we explained that we would have noncash charges for settlement accounting related to our retirement plans going forward. We expected these charges to be triggered because of the increase in lump sum distributions associated with our store closings, voluntary separation program and organizational restructuring. This charge was $13 million in the quarter, and we are still assuming approximately $135 million for the full year. These charges, as you saw, are broken out separately on the P&L and are not included in our guidance.
Operating income, excluding these settlement charges, was $289 million, down from last year's $409 million. As a percent of sales, operating income on this basis was 5% as compared to 6.6% last year.
Interest expense was $98 million. Tax expense was $63 million with an effective rate of 35.4%, down from last year's 38.5%, due to the timing of some tax settlements. We still expect the annual effective tax rate to be approximately 37%. 
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1 million versus none last year.
Net income attributable to Macy's, excluding the settlement charges, was $125 million as compared to $193 million a year ago. 
Average share count on a diluted basis was 313.5 million shares, down 9.5% from last year's 346.5 million shares.
EPS on a diluted basis, excluding the settlement charges, was $0.40 as compared to $0.56 a share last year. 
In the quarter, cash flow from operating activities, net of investing activities, was a use of $203 million this year versus a use of $328 million last year. The major variances were last year's Bluemercury acquisition, offset by lower net income, and less cash [ph] coming from previously escrowed funds from asset sales this year.
During the quarter, we bought back $129 million of stock or 3 million shares under our repurchase program versus $385 million last year. 
As you saw in our press release, we are focusing our efforts in 3 areas to improve our performance this year: one, speed up and scale up things that are working. This includes initiatives such as our jewelry pilot; Backstage in-store; beauty, including Bluemercury expansion; active; and Last Act. Two, we will excite customers with greater newness and more exclusive merchandise. You saw some examples of this in our press release, of exciting new collaborations and brands being introduced at Macy's. We also have a renewed focus on product that can only be found at Macy's and at Bloomingdale’s, including our private brands, exclusive brands and exclusive product from the major brands. And third, we are digging deeper to find expense reduction opportunities to free up money to invest in improving customer service, both in-store and online. Technology will obviously play a major role here. 
While we hope to see some improvement in our sales trends during the second quarter, most of these actions are expected to have a bigger impact in the fall and particularly in the fourth quarter.
With the evolving role of our stores, understanding opportunities with our real estate has become increasingly important. Doug Sesler, our new Executive Vice President of Real Estate, has jumped right in and is learning fast. He is continuing the work in progress to explore potential opportunities for creating value through joint ventures or other partnerships for our mall-based properties as well as our flagship properties. This is very complex, but I can say that the interest is very strong, and I believe we will have some good options. But it will take time to evaluate. At the same time, he and our real estate team are seeking to monetize unproductive real estate. 
While we are excited about our business-driving initiatives, we have lowered our expectations for the year, particularly the second quarter. For the year as a whole, we are now expecting comp owned plus licensed sales to be down 3% to down 4%. The upper end of this guidance, the down 3%, implies a similar trend for the remaining 9 months of the year to the first quarter trend on a 2-year basis, the down 2.9% per year.
As stated earlier, most of our new initiatives will not have a meaningful impact until the back half of the year. As a result, we don't expect comp sales in the second quarter to be significantly better than that in the first quarter. Also, as you know, the year-over-year comparisons get easier in the third and fourth quarters given the weakness last year. We also are hoping for a more normal winter. 
We are now assuming that our gross margin rate for the full year will be approximately flat to last year. And as mentioned earlier, we are working hard to reduce expense dollars given the lower sales outlook, while trying very hard to minimize any impact to our customers.
Expense dollars are now assumed to be below last year for the full year, but the rate as a percent of sales will still be higher. 
We are no longer expecting to be able to increase our EBITDA as a percent of sales this year, but we still believe that we will return to our 14% target, which we achieved just 2 years ago in 2014.
Our EPS guidance for the year is now $3.15 to $3.40 per share, excluding settlement charges. 
All of us have been reading the stream of negative news stories about various retailers over the past several weeks. Clearly, our industry is in something of a rough patch. We know we are not alone. But the consumer seems to be doing okay. Employment is steady, and wages continue to rise. The consumer savings rate remains high, and most macroeconomic indicators are better than flat. So it's reasonable to conclude that the consumer will return to more aggressive discretionary spending at some point, hopefully, sooner than later.
As we described today, we at Macy's, Inc. are taking tangible action now to mitigate the current headwinds and drive profitable sales. And as the overall tide rises, we believe we will be very well positioned to capitalize on new opportunities. 
We have always said that a down period in our industry is a great time for us to pursue gains in long-term market share. We are not counting on consumers to spend more this year, but we are working hard to give them reasons to shop more with us. 
As Terry has said, a setback is a setup for a comeback. That is how we are looking at the business even if our comeback is taking longer than expected to take root. We have a lot of newness in our pipeline. Not everything will work, of course, but we think that our proposition for the customer will be fresh and compelling in 2016, especially as we head into the all-important fourth quarter. And we are absolutely not pulling back our commitment to digital and Omnichannel retailing. Mobile remains a very high priority, and we continue to invest. 
You may have seen that a leading trade publication last month ranked Macy's, Inc. as the sixth largest online retailer in America. And as I said earlier, we are continuing to see double-digit year-over-year sales increases in online sales. 
While we have already somewhat downsized our fleet of stores, we continue to see value and opportunity in physical locations that sync with desktops, websites, apps and mobile in giving customers choices and meeting demand in new and different ways.
We would all prefer to be talking about sales and earnings increases today. We have confidence in our management team and organization to lead us in the direction of a recovery. And we are thankful for the heritage of innovation and the strength of outstanding brands on which we will continue to build.
So now it's time for questions. Who has the first question?"

So we really don't have to do anything to change that piece of it. And the replenishment is not just what we would call basics. There is some fashion on replenishment as well. So that adjusts with sales trends automatically. But that's in part why we relooked at the fall plan when we did. We're hopeful that what we've seen in the last -- in the end of the quarter is unusual and the trends will improve. But we thought we should not take the risk of waiting so that we could make a meaningful adjustment to our inventory and receipt plans as well as expense for the back half of the year. Your second question on how do you plan after a winter like last year. That's one of the interesting questions we've all been debating. We are actually planning it to be -- sorry, cold-weather merchandise to be relatively flat with last year. But if there is what we would call a normal winter, that would give us upside opportunity. Now 2014 was an unusually cold winter, so we're sort of looking at half of the difference between '14 as being what we think is reasonable, and that's over $100 million in additional cold-weather merchandise sales. So that would be helpful to the bottom -- to the top line."

In terms of Center Core, I would say a couple of things. One is the jewelry pilot rollout should be very helpful to that area, and we think that will be good. I think also we're testing a shoe pilot similar to the jewelry -- well, similar in terms of its focus on a specific category, different strategies out in California this fall. And we're hopeful that, that will help the shoe business. We've got a lot up our sleeves in the Beauty area, including the rollout of some more Bluemercury stores. So we do think it will get better.

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and other SEC filings. 
While second quarter sales and earnings were still below last year, we were pleased with improvement in our sales trend during the quarter. Our comp sales performance on an owned plus licensed basis was much improved from the first quarter on both a 1 and on a 2-year basis and sets us up well for the remainder of the year. 
I will talk this morning first about the quarter and then our outlook for the second half of the year, and we'll also discuss the strategic announcements made today regarding our store portfolio and real estate opportunities. 
Sales in the second quarter were $5,866,000,000, down 4% from last year. On a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 2%. This compares to the 5.6% drop we experienced in the first quarter. 
On a 2-year basis, the first quarter was down 2.9% per year and the second quarter down 1.7%, representing a 1.2 point improvement in this trend. 
Both Macy's and Bloomingdale's experienced improvement in the second quarter. 
We would cite 4 key factors contributing to this trend change: One, weather has been hot this summer and has contributed to the strong apparel sales and perhaps more shopping in general as the way to avoid the heat; two, international credit card sales were down 12% in the second quarter. This compares to a 20% drop in the first quarter. While they still negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter, it had less of an impact than it has had in recent quarters. As a result, our sales trend in the major tourist stores improved for both Macy's and Bloomingdale's in the quarter. Three, many of our sales generating strategies are beginning to kick in. The investment in staffing in our best stores, our fine jewelry strategy, the Last Act clearance strategy and home store improvements. This is very encouraging. And four, a few strong promotional events and sharper pricing helped in the quarter as well, and we were able to structure these events to both drive sales and preserve our gross margin rate. 
The families of business that were strongest in the quarter included all of apparel: men's, women's and kids, as well as fine jewelry, shoes, fragrances, textiles and housewares. Handbags and fashion jewelry and watches continued to be weak. 
We are encouraged by the start of the back-to-school season. We are seeing strength in all categories, but are most excited by the strong trend in denim. 
Our private brands also helped fuel the quarter's improvement, particularly in women's apparel, shoes and home. This strength is great to see given the importance of having great merchandise that can be found only at Macy's. 
Geographically, our Southwest region, which is primarily Southern California, had the strongest performance. 
Our digital business had a strong quarter again of double-digit growth, both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We are benefiting from new releases on our mobile apps and other technology improvements that are driving increases in conversion. Our investments are focused on removing points of friction, and our Net Promoter Score has improved on our digital business 2 points year-over-year. 
For example, we've been able to auto provision our customers' wallets to make it easier to use coupons and other promotional offers. We've also improved navigation to make it easier and faster to shop. 
The number of transactions in the quarter was down 5% versus last year, with average unit retail up 2.8% and a relatively flat units per transaction. This is slightly different from the first quarter when, as you remember, the number of transactions was down by more and the average unit retail not up by as much. The change in both of these metrics demonstrates the improved underlying trends in our business. 
Our Backstage stores are doing well in total although performance by doors mixed, as you would expect from a new business. We are learning a lot about how to maximize this opportunity with our focus being on the store in-stores. We are encouraged by the early result. 
Bluemercury has had terrific new store openings, including in Tribeca, Columbus Circle, East Hampton as well as their 100th store, which opened in Savannah, Georgia. We now have 103 Bluemercury stores, including 12 in our Macy's doors. We are optimistic that Bluemercury will contribute significantly to our beauty offering in our Macy's stores as well as in the freestanding locations. 
We are pleased with the early performance of our China joint venture, which is doing business through Tmall. We are learning both about the Chinese consumer and also how to do business there. It is too early to judge, but we are encouraged by what our small team has been able to accomplish in a very short time. 
Gross margin rate in the second quarter was 40.9%, flat with last year, which is better than we had expected. This resulted from our sales being stronger than expected and also from the success of our Last Act strategy for clearing end-of-season merchandise. We've now expanded Last Act beyond apparel areas, including, for example, the handbags, and we expect to convert shoes later this year. 
In total, our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 3.2% versus a year ago, and on a comp basis, inventory was down 1.5%. 
SG&A in the quarter was $2,026,000,000 or 34.5% of sales. This is $32 million or 1.6% below last year in the quarter, due primarily to $21 million in asset sale gains in the quarter versus none during the second quarter last year. The portion of the Brooklyn gain that was booked in the quarter was $11 million and gains on other asset sales were $10 million. 
We also benefit in the quarter from the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015, lower store expense due to last year's closings and lower retirement expense. Offsetting these positive factors were an increase in expense to support our digital growth and the reduction in credit income. 
Credit income in the quarter was $181 million, $14 million below last year due primarily to lower credit sales. The penetration of our proprietary credit card was approximately 47% in the second quarter, down about 80 basis points from last year, but up over 100 basis points from 2014. 
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $260 million, about flat with last year. We booked $249 million in asset impairments and other costs primarily related to the expected closure of approximately 100 stores, which I will discuss with you in a few minutes. 
Settlement charges related to our retirement plans were $6 million in the quarter. Operating income after these charges was $117 [ph] million. Excluding asset impairment, settlement charges and the other costs, operating income was $372 million, 6.4% of sales. On this basis, it was 15% below last year. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $97 million and tax expense, $11 million. Including the asset impairment settlement charges and other costs, net income was $9 million. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $2 million relating to our China joint venture, so the net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $11 million. 
Net income attributable to Macy's shareholders in the quarter, excluding the asset impairments, settlement charges and other costs, was $168 million. 
Average share count on a diluted basis in the quarter was 311.3 million shares, down 9% from last year. We did not buy back any stock in the second quarter. We suspended the program in reaction to our disappointing first quarter. However, should current sales trends continue, we will consider resuming our stock buyback in the back half of the year. 
EPS on a diluted basis was $0.03. Excluding asset impairments and settlement charges, EPS in the quarter on a diluted basis was $0.54, which is down 16% on the same basis from last year. 
Cash flow for financing in the first half of the year was a positive $222 million this year as compared to a use of $217 million last year. And net cash provided from operating activities was $560 million as compared to $398 million last year, primarily due to the reduction in inventory. 
Net cash used by investing activities was $338 million, $277 million lower than last year due primarily to last year's acquisition of Bluemercury as well as lower capital spending. 
We are still targeting capital spending of $900 million for the full year, which compares, as you know, to $1.1 billion last year. 
Cash used by financing activities was $331 million this year, $855 million less than last year due primarily to the lower stock buyback as well as fewer option exercises. 
As we move to the back half of the year, we are encouraged by the recent business trends. Our annual sales guidance of minus 3 to minus 4 on a comp owned plus licensed basis feels achievable. 
The fall season would need to be minus 2.3% to minus 4.1% to hit that guidance. This compares to the minus 3.8% in the first half of the year. 
On a 2-year basis, the back half of the year would need to be minus 3.2% to minus 4.1% per year as compared to minus 2.3% in the spring season. 
We still expect the comp sales performance relative to last year to be worse than the third quarter than in the fourth quarter, largely due to the last year comparisons. 
Our earnings per share guidance for the year remains at $3.15 to $3.40 for the full year. 
The only change in our key assumptions versus our prior earnings guidance is that we now expect that Brooklyn gain in fiscal 2016 to be approximately $36 million, which is $50 [ph] million less than what we had told you to expect when we gave guidance in February. 
The total gain associated with the Brooklyn transaction does not change. This is just timing due to delays in the project construction. 
We are comfortable at this point, though, covering this $0.10 a share of bad news within our prior guidance. 
As we have said, we are focusing on setting the company up for a comeback. And while we are very pleased with the improved sales trend, it does not change our feeling of urgency for making changes to better position Macy's and Bloomingdale's for the future. 
You will hear about these changes and our priorities as we move forward. Today's announcement is focused on our store portfolio and how we are strengthening it to position us best so that we can win over the longer term. 
As you know, we have a terrific portfolio of stores, with strong locations in almost every top mall in our markets as well as great freestanding stores, such as Herald Square, 59th Street and Union Square. We are in 49 of the top 50 U.S. markets based on population and 91 of the top 100. All of our stores, except a very few, are cash flow positive, but not all of our stores fit today with our desired long-term retail footprint. 
While our weaker performing and less well-located stores are cash flow positive, many of these don't produce acceptable returns on investment and often don't represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand. And as we all know, market demographics change over time, and this country is over stored given evolving customer shopping habits. 
We decided to be proactive and to close a larger number of stores this year. This will bring the shopping experience to a consistently higher level and concentrates Macy's stores in locations with better potential. We believe we can benefit from rightsizing the company. This will force us to make necessary overhead reductions to preserve profitability and ongoing cash flow. 
And while it will shrink the company somewhat, these closings will positively impact our return on invested capital and help us to accelerate our growth. 
As you read in our press release this morning, we expect to close approximately 100 stores. We will not, however, lose representation in any of the top markets. Most of these stores will close around our fiscal year-end, but we will continue to operate some of these until we either sell the store or until leases or operating covenants either expire or can be amended or waived. 
Most of these stores are underperformers or in weak locations. However, we will also close a few stores because their desirability as a redevelopment opportunity exceeds their value to us as a retail store. 
While we can't be too precise until the actual store lift and timing are finalized, our estimate is that if all of these closings happened at fiscal year-end 2016, they would negatively impact sales in 2017 by approximately $1 billion. But as I said earlier, we don't expect all to be closed at year-end, and so the impact on 2017 should be less. 
This potential sales loss is lower than the projected volume of these 100 roughly stores due to our ability to retain some of the sales and other stores as well as on Macy's.com. 
With the stores we've closed in recent years, we have greatly improved our ability to retain sales, both through new targeted marketing efforts and by trying to make sure that we add specific merchandise, categories and vendors that is in-stores that are being closed into stores that are nearby. 
The desire to retain as many customers as we can and begin impacting assortment decisions for spring 2017 is why we are making this announcement so far in advance. 
These stores currently produce incremental EBITDA, but we are hoping to be able to offset this loss with cost reductions beyond the costs that come from closing these stores directly. We are working hard on strategies to reduce costs, consistent with both the downsizing of the company, and also so that we can be more agile in making decisions going forward. 
At this point, we don't have details worked out, and we will discuss this with you more down the road. But as you know, our track record is very good in delivering expense reductions to which we commit. 
The preliminary list of possible closures resulted in our having to impair many of these assets now. These asset impairments are primarily what is responsible for the $249 million in total charges taken in the second quarter. 
One of the reasons we feel it is right to shrink to grow is the success we're beginning to have in our top doors. Our work with our top 150 doors gives us confidence that we can accelerate our growth in these strategically critical locations. We want to focus our financial resources and our talent to make this happen, along with fueling our digital growth. This will come from a combination of improved assortments, more technology, more and better customer service and more special events. 
The closing of approximately 100 stores is a big step and not one that we take lightly. We believe that it's critical to reposition the company for the future, but that still doesn't make it easy. We will be respectful and open with our associates in these stores, and we'll try to minimize the impact on local communities by improving nearby stores and with our digital shopping venues. 
We also provided an update today on our pursuit of various opportunities to extract value from our real estate portfolio, consistent with our long-term store location strategy as well as our balance sheet leverage objective. 
For some time now, we have been examining opportunities for 4 large downtown stores in major cities: Herald Square; Union Square; State Street in Chicago; and downtown Minneapolis. Today, we announced that we are currently in discussions with potential purchasers for our San Francisco men's store on Union Square. For those of you not familiar with San Francisco, we have a men's building as well as a main store, and what we're talking about is selling just the men's store. The main store would continue. 
This store would be redeveloped for alternative use and our men's business would be recombined into our main Union Square store. 
While today, it is currently one of the country's most successful men's stores, the value of the real estate appears to offer significant opportunity, and we believe we can recombine it with the main store and both preserve the strength of our offering and hopefully improve the main Union Square store as well. 
We continue to analyze possibilities for our Herald Square New York flagship store, downtown Minneapolis and the upper floors of our State Street store in downtown Chicago. 
In addition to these flagship stores, we have made progress in identifying underlying situations where the development or redevelopment of all or a part of our real estate holding exceeds the value of its existing use. We are developing and executing plans to move forward to capitalize on these opportunities. This will occur through sales of assets or portions thereof, some of which are included in the 100 closings. But it could also happen through joint ventures or strategic alliances. We are in early stages of discussions with various potential partners. 
We also continue to evaluate financial transactions, such as sale-leasebacks or joint ventures for locations that we expect to operate for many years. However, this is a low priority for us at present given the combination of leverage as well as breakage or leakage that would result from debt repurchase, from taxes and from fees. 
While we know we have a lot of work ahead of us, we feel confident that we are on the right path. 
As I said earlier, closing stores is not something we take lightly, but we do believe it will enable us to focus more on our better stores and on our digital business. And by closing weaker stores and monetizing some of our real estate where the redevelopment opportunities are significant, we will grow faster and we will produce a higher return on invested capital. 
We have talked before about the ongoing need to reinvent our company and that our industry, every 5 to 7 years, also needs to be reinvented in response to evolving customer shopping preferences and patterns. This is what you are seeing at work today at Macy's, Inc. 
Terry and Jeff are working closely with our management team and our board on the strategic progress needed to extend our long-standing role as a leader in fashion, innovation, value and convenience. 
As in previous times of reinvention, some big moves and tough decisions in the short term are necessary if we are to grow sales profitably for the longer term. We need to create value from our assets and manage our expenses prudently so that we can invest in the levers of growth. 
After a series of tough quarters, the distinct change in our sales trend in the second quarter has given our team encouragement. We have so many good ideas on the table. The biggest challenge will be prioritizing what we do, ensuring that we invest  appropriately for success and following the data to be sure that we are in sync with the customer.  Everyone here is on board to implement our chosen strategies with passion and rigor. 
Retailing is changing. There's no doubt about it. Our company is committed to being tomorrow's leader in Omnichannel retailing. We will strike the right balance between stores and digital, and the closing of 100 locations will get us to where we think we need to be, all while maintaining a significant physical presence in virtually every major market across America. 
Fortunately, our company has the critical mass to offer all of the options that our customers want in terms of stores, websites and mobile apps; in terms of expedited shipping, buy online pickup in-store and same-day delivery in many markets; in terms of offering a range of exclusive product choices, supported by great experiences that are the hallmarks of both Macy's and Bloomingdale's. So what you are seeing today is meaningful change in the making, and you will be hearing more as time goes on. 
I'll stop at this point and take whatever questions you may have."

Clearly, our view of the stores going forward will evolve, so I can't sit here today and paint what it's going to look like in 5 years. But as we do stores like Easton [ph] and Columbus, that gives you some insight into some of the things we're looking at. For example, a expanded active area that includes health and wellness more broadly. The way we've approached the bridal business at Easton, including having some wedding dress is available that you could buy in the store day of or not having to be pre-ordered. Also, what we've done with beauty in Easton is really very exciting. So there's a lot of concepts, fine jewelry, which we talked about. We're experimenting with shoes. So I would say almost throughout the store, we are looking for ways of improving both the assortment that we carry, making it more special, more exclusive to Macy's, which will attract not only millennials, but also older customers as well. So I think you're going to see a lot of experimentation continue on that front. In terms of increase in service, one of the areas we've actually focused on this year has been ready-to-wear. And the reason for that is it's the category that also has to handle the most Internet returns. And so we wanted to make sure we had more staff there so that they were able to service customers that came in wanting to buy in addition to dealing with the returns that are going to obviously come from a growing digital business. So that's one of the examples of where we've put increased staffing."

One, which we've always done, which is how was the store performing? And how do we expect it to perform in the future? And we project out cash flows and discount them back and compare that to the proceeds that we would get. So what you would expect to be a typical financial analysis. What we did this year, though, to supplement that is even through and look at all of our locations and evaluated them based on their strategic importance, which had to do with quality of the market, quality of the malls, the competition in the malls and the market, what was happening in terms of growth of income and population and all the markets and coverage that we would need to go forward and ranked our stores in terms of long-term strategic importance. And so what we've done to come up with this 100 stores is married those 2. And in most cases, as you would imagine, a poorly located store is also an underperformer. And so for the most part, they were both of those. But it did lead us to accelerate some of the closings that in prior years we might not have been without that long-term evaluation of the strategic importance of the location. So that is most of the 100. There are a few additional locations, though, that have been included that are not strategically critical to the company based on that analysis. But where -- from a redevelopment opportunity, we think there's a big opportunity. So in those cases, they're not underperformers. But the long term, they're not critical to the Macy's footprint. And so we will be taking advantage of the real estate demand for those locations as well. But I would say most of them are both underperforming and not in good locations for the long term."

While second quarter sales and earnings were still below last year, we were pleased with the improvement in our sales trend during the quarter. Our comp sales performance on an owned plus licensed basis was much improved from the first quarter on both a 1- and on a 2-year basis and sets us up well for the remainder of the year. 
I will talk this morning first about the quarter and then our outlook for the second half of the year, and we'll also discuss the strategic announcements made today regarding our store portfolio and real estate opportunities. 
Sales in the second quarter were $5,866,000,000, down 4% from last year. On a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 2%. This compares to the 5.6% drop we experienced in the first quarter. 
On a 2-year basis, the first quarter was down 2.9% per year and the second quarter down 1.7%, representing a 1.2 point improvement in this trend. 
Both Macy's and Bloomingdale's experienced improvement in the second quarter. 
We would cite 4 key factors contributing to this trend change: One, weather has been hot this summer and has contributed to the strong apparel sales and perhaps more shopping in general as the way to avoid the heat. Two, international credit card sales were down 12% in the second quarter. This compares to a 20% drop in the first quarter. While they still negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter, it had less of an impact than it has had in recent quarters. As a result, our sales trend in the major tourist stores improved for both Macy's and Bloomingdale's in the quarter. Three, many of our sales-generating strategies are beginning to kick in: the investment in staffing in our best stores, our fine jewelry strategy, the Last Act clearance strategy and home store improvements. This is very encouraging. And four, a few strong promotional events and sharper pricing helped in the quarter as well, and we were able to structure these events to both drive sales and preserve our gross margin rate. 
The families of business that were strongest in the quarter included all of apparel, men's, women's and kids, as well as fine jewelry, shoes, fragrances, textiles and housewares. Handbags and fashion jewelry and watches continued to be weak. 
We are encouraged by the start of the back-to-school season. We are seeing strength in all categories, but are most excited by the strong trend in denim. 
Our private brands also helped fuel the quarter's improvement, particularly in women's apparel, shoes and home. This strength is great to see, given the importance of having great merchandise that can be found only at Macy's. 
Geographically, our Southwest region, which is primarily Southern California, had the strongest performance. 
Our digital business had a strong quarter again of double-digit growth, both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We are benefiting from new releases on our mobile apps and other technology improvements that are driving increases in conversion. Our investments are focused on removing points of friction, and our Net Promoter Score has improved on our digital business 2 points year-over-year. 
For example, we've been able to auto-provision our customers' wallets to make it easier to use coupons and other promotional offers. We've also improved navigation to make it easier and faster to shop. 
The number of transactions in the quarter was down 5% versus last year, with average unit retail up 2.8% and a relatively flat units per transaction. This is slightly different from the first quarter when, as you remember, the number of transactions was down by more and the average unit retail not up by as much. The change in both of these metrics demonstrates the improved underlying trends in our business. 
Our Backstage stores are doing well in total, although performance by door is mixed, as you would expect from a new business. We are learning a lot about how to maximize this opportunity, with our focus being on the store-in-stores. We are encouraged by the early result. 
Bluemercury has had terrific new-store openings, including in Tribeca, Columbus Circle, East Hampton as well as their 100th store, which opened in Savannah, Georgia. We now have 103 Bluemercury stores, including 12 in our Macy's doors. We are optimistic that Bluemercury will contribute significantly to our beauty offering in our Macy's stores as well as in the freestanding locations. 
We are pleased with the early performance of our China joint venture, which is doing business through Tmall. We are learning both about the Chinese consumer and also how to do business there. It is too early to judge, but we are encouraged by what our small team has been able to accomplish in a very short time. 
Gross margin rate in the second quarter was 40.9%, flat with last year, which is better than we had expected. This resulted from our sales being stronger than expected and also from the success of our Last Act strategy for clearing end-of-season merchandise. We've now expanded Last Act beyond apparel areas, including, for example, the handbags, and we expect to convert shoes later this year. 
In total, our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 3.2% versus the year ago, and on a comp basis, inventory was down 1.5%. 
SG&A in the quarter was $2,026,000,000 or 34.5% of sales. This is $32 million or 1.6% below last year in the quarter, due primarily to $21 million in asset sale gains in the quarter versus none during the second quarter last year. The portion of the Brooklyn gain that was booked in the quarter was $11 million and gains on other asset sales were $10 million. 
We also benefited in the quarter from the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015, lower store expense due to last year's closings and lower retirement expense. Offsetting these positive factors were an increase in expense to support our digital growth and the reduction in credit income. 
Credit income in the quarter was $181 million, $14 million below last year, due primarily to lower credit sales. The penetration of our proprietary credit cards was approximately 47% in the second quarter, down about 80 basis points from last year but up over 100 basis points from 2014. 
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $260 million, about flat with last year. We booked $249 million in asset impairments and other costs primarily related to the expected closure of approximately 100 stores, which I will discuss with you in a few minutes. Settlement charges related to our retirement plans were $6 million in the quarter. 
Operating income after these charges was $117 million. Excluding asset impairments, settlement charges and the other costs, operating income was $372 million, 6.4% of sales. On this basis, it was 15% below last year. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $97 million, and tax expense, $11 million. Including the asset impairments, settlement charges and other costs, net income was $9 million. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $2 million, relating to our China joint venture, so that net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $11 million. 
Net income attributable to Macy's shareholders in the quarter, excluding the asset impairments, settlement charges and other costs, was $168 million. 
Average share count on a diluted basis in the quarter was 311.3 million shares, down 9% from last year. We did not buy back any stock in the second quarter. We suspended the program in reaction to our disappointing first quarter. However, should current sales trends continue, we will consider resuming our stock buyback in the back half of the year. 
EPS on a diluted basis was $0.03. Excluding asset impairments and settlement charges, EPS in the quarter on a diluted basis was $0.54, which is down 16% on the same basis from last year. 
Cash flow before financing in the first half of the year was a positive $222 million this year as compared to a use of $217 million last year. And net cash provided from operating activities was $560 million as compared to $398 million last year, primarily due to the reduction in inventory. 
Net cash used by investing activities was $338 million, $277 million lower than last year, due primarily to last year's acquisition of Bluemercury as well as lower capital spending. 
We are still targeting capital spending of $900 million for the full year, which compares, as you know, to $1.1 billion last year. Cash used by financing activities was $331 million this year, $855 million less than last year, due primarily to the lower stock buyback as well as fewer option exercises. 
As we move to the back half of the year, we are encouraged by the recent business trends. Our annual sales guidance of minus 3% to minus 4% on a comp owned plus licensed basis feels achievable. 
The fall season would need to be minus 2.3% to minus 4.1% to hit that guidance. This compares to the minus 3.8% in the first half of the year. On a 2-year basis, the back half of the year would need to be minus 3.2% to minus 4.1% per year as compared to minus 2.3% in the spring season. 
We still expect the comp sales performance relative to last year to be worse than the third quarter than in the fourth quarter, largely due to the last-year comparisons. 
Our earnings per share guidance for the year remains at $3.15 to $3.40 for the full year. 
The only change in our key assumptions versus our prior earnings guidance is that we now expect that Brooklyn gain in fiscal 2016 to be approximately $36 million, which is $50 million less than what we had told you to expect when we gave guidance in February. The total gain associated with the Brooklyn transaction does not change. This is just timing due to delays in the project construction. 
We are comfortable at this point, though, covering this $0.10 a share of bad news within our prior guidance. 
As we have said, we are focusing on setting the company up for a comeback. And while we are very pleased with the improved sales trend, it does not change our feeling of urgency for making changes to better position Macy's and Bloomingdale's for the future. 
You will hear about these changes and our priorities as we move forward. Today's announcement is focused on our store portfolio and how we are strengthening it to position us best so that we can win over the longer term. 
As you know, we have a terrific portfolio of stores, with strong locations in almost every top mall in our markets as well as great freestanding stores, such as Herald Square, 59th Street and Union Square. We are in 49 of the top 50 U.S. markets based on population and 91 of the top 100. All of our stores, except a very few, are cash flow-positive, but not all of our stores fit today with our desired long-term retail footprint. 
While our weaker-performing and less well-located stores are cash flow-positive, many of these don't produce acceptable returns on investment and often don't represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand. And as we all know, market demographics change over time, and this country is over-stored, given evolving customer shopping habits. 
We decided to be proactive and to close a larger number of stores this year. This will bring the shopping experience to a consistently higher level and concentrates Macy's stores in locations with better potential. We believe we can benefit from rightsizing the company. This will force us to make necessary overhead reductions to preserve profitability and ongoing cash flow. And while it will shrink the company somewhat, these closings will positively impact our return on invested capital and help us to accelerate our growth. 
As you read in our press release this morning, we expect to close approximately 100 stores. We will not, however, lose representation in any of the top markets. Most of these stores will close around our fiscal year-end, but we will continue to operate some of these until we either sell the store or until leases or operating covenants either expire or can be amended or waived. 
Most of these stores are underperformers or in weak locations. However, we will also close a few stores because their desirability as a redevelopment opportunity exceeds their value to us as a retail store. 
While we can't be too precise until the actual store lift and timing are finalized, our estimate is that if all of these closings happened at fiscal year-end 2016, they would negatively impact sales in 2017 by approximately $1 billion. But as I said earlier, we don't expect all to be closed at year-end, and so the impact on 2017 should be less. 
This potential sales loss is lower than the projected volume of these 100-roughly stores due to our ability to retain some of the sales in other stores as well as on Macy's.com. 
With the stores we've closed in recent years, we have greatly improved our ability to retain sales, both through new targeted marketing efforts and by trying to make sure that we add specific merchandise, categories and vendors that is in stores that are being closed into stores that are nearby. 
The desire to retain as many customers as we can and begin impacting assortment decisions for spring 2017 is why we are making this announcement so far in advance. 
These stores currently produce incremental EBITDA, but we are hoping to be able to offset this loss with cost reductions beyond the costs that come from closing these stores directly. We are working hard on strategies to reduce costs, consistent with both the downsizing of the company and also so that we can be more agile in making decisions going forward. 
At this point, we don't have details worked out, and we will discuss this with you more down the road. But as you know, our track record is very good in delivering expense reductions to which we commit. 
The preliminary list of possible closures resulted in our having to impair many of these assets now. These asset impairments are primarily what is responsible for the $249 million in total charges taken in the second quarter. 
One of the reasons we feel it is right to shrink to grow is the success we're beginning to have in our top doors. Our work with our top 150 doors gives us confidence that we can accelerate our growth in these strategically critical locations. We want to focus our financial resources and our talent to make this happen, along with fueling our digital growth. This will come from a combination of improved assortments, more technology, more and better customer service and more special events. 
The closing of approximately 100 stores is a big step and not one that we take lightly. We believe that it's critical to reposition the company for the future, but that still doesn't make it easy. We will be respectful and open with our associates in these stores, and we'll try to minimize the impact on local communities by improving nearby stores and with our digital shopping venues. 
We also provided an update today on our pursuit of various opportunities to extract value from our real estate portfolio, consistent with our long-term store location strategy as well as our balance sheet leverage objective. 
For some time now, we have been examining opportunities for 4 large downtown stores in major cities: Herald Square, Union Square, State Street in Chicago and Downtown Minneapolis. Today, we announced that we are currently in discussions with potential purchasers for our San Francisco Men's Store on Union Square. For those of you not familiar with San Francisco, we have a men's building as well as a main store, and what we're talking about is selling just the Men's Store; the main store would continue. 
This store would be redeveloped for alternative use, and our men's business would be recombined into our main Union Square store. 
While, today, it is currently one of the country's most successful Men's Stores, the value of the real estate appears to offer significant opportunity, and we believe we can recombine it with the main store and both preserve the strength of our offering and hopefully improve the main Union Square store as well. 
We continue to analyze possibilities for our Herald Square New York flagship store, Downtown Minneapolis and the upper floors of our State Street store in Downtown Chicago. 
In addition to these flagship stores, we have made progress in identifying underlying situations where the development or redevelopment of all or a part of our real estate holding exceeds the value of its existing use. We are developing and executing plans to move forward to capitalize on these opportunities. This will occur through sales of assets or portions thereof, some of which are included in the 100 closings, but it could also happen through joint ventures or strategic alliances. We are in early stages of discussions with various potential partners. 
We also continue to evaluate financial transactions such as sale leasebacks or joint ventures for locations that we expect to operate for many years. However, this is a low priority for us at present, given the combination of leverage as well as breakage or leakage that would result from debt repurchase, from taxes and from fees. 
While we know we have a lot of work ahead of us, we feel confident that we are on the right path. 
As I said earlier, closing stores is not something we take lightly, but we do believe it will enable us to focus more on our better stores and on our digital business. And by closing weaker stores and monetizing some of our real estate where the redevelopment opportunities are significant, we will grow faster, and we will produce a higher return on invested capital. 
We have talked before about the ongoing need to reinvent our company, and that our industry, every 5 to 7 years, also needs to be reinvented in response to evolving customer shopping preferences and patterns. This is what you are seeing at work today at Macy's, Inc. 
Terry and Jeff are working closely with our management team and our board on the strategic progress needed to extend our long-standing role as a leader in fashion, innovation, value and convenience. 
As in previous times of reinvention, some big moves and tough decisions in the short term are necessary if we are to grow sales profitably for the longer term. We need to create value from our assets and manage our expenses prudently so that we can invest in the levers of growth. 
After a series of tough quarters, the distinct change in our sales trend in the second quarter has given our team encouragement. We have so many good ideas on the table. The biggest challenge will be prioritizing what we do, ensuring that we invest  appropriately for success and following the data to be sure that we are in sync with the customer.  Everyone here is onboard to implement our chosen strategies with passion and rigor. 
Retailing is changing; there's no doubt about it. Our company is committed to being tomorrow's leader in Omnichannel retailing. We will strike the right balance between stores and digital, and the closing of 100 locations will get us to where we think we need to be, all while maintaining a significant physical presence in virtually every major market across America. 
Fortunately, our company has the critical mass to offer all of the options that our customers want in terms of stores, websites and mobile apps; in terms of expedited shipping, Buy Online Pickup in Store and same-day delivery in many markets; in terms of offering a range of exclusive product choices, supported by great experiences that are the hallmarks of both Macy's and Bloomingdale's. So what you are seeing today is meaningful change in the making, and you will be hearing more as time goes on. 
I'll stop at this point and take whatever questions you may have."

Clearly, our view of the stores going forward will evolve, so I can't sit here today and paint what it's going to look like in 5 years. But as we do stores like Easton and Columbus, that gives you some insight into some of the things we're looking at. For example, a expanded active area that includes health and wellness more broadly. The way we've approached the bridal business at Easton, including having some wedding dresses available that you could buy in the store day of or not having to be preordered. Also, what we've done with beauty in Easton is really very exciting. So there's a lot of concepts. Fine jewelry, which we've talked about. We're experimenting with shoes. So I would say, almost throughout the store, we are looking for ways of improving both the assortment that we carry, making it more special, more exclusive to Macy's, which will attract not only millennials but also older customers as well. So I think you're going to see a lot of experimentation continue on that front. In terms of increase in service, one of the areas we've actually focused on this year has been ready-to-wear. And the reason for that is it's the category that also has to handle the most Internet returns, and so we wanted to make sure we had more staff there so that they were able to service customers that came in wanting to buy in addition to dealing with the returns that are going to obviously come from a growing digital business.

One, which we've always done, which is how is the store performing, and how do we expect it to perform in the future? And we project out cash flows and discount them back and compare that to the proceeds that we would get. So what you would expect to be a typical financial analysis. What we did this year, though, to supplement that is we went through and looked at all of our locations and evaluated them based on their strategic importance, which had to do with quality of the market, quality of the malls, the competition in the malls and the market, what was happening in terms of growth of income and population and all the markets and coverage that we would need to go forward, and ranked our stores in terms of long-term strategic importance. And so what we've done to come up with these 100 stores is married those 2. And in most cases, as you would imagine, a poorly located store is also an underperformer. And so for the most part, they were both of those. But it did lead us to accelerate some of the closings that, in prior years, we might not have done without that long-term evaluation of the strategic importance of the location. So that is most of the 100. There are a few additional locations, though, that have been included that are not strategically critical to the company based on that analysis. But where, from a redevelopment opportunity, we think there's a big opportunity. So in those cases, they're not underperformers, but that, long term, they're not critical to the Macy's footprint. And so we will be taking advantage of the real estate demand for those locations as well. But I would say most of them are both underperforming and not in good locations for the long term."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and other SEC filings. 
While second quarter sales and earnings were still below last year, we were pleased with the improvement in our sales trend during the quarter. Our comp sales performance on an owned plus licensed basis was much improved from the first quarter on both a 1- and on a 2-year basis and sets us up well for the remainder of the year. 
I will talk this morning first about the quarter and then our outlook for the second half of the year, and we'll also discuss the strategic announcements made today regarding our store portfolio and real estate opportunities. 
Sales in the second quarter were $5,866,000,000, down 4% from last year. On a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 2%. This compares to the 5.6% drop we experienced in the first quarter. 
On a 2-year basis, the first quarter was down 2.9% per year and the second quarter down 1.7%, representing a 1.2 point improvement in this trend. 
Both Macy's and Bloomingdale's experienced improvement in the second quarter. 
We would cite 4 key factors contributing to this trend change: One, weather has been hot this summer and has contributed to the strong apparel sales and perhaps more shopping in general as a way to avoid the heat. Two, international credit card sales were down 12% in the second quarter. This compares to a 20% drop in the first quarter. While they still negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter, it had less of an impact than it has had in recent quarters. As a result, our sales trend in the major tourist stores improved for both Macy's and Bloomingdale's in the quarter. Three, many of our sales-generating strategies are beginning to kick in: the investment in staffing in our best stores, our fine jewelry strategy, the Last Act clearance strategy and home store improvements. This is very encouraging. And four, a few strong promotional events and sharper pricing helped in the quarter as well, and we were able to structure these events to both drive sales and preserve our gross margin rate. 
The families of business that were strongest in the quarter included all of apparel, men's, women's and kids, as well as fine jewelry, shoes, fragrances, textiles and housewares. Handbags and fashion jewelry and watches continued to be weak. 
We are encouraged by the start of the back-to-school season. We are seeing strength in all categories, but are most excited by the strong trend in denim. 
Our private brands also helped fuel the quarter's improvement, particularly in women's apparel, shoes and home. This strength is great to see, given the importance of having great merchandise that can be found only at Macy's. 
Geographically, our Southwest region, which is primarily Southern California, had the strongest performance. 
Our digital business had a strong quarter again of double-digit growth both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We are benefiting from new releases on our mobile apps and other technology improvements that are driving increases in conversion. Our investments are focused on removing points of friction, and our Net Promoter Score has improved on our digital business 2 points year-over-year. 
For example, we've been able to auto-provision our customers' wallets to make it easier to use coupons and other promotional offers. We've also improved navigation to make it easier and faster to shop. 
The number of transactions in the quarter was down 5% versus last year, with average unit retail up 2.8% and a relatively flat units per transaction. This is slightly different from the first quarter when, as you remember, the number of transactions was down by more and the average unit retail not up by as much. The change in both of these metrics demonstrates the improved underlying trends in our business. 
Our Backstage stores are doing well in total, although performance by door is mixed, as you would expect from a new business. We are learning a lot about how to maximize this opportunity, with our focus being on the store-in-stores. We are encouraged by the early result. 
Bluemercury has had terrific new-store openings, including in Tribeca, Columbus Circle, East Hampton as well as their 100th store, which opened in Savannah, Georgia. We now have 103 Bluemercury stores, including 12 in our Macy's doors. We are optimistic that Bluemercury will contribute significantly to our beauty offering in our Macy's stores as well as in the freestanding locations. 
We are pleased with the early performance of our China joint venture, which is doing business through Tmall. We are learning both about the Chinese consumer and also how to do business there. It is too early to judge, but we are encouraged by what our small team has been able to accomplish in a very short time. 
Gross margin rate in the second quarter was 40.9%, flat with last year, which is better than we had expected. This resulted from our sales being stronger than expected and also from the success of our Last Act strategy for clearing end-of-season merchandise. We've now expanded Last Act beyond apparel areas, including, for example, to handbags, and we expect to convert shoes later this year. 
In total, our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 3.2% versus a year ago, and on a comp basis, inventory was down 1.5%. 
SG&A in the quarter was $2,026,000,000 or 34.5% of sales. This is $32 million or 1.6% below last year in the quarter, due primarily to $21 million in asset sale gains in the quarter versus none during the second quarter last year. The portion of the Brooklyn gain that was booked in the quarter was $11 million and gains on other asset sales were $10 million. 
We also benefited in the quarter from the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015, lower store expense due to last year's closings and lower retirement expense. Offsetting these positive factors were an increase in expense to support our digital growth and a reduction in credit income. 
Credit income in the quarter was $181 million, $14 million below last year, due primarily to lower credit sales. The penetration of our proprietary credit cards was approximately 47% in the second quarter, down about 80 basis points from last year but up over 100 basis points from 2014. 
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $260 million, about flat with last year. We booked $249 million in asset impairments and other costs primarily related to the expected closure of approximately 100 stores, which I will discuss with you in a few minutes. Settlement charges related to our retirement plans were $6 million in the quarter. 
Operating income after these charges was $117 million. Excluding asset impairments, settlement charges and the other costs, operating income was $372 million, 6.4% of sales. On this basis, it was 15% below last year. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $97 million, and tax expense, $11 million. Including the asset impairments, settlement charges and other costs, net income was $9 million. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million, relating to our China joint venture, so that net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $11 million. 
Net income attributable to Macy's shareholders in the quarter, excluding the asset impairments, settlement charges and other costs, was $168 million. 
Average share count on a diluted basis in the quarter was 311.3 million shares, down 9% from last year. We did not buy back any stock in the second quarter. We suspended the program in reaction to our disappointing first quarter. However, should current sales trends continue, we will consider resuming our stock buyback in the back half of the year. 
EPS on a diluted basis was $0.03. Excluding asset impairments and settlement charges, EPS in the quarter on a diluted basis was $0.54, which is down 16% on the same basis from last year. 
Cash flow before financing in the first half of the year was a positive $222 million this year as compared to a use of $217 million last year. And net cash provided from operating activities was $560 million as compared to $398 million last year, primarily due to the reduction in inventory. 
Net cash used by investing activities was $338 million, $277 million lower than last year, due primarily to last year's acquisition of Bluemercury as well as lower capital spending. 
We are still targeting capital spending of $900 million for the full year, which compares, as you know, to $1.1 billion last year. Cash used by financing activities was $331 million this year, $855 million less than last year, due primarily to the lower stock buyback as well as fewer option exercises. 
As we move to the back half of the year, we are encouraged by the recent business trends. Our annual sales guidance of minus 3% to minus 4% on a comp owned plus licensed basis feels achievable. 
The fall season would need to be minus 2.3% to minus 4.1% to hit that guidance. This compares to the minus 3.8% in the first half of the year. On a 2-year basis, the back half of the year would need to be minus 3.2% to minus 4.1% per year as compared to minus 2.3% in the spring season. 
We still expect the comp sales performance relative to last year to be worse in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter, largely due to the last-year comparisons. 
Our earnings per share guidance for the year remains at $3.15 to $3.40 for the full year. 
The only change in our key assumptions versus our prior earnings guidance is that we now expect the Brooklyn gain in fiscal 2016 to be approximately $36 million, which is $50 million less than what we had told you to expect when we gave guidance in February. The total gain associated with the Brooklyn transaction does not change. This is just timing due to delays in the project construction. 
We are comfortable at this point, though, covering this $0.10 a share of bad news within our prior guidance. 
As we have said, we are focusing on setting the company up for a comeback. And while we are very pleased with the improved sales trend, it does not change our feeling of urgency for making changes to better position Macy's and Bloomingdale's for the future. 
You will hear about these changes and our priorities as we move forward. Today's announcement is focused on our store portfolio and how we are strengthening it to position us best so that we can win over the longer term. 
As you know, we have a terrific portfolio of stores, with strong locations in almost every top mall in our markets as well as great freestanding stores, such as Herald Square, 59th Street and Union Square. We are in 49 of the top 50 U.S. markets based on population and 91 of the top 100. All of our stores, except a very few, are cash flow-positive, but not all of our stores fit today with our desired long-term retail footprint. 
While our weaker-performing and less well-located stores are cash flow-positive, many of these don't produce acceptable returns on investment and often don't represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand. And as we all know, market demographics change over time, and this country is over-stored, given evolving customer shopping habits. 
We decided to be proactive and to close a larger number of stores this year. This will bring the shopping experience to a consistently higher level and concentrates Macy's stores in locations with better potential. We believe we can benefit from rightsizing the company. This will force us to make necessary overhead reductions to preserve profitability and ongoing cash flow. And while it will shrink the company somewhat, these closings will positively impact our return on invested capital and help us to accelerate our growth. 
As you read in our press release this morning, we expect to close approximately 100 stores. We will not, however, lose representation in any of the top markets. Most of these stores will close around our fiscal year-end, but we will continue to operate some of these until we either sell the store or until leases or operating covenants either expire or can be amended or waived. 
Most of these stores are underperformers or in weak locations. However, we will also close a few stores because their desirability as a redevelopment opportunity exceeds their value to us as a retail store. 
While we can't be too precise until the actual store list and timing are finalized, our estimate is that if all of these closings happened at fiscal year-end 2016, they would negatively impact sales in 2017 by approximately $1 billion. But as I said earlier, we don't expect all to be closed at year-end, and so the impact on 2017 should be less. 
This potential sales loss is lower than the projected volume of these 100-roughly stores due to our ability to retain some of the sales in other stores as well as on Macy's.com. 
With the stores we've closed in recent years, we have greatly improved our ability to retain sales, both through new targeted marketing efforts and by trying to make sure that we add specific merchandise, categories and vendors that is in stores that are being closed into stores that are nearby. 
The desire to retain as many customers as we can and begin impacting assortment decisions for spring 2017 is why we are making this announcement so far in advance. 
These stores currently produce incremental EBITDA, but we are hoping to be able to offset this loss with cost reductions beyond the costs that come from closing these stores directly. We are working hard on strategies to reduce costs, consistent with both the downsizing of the company and also so that we can be more agile in making decisions going forward. 
At this point, we don't have details worked out, and we will discuss this with you more down the road. But as you know, our track record is very good in delivering expense reductions to which we commit. 
The preliminary list of possible closures resulted in our having to impair many of these assets now. These asset impairments are primarily what is responsible for the $249 million in total charges taken in the second quarter. 
One of the reasons we feel it is right to shrink to grow is the success we're beginning to have in our top doors. Our work with our top 150 doors gives us confidence that we can accelerate our growth in these strategically critical locations. We want to focus our financial resources and our talent to make this happen, along with fueling our digital growth. This will come from a combination of improved assortments, more technology, more and better customer service and more special events. 
The closing of approximately 100 stores is a big step and not one that we take lightly. We believe it is critical to reposition the company for the future, but that still doesn't make it easy. We will be respectful and open with our associates in these stores, and we'll try to minimize the impact on local communities by improving nearby stores and with our digital shopping venues. 
We also provided an update today on our pursuit of various opportunities to extract value from our real estate portfolio, consistent with our long-term store location strategy as well as our balance sheet leverage objectives. 
For some time now, we have been examining opportunities for 4 large downtown stores in major cities: Herald Square, Union Square, State Street in Chicago and Downtown Minneapolis. Today, we announced that we are currently in discussions with potential purchasers for our San Francisco Men's Store on Union Square. For those of you not familiar with San Francisco, we have a men's building as well as a main store, and what we're talking about is selling just the Men's Store; the main store would continue. 
This store would be redeveloped for alternative use, and our men's business would be recombined into our main Union Square store. 
While, today, it is currently one of the country's most successful Men's Stores, the value of the real estate appears to offer significant opportunity, and we believe we can recombine it with the main store and both preserve the strength of our offering and hopefully improve the main Union Square store as well. 
We continue to analyze possibilities for our Herald Square New York flagship store, Downtown Minneapolis and the upper floors of our State Street store in Downtown Chicago. 
In addition to these flagship stores, we have made progress in identifying underlying situations where the development or redevelopment of all or a part of our real estate holding exceeds the value of its existing use. We are developing and executing plans to move forward to capitalize on these opportunities. This will occur through sales of assets or portions thereof, some of which are included in the 100 closings, but it could also happen through joint ventures or strategic alliances. We are in early stages of discussions with various potential partners. 
We also continue to evaluate financial transactions such as sale leasebacks or joint ventures for locations that we expect to operate for many years. However, this is a low priority for us at present, given a combination of leverage as well as breakage or leakage that would result from debt repurchase, from taxes and from fees. 
While we know we have a lot of work ahead of us, we feel confident that we are on the right path. 
As I said earlier, closing stores is not something we take lightly, but we do believe it will enable us to focus more on our better stores and on our digital business. And by closing weaker stores and monetizing some of our real estate where the redevelopment opportunities are significant, we will grow faster, and we will produce a higher return on invested capital. 
We have talked before about the ongoing need to reinvent our company, and that our industry, every 5 to 7 years, also needs to be reinvented in response to evolving customer shopping preferences and patterns. This is what you are seeing at work today at Macy's, Inc. 
Terry and Jeff are working closely with our management team and our board on the strategic progress needed to extend our long-standing role as a leader in fashion, innovation, value and convenience. 
As in previous times of reinvention, some big moves and tough decisions in the short term are necessary if we are to grow sales profitably for the longer term. We need to create value from our assets and manage our expenses prudently so that we can invest in the levers of growth. 
After a series of tough quarters, the distinct change in our sales trend in the second quarter has given our team encouragement. We have so many good ideas on the table. The biggest challenge will be prioritizing what we do, ensuring that we invest appropriately for success and following the data to be sure that we are in sync with the customer. Everyone here is onboard to implement our chosen strategies with passion and rigor. 
Retailing is changing; there's no doubt about it. Our company is committed to being tomorrow's leader in Omnichannel retailing. We will strike the right balance between stores and digital, and the closing of 100 locations will get us to where we think we need to be, all while maintaining a significant physical presence in virtually every major market across America. 
Fortunately, our company has the critical mass to offer all of the options that our customers want in terms of stores, websites and mobile apps; in terms of expedited shipping, Buy Online, Pickup in Store and same-day delivery in many markets; in terms of offering a range of exclusive product choices, supported by great experiences that are the hallmarks of both Macy's and Bloomingdale's. So what you are seeing today is meaningful change in the making, and you will be hearing more as time goes on. 
I'll stop at this point and take whatever questions you may have."

So we feel great about the sustainability of the accelerated growth. And now it's in over 350 stores, with the remaining locations being rolled out next year. And the Phase 2 of the rollout is doing as well as the first phase did last year, so we feel great about that. Last Act continues to be very strong, helping both sales and margin. And Backstage, as I said, we're learning an awful lot about how to give value to the customer and perhaps how to both increase the share of wallet of our existing customers and also attract new customers to our doors.

So I would say, almost throughout the store, we are looking for ways of improving both the assortment that we carry, making it more special, more exclusive to Macy's, which will attract not only millennials but also older customers as well. So I think you're going to see a lot of experimentation continue on that front. In terms of increase in service, one of the areas we've actually focused on this year has been ready-to-wear. And the reason for that is it's the category that also has to handle the most Internet returns, and so we wanted to make sure we had more staff there so that they were able to service customers that came in wanting to buy in addition to dealing with the returns that are going to obviously come from a growing digital business. So that's one of the examples of where we've put increased staffing."

One, which we've always done, which is how is the store performing, and how do we expect it to perform in the future? And we project out cash flows and discount them back and compare that to the proceeds that we would get. So what you would expect to be a typical financial analysis. What we did this year, though, to supplement that is we went through and looked at all of our locations and evaluated them based on their strategic importance, which had to do with quality of the market, quality of the malls, the competition in the malls and the market, what was happening in terms of growth of income and population in all the markets and coverage that we would need to go forward, and ranked our stores in terms of long-term strategic importance. And so what we've done to come up with this 100 stores is married those 2. And in most cases, as you would imagine, a poorly located store is also an underperformer. And so for the most part, they were both of those. But it did lead us to accelerate some of the closings that, in prior years, we might not have done without that long-term evaluation of the strategic importance of the location. So that is most of the 100. There are a few additional locations, though, that have been included that are not strategically critical to the company based on that analysis. But where, from a redevelopment opportunity, we think there's a big opportunity. So in those cases, they're not underperformers, but that, long term, they're not critical to the Macy's footprint. And so we will be taking advantage of the real estate demand for those locations as well. But I would say most of them are both underperforming and not in good locations for the long term."

Keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the expectations and assumptions mentioned today due to a variety of factors that affect the company, including the risks specified in the company's most recently filed Form 10-K and other SEC filings. 
While second quarter sales and earnings were still below last year, we were pleased with the improvement in our sales trend during the quarter. Our comp sales performance on an owned plus licensed basis was much improved from the first quarter on both a 1- and on a 2-year basis and sets us up well for the remainder of the year. 
I will talk this morning first about the quarter and then our outlook for the second half of the year, and we'll also discuss the strategic announcements made today regarding our store portfolio and real estate opportunities. 
Sales in the second quarter were $5,866,000,000, down 4% from last year. On a comp owned plus licensed basis, sales were down 2%. This compares to the 5.6% drop we experienced in the first quarter. 
On a 2-year basis, the first quarter was down 2.9% per year and the second quarter down 1.7%, representing a 1.2 point improvement in this trend. 
Both Macy's and Bloomingdale's experienced improvement in the second quarter. 
We would cite 4 key factors contributing to this trend change: One, weather has been hot this summer and has contributed to the strong apparel sales and perhaps more shopping in general as a way to avoid the heat. Two, international credit card sales were down 12% in the second quarter. This compares to a 20% drop in the first quarter. While they still negatively impacted our comp sales by approximately 60 basis points in the second quarter, it had less of an impact than it has had in recent quarters. As a result, our sales trend in the major tourist stores improved for both Macy's and Bloomingdale's in the quarter. Three, many of our sales-generating strategies are beginning to kick in: the investment in staffing in our best stores, our fine jewelry strategy, the Last Act clearance strategy and home store improvements. This is very encouraging. And four, a few strong promotional events and sharper pricing helped in the quarter as well, and we were able to structure these events to both drive sales and preserve our gross margin rate. 
The families of business that were strongest in the quarter included all of apparel, men's, women's and kids, as well as fine jewelry, shoes, fragrances, textiles and housewares. Handbags and fashion jewelry and watches continued to be weak. 
We are encouraged by the start of the back-to-school season. We are seeing strength in all categories, but are most excited by the strong trend in denim. 
Our private brands also helped fuel the quarter's improvement, particularly in women's apparel, shoes and home. This strength is great to see, given the importance of having great merchandise that can be found only at Macy's. 
Geographically, our Southwest region, which is primarily Southern California, had the strongest performance. 
Our digital business had a strong quarter again of double-digit growth both at Macy's and at Bloomingdale's. We are benefiting from new releases on our mobile apps and other technology improvements that are driving increases in conversion. Our investments are focused on removing points of friction, and our Net Promoter Score has improved on our digital business 2 points year-over-year. 
For example, we've been able to auto-provision our customers' wallets to make it easier to use coupons and other promotional offers. We've also improved navigation to make it easier and faster to shop. 
The number of transactions in the quarter was down 5% versus last year, with average unit retail up 2.8% and a relatively flat units per transaction. This is slightly different from the first quarter when, as you remember, the number of transactions was down by more and the average unit retail not up by as much. The change in both of these metrics demonstrates the improved underlying trends in our business. 
Our Backstage stores are doing well in total, although performance by door is mixed, as you would expect from a new business. We are learning a lot about how to maximize this opportunity, with our focus being on the store-in-stores. We are encouraged by the early result. 
Bluemercury has had terrific new-store openings, including in Tribeca, Columbus Circle, East Hampton as well as their 100th store, which opened in Savannah, Georgia. We now have 103 Bluemercury stores, including 12 in our Macy's doors. We are optimistic that Bluemercury will contribute significantly to our beauty offering in our Macy's stores as well as in the freestanding locations. 
We are pleased with the early performance of our China joint venture, which is doing business through Tmall. We are learning both about the Chinese consumer and also how to do business there. It is too early to judge, but we are encouraged by what our small team has been able to accomplish in a very short time. 
Gross margin rate in the second quarter was 40.9%, flat with last year, which is better than we had expected. This resulted from our sales being stronger than expected and also from the success of our Last Act strategy for clearing end-of-season merchandise. We've now expanded Last Act beyond apparel areas, including, for example, to handbags, and we expect to convert shoes later this year. 
In total, our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 3.2% versus a year ago, and on a comp basis, inventory was down 1.5%. 
SG&A in the quarter was $2,026,000,000 or 34.5% of sales. This is $32 million or 1.6% below last year in the quarter, due primarily to $21 million in asset sale gains in the quarter versus none during the second quarter last year. The portion of the Brooklyn gain that was booked in the quarter was $11 million and gains on other asset sales were $10 million. 
We also benefited in the quarter from the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015, lower store expense due to last year's closings and lower retirement expense. Offsetting these positive factors were an increase in expense to support our digital growth and a reduction in credit income. 
Credit income in the quarter was $181 million, $14 million below last year, due primarily to lower credit sales. The penetration of our proprietary credit cards was approximately 47% in the second quarter, down about 80 basis points from last year but up over 100 basis points from 2014. 
Depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $260 million, about flat with last year. We booked $249 million in asset impairments and other costs primarily related to the expected closure of approximately 100 stores, which I will discuss with you in a few minutes. Settlement charges related to our retirement plans were $6 million in the quarter. 
Operating income after these charges was $117 million. Excluding asset impairments, settlement charges and the other costs, operating income was $372 million, 6.4% of sales. On this basis, it was 15% below last year. 
Interest expense in the quarter was $97 million, and tax expense, $11 million. Including the asset impairments, settlement charges and other costs, net income was $9 million. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was $2 million, relating to our China joint venture, so that net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $11 million. 
Net income attributable to Macy's shareholders in the quarter, excluding the asset impairments, settlement charges and other costs, was $168 million. 
Average share count on a diluted basis in the quarter was 311.3 million shares, down 9% from last year. We did not buy back any stock in the second quarter. We suspended the program in reaction to our disappointing first quarter. However, should current sales trends continue, we will consider resuming our stock buyback in the back half of the year. 
EPS on a diluted basis was $0.03. Excluding asset impairments and settlement charges, EPS in the quarter on a diluted basis was $0.54, which is down 16% on the same basis from last year. 
Cash flow before financing in the first half of the year was a positive $222 million this year as compared to a use of $217 million last year. And net cash provided from operating activities was $560 million as compared to $398 million last year, primarily due to the reduction in inventory. 
Net cash used by investing activities was $338 million, $277 million lower than last year, due primarily to last year's acquisition of Bluemercury as well as lower capital spending. 
We are still targeting capital spending of $900 million for the full year, which compares, as you know, to $1.1 billion last year. Cash used by financing activities was $331 million this year, $855 million less than last year, due primarily to the lower stock buyback as well as fewer option exercises. 
As we move to the back half of the year, we are encouraged by the recent business trends. Our annual sales guidance of minus 3% to minus 4% on a comp owned plus licensed basis feels achievable. 
The fall season would need to be minus 2.3% to minus 4.1% to hit that guidance. This compares to the minus 3.8% in the first half of the year. On a 2-year basis, the back half of the year would need to be minus 3.2% to minus 4.1% per year as compared to minus 2.3% in the spring season. 
We still expect the comp sales performance relative to last year to be worse in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter, largely due to the last-year comparisons. 
Our earnings per share guidance for the year remains at $3.15 to $3.40 for the full year. 
The only change in our key assumptions versus our prior earnings guidance is that we now expect the Brooklyn gain in fiscal 2016 to be approximately $36 million, which is $50 million less than what we had told you to expect when we gave guidance in February. The total gain associated with the Brooklyn transaction does not change. This is just timing due to delays in the project construction. 
We are comfortable at this point, though, covering this $0.10 a share of bad news within our prior guidance. 
As we have said, we are focusing on setting the company up for a comeback. And while we are very pleased with the improved sales trend, it does not change our feeling of urgency for making changes to better position Macy's and Bloomingdale's for the future. 
You will hear about these changes and our priorities as we move forward. Today's announcement is focused on our store portfolio and how we are strengthening it to position us best so that we can win over the longer term. 
As you know, we have a terrific portfolio of stores, with strong locations in almost every top mall in our markets as well as great freestanding stores, such as Herald Square, 59th Street and Union Square. We are in 49 of the top 50 U.S. markets based on population and 91 of the top 100. All of our stores, except a very few, are cash flow-positive, but not all of our stores fit today with our desired long-term retail footprint. 
While our weaker-performing and less well-located stores are cash flow-positive, many of these don't produce acceptable returns on investment and often don't represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand. And as we all know, market demographics change over time, and this country is over-stored, given evolving customer shopping habits. 
We decided to be proactive and to close a larger number of stores this year. This will bring the shopping experience to a consistently higher level and concentrates Macy's stores in locations with better potential. We believe we can benefit from rightsizing the company. This will force us to make necessary overhead reductions to preserve profitability and ongoing cash flow. And while it will shrink the company somewhat, these closings will positively impact our return on invested capital and help us to accelerate our growth. 
As you read in our press release this morning, we expect to close approximately 100 stores. We will not, however, lose representation in any of the top markets. Most of these stores will close around our fiscal year-end, but we will continue to operate some of these until we either sell the store or until leases or operating covenants either expire or can be amended or waived. 
Most of these stores are underperformers or in weak locations. However, we will also close a few stores because their desirability as a redevelopment opportunity exceeds their value to us as a retail store. 
While we can't be too precise until the actual store list and timing are finalized, our estimate is that if all of these closings happened at fiscal year-end 2016, they would negatively impact sales in 2017 by approximately $1 billion. But as I said earlier, we don't expect all to be closed at year-end, and so the impact on 2017 should be less. 
This potential sales loss is lower than the projected volume of these 100-roughly stores due to our ability to retain some of the sales in other stores as well as on Macy's.com. 
With the stores we've closed in recent years, we have greatly improved our ability to retain sales, both through new targeted marketing efforts and by trying to make sure that we add specific merchandise, categories and vendors that is in stores that are being closed into stores that are nearby. 
The desire to retain as many customers as we can and begin impacting assortment decisions for spring 2017 is why we are making this announcement so far in advance. 
These stores currently produce incremental EBITDA, but we are hoping to be able to offset this loss with cost reductions beyond the costs that come from closing these stores directly. We are working hard on strategies to reduce costs, consistent with both the downsizing of the company and also so that we can be more agile in making decisions going forward. 
At this point, we don't have details worked out, and we will discuss this with you more down the road. But as you know, our track record is very good in delivering expense reductions to which we commit. 
The preliminary list of possible closures resulted in our having to impair many of these assets now. These asset impairments are primarily what is responsible for the $249 million in total charges taken in the second quarter. 
One of the reasons we feel it is right to shrink to grow is the success we're beginning to have in our top doors. Our work with our top 150 doors gives us confidence that we can accelerate our growth in these strategically critical locations. We want to focus our financial resources and our talent to make this happen, along with fueling our digital growth. This will come from a combination of improved assortments, more technology, more and better customer service and more special events. 
The closing of approximately 100 stores is a big step and not one that we take lightly. We believe it is critical to reposition the company for the future, but that still doesn't make it easy. We will be respectful and open with our associates in these stores, and we'll try to minimize the impact on local communities by improving nearby stores and with our digital shopping venues. 
We also provided an update today on our pursuit of various opportunities to extract value from our real estate portfolio, consistent with our long-term store location strategy as well as our balance sheet leverage objectives. 
For some time now, we have been examining opportunities for 4 large downtown stores in major cities: Herald Square, Union Square, State Street in Chicago and Downtown Minneapolis. Today, we announced that we are currently in discussions with potential purchasers for our San Francisco Men's Store on Union Square. For those of you not familiar with San Francisco, we have a men's building as well as a main store, and what we're talking about is selling just the Men's Store; the main store would continue. 
This store would be redeveloped for alternative use, and our men's business would be recombined into our main Union Square store. 
While, today, it is currently one of the country's most successful Men's Stores, the value of the real estate appears to offer significant opportunity, and we believe we can recombine it with the main store and both preserve the strength of our offering and hopefully improve the main Union Square store as well. 
We continue to analyze possibilities for our Herald Square New York flagship store, Downtown Minneapolis and the upper floors of our State Street store in Downtown Chicago. 
In addition to these flagship stores, we have made progress in identifying underlying situations where the development or redevelopment of all or a part of our real estate holding exceeds the value of its existing use. We are developing and executing plans to move forward to capitalize on these opportunities. This will occur through sales of assets or portions thereof, some of which are included in the 100 closings, but it could also happen through joint ventures or strategic alliances. We are in early stages of discussions with various potential partners. 
We also continue to evaluate financial transactions such as sale leasebacks or joint ventures for locations that we expect to operate for many years. However, this is a low priority for us at present, given a combination of leverage as well as breakage or leakage that would result from debt repurchase, from taxes and from fees. 
While we know we have a lot of work ahead of us, we feel confident that we are on the right path. 
As I said earlier, closing stores is not something we take lightly, but we do believe it will enable us to focus more on our better stores and on our digital business. And by closing weaker stores and monetizing some of our real estate where the redevelopment opportunities are significant, we will grow faster, and we will produce a higher return on invested capital. 
We have talked before about the ongoing need to reinvent our company, and that our industry, every 5 to 7 years, also needs to be reinvented in response to evolving customer shopping preferences and patterns. This is what you are seeing at work today at Macy's, Inc. 
Terry and Jeff are working closely with our management team and our board on the strategic progress needed to extend our long-standing role as a leader in fashion, innovation, value and convenience. 
As in previous times of reinvention, some big moves and tough decisions in the short term are necessary if we are to grow sales profitably for the longer term. We need to create value from our assets and manage our expenses prudently so that we can invest in the levers of growth. 
After a series of tough quarters, the distinct change in our sales trend in the second quarter has given our team encouragement. We have so many good ideas on the table. The biggest challenge will be prioritizing what we do, ensuring that we invest appropriately for success and following the data to be sure that we are in sync with the customer. Everyone here is onboard to implement our chosen strategies with passion and rigor. 
Retailing is changing; there's no doubt about it. Our company is committed to being tomorrow's leader in Omnichannel retailing. We will strike the right balance between stores and digital, and the closing of 100 locations will get us to where we think we need to be, all while maintaining a significant physical presence in virtually every major market across America. 
Fortunately, our company has the critical mass to offer all of the options that our customers want in terms of stores, websites and mobile apps; in terms of expedited shipping, Buy Online, Pickup in Store and same-day delivery in many markets; in terms of offering a range of exclusive product choices, supported by great experiences that are the hallmarks of both Macy's and Bloomingdale's. So what you are seeing today is meaningful change in the making, and you will be hearing more as time goes on. 
I'll stop at this point and take whatever questions you may have."

Clearly, our view of the stores going forward will evolve, so I can't sit here today and paint what it's going to look like in 5 years. But as we do stores like Easton and Columbus, that gives you some insight into some of the things we're looking at. For example, an expanded active area that includes health and wellness more broadly. The way we've approached the bridal business at Easton, including having some wedding dresses available that you could buy in the store day of or not having to be preordered. Also, what we've done with beauty in Easton is really very exciting. So there's a lot of concepts. Fine jewelry, which we've talked about. We're experimenting with shoes. So I would say, almost throughout the store, we are looking for ways of improving both the assortment that we carry, making it more special, more exclusive to Macy's, which will attract not only millennials but also older customers as well. So I think you're going to see a lot of experimentation continue on that front. In terms of increase in service, one of the areas we've actually focused on this year has been ready-to-wear. And the reason for that is it's the category that also has to handle the most Internet returns, and so we wanted to make sure we had more staff there so that they were able to service customers that came in wanting to buy in addition to dealing with the returns that are going to obviously come from a growing digital business.

One, which we've always done, which is how is the store performing, and how do we expect it to perform in the future? And we project out cash flows and discount them back and compare that to the proceeds that we would get. So what you would expect to be a typical financial analysis. What we did this year, though, to supplement that is we went through and looked at all of our locations and evaluated them based on their strategic importance, which had to do with quality of the market, quality of the malls, the competition in the malls and the market, what was happening in terms of growth of income and population in all the markets and coverage that we would need to go forward, and ranked our stores in terms of long-term strategic importance. And so what we've done to come up with this 100 stores is married those 2. And in most cases, as you would imagine, a poorly located store is also an underperformer. And so for the most part, they were both of those. But it did lead us to accelerate some of the closings that, in prior years, we might not have done without that long-term evaluation of the strategic importance of the location. So that is most of the 100. There are a few additional locations, though, that have been included that are not strategically critical to the company based on that analysis. But where, from a redevelopment opportunity, we think there's a big opportunity. So in those cases, they're not underperformers, but that, long term, they're not critical to the Macy's footprint. And so we will be taking advantage of the real estate demand for those locations as well. But I would say most of them are both underperforming and not in good locations for the long term."

We are pleased with our third quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations. As we have said all year, we are in the process of setting ourselves up for a comeback, and we remain on that path. We are on track to deliver our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.40 and we are increasing our sales guidance to an annual decline of 2.5% to 3% on an owned plus licensed basis versus our prior guidance of minus 3% to minus 4%. And in addition to feeling good about our operating performance, we're also pleased by the progress we've made on the real estate front. We'll talk more about this later.
So let's start with some commentary on the third quarter. I'll then update you on our progress with our real estate strategy, talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and then end by taking your questions.
Sales in the third quarter were $5,626,000,000, down 4.2% from last year and down 2.7% on a comp owned plus licensed basis. Our growth strategies are beginning to gain traction in our top doors and in key areas such as fine jewelry, shoes and home, plus we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our apparel businesses: Men's, women's and kids. We were pleased that the performance improved for many of our major apparel brands during the quarter, including our exclusive brands such as INC and Tommy Hilfiger. We also saw strength in shoes, fragrances and soft home, which includes textiles, tabletop and housewares. These trends are offsetting some of the weakness in handbags, cosmetics and fashion watches. It actually was encouraging that our fashion watch trend did improve as our expanded tech watch assortment hit our stores and website late in the quarter, including products from brands like Apple and Michael Kors. The category trends were generally similar at both Macy's and Bloomingdale’s.
Our digital business had another strong quarter, with double-digit gains at both macys.com and bloomingdales.com.
Geographically, our business was strongest throughout the West.
International tourist sales stabilized during the quarter and were down in line with the rest of our sales. As a result, the international tourist business did not have a meaningful impact on our sales in total, although it still represented a headwind for our major international tourist stores for both Bloomingdale’s and Macy's.
Average unit retail increased 3.5% in the third quarter, which is great news. This compares to a 1.6% increase in the first half of the year. This helped to offset the impact of 6% fewer transactions in the third quarter. This was the same reduction in transactions as we saw in the first half of the year.
As we discussed after the second quarter, we continue to be optimistic about Bluemercury as well as our Backstage shops within our Macy's stores. In the fourth quarter, we are testing putting Backstage pop-up apparel shops in approximately 45 Macy's stores, with merchandise being procured by our Backstage team. This merchandise will be put adjacent to our Last Act clearance areas and, like Last Act, will be coupon-free.
In addition, in 13 of these stores, we're also adding some new categories of merchandise being procured by the Backstage team, including toys, home decor and queue products. Those are the items you often see as you're waiting to check out at various retailers. We've put this queue product adjacent to the highest traffic POS locations in these 13 stores. We think these could end up being additive to many of our Macy's locations.
We also remain encouraged by the learnings and progress being made in China. Not only are we developing a potentially large high-growth business, but, as importantly, we are learning about ways we could improve our digital business in the United States as well as how we could assort our stores and websites to better serve the Chinese consumer, whether living in the U.S. or traveling here.
Gross margin rate in the third quarter was 39.8%, equal to a year ago. We are very pleased with this performance. It reflects the benefit of lower inventory levels and the impact of our Last Act clearance strategy.
At the end of the quarter, comparable inventory was down approximately 3%. This gives us great liquidity, providing us the flexibility to react to trends during the fourth quarter.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,071,000,000, up 5.2% versus last year. Much of this increase is related to lower asset sale gains this year. We recognized $41 million of these gains in the third quarter this year, which compares to $78 million last year. As you know, asset sales will be lumpy by quarter and are hard to forecast. Most of the gains in the quarter this year relate to the transaction announced last week with General Growth Properties as well as the $9 million booked relating to the Brooklyn transaction in the quarter. If you exclude these gains in both years, SG&A dollars were up 3.2%. This is consistent with what we expected, but I suspect it may seem high to you given our performance earlier in the year.
We continue to benefit from both the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015 and also the store closures, but these benefits are being more than offset by other increases, including selling, where we are investing in our key locations as well as in the strategic families of business I mentioned earlier. This staffing is supporting our growth strategies and incorporates the Omnichannel activities that we now ask our store associates to perform. This investment is resulting in improved customer service scores and we do expect higher sales, albeit on a lagged basis.
We're also continuing to invest in digital growth as well as in our Bluemercury China and Backstage initiatives.
And our earnings from credit were $165 million in the third quarter, which is $12 million lower than a year ago. Our overall sales reduction hurts our credit income and this was magnified by a reduction in the usage of our proprietary card. Proprietary card penetration was still very high in the third quarter at 48.5%, but it was 80 basis points lower than a year ago. The lower credit sales combined with slightly lower portfolio yields continue to negatively impact the income produced relative to a year ago. Having said that, our credit portfolio continues to be very strong in terms of its return on assets.
Operating income in the quarter, excluding settlement charge related to our retirement plans, was $169 million. The noncash settlement charges in the quarter were $62 million on a pretax basis or $0.12 per share after tax. Interest expense was $81 million; tax expense, $11 million. So net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $17 million. Excluding settlement charges and impairments from both years, net profit was $54 million this year, down from last year's $186 million.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 310.6 million shares. Earnings per share were $0.05 this quarter as compared to $0.36 last year. Excluding settlement and impairment charges, earnings were $0.17 per share in the quarter this year, down from $0.56 per share last year. And while well below a year ago, this performance is consistent with our expectations and the annual guidance which we had provided.
For the 9 months of this year, cash provided by operating activities was $308 million, which is $30 million higher than a year ago. This is primarily due to the reduction in inventory net of payables which resulted from our store closings and our efforts to improve inventory turnover. And as you heard earlier, this reduction in inventory is helping not only our cash, but also our gross margin rate and potentially our sales as well.
Cash used by investing activities was $491 million this year, $370 million lower than last year. This is due to $159 million lower capital spending, higher proceeds of our asset sales and last year's acquisition of Bluemercury. Therefore, our cash flow before financing activities is $400 million above last year.
We did resume our stock buyback in the quarter, buying back 3 million shares, utilizing $108 million of cash. And year-to-date, we have bought back 6 million shares for $238 million.
At the end of the quarter, we had accessed the commercial paper market for $52 million, which was a lower amount than we had anticipated. And we expect to be out of the short-term debt market by early December following a $577 million debt maturity payment on December 1.
With the strong cash flow and the proceeds from asset sales expected in the coming months, many of you are asking about how we plan to utilize this cash. As you know, we always start with funding our business needs. We then look to utilize excess cash for returns to our shareholders through our dividend and through repurchasing stock. We may also repurchase debt at some point to help make sure that our credit ratios get back to within our targeted range in a reasonable amount of time.
We are currently above our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 2.8. This ratio was 3.3 at the end of the third quarter on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Remember that, that does include the weak fourth quarter last year. But we will look at the balance sheet and the ratios at year-end in conjunction with our plan for the next few years before we make any decisions on our future utilization of excess cash.
In addition to our as-expected operating results in the quarter, we made a great deal of progress on real estate. Our real estate strategy can be divided into 3 parts. The first is our flagship assets, which, as you know, we have defined as Herald Square in New York, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago and our downtown Minneapolis store.
We have signed a contract to sell our Union Square Men's building. This separate building is approximately 250,000 square feet and we are selling it for approximately $250 million. We expect this transaction to close in January. We will utilize a part of the proceeds to consolidate our men's merchandise back into the main Union Square store and to make it an even more exciting shopping experience. We will be leasing the Men's building back for 2 to 3 years as we complete this construction. We will receive the cash for this transaction in January when it closes, but under GAAP, we will not be booking the approximately $235 million gain until January of 2018.
We also are continuing to explore options for downtown Minneapolis, Chicago and Herald Square. Of the 3, we expect Herald Square will take the longest to determine the best approach for potentially creating value, given its size and complexity.
The second component of our real estate strategy relates to the approximately 100 stores we intend to close. As we discussed last quarter, most of these are underperforming stores and are less critical to our footprint, but a few represent opportunities where we believe the real estate value exceeds the value as a retail entity.
We announced today that we have a signed contract to sell our downtown Portland store. This transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter with proceeds of approximately $54 million and a book gain of approximately $36 million. This store will be closed in early 2017.
Additionally, as you saw last week, we sold 5 locations to GGP for a total of $48 million. One of these stores has already closed, 3 will close in early 2017 and we will continue to leaseback and operate Tysons Galleria while GGP determines the best use for this property.
There are also 2 other stores that we will be closing, Douglaston in New York and Lancaster Mall in Salem, Oregon. These are being closed based on the timing of lease terminations and expirations.
So in total, as of today, we have closed or announced plans to close 8 stores as part of the 100 stores discussed last quarter, with Tysons Galleria being sold in leaseback. We are working on many other transactions like these for the locations that we believe we should close. While Eastdil Secured continues to advise us on the flagship properties and other significant assets, we have also now engaged CBRE to help facilitate the disposition of the majority of our closed or to-be-closed locations.
That brings us to the third component of our real estate strategy, which is to create value from our remaining real estate portfolio. Macy's has real estate assets with significant value creation opportunities, but we recognize that realizing these opportunities will often require alternative uses for the property and some amount of related development.
We sought out a world-class partner with both capital and strong platform capabilities to help us with this component of our strategy, and we found this in Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield is one of the leading global investors in real estate spanning all major sectors: Office, multifamily, hospitality and retail, particularly regional malls.
As you can imagine, there was tremendous interest among real estate investors to partner with Macy's. We are very excited about the potential of this alliance. We believe that the potential risk-adjusted value from pursuing this path on these assets could be significantly higher than the outright sales today.
We have kept this alliance as simple as we could. In short, we are giving Brookfield an exclusive right for up to 24 months to create a predevelopment plan on each of approximately 50 assets that are initially included in this agreement. We have the option to add additional assets to this alliance in the future. These to-be-redeveloped assets are a combination of stores, portions of stores and outparcels, both adjacent to our stores and, in some cases, in our parking fields. While we might close stores in some of these locations, it is more likely that we will create value with surplus land or through improvements alongside an existing store. The locations initially chosen are varied in their quality. These are just not all our A-mall locations. This should give us insight into the potential of our total portfolio. And in most cases, the assets that we initially have selected are not in malls with the major owners. 
Potential redevelopments in these strategic alliance can range to what we would call modest do more substantial opportunities, and we'll factor in feasibility as well as impact on store operations. On the modest side, Macy's has successfully done this ourselves. For example, adding restaurants within the Bloomingdale’s and South Coast Plaza in Southern California or putting in a Louis Vuitton shop outside our flagship store in Union Square in San Francisco. The great thing, though, about this alliance is that it allows us to keep our focus as a top retailer while optimizing our real estate, doing it in scale and potentially thinking much bigger. And a hypothetical example of a more substantial redevelopment opportunity could be the following: Take an 8-acre standalone 100,000 square-foot furniture store. One idea might be to move the furniture operations back into a nearby Macy's mall location, demolish the furniture store and then densify the site with a newly built, for example, 100,000 square foot of retail, a new parking garage and a mid-rise residential tower. Brookfield will clearly help us think big and then will help us execute redevelopment opportunities more quickly. 
So as a first step with this alliance, we and a dedicated team at Brookfield will work together to assess the feasibility of the development of assets. Once a plan for a particular asset is developed, Macy's will have the ability to proceed or not to redevelop this asset. If we choose to redevelop the asset, the property will then be contributed into redevelopment joint ventures. Macy's can then at that point decide to take a cash settlement or contribute and participate in the redevelopment joint venture. And if we stay in as a partner on the joint venture, it is likely that upon stabilization, the redevelopment project would be sold and then profits distributed. We are very excited by this alliance and look forward to starting the work. We believe that having this single significant partnership will align interest and improve both communication and execution as compared to working with separate developers for each opportunity. Terry, Jeff and I have confidence that Brookfield's senior management is committed to making this alliance successful, and they share our optimism about the potential. We will continue to update you as we move forward on all 3 of these components of our real estate strategy. Our real estate team, along with our advisers, are doing a terrific job maximizing opportunities in our portfolio in a thoughtful way while balancing the desire to move quickly. 
Let's now move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. The trend improvements relative to the spring season that we saw in the third quarter, combined with a more normal weather patterns, stabilization and international tourists sales and the mix benefit of the higher proportion of digital sales that happen in the holiday season, make us confidence that we will be able to deliver and improved comp owned plus licensed sales trend in the fourth quarter. We are expecting comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis to be down approximately 0.5% to down 2% in the quarter. And we are expecting at least a 100 basis point improvement in the gross margin rate this year in the fourth quarter. Given our inventory position and our Last Act strategy, we believe this to be achievable. Remember, last year, our gross margin rate dropped 290 basis points versus 2014, so we do have a lot of room to improve. 
SG&A is expected to be up over last year in both dollars and rate in the fourth quarter. The investments in growth will continue, and we expect the income to be worse than last year by approximately $50 million to $60 million in the quarter. We recognize the expense investments needed to support our growth initiatives is not insignificant, and we are very focused on identifying opportunities for profit improvement in 2017, including decreasing our non-payroll spend, improving the efficiency of our store operations and making sure we are structured to be both agile and cost-effective. We don't have any specifics to report at this time, but know that this is an important part of our set up for our comeback. Also, we are experiencing an additional delay in the construction of Brooklyn, and as a result, the timing for booking of the gain is getting delayed more into 2017 and 2018. We now expect to book only $27 million this year. This is $59 million or $0.12 per share lower than what we expected early in 2016 when we originally gave earnings guidance. While not insignificant, we remain comfortable that we can cover this shortfall and are sticking with our earnings guidance. But not changing guidance is actually a $0.12 per share increase in our expectations from operations. In the fourth quarter, we expect to book a $4 million gain associated with Brooklyn. We are also anticipating other non-flagship asset sales, including the Portland gain of approximately $100 million, which will take our annual number to approximately $150 million, which is consistent with the guidance at the start of the year. As you can tell, we are expecting quite a few transactions to close over the next few months. 
Depreciation and amortization for the year is now estimated at approximately $1,055,000,000. We are still tracking to our guidance for capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year. We expect interest expense of roughly $365 million and still the effective annual tax rate of approximately 37%. All of these assumptions support our guidance for our setup year. 
Our top management team here at Macy's is stronger than ever. The combination of some very experienced executive and recently added talent is very powerful. The new senior executives bring important capabilities and experiences to the team, complementing those of us with deep history with the company. We are all energized by the new perspective and know that this will have a positive impact on the business going forward. As we outlined today, our organization is focused on doing all that we can to execute our strategies and drive the strong performance that will lead to a successful fourth quarter and improve results in 2017 and beyond. We head into the holidays with some momentum of some positive trends and with optimism in our assortments and marketing strategies. We have a lot of distinctive product and newness in our stores for holiday, and we feel great that our customer proposition is compelling, including our new Brookstone shop; our investment in the Tech watch business, including Apple and Michael Kors; and our new holiday arcade full of wonderful gift ideas. We love this time of year. Macy's is the destination for great holiday gift giving, and we are uniquely equipped to deliver the complete experience, great product, best-in-class all-digital capability and the store animation and holiday traditions that are so cherished by customers across the country.

We actually had said earlier in the year that we expected it to be flattish, not down. I think, now the year will be slightly up.

The credit performance has been worse than we had expected, so that's one piece of the reason for the increase. Still a very strong profitability, but with credit sales declining, harder to keep the credit income dollars. And as we've said, we are investing in some of these growth initiatives, which are great from a bottom line perspective, but do add to expense. So I would say, focus on the annual as you're thinking about SG&A and not necessarily the fall season. The other thing I would say to you is that we continue to want to keep investing in these growth initiatives, so we are looking really deep to find additional SG&A reductions that, as I said, either are low-hanging fruit if there are such things at this point, but also trying to make the organization more cost effective, more agile and things like that. So it's sort of a combined message, but I don't think on an annual basis, we're going to be that far different from what we had said at the start of the year."

Even if they end up buying online from our app, they still experience of the store. And so I think, both of those will allow us to always compete effectively against an Amazon. It doesn't mean that an Amazon won't do a lot of business. I'm not saying that. But I think, in the category-ing that we carry, most of them, I do think that the Omnichannel is the benefit and the quality of our merchant team, both in terms of our private brands, our MMG team is spectacular and developing product that will only be available at Macy's will be a piece of that as well. And also given the customers, frankly, that you can only get at Macy's. So it's a combination of those factors that, I think, will enable us to compete effectively against an Amazon. In terms of the traffic and transactions, that's obviously a harder thing to predict, and that's partly why we're so happy to see the AUR doing well with our inventory levels and clearance strategy working. So I think, we'll do everything we can to grow the number of transactions, but I don't think we'll count on that as we go into next year."

We are pleased with our third quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations. As we have said all year, we are in the process of setting ourselves up for a comeback, and we remain on that path. We are on track to deliver our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.40 and we are increasing our sales guidance to an annual decline of 2.5% to 3% on an owned plus licensed basis versus our prior guidance of minus 3% to minus 4%. And in addition to feeling good about our operating performance, we're also pleased by the progress we've made on the real estate front. We'll talk more about this later.
So let's start with some commentary on the third quarter. I'll then update you on our progress with our real estate strategy, talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and then end by taking your questions.
Sales in the third quarter were $5,626,000,000, down 4.2% from last year and down 2.7% on a comp owned plus licensed basis. Our growth strategies are beginning to gain traction in our top doors and in key areas such as fine jewelry, shoes and home, plus we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our apparel businesses: Men's, women's and kids. We were pleased that the performance improved for many of our major apparel brands during the quarter, including our exclusive brands such as INC and Tommy Hilfiger. We also saw strength in shoes, fragrances and soft home, which includes textiles, tabletop and housewares. These trends are offsetting some of the weakness in handbags, cosmetics and fashion watches. It actually was encouraging that our fashion watch trend did improve as our expanded tech watch assortment hit our stores and website late in the quarter, including products from brands like Apple and Michael Kors. The category trends were generally similar at both Macy's and Bloomingdale’s.
Our digital business had another strong quarter, with double-digit gains at both macys.com and bloomingdales.com.
Geographically, our business was strongest throughout the West.
International tourist sales stabilized during the quarter and were down in line with the rest of our sales. As a result, the international tourist business did not have a meaningful impact on our sales in total, although it still represented a headwind for our major international tourist stores for both Bloomingdale’s and Macy's.
Average unit retail increased 3.5% in the third quarter, which is great news. This compares to a 1.6% increase in the first half of the year. This helped to offset the impact of 6% fewer transactions in the third quarter. This was the same reduction in transactions as we saw in the first half of the year.
As we discussed after the second quarter, we continue to be optimistic about Bluemercury as well as our Backstage shops within our Macy's stores. In the fourth quarter, we are testing putting Backstage pop-up apparel shops in approximately 45 Macy's stores, with merchandise being procured by our Backstage team. This merchandise will be put adjacent to our Last Act clearance areas and, like Last Act, will be coupon-free.
In addition, in 13 of these stores, we're also adding some new categories of merchandise being procured by the Backstage team, including toys, home decor and queue products. Those are the items you often see as you're waiting to check out at various retailers. We've put this queue product adjacent to the highest traffic POS locations in these 13 stores. We think these could end up being additive to many of our Macy's locations.
We also remain encouraged by the learnings and progress being made in China. Not only are we developing a potentially large high-growth business, but, as importantly, we are learning about ways we could improve our digital business in the United States as well as how we could assort our stores and websites to better serve the Chinese consumer, whether living in the U.S. or traveling here.
Gross margin rate in the third quarter was 39.8%, equal to a year ago. We are very pleased with this performance. It reflects the benefit of lower inventory levels and the impact of our Last Act clearance strategy.
At the end of the quarter, comparable inventory was down approximately 3%. This gives us great liquidity, providing us the flexibility to react to trends during the fourth quarter.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,071,000,000, up 5.2% versus last year. Much of this increase is related to lower asset sale gains this year. We recognized $41 million of these gains in the third quarter this year, which compares to $78 million last year. As you know, asset sales will be lumpy by quarter and are hard to forecast. Most of the gains in the quarter this year relate to the transaction announced last week with General Growth Properties as well as the $9 million booked relating to the Brooklyn transaction in the quarter. If you exclude these gains in both years, SG&A dollars were up 3.2%. This is consistent with what we expected, but I suspect it may seem high to you given our performance earlier in the year.
We continue to benefit from both the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015 and also the store closures, but these benefits are being more than offset by other increases, including selling, where we are investing in our key locations as well as in the strategic families of business I mentioned earlier. This staffing is supporting our growth strategies and incorporates the omnichannel activities that we now ask our store associates to perform. This investment is resulting in improved customer service scores and we do expect higher sales, albeit on a lagged basis.
We're also continuing to invest in digital growth as well as in our Bluemercury China and Backstage initiatives.
And our earnings from credit were $165 million in the third quarter, which is $12 million lower than a year ago. Our overall sales reduction hurts our credit income and this was magnified by a reduction in the usage of our proprietary card. Proprietary card penetration was still very high in the third quarter at 48.5%, but it was 80 basis points lower than a year ago. The lower credit sales combined with slightly lower portfolio yields continue to negatively impact the income produced relative to a year ago. Having said that, our credit portfolio continues to be very strong in terms of its return on assets.
Operating income in the quarter, excluding settlement charge related to our retirement plans, was $169 million. The noncash settlement charges in the quarter were $62 million on a pretax basis or $0.12 per share after tax. Interest expense was $81 million; tax expense, $11 million. So net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $17 million. Excluding settlement charges and impairments from both years, net profit was $54 million this year, down from last year's $186 million.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 310.6 million shares. Earnings per share were $0.05 this quarter as compared to $0.36 last year. Excluding settlement and impairment charges, earnings were $0.17 per share in the quarter this year, down from $0.56 per share last year. And while well below a year ago, this performance is consistent with our expectations and the annual guidance which we had provided.
For the 9 months of this year, cash provided by operating activities was $308 million, which is $30 million higher than a year ago. This is primarily due to the reduction in inventory net of payables which resulted from our store closings and our efforts to improve inventory turnover. And as you heard earlier, this reduction in inventory is helping not only our cash, but also our gross margin rate and potentially our sales as well.
Cash used by investing activities was $491 million this year, $370 million lower than last year. This is due to $159 million lower capital spending, higher proceeds of our asset sales and last year's acquisition of Bluemercury. Therefore, our cash flow before financing activities is $400 million above last year.
We did resume our stock buyback in the quarter, buying back 3 million shares, utilizing $108 million of cash. And year-to-date, we have bought back 6 million shares for $238 million.
At the end of the quarter, we had accessed the commercial paper market for $52 million, which was a lower amount than we had anticipated. And we expect to be out of the short-term debt market by early December following a $577 million debt maturity payment on December 1.
With the strong cash flow and the proceeds from asset sales expected in the coming months, many of you are asking about how we plan to utilize this cash. As you know, we always start with funding our business needs. We then look to utilize excess cash for returns to our shareholders through our dividend and through repurchasing stock. We may also repurchase debt at some point to help make sure that our credit ratios get back to within our targeted range in a reasonable amount of time.
We are currently above our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 2.8. This ratio was 3.3 at the end of the third quarter on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Remember that, that does include the weak fourth quarter last year. But we will look at the balance sheet and the ratios at year-end in conjunction with our plan for the next few years before we make any decisions on our future utilization of excess cash.
In addition to our as-expected operating results in the quarter, we made a great deal of progress on real estate. Our real estate strategy can be divided into 3 parts. The first is our flagship assets, which, as you know, we have defined as Herald Square in New York, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago and our downtown Minneapolis store.
We have signed a contract to sell our Union Square Men's building. This separate building is approximately 250,000 square feet and we are selling it for approximately $250 million. We expect this transaction to close in January. We will utilize a part of the proceeds to consolidate our men's merchandise back into the main Union Square store and to make it an even more exciting shopping experience. We will be leasing the Men's building back for 2 to 3 years as we complete this construction. We will receive the cash for this transaction in January when it closes, but under GAAP, we will not be booking the approximately $235 million gain until January of 2018.
We also are continuing to explore options for downtown Minneapolis, Chicago and Herald Square. Of the 3, we expect Herald Square will take the longest to determine the best approach for potentially creating value, given its size and complexity.
The second component of our real estate strategy relates to the approximately 100 stores we intend to close. As we discussed last quarter, most of these are underperforming stores and are less critical to our footprint, but a few represent opportunities where we believe the real estate value exceeds the value as a retail entity.
We announced today that we have a signed contract to sell our downtown Portland store. This transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter with proceeds of approximately $54 million and a book gain of approximately $36 million. This store will be closed in early 2017.
Additionally, as you saw last week, we sold 5 locations to GGP for a total of $48 million. One of these stores has already closed, 3 will close in early 2017 and we will continue to leaseback and operate Tysons Galleria while GGP determines the best use for this property.
There are also 2 other stores that we will be closing, Douglaston in New York and Lancaster Mall in Salem, Oregon. These are being closed based on the timing of lease terminations and expirations.
So in total, as of today, we have closed or announced plans to close 8 stores as part of the 100 stores discussed last quarter, with Tysons Galleria being sold in leaseback. We are working on many other transactions like these for the locations that we believe we should close. While Eastdil Secured continues to advise us on the flagship properties and other significant assets, we have also now engaged CBRE to help facilitate the disposition of the majority of our closed or to-be-closed locations.
That brings us to the third component of our real estate strategy, which is to create value from our remaining real estate portfolio. Macy's has real estate assets with significant value creation opportunities, but we recognize that realizing these opportunities will often require alternative uses for the property and some amount of related development.
We sought out a world-class partner with both capital and strong platform capabilities to help us with this component of our strategy, and we found this in Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield is one of the leading global investors in real estate spanning all major sectors: Office, multifamily, hospitality and retail, particularly regional malls.
As you can imagine, there was tremendous interest among real estate investors to partner with Macy's. We are very excited about the potential of this alliance. We believe that the potential risk-adjusted value from pursuing this path on these assets could be significantly higher than the outright sales today.
We have kept this alliance as simple as we could. In short, we are giving Brookfield an exclusive right for up to 24 months to create a predevelopment plan on each of approximately 50 assets that are initially included in this agreement. We have the option to add additional assets to this alliance in the future.
These to-be-redeveloped assets are a combination of stores, portions of stores and outparcels, both adjacent to our stores and, in some cases, in our parking fields. While we might close stores in some of these locations, it is more likely that we will create value with surplus land or through improvements alongside an existing store.
The locations initially chosen are varied in their quality. These are just not all our A mall locations. This should give us insight into the potential of our total portfolio. And in most cases, the assets that we initially have selected are not in malls with the major mall owners.
Potential redevelopments in this strategic alliance can range to what we would call modest to more substantial opportunities, and we'll factor in feasibility as well as impact on store operations.
On the modest side, Macy's has successfully done this ourselves. For example, adding restaurants within the Bloomingdale’s and South Coast Plaza in Southern California or putting in a Louis Vuitton shop outside our flagship store in Union Square in San Francisco.
The great thing, though, about this alliance is that it allows us to keep our focus as a top retailer while optimizing our real estate, doing it in scale and potentially thinking much bigger. And a hypothetical example of a more substantial redevelopment opportunity could be the following: Take an 8-acre stand-alone 100,000 square foot furniture store. One idea might be to move the furniture operations back into a nearby Macy's mall location, demolish the furniture store and then densify the site with a newly built, for example, 100,000 square foot of retail, a new parking garage and a mid-rise residential tower. Brookfield will clearly help us think big and then will help us execute redevelopment opportunities more quickly.
So as a first step with this alliance, we and a dedicated team at Brookfield will work together to assess the feasibility of the development of assets. Once a plan for a particular asset is developed, Macy's will have the ability to proceed or not to redevelop this asset. If we choose to redevelop the asset, the property will then be contributed into redevelopment joint venture. Macy's can then, at that point, decide to take a cash settlement or contribute and participate in the redevelopment joint venture. And if we stay in as a partner in the joint venture, it is likely that, upon stabilization, the redevelopment project would be sold and then profits distributed.
We are very excited by this alliance and look forward to starting the work. We believe that having this single significant partnership will align interest and improve both communication and execution as compared to working with separate developers for each opportunity. Terry, Jeff and I have confidence that Brookfield's senior management is committed to making this alliance successful and they share our optimism about the potential.
We will continue to update you as we move forward on all 3 of these components of our real estate strategy. Our real estate team, along with our advisers, are doing a terrific job maximizing opportunities in our portfolio in a thoughtful way while balancing the desire to move quickly.
Let's now move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. The trend improvements relative to the spring season that we saw in the third quarter combined with a more normal weather pattern, stabilization in international tourists sales and the mix benefit of the higher proportion of digital sales that happen in the holiday season make us confident that we will be able to deliver and improve comp owned plus licensed sales trend in the fourth quarter. We are expecting comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis to be down approximately 0.5% to down 2% in the quarter. And we are expecting at least a 100 basis point improvement in the gross margin rate this year in the fourth quarter. Given our inventory position and our Last Act strategy, we believe this to be achievable. Remember, last year, our gross margin rate dropped 290 basis points versus 2014, so we do have a lot of room to improve.
SG&A is expected to be up over last year in both dollars and rate in the fourth quarter. The investments in growth will continue and we expect the income to be worse than last year by approximately $50 million to $60 million in the quarter. We recognize the expense investment needed to support our growth initiatives is not insignificant and we are very focused on identifying opportunities for profit improvement in 2017, including decreasing our non-payroll spend, improving the efficiency of our store operations and making sure we are structured to be both agile and cost-effective. We don't have any specifics to report at this time, but know that this is an important part of our setup for our comeback.
Also, we are experiencing an additional delay in the construction of Brooklyn and, as a result, the timing for the -- for booking of the gain is getting delayed more into 2017 and 2018. We now expect to book only $27 million this year. This is $59 million or $0.12 per share lower than what we expected early in 2016 when we originally gave earnings guidance. While not insignificant, we remain comfortable that we can cover this shortfall and are sticking with our earnings guidance, but not changing guidance is actually a $0.12 per share increase in our expectations from operations.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to book a $4 million gain associated with Brooklyn. We are also anticipating other non-flagship asset sales, including the Portland gain of approximately $100 million, which will take our annual number to approximately $150 million, which is consistent with the guidance at the start of the year. As you can tell, we are expecting quite a few transactions to close over the next few months.
Depreciation and amortization for the year is now estimated at approximately $1,055,000,000. We are still tracking to our guidance for capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year. We expect interest expense of roughly $365 million and still the effective annual tax rate of approximately 37%. All of these assumptions support our guidance for our setup year.
Our top management team here at Macy's is stronger than ever. The combination of some very experienced executives and recently added talent is very powerful. The new senior executives bring important capabilities and experiences to the team, complementing those of us with deep history with the company. We are all energized by the new perspective and know that this will have a positive impact on the business going forward.
As we outlined today, our organization is focused on doing all that we can to execute our strategies and drive the strong performance that will lead to a successful fourth quarter and improved results in 2017 and beyond. We head into the holidays with some momentum of some positive trends and with optimism in our assortments and marketing strategies. We have a lot of distinctive product and newness in our stores for holiday and we feel great that our customer proposition is compelling, including our new Brookstone shops; our investment in the tech watch business, including Apple and Michael Kors; and our new holiday arcade full of wonderful gift ideas.
We love this time of year. Macy's is the destination for great holiday gift giving and we are uniquely equipped to deliver the complete experience: Great product, best-in-class omnichannel capability and the store animation and holiday traditions that are so cherished by customers across the country.
And now, why don't I open the call for your questions."

And lastly, just to elaborate on the trends in apparel just looking at some perspective on -- it sounds like that category picked up. The weather wasn't as favorable. Now we're getting more favorable weather. So just kind of curious on, holistically, the inventory control, those are more long-term factors where the consumers ask from a price acceptance perspective, and then a little bit more near-term on just the trends in apparel, given the weather, et cetera."

We actually had said early in the year that we expected it to be flattish, not down. I think now the year will be slightly up. But again, if you focus on the annual, the increase feels reasonable, and that's the way I would think about it if I were you. The credit performance has been worse than we had expected, so that's one piece of the reason for the increase. Still a very strong profitability, but with credit sales declining, harder to keep the credit income dollars. And as we've said, we are investing in some of these growth initiatives, which are great from a bottom line perspective, but do add to expense. So I would say focus on the annual as you're thinking about SG&A and not necessarily the fall season.
The other thing I would say to you is that we continue to want to keep investing in these growth initiatives. So we are looking really deep to find additional SG&A reductions that, as I said, either are low-hanging fruit, if there are such things at this point, but also trying to make the organization more cost-effective, more agile and things like that.
So it's sort of a combined message, but I don't think, on an annual basis, we're going to be that far different from what we had said at the start of the year."

It doesn't mean that an Amazon won't do a lot of business. I'm not saying that. But I think in the categories that we carry, most of them, I do think the omnichannel is a benefit and the quality of our merchant team, both in terms of our private brands, our MMG team is spectacular in developing product that will only be available at Macy's will be a piece of that as well, and also giving the customers, frankly, that you can only get at Macy's. So it's a combination of those factors that I think will enable us to compete effectively against an Amazon.
In terms of the traffic and transactions, that's obviously a harder thing to predict and that's partly why we're so happy to see the AUR doing well with our inventory levels and clearance strategy working. So I think we'll do everything we can to grow the number of transactions, but I don't think we'll count on that as we go into next year."

In terms of allocation going forward, as I said, use for the business always comes first. But again, we don't see a dramatic increase in spending needed to do that. And so there will be lots of cash available both for the dividend buyback and also we may do some debt repurchases depending on how we end the year because we've always said having a healthy balance sheet is really important to the company, and we just may decide to do that.

And our shoe business was actually  one of the callouts in total for strength in the third quarter. So we feel very good about what we have done there. And as a result of the strength in fine jewelry and in shoes based on our changes in the business trends with our strategies, we've now moved on to cosmetics. And so cosmetics was one of the weaker businesses in the third quarter and we're now focused on improving that like we've done with jewelry and like we've done with shoes.
Also, oftentimes, you guys think of cosmetics as both sort of color, skincare and fragrances. I should point out that the fragrance business has been very strong of those sort of 3 components of what you tend to think of as cosmetics, which, by the way, is great as we head into the fourth quarter, which is a heavy penetration of fragrance. But cosmetics, Jeff, is next on our line -- on our list of attacking to figure out a strategy for making it stronger."

We are pleased with our third quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations. As we have said all year, we are in the process of setting ourselves up for a comeback, and we remain on that path. We are on track to deliver our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.40 and we are increasing our sales guidance to an annual decline of 2.5% to 3% on an owned plus licensed basis versus our prior guidance of minus 3% to minus 4%. And in addition to feeling good about our operating performance, we're also pleased by the progress we've made on the real estate front. We'll talk more about this later.
So let's start with some commentary on the third quarter. I'll then update you on our progress with our real estate strategy, talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and then end by taking your questions.
Sales in the third quarter were $5,626,000,000, down 4.2% from last year and down 2.7% on a comp owned plus licensed basis. Our growth strategies are beginning to gain traction in our top doors and in key areas such as fine jewelry, shoes and home, plus we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our apparel businesses: Men's, women's and kids. We were pleased that the performance improved for many of our major apparel brands during the quarter, including our exclusive brands such as INC and Tommy Hilfiger. We also saw strength in shoes, fragrances and soft home, which includes textiles, tabletop and housewares. These trends are offsetting some of the weakness in handbags, cosmetics and fashion watches. It actually was encouraging that our fashion watch trend did improve as our expanded tech watch assortment hit our stores and websites late in the quarter, including products from brands like Apple and Michael Kors. The category trends were generally similar at both Macy's and Bloomingdale’s.
Our digital business had another strong quarter, with double-digit gains at both macys.com and bloomingdales.com.
Geographically, our business was strongest throughout the West.
International tourist sales stabilized during the quarter and were down in line with the rest of our sales. As a result, the international tourist business did not have a meaningful impact on our sales in total, although it still represented a headwind for our major international tourist stores for both Bloomingdale’s and Macy's.
Average unit retail increased 3.5% in the third quarter, which is great news. This compares to a 1.6% increase in the first half of the year. This helped to offset the impact of 6% fewer transactions in the third quarter. This was the same reduction in transactions as we saw in the first half of the year.
As we discussed after the second quarter, we continue to be optimistic about Bluemercury as well as our Backstage shops within our Macy's stores. In the fourth quarter, we are testing putting Backstage pop-up apparel shops in approximately 45 Macy's stores, with merchandise being procured by our Backstage team. This merchandise will be put adjacent to our Last Act clearance areas and, like Last Act, will be coupon-free.
In addition, in 13 of these stores, we're also adding some new categories of merchandise being procured by the Backstage team, including toys, home decor and queue products. Those are the items you often see as you're waiting to check out at various retailers. We've put this queue product adjacent to the highest traffic POS locations in these 13 stores. We think these could end up being additive to many of our Macy's locations.
We also remain encouraged by the learnings and progress being made in China. Not only are we developing a potentially large high-growth business, but, as importantly, we are learning about ways we could improve our digital business in the United States as well as how we could assort our stores and websites to better serve the Chinese consumer, whether living in the U.S. or traveling here.
Gross margin rate in the third quarter was 39.8%, equal to a year ago. We are very pleased with this performance. It reflects the benefit of lower inventory levels and the impact of our Last Act clearance strategy.
At the end of the quarter, comparable inventory was down approximately 3%. This gives us great liquidity, providing us the flexibility to react to trends during the fourth quarter.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,071,000,000, up 5.2% versus last year. Much of this increase is related to lower asset sale gains this year. We recognized $41 million of these gains in the third quarter this year, which compares to $78 million last year. As you know, asset sales will be lumpy by quarter and are hard to forecast. Most of the gains in the quarter this year relate to the transaction announced last week with General Growth Properties as well as the $9 million booked relating to the Brooklyn transaction in the quarter. If you exclude these gains in both years, SG&A dollars were up 3.2%. This is consistent with what we expected, but I suspect it may seem high to you given our performance earlier in the year.
We continue to benefit from both the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015 and also the store closures, but these benefits are being more than offset by other increases, including selling, where we are investing in our key locations as well as in the strategic families of business I mentioned earlier. This staffing is supporting our growth strategies and incorporates the omnichannel activities that we now ask our store associates to perform. This investment is resulting in improved customer service scores and we do expect higher sales, albeit on a lagged basis.
We're also continuing to invest in digital growth as well as in our Bluemercury, China and Backstage initiatives.
And our earnings from credit were $165 million in the third quarter, which is $12 million lower than a year ago. Our overall sales reduction hurts our credit income and this was magnified by a reduction in the usage of our proprietary card. Proprietary card penetration was still very high in the third quarter at 48.5%, but it was 80 basis points lower than a year ago. The lower credit sales combined with slightly lower portfolio yields continue to negatively impact the income produced relative to a year ago. Having said that, our credit portfolio continues to be very strong in terms of its return on assets.
Operating income in the quarter, excluding settlement charge related to our retirement plans, was $169 million. The noncash settlement charges in the quarter were $62 million on a pretax basis or $0.12 per share after tax. Interest expense was $81 million; tax expense, $11 million. So net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $17 million. Excluding settlement charges and impairments from both years, net profit was $54 million this year, down from last year's $186 million.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 310.6 million shares. Earnings per share were $0.05 this quarter as compared to $0.36 last year. Excluding settlement and impairment charges, earnings were $0.17 per share in the quarter this year, down from $0.56 per share last year. And while well below a year ago, this performance is consistent with our expectations and the annual guidance which we had provided.
For the 9 months of this year, cash provided by operating activities was $308 million, which is $30 million higher than a year ago. This is primarily due to the reduction in inventory net of payables which resulted from our store closings and our efforts to improve inventory turnover. And as you heard earlier, this reduction in inventory is helping not only our cash, but also our gross margin rate and potentially our sales as well.
Cash used by investing activities was $491 million this year, $370 million lower than last year. This is due to $159 million lower capital spending, higher proceeds from our asset sales and last year's acquisition of Bluemercury. Therefore, our cash flow before financing activities is $400 million above last year.
We did resume our stock buyback in the quarter, buying back 3 million shares, utilizing $108 million of cash. And year-to-date, we have bought back 6 million shares for $238 million.
At the end of the quarter, we had accessed the commercial paper market for $52 million, which was a lower amount than we had anticipated. And we expect to be out of the short-term debt market by early December following a $577 million debt maturity payment on December 1.
With the strong cash flow and the proceeds from asset sales expected in the coming months, many of you are asking about how we plan to utilize this cash. As you know, we always start with funding our business needs. We then look to utilize excess cash for returns to our shareholders through our dividend and through repurchasing stock. We may also repurchase debt at some point to help make sure that our credit ratios get back to within our targeted range in a reasonable amount of time.
We are currently above our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 2.8. This ratio was 3.3 at the end of the third quarter on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Remember that, that does include the weak fourth quarter last year. But we will look at the balance sheet and the ratios at year-end in conjunction with our plan for the next few years before we make any decisions on our future utilization of excess cash.
In addition to our as-expected operating results in the quarter, we made a great deal of progress on real estate. Our real estate strategy can be divided into 3 parts. The first is our flagship assets, which, as you know, we have defined as Herald Square in New York, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago and our downtown Minneapolis store.
We have signed a contract to sell our Union Square Men's building. This separate building is approximately 250,000 square feet and we are selling it for approximately $250 million. We expect this transaction to close in January. We will utilize a part of the proceeds to consolidate our men's merchandise back into the main Union Square store and to make it an even more exciting shopping experience. We will be leasing the Men's building back for 2 to 3 years as we complete this construction. We will receive the cash for this transaction in January when it closes, but under GAAP, we will not be booking the approximately $235 million gain until January of 2018.
We also are continuing to explore options for downtown Minneapolis, Chicago and Herald Square. Of the 3, we expect Herald Square will take the longest to determine the best approach for potentially creating value, given its size and complexity.
The second component of our real estate strategy relates to the approximately 100 stores we intend to close. As we discussed last quarter, most of these are underperforming stores and are less critical to our footprint, but a few represent opportunities where we believe the real estate value exceeds the value as a retail entity.
We announced today that we have a signed contract to sell our downtown Portland store. This transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter with proceeds of approximately $54 million and a book gain of approximately $36 million. This store will be closed in early 2017.
Additionally, as you saw last week, we sold 5 locations to GGP for a total of $48 million. One of these stores has already closed, 3 will close in early 2017 and we will continue to leaseback and operate Tysons Galleria while GGP determines the best use for this property.
There are also 2 other stores that we will be closing, Douglaston in New York and Lancaster Mall in Salem, Oregon. These are being closed based on the timing of lease terminations and expirations.
So in total, as of today, we have closed or announced plans to close 8 stores as part of the 100 stores discussed last quarter, with Tysons Galleria being sold in leaseback. We are working on many other transactions like these for the locations that we believe we should close. While Eastdil Secured continues to advise us on the flagship properties and other significant assets, we have also now engaged CBRE to help facilitate the disposition of the majority of our closed or to-be-closed locations.
That brings us to the third component of our real estate strategy, which is to create value from our remaining real estate portfolio. Macy's has real estate assets with significant value creation opportunities, but we recognize that realizing these opportunities will often require alternative uses for the property and some amount of related development.
We sought out a world-class partner with both capital and strong platform capabilities to help us with this component of our strategy, and we found this in Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield is one of the leading global investors in real estate spanning all major sectors: Office, multifamily, hospitality and retail, particularly regional malls.
As you can imagine, there was tremendous interest among real estate investors to partner with Macy's. We are very excited about the potential of this alliance. We believe that the potential risk-adjusted value from pursuing this path on these assets could be significantly higher than the outright sales today.
We have kept this alliance as simple as we could. In short, we are giving Brookfield an exclusive right for up to 24 months to create a predevelopment plan on each of approximately 50 assets that are initially included in this agreement. We have the option to add additional assets to this alliance in the future.
These to-be-redeveloped assets are a combination of stores, portions of stores and outparcels, both adjacent to our stores and, in some cases, in our parking fields. While we might close stores in some of these locations, it is more likely that we will create value with surplus land or through improvements alongside an existing store.
The locations initially chosen are varied in their quality. These are just not all our A mall locations. This should give us insight into the potential of our total portfolio. And in most cases, the assets that we initially have selected are not in malls with the major mall owners.
Potential redevelopments in this strategic alliance can range to what we would call modest to more substantial opportunities, and we'll factor in feasibility as well as impact on store operations.
On the modest side, Macy's has successfully done this ourselves. For example, adding restaurants within the Bloomingdale’s and South Coast Plaza in Southern California or putting in a Louis Vuitton shop outside our flagship store in Union Square in San Francisco.
The great thing, though, about this alliance is that it allows us to keep our focus as a top retailer while optimizing our real estate, doing it in scale and potentially thinking much bigger. And a hypothetical example of a more substantial redevelopment opportunity could be the following: Take an 8-acre stand-alone 100,000 square foot furniture store. One idea might be to move the furniture operations back into a nearby Macy's mall location, demolish the furniture store and then densify the site with a newly built, for example, 100,000 square foot of retail, a new parking garage and a mid-rise residential tower. Brookfield will clearly help us think big and then will help us execute redevelopment opportunities more quickly.
So as a first step with this alliance, we and a dedicated team at Brookfield will work together to assess the feasibility of the development of assets. Once a plan for a particular asset is developed, Macy's will have the ability to proceed or not to redevelop this asset. If we choose to redevelop the asset, the property will then be contributed into redevelopment joint venture. Macy's can then, at that point, decide to take a cash settlement or contribute and participate in the redevelopment joint venture. And if we stay in as a partner in the joint venture, it is likely that, upon stabilization, the redevelopment project would be sold and then profits distributed.
We are very excited by this alliance and look forward to starting the work. We believe that having this single significant partnership will align interest and improve both communication and execution as compared to working with separate developers for each opportunity. Terry, Jeff and I have confidence that Brookfield's senior management is committed to making this alliance successful and they share our optimism about the potential.
We will continue to update you as we move forward on all 3 of these components of our real estate strategy. Our real estate team, along with our advisers, are doing a terrific job maximizing opportunities in our portfolio in a thoughtful way while balancing the desire to move quickly.
Let's now move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. The trend improvements relative to the spring season that we saw in the third quarter combined with a more normal weather pattern, stabilization in international tourists sales and the mix benefit of the higher proportion of digital sales that happen in the holiday season, make us confident that we will be able to deliver and improve comp owned plus licensed sales trend in the fourth quarter. We are expecting comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis to be down approximately 0.5% to down 2% in the quarter. And we are expecting at least a 100 basis point improvement in the gross margin rate this year in the fourth quarter. Given our inventory position and our Last Act strategy, we believe this to be achievable. Remember, last year, our gross margin rate dropped 290 basis points versus 2014, so we do have a lot of room to improve.
SG&A is expected to be up over last year in both dollars and rate in the fourth quarter. The investments in growth will continue and we expect the income to be worse than last year by approximately $50 million to $60 million in the quarter. We recognize the expense investment needed to support our growth initiatives is not insignificant and we are very focused on identifying opportunities for profit improvement in 2017, including decreasing our non-payroll spend, improving the efficiency of our store operations and making sure we are structured to be both agile and cost-effective. We don't have any specifics to report at this time, but know that this is an important part of our setup for our comeback.
Also, we are experiencing an additional delay in the construction of Brooklyn and, as a result, the timing for the -- for booking of the gain is getting delayed more into 2017 and 2018. We now expect to book only $27 million this year. This is $59 million or $0.12 per share lower than what we expected early in 2016 when we originally gave earnings guidance. While not insignificant, we remain comfortable that we can cover this shortfall and are sticking with our earnings guidance, but not changing guidance is actually a $0.12 per share increase in our expectations from operations.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to book a $4 million gain associated with Brooklyn. We are also anticipating other non-flagship asset sales, including the Portland gain of approximately $100 million, which will take our annual number to approximately $150 million, which is consistent with the guidance at the start of the year. As you can tell, we are expecting quite a few transactions to close over the next few months.
Depreciation and amortization for the year is now estimated at approximately $1,055,000,000. We are still tracking to our guidance for capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year. We expect interest expense of roughly $365 million and still the effective annual tax rate of approximately 37%. All of these assumptions support our guidance for our setup year.
Our top management team here at Macy's is stronger than ever. The combination of some very experienced executives and recently added talent is very powerful. The new senior executives bring important capabilities and experiences to the team, complementing those of us with deep history with the company. We are all energized by the new perspectives and know that this will have a positive impact on the business going forward.
As we outlined today, our organization is focused on doing all that we can to execute our strategies and drive the strong performance that will lead to a successful fourth quarter and improved results in 2017 and beyond. We head into the holidays with some momentum of some positive trends and with optimism in our assortments and marketing strategies. We have a lot of distinctive product and newness in our stores for holiday and we feel great that our customer proposition is compelling, including our new Brookstone shops; our investment in the tech watch business, including Apple and Michael Kors; and our new holiday arcade full of wonderful gift ideas.
We love this time of year. Macy's is the destination for great holiday gift giving and we are uniquely equipped to deliver the complete experience: Great product, best-in-class omnichannel capability and the store animation and holiday traditions that are so cherished by customers across the country.

The credit performance has been worse than we had expected, so that's one piece of the reason for the increase. Still a very strong profitability, but with credit sales declining, harder to keep the credit income dollars. And as we've said, we are investing in some of these growth initiatives, which are great from a bottom line perspective, but do add to expense. So I would say focus on the annual as you're thinking about SG&A and not necessarily the fall season.
The other thing I would say to you is that we continue to want to keep investing in these growth initiatives. So we are looking really deep to find additional SG&A reductions that, as I said, either are low-hanging fruit, if there are such things at this point, but also trying to make the organization more cost-effective, more agile and things like that.

I think on penetration, last year, it was up quite a bit in the third quarter. So it may just be -- on a 2-year basis, it looks fine. But we are working hard to think about strategies for improving that metric in terms of the penetration. And again, it's still at a very high level, but I think you'll see us focus on this as we go forward."

I think the first question is a good one when we think about, but I do think that our organization and, as you said, our merchants being able to curate the market, find the right product, really is a competitive advantage relative to Amazon. And when you combine that with a really terrific store organization that we have, I do believe, for fashion, customers still love going into the stores, trying things on. Even if they end up buying online from our apps, they still experience the store. And so I think both of those will allow us to always compete effectively against an Amazon. It doesn't mean that an Amazon won't do a lot of business. I'm not saying that. But I think in the categories that we carry, most of them, I do think the omnichannel is a benefit and the quality of our merchant team, both in terms of our private brands, our MMG team is spectacular in developing product that will only be available at Macy's will be a piece of that as well, and also giving the customers, frankly, that you can only get at Macy's. So it's a combination of those factors that I think will enable us to compete effectively against an Amazon.
In terms of the traffic and transactions, that's obviously a harder thing to predict and that's partly why we're so happy to see the AUR doing well with our inventory levels and clearance strategy working. So I think we'll do everything we can to grow the number of transactions, but I don't think we'll count on that as we go into next year."

And so cosmetics was one of the weaker businesses in the third quarter and we're now focused on improving that like we've done with jewelry and like we've done with shoes.
Also, oftentimes, you guys think of cosmetics as both sort of color, skincare and fragrances. I should point out that the fragrance business has been very strong of those sort of 3 components of what you tend to think of as cosmetics, which, by the way, is great as we head into the fourth quarter, which is a heavy penetration of fragrance. But cosmetics, Jeff, is next on our line -- on our list of attacking to figure out a strategy for making it stronger."

We are pleased with our third quarter performance, which was consistent with our expectations. As we have said all year, we are in the process of setting ourselves up for a comeback, and we remain on that path. We are on track to deliver our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.40 and we are increasing our sales guidance to an annual decline of 2.5% to 3% on an owned plus licensed basis versus our prior guidance of minus 3% to minus 4%. And in addition to feeling good about our operating performance, we're also pleased by the progress we've made on the real estate front. We'll talk more about this later.
So let's start with some commentary on the third quarter. I'll then update you on our progress with our real estate strategy, talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and then end by taking your questions.
Sales in the third quarter were $5,626,000,000, down 4.2% from last year and down 2.7% on a comp owned plus licensed basis. Our growth strategies are beginning to gain traction in our top doors and in key areas such as fine jewelry, shoes and home, plus we are seeing a meaningful improvement in our apparel businesses: Men's, women's and kids. We were pleased that the performance improved for many of our major apparel brands during the quarter, including our exclusive brands such as INC and Tommy Hilfiger. We also saw strength in shoes, fragrances and soft home, which includes textiles, tabletop and housewares. These trends are offsetting some of the weakness in handbags, cosmetics and fashion watches. It actually was encouraging that our fashion watch trend did improve as our expanded tech watch assortment hit our stores and websites late in the quarter, including products from brands like Apple and Michael Kors. The category trends were generally similar at both Macy's and Bloomingdale’s.
Our digital business had another strong quarter, with double-digit gains at both macys.com and bloomingdales.com.
Geographically, our business was strongest throughout the West.
International tourist sales stabilized during the quarter and were down in line with the rest of our sales. As a result, the international tourist business did not have a meaningful impact on our sales in total, although it still represented a headwind for our major international tourist stores for both Bloomingdale’s and Macy's.
Average unit retail increased 3.5% in the third quarter, which is great news. This compares to a 1.6% increase in the first half of the year. This helped to offset the impact of 6% fewer transactions in the third quarter. This was the same reduction in transactions as we saw in the first half of the year.
As we discussed after the second quarter, we continue to be optimistic about Bluemercury as well as our Backstage shops within our Macy's stores. In the fourth quarter, we are testing putting Backstage pop-up apparel shops in approximately 45 Macy's stores, with merchandise being procured by our Backstage team. This merchandise will be put adjacent to our Last Act clearance areas and, like Last Act, will be coupon-free.
In addition, in 13 of these stores, we're also adding some new categories of merchandise being procured by the Backstage team, including toys, home decor and queue products. Those are the items you often see as you're waiting to check out at various retailers. We've put this queue product adjacent to the highest traffic POS locations in these 13 stores. We think these could end up being additive to many of our Macy's locations.
We also remain encouraged by the learnings and progress being made in China. Not only are we developing a potentially large high-growth business, but, as importantly, we are learning about ways we could improve our digital business in the United States as well as how we could assort our stores and websites to better serve the Chinese consumer, whether living in the U.S. or traveling here.
Gross margin rate in the third quarter was 39.8%, equal to a year ago. We are very pleased with this performance. It reflects the benefit of lower inventory levels and the impact of our Last Act clearance strategy.
At the end of the quarter, comparable inventory was down approximately 3%. This gives us great liquidity, providing us the flexibility to react to trends during the fourth quarter.
SG&A in the quarter was $2,071,000,000, up 5.2% versus last year. Much of this increase is related to lower asset sale gains this year. We recognized $41 million of these gains in the third quarter this year, which compares to $78 million last year. As you know, asset sales will be lumpy by quarter and are hard to forecast. Most of the gains in the quarter this year relate to the transaction announced last week with General Growth Properties as well as the $9 million booked relating to the Brooklyn transaction in the quarter. If you exclude these gains in both years, SG&A dollars were up 3.2%. This is consistent with what we expected, but I suspect it may seem high to you given our performance earlier in the year.
We continue to benefit from both the restructuring that we completed at year-end 2015 and also the store closures, but these benefits are being more than offset by other increases, including selling, where we are investing in our key locations as well as in the strategic families of business I mentioned earlier. This staffing is supporting our growth strategies and incorporates the omnichannel activities that we now ask our store associates to perform. This investment is resulting in improved customer service scores and we do expect higher sales, albeit on a lagged basis.
We're also continuing to invest in digital growth as well as in our Bluemercury, China and Backstage initiatives.
And our earnings from credit were $165 million in the third quarter, which is $12 million lower than a year ago. Our overall sales reduction hurts our credit income and this was magnified by a reduction in the usage of our proprietary card. Proprietary card penetration was still very high in the third quarter at 48.5%, but it was 80 basis points lower than a year ago. The lower credit sales combined with slightly lower portfolio yields continue to negatively impact the income produced relative to a year ago. Having said that, our credit portfolio continues to be very strong in terms of its return on assets.
Operating income in the quarter, excluding settlement charge related to our retirement plans, was $169 million. The noncash settlement charges in the quarter were $62 million on a pretax basis or $0.12 per share after tax. Interest expense was $81 million; tax expense, $11 million. So net income attributable to Macy's shareholders was $17 million. Excluding settlement charges and impairments from both years, net profit was $54 million this year, down from last year's $186 million.
Average diluted share count in the quarter was 310.6 million shares. Earnings per share were $0.05 this quarter as compared to $0.36 last year. Excluding settlement and impairment charges, earnings were $0.17 per share in the quarter this year, down from $0.56 per share last year. And while well below a year ago, this performance is consistent with our expectations and the annual guidance which we had provided.
For the 9 months of this year, cash provided by operating activities was $308 million, which is $30 million higher than a year ago. This is primarily due to the reduction in inventory net of payables which resulted from our store closings and our efforts to improve inventory turnover. And as you heard earlier, this reduction in inventory is helping not only our cash, but also our gross margin rate and potentially our sales as well.
Cash used by investing activities was $491 million this year, $370 million lower than last year. This is due to $159 million lower capital spending, higher proceeds from our asset sales and last year's acquisition of Bluemercury. Therefore, our cash flow before financing activities is $400 million above last year.
We did resume our stock buyback in the quarter, buying back 3 million shares, utilizing $108 million of cash. And year-to-date, we have bought back 6 million shares for $238 million.
At the end of the quarter, we had accessed the commercial paper market for $52 million, which was a lower amount than we had anticipated. And we expect to be out of the short-term debt market by early December following a $577 million debt maturity payment on December 1.
With the strong cash flow and the proceeds from asset sales expected in the coming months, many of you are asking about how we plan to utilize this cash. As you know, we always start with funding our business needs. We then look to utilize excess cash for returns to our shareholders through our dividend and through repurchasing stock. We may also repurchase debt at some point to help make sure that our credit ratios get back to within our targeted range in a reasonable amount of time.
We are currently above our targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 to 2.8. This ratio was 3.3 at the end of the third quarter on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Remember that, that does include the weak fourth quarter last year. But we will look at the balance sheet and the ratios at year-end in conjunction with our plan for the next few years before we make any decisions on our future utilization of excess cash.
In addition to our as-expected operating results in the quarter, we made a great deal of progress on real estate. Our real estate strategy can be divided into 3 parts. The first is our flagship assets, which, as you know, we have defined as Herald Square in New York, Union Square in San Francisco, State Street in Chicago and our downtown Minneapolis store.
We have signed a contract to sell our Union Square Men's building. This separate building is approximately 250,000 square feet and we are selling it for approximately $250 million. We expect this transaction to close in January. We will utilize a part of the proceeds to consolidate our men's merchandise back into the main Union Square store and to make it an even more exciting shopping experience. We will be leasing the Men's building back for 2 to 3 years as we complete this construction. We will receive the cash for this transaction in January when it closes, but under GAAP, we will not be booking the approximately $235 million gain until January of 2018.
We also are continuing to explore options for downtown Minneapolis, Chicago and Herald Square. Of the 3, we expect Herald Square will take the longest to determine the best approach for potentially creating value, given its size and complexity.
The second component of our real estate strategy relates to the approximately 100 stores we intend to close. As we discussed last quarter, most of these are underperforming stores and are less critical to our footprint, but a few represent opportunities where we believe the real estate value exceeds the value as a retail entity.
We announced today that we have a signed contract to sell our downtown Portland store. This transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter with proceeds of approximately $54 million and a book gain of approximately $36 million. This store will be closed in early 2017.
Additionally, as you saw last week, we sold 5 locations to GGP for a total of $48 million. One of these stores has already closed, 3 will close in early 2017 and we will continue to leaseback and operate Tysons Galleria while GGP determines the best use for this property.
There are also 2 other stores that we will be closing, Douglaston in New York and Lancaster Mall in Salem, Oregon. These are being closed based on the timing of lease terminations and expirations.
So in total, as of today, we have closed or announced plans to close 8 stores as part of the 100 stores discussed last quarter, with Tysons Galleria being sold in leaseback. We are working on many other transactions like these for the locations that we believe we should close. While Eastdil Secured continues to advise us on the flagship properties and other significant assets, we have also now engaged CBRE to help facilitate the disposition of the majority of our closed or to-be-closed locations.
That brings us to the third component of our real estate strategy, which is to create value from our remaining real estate portfolio. Macy's has real estate assets with significant value creation opportunities, but we recognize that realizing these opportunities will often require alternative uses for the property and some amount of related development.
We sought out a world-class partner with both capital and strong platform capabilities to help us with this component of our strategy, and we found this in Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield is one of the leading global investors in real estate spanning all major sectors: Office, multifamily, hospitality and retail, particularly regional malls.
As you can imagine, there was tremendous interest among real estate investors to partner with Macy's. We are very excited about the potential of this alliance. We believe that the potential risk-adjusted value from pursuing this path on these assets could be significantly higher than the outright sales today.
We have kept this alliance as simple as we could. In short, we are giving Brookfield an exclusive right for up to 24 months to create a predevelopment plan on each of approximately 50 assets that are initially included in this agreement. We have the option to add additional assets to this alliance in the future.
These to-be-redeveloped assets are a combination of stores, portions of stores and outparcels, both adjacent to our stores and, in some cases, in our parking fields. While we might close stores in some of these locations, it is more likely that we will create value with surplus land or through improvements alongside an existing store.
The locations initially chosen are varied in their quality. These are just not all our A mall locations. This should give us insight into the potential of our total portfolio. And in most cases, the assets that we initially have selected are not in malls with the major mall owners.
Potential redevelopments in this strategic alliance can range to what we would call modest to more substantial opportunities, and we'll factor in feasibility as well as impact on store operations.
On the modest side, Macy's has successfully done this ourselves. For example, adding restaurants within the Bloomingdale’s and South Coast Plaza in Southern California or putting in a Louis Vuitton shop outside our flagship store in Union Square in San Francisco.
The great thing, though, about this alliance is that it allows us to keep our focus as a top retailer while optimizing our real estate, doing it in scale and potentially thinking much bigger. And a hypothetical example of a more substantial redevelopment opportunity could be the following: Take an 8-acre stand-alone 100,000 square foot furniture store. One idea might be to move the furniture operations back into a nearby Macy's mall location, demolish the furniture store and then densify the site with a newly built, for example, 100,000 square foot of retail, a new parking garage and a mid-rise residential tower. Brookfield will clearly help us think big and then will help us execute redevelopment opportunities more quickly.
So as a first step with this alliance, we and a dedicated team at Brookfield will work together to assess the feasibility of the development of assets. Once a plan for a particular asset is developed, Macy's will have the ability to proceed or not to redevelop this asset. If we choose to redevelop the asset, the property will then be contributed into redevelopment joint venture. Macy's can then, at that point, decide to take a cash settlement or contribute and participate in the redevelopment joint venture. And if we stay in as a partner in the joint venture, it is likely that, upon stabilization, the redevelopment project would be sold and then profits distributed.
We are very excited by this alliance and look forward to starting the work. We believe that having this single significant partnership will align interest and improve both communication and execution as compared to working with separate developers for each opportunity. Terry, Jeff and I have confidence that Brookfield's senior management is committed to making this alliance successful and they share our optimism about the potential.
We will continue to update you as we move forward on all 3 of these components of our real estate strategy. Our real estate team, along with our advisers, are doing a terrific job maximizing opportunities in our portfolio in a thoughtful way while balancing the desire to move quickly.
Let's now move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter. The trend improvements relative to the spring season that we saw in the third quarter combined with a more normal weather pattern, stabilization in international tourists sales and the mix benefit of the higher proportion of digital sales that happen in the holiday season, make us confident that we will be able to deliver and improve comp owned plus licensed sales trend in the fourth quarter. We are expecting comp sales on an owned plus licensed basis to be down approximately 0.5% to down 2% in the quarter. And we are expecting at least a 100 basis point improvement in the gross margin rate this year in the fourth quarter. Given our inventory position and our Last Act strategy, we believe this to be achievable. Remember, last year, our gross margin rate dropped 290 basis points versus 2014, so we do have a lot of room to improve.
SG&A is expected to be up over last year in both dollars and rate in the fourth quarter. The investments in growth will continue and we expect the income to be worse than last year by approximately $50 million to $60 million in the quarter. We recognize the expense investment needed to support our growth initiatives is not insignificant and we are very focused on identifying opportunities for profit improvement in 2017, including decreasing our non-payroll spend, improving the efficiency of our store operations and making sure we are structured to be both agile and cost-effective. We don't have any specifics to report at this time, but know that this is an important part of our setup for our comeback.
Also, we are experiencing an additional delay in the construction of Brooklyn and, as a result, the timing for the -- for booking of the gain is getting delayed more into 2017 and 2018. We now expect to book only $27 million this year. This is $59 million or $0.12 per share lower than what we expected early in 2016 when we originally gave earnings guidance. While not insignificant, we remain comfortable that we can cover this shortfall and are sticking with our earnings guidance, but not changing guidance is actually a $0.12 per share increase in our expectations from operations.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to book a $4 million gain associated with Brooklyn. We are also anticipating other non-flagship asset sales, including the Portland gain of approximately $100 million, which will take our annual number to approximately $150 million, which is consistent with the guidance at the start of the year. As you can tell, we are expecting quite a few transactions to close over the next few months.
Depreciation and amortization for the year is now estimated at approximately $1,055,000,000. We are still tracking to our guidance for capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year. We expect interest expense of roughly $365 million and still the effective annual tax rate of approximately 37%. All of these assumptions support our guidance for our setup year.
Our top management team here at Macy's is stronger than ever. The combination of some very experienced executives and recently added talent is very powerful. The new senior executives bring important capabilities and experiences to the team, complementing those of us with deep history with the company. We are all energized by the new perspectives and know that this will have a positive impact on the business going forward.
As we outlined today, our organization is focused on doing all that we can to execute our strategies and drive the strong performance that will lead to a successful fourth quarter and improved results in 2017 and beyond. We head into the holidays with some momentum of some positive trends and with optimism in our assortments and marketing strategies. We have a lot of distinctive product and newness in our stores for holiday and we feel great that our customer proposition is compelling, including our new Brookstone shops; our investment in the tech watch business, including Apple and Michael Kors; and our new holiday arcade full of wonderful gift ideas.
We love this time of year.

One, I think it's very encouraging you're seeing these AUR trends improve. So I just wanted to get a little bit more color on if you think -- obviously, the inventory control is very positive as well. Is this more of a inventory control factor? Are you seeing more firmer pricing acceptance by the consumer? Or is it mix related? Just a little bit more elaboration there.
And lastly, just to elaborate on the trends in apparel just so we can get some perspective on -- it sounds like that category picked up. The weather wasn't as favorable. Now we're getting more favorable weather. So just kind of curious on, holistically, the inventory control, those are more long-term factors where the consumers' at from a price acceptance perspective, and then a little bit more near-term on just the trends in apparel, given the weather, et cetera."

We actually had said early in the year that we expected it to be flattish, not down. I think now the year will be slightly up. But again, if you focus on the annual, the increase feels reasonable, and that's the way I would think about it if I were you. The credit performance has been worse than we had expected, so that's one piece of the reason for the increase. Still a very strong profitability, but with credit sales declining, harder to keep the credit income dollars. And as we've said, we are investing in some of these growth initiatives, which are great from a bottom line perspective, but do add to expense. So I would say focus on the annual as you're thinking about SG&A and not necessarily the fall season.
The other thing I would say to you is that we continue to want to keep investing in these growth initiatives. So we are looking really deep to find additional SG&A reductions that, as I said, either are low-hanging fruit, if there are such things at this point, but also trying to make the organization more cost-effective, more agile and things like that.
So it's sort of a combined message, but I don't think, on an annual basis, we're going to be that far different from what we had said at the start of the year."

I think the first question is a good one when we think about, but I do think that our organization and, as you said, our merchants being able to curate the market, find the right product, really is a competitive advantage relative to Amazon. And when you combine that with a really terrific store organization that we have, I do believe, for fashion, customers still love going into the stores, trying things on. Even if they end up buying online from our apps, they still experience the store. And so I think both of those will allow us to always compete effectively against an Amazon. It doesn't mean that an Amazon won't do a lot of business. I'm not saying that. But I think in the categories that we carry, most of them, I do think the omnichannel is a benefit and the quality of our merchant team, both in terms of our private brands, our MMG team is spectacular in developing product that will only be available at Macy's will be a piece of that as well, and also giving the customers, frankly, that you can only get at Macy's. So it's a combination of those factors that I think will enable us to compete effectively against an Amazon.
In terms of the traffic and transactions, that's obviously a harder thing to predict and that's partly why we're so happy to see the AUR doing well with our inventory levels and clearance strategy working. So I think we'll do everything we can to grow the number of transactions, but I don't think we'll count on that as we go into next year."

And we, frankly, just said, you know what, we don't know what's going to happen, let's wait and see if the second quarter improves, just to be sure before we head into the fall. The second quarter obviously improved quite a bit and gave us the stability and confidence to resume the buyback. So that's really the thinking there.
In terms of allocation going forward, as I said, use for the business always comes first. But again, we don't see a dramatic increase in spending needed to do that. And so there will be lots of cash available both for the dividend buyback and also we may do some debt repurchases depending on how we end the year because we've always said having a healthy balance sheet is really important to the company, and we just may decide to do that. But again, we're not making those decisions until we get through the end of the year."

And so cosmetics was one of the weaker businesses in the third quarter and we're now focused on improving that like we've done with jewelry and like we've done with shoes.
Also, oftentimes, you guys think of cosmetics as both sort of color, skincare and fragrances. I should point out that the fragrance business has been very strong of those sort of 3 components of what you tend to think of as cosmetics, which, by the way, is great as we head into the fourth quarter, which is a heavy penetration of fragrance. But cosmetics, Jeff, is next on our line -- on our list of attacking to figure out a strategy for making it stronger."
