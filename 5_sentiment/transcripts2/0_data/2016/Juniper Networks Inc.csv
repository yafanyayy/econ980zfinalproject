January is a time to review our key accomplishments of the prior year and set expectations for the year ahead. 2015 was an inflection point year for the industry and for Juniper as well. Traditional networking boun",1282,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. January is a time to review our key accomplishments of the prior year and set expectations for the year ahead. 2015 was an inflection point year for the industry and for Juniper as well. Traditional networking boundaries are changing, and as a challenger in this industry, we're here to shape it and lead it. 
Throughout last year, I committed to focusing on innovation, operational excellence, cost discipline and our targeted growth initiatives. I'm pleased to report that in 2015, our total revenue grew 7% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse, driven by growth across all verticals, geographies and technologies. 
Product and service revenue were up across routing, switching and security. Service provider and Enterprise revenue was up by 7% and 8%, respectively. We improved our operating margin and delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. 
So I'm proud of what we've achieved but there's still more to do to continue on our path of operational excellence, innovation and growth. We are living in disruptive times, and we are witnessing some megatrends unfold. The competitive landscape is evolving. New architectural approaches like SDN are becoming real. Business models are changing with software disaggregation and white-box switching. The future of security is evolving and everything is shifting to the cloud. 
What does this all mean for Juniper? We intend to be the most trusted technology provider, helping our customers to solve their most pressing networking problems. We see incredible opportunity ahead and we intend to capture it.
Today, there are about 700 million broadband users worldwide and an estimated 940 million by the end of 2018. This is driving an insatiable need for network capacity. To illustrate this point, Netflix recently announced it is now serving 192 countries, up from 60-plus. Imagine satisfying this increasing worldwide demand for rapid low-latency and high-volume communication of information. It will require new high-performance highly automated networking solutions and cutting edge technologies.
In 2016, we plan to continue to capture inflection points in the industry that will help accelerate our existing strategy. We plan to do so through continued execution and product innovation as well as partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions when appropriate that complements our organic R&D strategy. 
For example, we see new growth opportunities in the data center interconnect and Metro Ethernet markets. Traffic growth in the networks that form these markets is forcing our customers to consider new architectural approaches to keeping up with traffic demand cost effectively. 
Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider, BTI Systems. By combining Juniper's data center switching and IP routing platforms with BTI's cloud and metro networking systems and software, we expect to transform optical networking and provide our customers with open software-driven solutions that are automated, highly programmable, cost-efficient and offer tremendous service agility. 
It is now more evident than ever that everything is shifting to the cloud. Enterprise IT is moving apps and data to public and hybrid cloud. Service providers are building out a distributed telco cloud to drive down operational costs, increase agility and better serve their customer. Cloud adoption requires new network infrastructure build and upgrade across wide area network, data centers and branch offices. And our customers recognize the value of Juniper's networking innovations to help in their transition to cloud architectures. 
Our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operations of networks and to allow our customers across our key vertical to deliver real value over those networks. We anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time.
I remain optimistic about our entire product line-up across routing, switching, security and automation software that spans 5 solution domains: data center, core, edge, campus and branch and access and aggregation. We shipped several new products last quarter, including the ACX500 hardened access switch; the QFX5200 top-of-rack data center switch; the SRX1500 security platform for the campus and branch domain and the newest generation of MX line card, the MPC7. These and other new products are getting good early reception from customers, and we expect them to ramp in revenue this year. 
Now I know cybersecurity is top of mind for organizations of all sizes. Investing in security is an imperative for our customers' and Juniper's strategy. We believe the future of security is intimately tied to the network, and we are investing and innovating in our domain solutions with that direction in mind. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity, security and assurance of all of our products at Juniper.
Against this backdrop that I've laid out and given our assumptions that the global economy will be volatile and customer investments may be lumpy, my team and I have set out the following 3 operating principles for managing the business in 2016: First, we intend to take a prudent stance while going after revenue growth opportunities that we see within our target markets; second, we will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses and intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2016. We reiterate our long-term target of operating margins of 25% on a sustainable annualized basis; third, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and continue working towards an optimized capital structure. 
We will seek to fulfill our commitments to continuous process improvement and execution, and I look forward to sharing yet more accomplishments that provide value to our customers and return for our shareholders. I want to thank our employees for their continuous pursuit of excellence and their sincere commitment to helping our customers every day.
Before I conclude, I would like to say a few words on the leadership transition that we announced earlier today. Robyn joined Juniper as our CFO over 8.5 years ago and has since led the finance and operations organization through a period of extensive change and frankly significant accomplishments. I've always been impressed with Robyn's willingness to put customers first and bring her great energy and enthusiasm to some of the most challenging times our company has faced. 
Robyn has developed an outstanding finance, IT and operations organization and has instilled a strong operational and financial discipline in the company, complementing and strengthening our heritage of innovation. Robyn, I thank you for being a great business partner, not only with me but the entire Juniper senior leadership team and the board over the last 8.5 years. And thank you for stepping down in the thoughtful way you have, with a great CFO successor to take over after filing the 10-K in late February and staying on until the summer to ensure a smooth transition. 
Ken, you have been at Juniper since before the IPO, and I know you have been in all parts of the company over those 16-plus years and know the company inside and out. In your current role as the SVP of Finance, you have worked closely with Robyn and me in helping to instill the financial discipline that has resulted in our strong performance in 2015. 
I also know that you appreciate where this company has been, but more importantly, are mindful that there is still more work to do to really achieve our full potential. We are confident that with your leadership, we will continue on this new path of operational excellence and diligent and prudent financial management. Continuing to strengthen these attributes of our culture are essential to our future successes. Robyn, thank you. And Ken, we look forward to your new role. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Robyn for a review of our full year and quarterly financial results."

I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both America",834,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both Americas and APAC as well as solid growth with service providers across all technologies. Specifically, telecom, cable and cloud providers each grew revenue more than 20% year-over-year.
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 7 were telcos and 3 were cloud or cable providers. Of these customers, 5 were located outside of the U.S., reflecting our continued strategy to diversify our revenue across multiple verticals and geographies. 
Our underlying demand metrics continued to be healthy this quarter, with a product book-to-bill greater than 1 and ending product backlog at $517 million, up 16% year-over-year. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was flat and up 7% year-over-year. 
I'm especially pleased that for the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year and sequential non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. This reflects our continued good execution, focused on revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $117 million, lower than the previous quarter, primarily due to working capital requirements. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million. We repurchased $93 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we've returned approximately $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now I'd like to discuss our annual results. Our fiscal 2015 results were strong, with year-over-year revenue increases across all verticals, geographies and technologies. As anticipated, in the second half of 2015, U.S. Tier 1 telcos showed an improvement compared to the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were telcos, 3 of which were outside of the U.S. and 5 were cloud or cable providers. For the year, we expanded operating margins significantly by 3.3 points and grew diluted earnings per share by 40% on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects our solid execution, focused on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we are making good progress to our annualized long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue and towards our non-GAAP operating margin target of 25%. 
For the year, we had strong cash flows from operation of $893 million, primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margins. Capital expenditures for the year were $210 million as we focused on investments to drive long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. We repurchased $1,143,000,000 of shares and paid $156 million in dividends.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our Q1 outlook. Although we have good visibility into the first quarter, the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential customer investment lumpiness calls for a conservative outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong, which we effected into our outlook. You can find the detailed outlook for Q1 in the CFO commentary available on our website. 
Now I'll provide an update on our capital return program. Given that we are substantially through our $4.1 billion capital return commitment, we wanted to give you some color on how we look at our capital return policy beyond the 2016 time frame. Going forward, we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. As a reminder, in March of 2016, we have $300 million of debt maturing that we currently intend to refinance, subject to market and other business conditions.
Also yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire BTI Systems. Please note that we expect the transaction to close in Q2. And we will provide more information on the financial details of the combined operations after the transaction's closed. At this point, we don't expect the transaction to have a material impact to our 2016 earnings.
To summarize, I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in this year, which is reflected in our results. We are executing well against our long-term model, and as we begin the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. 
For the past 8.5 years, I've been privileged to be the CFO of Juniper. We have accomplished a lot over this time, and I feel really good about where the company is positioned and the financial and operational discipline that is in place. I also believe that the company is in great hands with Rami and with Ken as we move forward. And I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now with that, I'd like to open the call to questions."

First and foremost, I have to say that I feel good about the fundamentals of the business, and of course, the need for networking technology across all of our market verticals. The fact of the matter is there are some very important problems to be solved in the area of networking, keeping up with capacity and delivering services over those networks and so forth. I also feel great about our execution, the engagement that we have with our customers across all of our key market verticals. I think it really comes down to the fact that 2016 has started with a lot of market volatility. And we have to see how that plays out in terms of its effect on spending patterns and deployment with our customers really across all of our key verticals. I think it's really important that we manage the business, and we invest with that assumption in mind, and that's exactly what we're doing."

Routing all up grew 6%, switching 7%, security grew 5%. And that, I think, is a reflection of just the execution by the engineering team, the go-to-market team, our marketing teams. And I feel that the opportunity is there for us to continue that growth across all of the technology areas. In security in particular, since you highlighted it, this was an area that required an extra level of focus from us because as you know, we started with a bit of a deficit just a year ago. We refocused our strategy. We enhanced our product set. We definitely did a lot of training and marketing to win the hearts and minds of our partners and our customers. And while I'm not yet ready at this point to say that we are completely done because there's still a lot more execution for us to do in the area of security, I definitely feel much better about the opportunity that we have with that business and the way that we are executing in that business than I did a year ago."

This is actually a strategy that I've talked to you and our customers and our partners about over several years. We have already been developing optical interfaces, colored interfaces on our routers. And we think that there are certain market segments, data center interconnect in particular, Metro that are going to need to move to this architectural approach sooner rather than later.

It's up a couple of ticks year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. It is strong in terms of both the product and the services margin. The services team and the business around services is doing very well within the company. The team continues to work on the cost structure. They continue to take cost out of that business and productivity increase at the same time as improving their customer satisfaction scores. So I'm very pleased with that. If we moved to the first quarter guidance on the gross margin, we also typically see a quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in gross margins. Again, it's up year-over-year from Q1 of last year, and that's primarily the result of the volume in the Q1 period of time from product. So services relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter in terms of the gross margin area. Sometimes, we do get some fluctuation in that depending on deployments from products because the PS revenue is part of services, but we're very pleased with our services gross margin."

So we see very clearly that your very good performance today is mostly driven by the U.S. Are you concerned about the slowdown -- domestic slowdown as well? Or is most of the uncertainty in international market? And then maybe along the same line, one last question. What's your view on data into spending?

There is nothing specific to any one particular vertical or even a geography. The macro volatility we're seeing is really widespread, and it touches pretty much all of our customers across verticals and different geos as well. On the second question that you are talking about with respect to data center, I still see that as a tremendous opportunity for us. We are -- if you look at our switching market share, although it's actually nudging up, we're still relatively small, and for that reason, the opportunity for us to penetrate into the data center with switching products, data center interconnect with our MX product line as well as some of the packet optical architectures that we're talking about. And data center is, in fact, the area where we are strongest today from a security standpoint. Finally, where we are really seeing some good momentum is with Contrail and build-out of cloud for telecom operators and large enterprises. The Contrail win rate that we are observing right now with 6 additional wins in the Q4 timeframe alone is really healthy. And we definitely see a pooling of other products along with it. So macro uncertainty aside, I still view data center, and in particular, the move to hybrid cloud environment as a tremendous opportunity for Juniper."

I'd say that the biggest areas of focus and where our competitive differentiation is going to be greatest as well as where our go-to-market attention is also the highest is in the data center opportunity. So you mentioned correctly, so the move to 25- and 50-gig. We just introduced in the Q4 timeframe the QFX5200. In fact, that's the first switch that we offer with a completely disaggregated operating system to truly go after that opportunity. That complements the spine switches that are now in the hands of our customers, at least the early versions in the hands of our customers where we expect revenue to start ramping this year. So anything to do with data center just as a matter of strategy and focus, I'm optimistic about. Metro 100-gig, the MX is the sweet spot product now for these 100-gig deployments. And I do expect to be very much relevant, if you will, for those kinds of opportunities. Campus has been a little bit less of a focus relative to the data center but that's only because of the timing of the -- the timing of products, if you will. We have a new architecture that we introduced for the campus that we call Fusion architecture. And that architecture really comes to fruition in around the middle of this year. And for large campus environment, I think that makes us very, very competitive. Last -- no, on the Metro opportunity, we did mention that we introduced the latest version of our MX line cards in the Q4 timeframe. This is the MPC7 with very dense industry-leading 100-gig capacity, which is perfectly timed to capture the Metro opportunity that you are mentioning."

Last quarter was a great quarter for the MX and the PTX. This quarter is another fantastic quarter for the MX. So there are really 2 routing product lines that are humming right now in terms of the business momentum that we are building. Both have fantastic roadmaps and both are hitting the mark in terms of both the software capabilities, the services and the density and performance that they offer to our customers. In Q4 in particular, we saw broad-based strength in service providers. This is not a comment specific to just a large Tier 1. This is true for service providers around the world that are building out their Metro, their Edge and their cores through the MX and the PTX. And I'm also very pleased with the performance that we saw in the cable in the Q4 timeframe where cable operators are really just trying to keep ahead of the growth in video traffic. They're doing this with the migration to DOCSIS 3.0 to 3.1.

And in terms of Brazil, it's a small business for us, but I can actually say it was down in the quarter and that's in the Americas results. So in terms of the APAC results, they would have been up. I think it was about 10% but we'll come back to you with that number."

This is an industry where most of the innovation and the investment goes into software, but much of the business models are tied to hardware. I mean, if you take a look at Juniper as an example, 85% of all of our development resources are software resources. That is where the crust or the majority of our R&D investment actually lies. I do believe that over time, business models will adjust so that more of the value is going to be monetized through software. And I think we're taking meaningful steps in that direction. So in the Q4 timeframe, we announced our disaggregated architecture, our customers were very pleased. We got a lot of kudos, if you will, from our customers, telecom operators and enterprises but mostly on the telco side, that this is the right step to take. Do I believe that there's going to be an overnight shift in business models? No, I don't. I think in this industry, everything sort of unfolds in multi-years. But I do think that we are taking the steps that are necessary to make sure that in a world where white-box switching starts to become more prominent, that we will be able to participate, add value, and of course, create shareholder value from that transition as well."

I think that it's largely as a result of the timing of large Enterprise deployments and especially government. Government was actually very strong for us in Q3. And there was a bit more weakness in government just because of various factors in the Q4 timeframe. If I think about the opportunity for us in Enterprise and our ability to capture it, especially as it pertains to cloud deployments, I actually feel very good about 2016, all of 2016.

And Enterprise was up 8%. So within -- in any one quarter, you will see some lumpiness between the sectors and between the verticals and the markets just because of the deployment cycle.

I mean, we are seeing the same reports that you're seeing. It's still early in the year, but it is at least one of the factors that we are considering as we provide our outlook. For telcos in particular, the most important thing we need to do is to make sure that we remain extremely relevant to the next-generation architecture that they are now contemplating and will eventually deploy. Things like cloud things like deploying SDN and transforming their network locations to data center-like entities. I feel really good about that level of engagement that we're having with our telecom operators to be able to capture that opportunity when it becomes real. I think there are some real good proof points of telcos, even large telcos, that are making significant progress in that direction.

And we have developed, what I think, a really competitive solution to address that particular opportunity.

January is a time to review our key accomplishments of the prior year and set expectations for the year ahead. 2015 was an inflection point year for the industry and for Juniper as well. Traditional networking boun",1282,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. January is a time to review our key accomplishments of the prior year and set expectations for the year ahead. 2015 was an inflection point year for the industry and for Juniper as well. Traditional networking boundaries are changing, and as a challenger in this industry, we're here to shape it and lead it. 
Throughout last year, I committed to focusing on innovation, operational excellence, cost discipline and our targeted growth initiatives. I'm pleased to report that in 2015, our total revenue grew 7% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse, driven by growth across all verticals, geographies and technologies. 
Product and service revenue were up across routing, switching and security. Service provider and enterprise revenue was up by 7% and 8%, respectively. We improved our operating margin and delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. 
So I'm proud of what we've achieved but there's still more to do to continue on our path of operational excellence, innovation and growth. We are living in disruptive times, and we are witnessing some megatrends unfold. The competitive landscape is evolving. New architectural approaches like SDN are becoming real. Business models are changing with software disaggregation and white-box switching. The future of security is evolving and everything is shifting to the cloud. 
What does this all mean for Juniper? We intend to be the most trusted technology provider, helping our customers to solve their most pressing networking problems. We see incredible opportunity ahead, and we intend to capture it.
Today, there are about 700 million broadband users worldwide and an estimated 940 million by the end of 2018. This is driving an insatiable need for network capacity. To illustrate this point, Netflix recently announced it is now serving 192 countries, up from 60-plus. Imagine satisfying this increasing worldwide demand for rapid low-latency and high-volume communication of information. It will require new high-performance highly automated networking solutions and cutting-edge technologies.
In 2016, we plan to continue to capture inflection points in the industry that will help accelerate our existing strategy. We plan to do so through continued execution and product innovation, as well as partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions when appropriate that complements our organic R&D strategy. 
For example, we see new growth opportunities in the data center interconnect and Metro Ethernet markets. Traffic growth in the networks that form these markets is forcing our customers to consider new architectural approaches to keeping up with traffic demand cost effectively. 
Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider, BTI Systems. By combining Juniper's data center switching and IP routing platforms with BTI's cloud and metro networking systems and software, we expect to transform packet-optical networking and provide our customers with open software-driven solutions that are automated, highly programmable, cost-efficient and offer tremendous service agility. 
It is now more evident than ever that everything is shifting to the cloud. Enterprise IT is moving apps and data to public and hybrid cloud. Service providers are building out a distributed telco cloud to drive down operational costs, increase agility and better serve their customer. Cloud adoption requires new network infrastructure build and upgrade across wide area network, data centers and branch offices. And our customers recognize the value of Juniper's networking innovations to help in their transition to cloud architectures. 
Our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operations of networks and to allow our customers across our key vertical to deliver real value over those networks. We anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time.
I remain optimistic about our entire product line-up across routing, switching, security and automation software that spans 5 solution domains: data center, core, edge, campus and branch and access and aggregation. We shipped several new products last quarter, including the ACX500 hardened access switch; the QFX5200 top-of-rack data center switch; the SRX1500 security platform for the campus and branch domain and the newest generation of MX line card, the MPC7. These and other new products are getting good early reception from customers, and we expect them to ramp in revenue this year. 
Now I know cybersecurity is top of mind for organizations of all sizes. Investing in security is an imperative for our customers' and to Juniper's strategy. We believe the future of security is intimately tied to the network, and we are investing and innovating in our domain solutions with that direction in mind. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity, security and assurance of all of our products at Juniper.
Against this backdrop that I've laid out and given our assumptions that the global economy will be volatile and customer investments may be lumpy, my team and I have set out the following 3 operating principles for managing the business in 2016: First, we intend to take a prudent stance while going after revenue growth opportunities that we see within our target markets; second, we will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses and intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2016. We reiterate our long-term target of operating margins of 25% on a sustainable annualized basis; third, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and continue working towards an optimized capital structure. 
We will seek to fulfill our commitments to continuous process improvement and execution, and I look forward to sharing yet more accomplishments that provide value to our customers and return for our shareholders. I want to thank our employees for their continuous pursuit of excellence and their sincere commitment to helping our customers every day.
Before I conclude, I would like to say a few words on the leadership transition that we announced earlier today. Robyn joined Juniper as our CFO over 8.5 years ago, and has since led the finance and operations organization through a period of extensive change, and frankly, significant accomplishments. I've always been impressed with Robyn's willingness to put customers first and bring her great energy and enthusiasm to some of the most challenging times our company has faced. 
Robyn has developed an outstanding finance, IT and operations organization and has instilled a strong operational and financial discipline in the company, complementing and strengthening our heritage of innovation. Robyn, I thank you for being a great business partner, not only with me but the entire Juniper senior leadership team and the board over the last 8.5 years. And thank you for stepping down in the thoughtful way you have, with a great CFO successor to take over after filing the 10-K in late February and staying on until the summer to ensure a smooth transition. 
Ken, you have been at Juniper since before the IPO, and I know you have been in all parts of the company over those 16-plus years and know the company inside and out. In your current role as the SVP of Finance, you have worked closely with Robyn and me in helping to instill the financial discipline that has resulted in our strong performance in 2015. 
I also know that you appreciate where this company has been, but more importantly, are mindful that there is still more work to do to really achieve our full potential. We are confident that with your leadership, we will continue on this new path of operational excellence and diligent and prudent financial management. Continuing to strengthen these attributes of our culture are essential to our future successes. Robyn, thank you. And Ken, we look forward to your new role. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Robyn for a review of our full year and quarterly financial results."

I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both America",834,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both Americas and APAC, as well as solid growth with service providers across all technologies. Specifically, telecom, cable and cloud providers each grew revenue more than 20% year-over-year.
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 7 were telcos and 3 were cloud or cable providers. Of these customers, 5 were located outside of the U.S., reflecting our continued strategy to diversify our revenue across multiple verticals and geographies. 
Our underlying demand metrics continued to be healthy this quarter, with a product's book-to-bill greater than 1, and ending product backlog at $517 million, up 16% year-over-year. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was flat and up 7% year-over-year. 
I'm especially pleased that for the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year and sequential non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. This reflects our continued good execution, focused on revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $117 million, lower than the previous quarter, primarily due to working capital requirements. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million. We repurchased $93 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we've returned approximately $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now I'd like to discuss our annual results. Our fiscal 2015 results were strong, with year-over-year revenue increases across all verticals, geographies and technologies. As anticipated, in the second half of 2015, U.S. Tier 1 telcos showed an improvement compared to the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were telcos, 3 of which were outside of the U.S. and 5 were cloud or cable providers. For the year, we expanded operating margins significantly by 3.3 points and grew diluted earnings per share by 40% on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects our solid execution, focused on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we are making good progress to our annualized long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue and towards our non-GAAP operating margin target of 25%. 
For the year, we had strong cash flows from operation of $893 million, primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margins. Capital expenditures for the year were $210 million, as we focused on investments to drive long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. We repurchased $1,143,000,000 of shares and paid $156 million in dividends.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our Q1 outlook. Although we have good visibility into the first quarter, the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential customer investment lumpiness calls for a conservative outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong, which we effected into our outlook. You can find the detailed outlook for Q1 in the CFO commentary available on our website. 
Now I'll provide an update on our capital return program. Given that we are substantially through our $4.1 billion capital return commitment, we wanted to give you some color on how we look at our capital return policy beyond the 2016 time frame. Going forward, we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. As a reminder, in March of 2016, we have $300 million of debt maturing that we currently intend to refinance, subject to market and other business conditions.
Also yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire BTI Systems. Please note that we expect the transaction to close in Q2. And we will provide more information on the financial details of the combined operations after the transaction's closed. At this point, we don't expect the transaction to have a material impact to our 2016 earnings.
To summarize, I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in this year, which is reflected in our results. We are executing well against our long-term model, and as we begin the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. 
For the past 8.5 years, I've been privileged to be the CFO of Juniper. We have accomplished a lot over this time, and I feel really good about where the company is positioned and the financial and operational discipline that is in place. I also believe that the company is in great hands with Rami and with Ken as we move forward. And I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

The fact of the matter is there are some very important problems to be solved in the area of networking, keeping up with capacity and delivering services over those networks and so forth. I also feel great about our execution, the engagement that we have with our customers across all of our key market verticals. I think it really comes down to the fact that 2016 has started with a lot of market volatility. And we have to see how that plays out in terms of its effect on spending patterns and deployment with our customers really across all of our key verticals. I think it's really important that we manage the business, and we invest with that assumption in mind, and that's exactly what we're doing."

Routing all up grew 6%, switching 7%, security grew 5%. And that, I think, is a reflection of just the execution by the engineering team, the go-to-market team, our marketing team. And I feel that the opportunity is there for us to continue that growth across all of the technology areas. In security in particular, since you highlighted it, this was an area that required an extra level of focus from us because as you know, we started with a bit of a deficit just a year ago. We refocused our strategy. We enhanced our product set. We definitely did a lot of training and marketing to win the hearts and minds of our partners and our customers. And while I'm not yet ready at this point to say that we are completely done because there's still a lot more execution for us to do in the area of security, I definitely feel much better about the opportunity that we have with that business and the way that we are executing in that business than I did a year ago."

The goal is to capture what we believe are very important market inflection points that have to do with the convergence of packet and optical. And this is not a new strategy. This is actually a strategy that I've talked to you and our customers and our partners about over several years. We have already been developing optical interfaces, colored interfaces on our routers. And we think that there are certain market segments, data center interconnect in particular, Metro that are going to need to move to this architectural approach sooner rather than later.

When you talk about being prudent in the lumpiness, 1 month in, I recognize it's not very long and January is always a light month for the first quarter. But have you seen -- have you actually seen things that cause you concern as opposed to reading The Wall Street Journal and CNN and listening to all the other companies that we announced? And then my question would be on margins. You had a really strong services gross margin number relative to what you've done over the last year or 2. And product gross margin was somewhere between -- the real question, I mean, going forward, what should we expect? Is the 63-plus you did in services, is that the new norm or the extraordinary things in the quarter that accounted for the strength? And similar question on product."

So as we said, if I go back 90 days ago, what I said on the earnings call was that we expected Q1 to be 7% to 10% down. And what we just announced in terms of the guidance at the midpoint is 11% down. So it's modestly down from what we were expecting before and that's us being cautious and prudent. We're not seeing any wholesale signs of any weakness, as Rami mentioned before. Having said that, it is early in the quarter and it's just our experience that where there are headlines, we talk about capital purchases, many of my peers around the world will start to tighten things unless macro environment changes. And so that's why we're being cautious and prudent. It's more experience than actually what we're seeing. So on the margin side, I'm very pleased with the gross margin that we posted for Q4. It's up a couple of ticks year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. It is strong in terms of both the product and the services margin. The services team and the business around services is doing very well within the company. The team continues to work on the cost structure. They continue to take cost out of that business and productivity increase at the same time as improving their customer satisfaction scores. So I'm very pleased with that. If we moved to the first quarter guidance on the gross margin, we also typically see a quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in gross margins. Again, it's up year-over-year from Q1 of last year, and that's primarily the result of the volume in the Q1 period of time from product. So services relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter in terms of the gross margin area. Sometimes, we do get some fluctuation in that depending on deployments from products because the PS revenue is part of services, but we're very pleased with our services gross margin."

There is nothing specific to any one particular vertical or even a geography. The macro volatility we're seeing is really widespread, and it touches pretty much all of our customers across verticals and different geos as well. On the second question that you are talking about with respect to data center, I still see that as a tremendous opportunity for us. We are -- if you look at our switching market share, although it's actually nudging up, we're still relatively small, and for that reason, the opportunity for us to penetrate into the data center with switching products, data center interconnect with our MX product line as well as some of the packet optical architectures that we're talking about. And data center is, in fact, the area where we are strongest today from a security standpoint. Finally, where we are really seeing some good momentum is with Contrail and build-out of cloud for telecom operators and large enterprises. The Contrail win rate that we are observing right now with 6 additional wins in the Q4 timeframe alone is really healthy. And we definitely see a pooling of other products along with it. So macro uncertainty aside, I still view data center, and in particular, the move to hybrid cloud environment as a tremendous opportunity for Juniper."

So you mentioned correctly, so the move to 25- and 50-gig. We just introduced in the Q4 timeframe the QFX5200.

That complements the spine switches that are now in the hands of our customers, at least the early versions in the hands of our customers where we expect revenue to start ramping this year. So anything to do with data center just as a matter of strategy and focus, I'm optimistic about. Metro 100-gig, the MX is the sweet spot product now for these 100-gig deployments. And I do expect to be very much relevant, if you will, for those kinds of opportunity. Campus has been a little bit less of a focus relative to the data center but that's only because of the timing of the -- the timing of products, if you will. We have a new architecture that we introduced for the campus that we call Fusion architecture. And that architecture really comes to fruition in around the middle of this year. And for large campus environment, I think that makes us very, very competitive. Last -- no, on the Metro opportunity, we did mention that we introduced the latest version of our MX line cards in the Q4 timeframe.

And then Robyn, I was hoping you could perhaps touch upon to what degree you expect currency to impact the outlook and perhaps some of the exchange rate assumptions that are embedded in the forecast."

In routing over the last few quarters, we've been taking market share. And I think that's because of the strength of our product portfolio and the engagements that we're having with our service provider and enterprise customers around the world. Last quarter was a great quarter for the MX and the PTX. This quarter is another fantastic quarter for the MX. So there are really 2 routing product lines that are humming right now in terms of the business momentum that we are building. Both have fantastic roadmaps and both are hitting the mark in terms of both the software capabilities, the services and the density and performance that they offer to our customers. In Q4 in particular, we saw broad-based strength in service providers. This is not a comment specific to just a large Tier 1. This is true for service providers around the world that are building out their Metro, their Edge and their cores through the MX and the PTX. And I'm also very pleased with the performance that we saw in the cable in the Q4 timeframe where cable operators are really just trying to keep ahead of the growth in video traffic. They're doing this with the migration to DOCSIS 3.0, 3.1. And of course, the density that we offer with the MX and the PTX to help them to do that is really turning into a competitive advantage for us."

But actually overall, the diversity is working for us, and then it gives us good growth in both areas in our -- over a full year period of time."

I mean, we are seeing the same reports that you're seeing. It's still early in the year, but it is at least one of the factors that we are considering as we provide our outlook. For telcos in particular, the most important thing we need to do is to make sure that we remain extremely relevant to the next-generation architecture that they are now contemplating and will eventually deploy. Things like cloud CPE, things like deploying SDN and transforming their network locations to data center-like entities. I feel really good about that level of engagement that we're having with our telecom operators to be able to capture that opportunity when it becomes real. I think there are some real good proof points of telcos, even large telcos, that are making significant progress in that direction. And then finally, it's important for us to continue the diversification of the business, so that we can increase the predictability of our business over time across all vertical market segments."

And we have developed, what I think, a really competitive solution to address that particular opportunity. The big iron stuff, it's really around keeping up with traffic pattern, with growth in traffic. And if you look at, for example, the enhancements that we are making in the PTX, where we're going from 1 terabit per slot to 3 terabits per slot, industry leadership from performance standpoint, I can tell you, that is absolutely hitting the mark in terms of the kinds of technologies that our telecom operators are looking for to cost-effectively address the insatiable appetite traffic growth in their network."

Traditional networking boun",1282,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. January is a time to review our key accomplishments of the prior year and set expectations for the year ahead. 2015 was an inflection point year for the industry and for Juniper as well. Traditional networking boundaries are changing, and as a challenger in this industry, we're here to shape it and lead it. 
Throughout last year, I committed to focusing on innovation, operational excellence, cost discipline and our targeted growth initiatives. I'm pleased to report that in 2015, our total revenue grew 7% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse, driven by growth across all verticals, geographies and technologies. 
Product and service revenue were up across routing, switching and security. Service provider and enterprise revenue was up by 7% and 8%, respectively. We improved our operating margin and delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. 
So I'm proud of what we've achieved but there's still more to do to continue on our path of operational excellence, innovation and growth. We are living in disruptive times, and we are witnessing some megatrends unfold. The competitive landscape is evolving. New architectural approaches like SDN are becoming real. Business models are changing with software disaggregation and white-box switching. The future of security is evolving and everything is shifting to the cloud. 
What does this all mean for Juniper? We intend to be the most trusted technology provider, helping our customers to solve their most pressing networking problems. We see incredible opportunity ahead, and we intend to capture it.
Today, there are about 700 million broadband users worldwide and an estimated 940 million by the end of 2018. This is driving an insatiable need for network capacity. To illustrate this point, Netflix recently announced it is now serving 192 countries, up from 60-plus. Imagine satisfying this increasing worldwide demand for rapid low-latency and high-volume communication of information. It will require new high-performance highly automated networking solutions and cutting-edge technologies.
In 2016, we plan to continue to capture inflection points in the industry that will help accelerate our existing strategy. We plan to do so through continued execution and product innovation, as well as partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions when appropriate that complements our organic R&D strategy. 
For example, we see new growth opportunities in the data center interconnect and Metro Ethernet markets. Traffic growth in the networks that form these markets is forcing our customers to consider new architectural approaches to keeping up with traffic demand cost effectively. 
Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider, BTI Systems. By combining Juniper's data center switching and IP routing platforms with BTI's cloud and metro networking systems and software, we expect to transform packet-optical networking and provide our customers with open software-driven solutions that are automated, highly programmable, cost-efficient and offer tremendous service agility. 
It is now more evident than ever that everything is shifting to the cloud. Enterprise IT is moving apps and data to public and hybrid cloud. Service providers are building out a distributed telco cloud to drive down operational costs, increase agility and better serve their customer. Cloud adoption requires new network infrastructure build and upgrade across wide area network, data centers and branch offices. And our customers recognize the value of Juniper's networking innovations to help in their transition to cloud architectures. 
Our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operations of networks and to allow our customers across our key vertical to deliver real value over those networks. We anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time.
I remain optimistic about our entire product line-up across routing, switching, security and automation software that spans 5 solution domains: data center, core, edge, campus and branch and access and aggregation. We shipped several new products last quarter, including the ACX500 hardened access switch; the QFX5200 top-of-rack data center switch; the SRX1500 security platform for the campus and branch domain and the newest generation of MX line card, the MPC7. These and other new products are getting good early reception from customers, and we expect them to ramp in revenue this year. 
Now I know cybersecurity is top of mind for organizations of all sizes. Investing in security is an imperative for our customers' and to Juniper's strategy. We believe the future of security is intimately tied to the network, and we are investing and innovating in our domain solutions with that direction in mind. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity, security and assurance of all of our products at Juniper.
Against this backdrop that I've laid out and given our assumptions that the global economy will be volatile and customer investments may be lumpy, my team and I have set out the following 3 operating principles for managing the business in 2016: First, we intend to take a prudent stance while going after revenue growth opportunities that we see within our target markets; second, we will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses and intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2016. We reiterate our long-term target of operating margins of 25% on a sustainable annualized basis; third, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and continue working towards an optimized capital structure. 
We will seek to fulfill our commitments through continuous process improvement and execution, and I look forward to sharing yet more accomplishments that provide value to our customers and return for our shareholders. I want to thank our employees for their continuous pursuit of excellence and their sincere commitment to helping our customers every day.
Before I conclude, I would like to say a few words on the leadership transition that we announced earlier today. Robyn joined Juniper as our CFO over 8.5 years ago, and has since led the finance and operations organization through a period of extensive change, and frankly, significant accomplishments. I've always been impressed with Robyn's willingness to put customers first and bring her great energy and enthusiasm to some of the most challenging times our company has faced. 
Robyn has developed an outstanding finance, IT and operations organization and has instilled a strong operational and financial discipline in the company, complementing and strengthening our heritage of innovation. Robyn, I thank you for being a great business partner, not only with me but the entire Juniper senior leadership team and the board over the last 8.5 years. And thank you for stepping down in the thoughtful way you have, with a great CFO successor to take over after filing the 10-K in late February and staying on until the summer to ensure a smooth transition. 
Ken, you have been at Juniper since before the IPO, and I know you have been in all parts of the company over those 16-plus years and know the company inside and out. In your current role as the SVP of Finance, you have worked closely with Robyn and me in helping to instill the financial discipline that has resulted in our strong performance in 2015. 
I also know that you appreciate where this company has been, but more importantly, are mindful that there is still more work to do to really achieve our full potential. We are confident that with your leadership, we will continue on this new path of operational excellence and diligent and prudent financial management. Continuing to strengthen these attributes of our culture are essential to our future successes. Robyn, thank you. And Ken, we look forward to your new role. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Robyn for a review of our full year and quarterly financial results."

I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both America",834,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both Americas and APAC, as well as solid growth with service providers across all technologies. Specifically, telecom, cable and cloud providers each grew revenue more than 20% year-over-year.
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 7 were telcos and 3 were cloud or cable providers. Of these customers, 5 were located outside of the U.S., reflecting our continued strategy to diversify our revenue across multiple verticals and geographies. 
Our underlying demand metrics continued to be healthy this quarter, with a product's book-to-bill greater than 1, and ending product backlog at $517 million, up 16% year-over-year. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was flat and up 7% year-over-year. 
I'm especially pleased that for the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year and sequential non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. This reflects our continued good execution, focused on revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $117 million, lower than the previous quarter, primarily due to working capital requirements. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million. We repurchased $93 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we've returned approximately $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now I'd like to discuss our annual results. Our fiscal 2015 results were strong, with year-over-year revenue increases across all verticals, geographies and technologies. As anticipated, in the second half of 2015, U.S. Tier 1 telcos showed an improvement compared to the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were telcos, 3 of which were outside of the U.S. and 5 were cloud or cable providers. For the year, we expanded operating margins significantly by 3.3 points and grew diluted earnings per share by 40% on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects our solid execution, focused on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we are making good progress to our annualized long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue and towards our non-GAAP operating margin target of 25%. 
For the year, we had strong cash flows from operation of $893 million, primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margins. Capital expenditures for the year were $210 million, as we focused on investments to drive long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. We repurchased $1,143,000,000 of shares and paid $156 million in dividends.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our Q1 outlook. Although we had good visibility into the first quarter, the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential customer investment lumpiness calls for a conservative outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong, which we effected into our outlook. You can find the detailed outlook for Q1 in the CFO commentary available on our website. 
Now I'll provide an update on our capital return program. Given that we are substantially through our $4.1 billion capital return commitment, we wanted to give you some color on how we look at our capital return policy beyond the 2016 time frame. Going forward, we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. As a reminder, in March of 2016, we have $300 million of debt maturing that we currently intend to refinance, subject to market and other business conditions.
Also yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire BTI Systems. Please note that we expect the transaction to close in Q2. And we will provide more information on the financial details of the combined operations after the transaction's closed. At this point, we don't expect the transaction to have a material impact to our 2016 earnings.
To summarize, I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in this year, which is reflected in our results. We are executing well against our long-term model, and as we begin the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. 
For the past 8.5 years, I've been privileged to be the CFO of Juniper. We have accomplished a lot over this time, and I feel really good about where the company is positioned and the financial and operational discipline that is in place. I also believe that the company is in great hands with Rami and with Ken as we move forward. And I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

Routing all up grew 6%, switching 7%, security grew 5%. And that, I think, is a reflection of just the execution by the engineering team, the go-to-market team, our marketing team. And I feel that the opportunity is there for us to continue that growth across all of the technology areas. In security in particular, since you highlighted it, this was an area that required an extra level of focus from us because as you know, we started with a bit of a deficit just a year ago. We refocused our strategy. We enhanced our product set. We definitely did a lot of training and marketing to win the hearts and minds of our partners and our customers. And while I'm not yet ready at this point to say that we are completely done because there's still a lot more execution for us to do in the area of security, I definitely feel much better about the opportunity that we have with that business and the way that we are executing in that business than I did a year ago."

The goal of this acquisition is not to build a large optical business inside of Juniper. The goal is to capture what we believe are very important market inflection points that have to do with the convergence of packet and optical. And this is not a new strategy. This is actually a strategy that I've talked to you and our customers and our partners about over several years. We have already been developing optical interfaces, colored interfaces on our routers. And we think that there are certain market segments, data center interconnect in particular, Metro that are going to need to move to this architectural approach sooner rather than later. And so this acquisition, when it closes in the Q2 time frame, is essentially a way for us to accelerate our innovation in this area by getting key building blocks, and of course, the talent that will help us do it.

When you talk about being prudent in the lumpiness, 1 month in, I recognize it's not very long and January is always a light month for the first quarter. But have you seen -- have you actually seen things that cause you concern as opposed to reading The Wall Street Journal and CNN and listening to all the other companies that have announced? And then my question would be on margins. You had a really strong services gross margin number relative to what you've done over the last year or 2. And product gross margin was somewhere between -- the real question, I mean, going forward, what should we expect? Is the 63-plus you did in services, is that the new norm or the extraordinary things in the quarter that accounted for the strength? And similar question on product."

So as we said, if I go back 90 days ago, what I said on the earnings call was that we expected Q1 to be 7% to 10% down. And what we just announced in terms of the guidance at the midpoint is 11% down. So it's modestly down from what we were expecting before and that's us being cautious and prudent. We're not seeing any wholesale signs of any weakness, as Rami mentioned before. Having said that, it is early in the quarter and it's just our experience that where there are headlines, we talk about capital purchases, many of my peers around the world will start to tighten things unless macro environment changes. And so that's why we're being cautious and prudent. It's more experience than actually what we're seeing. So on the margin side, I'm very pleased with the gross margin that we posted for Q4. It's up a couple of ticks year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. It is strong in terms of both the product and the services margin. The services team and the business around services is doing very well within the company. The team continues to work on the cost structure. They continue to take cost out of that business and productivity increase at the same time as improving their customer satisfaction scores. So I'm very pleased with that. If we moved to the first quarter guidance on the gross margin, we also typically see a quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in gross margins. Again, it's up year-over-year from Q1 of last year, and that's primarily the result of the volume in the Q1 period of time from product. So services relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter in terms of the gross margin area. Sometimes, we do get some fluctuation in that depending on deployments from products because the PS revenue is part of services, but we're very pleased with our services gross margin."

There is nothing specific to any one particular vertical or even a geography. The macro volatility we're seeing is really widespread, and it touches pretty much all of our customers across verticals and different geos as well. On the second question that you are talking about with respect to data center, I still see that as a tremendous opportunity for us. We are -- if you look at our switching market share, although it's actually nudging up, we're still relatively small, and for that reason, the opportunity for us to penetrate into the data center with switching products, data center interconnect with our MX product line as well as some of the packet optical architectures that we're talking about. And data center is, in fact, the area where we are strongest today from a security standpoint. Finally, where we are really seeing some good momentum is with Contrail and build-out of cloud for telecom operators and large enterprises. The Contrail win rate that we are observing right now with 6 additional wins in the Q4 timeframe alone is really healthy. And we definitely see a pooling of other products along with it. So macro uncertainty aside, I still view data center, and in particular, the move to hybrid cloud environment as a tremendous opportunity for Juniper."

So you mentioned correctly, so the move to 25- and 50-gig. We just introduced in the Q4 timeframe the QFX5200. In fact, that's the first switch that we offer with a completely disaggregated operating system to truly go after that opportunity. That complements the spine switches that are now in the hands of our customers, at least the early versions in the hands of our customers where we expect revenue to start ramping this year. So anything to do with data center just as a matter of strategy and focus, I'm optimistic about. Metro 100-gig, the MX is the sweet spot product now for these 100-gig deployments. And I do expect to be very much relevant, if you will, for those kinds of opportunity. Campus has been a little bit less of a focus relative to the data center but that's only because of the timing of the -- the timing of products, if you will. We have a new architecture that we introduced for the campus that we call Fusion architecture. And that architecture really comes to fruition in around the middle of this year. And for large campus environment, I think that makes us very, very competitive. Last -- no, on the Metro opportunity, we did mention that we introduced the latest version of our MX line cards in the Q4 timeframe.

Both have fantastic roadmaps and both are hitting the mark in terms of both the software capabilities, the services and the density and performance that they offer to our customers. In Q4 in particular, we saw broad-based strength in service providers. This is not a comment specific to just a large Tier 1. This is true for service providers around the world that are building out their Metro, their Edge and their cores with the MX and the PTX. And I'm also very pleased with the performance that we saw in the cable in the Q4 timeframe where cable operators are really just trying to keep ahead of the growth in video traffic.

If I think about the opportunity for us in Enterprise and our ability to capture it, especially as it pertains to cloud deployments, I actually feel very good about 2016, all of 2016.

For telcos in particular, the most important thing we need to do is to make sure that we remain extremely relevant to the next-generation architecture that they are now contemplating and will eventually deploy. Things like cloud CPE, things like deploying SDN and transforming their network locations to data center-like entities.

I mean, our exposure to telecom operator is still quite high, so there's going to be some lumpiness to the business, which is why it's so important for us to continue in 2016 on our strategy of diversification across vertical markets, across geos and also across technology areas with switching, routing and security."

Traditional networking boun",1282,"Thanks, Kathleen, and welcome, everyone. January is a time to review our key accomplishments of the prior year and set expectations for the year ahead. 2015 was an inflection point year for the industry and for Juniper as well. Traditional networking boundaries are changing, and as a challenger in this industry, we're here to shape it and lead it. 
Throughout last year, I committed to focusing on innovation, operational excellence, cost discipline and our targeted growth initiatives. I'm pleased to report that in 2015, our total revenue grew 7% year-over-year, excluding Junos Pulse, driven by growth across all verticals, geographies and technologies. 
Product and service revenue were up across routing, switching and security. Service provider and enterprise revenue was up by 7% and 8%, respectively. We improved our operating margin and delivered our third consecutive year of double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. 
So I'm proud of what we've achieved, but there's still more to do to continue on our path of operational excellence, innovation and growth. We are living in disruptive times, and we are witnessing some megatrends unfold. The competitive landscape is evolving. New architectural approaches like SDN are becoming real. Business models are changing with software disaggregation and white-box switching. The future of security is evolving and everything is shifting to the cloud. 
What does this all mean for Juniper? We intend to be the most trusted technology provider, helping our customers to solve their most pressing networking problems. We see incredible opportunity ahead, and we intend to capture it.
Today, there are about 700 million broadband users worldwide and an estimated 940 million by the end of 2018. This is driving an insatiable need for network capacity. To illustrate this point, Netflix recently announced it is now serving 192 countries, up from 60-plus. Imagine satisfying this increasing worldwide demand for rapid low-latency and high-volume communication of information. It will require new high-performance highly automated networking solutions and cutting-edge technologies.
In 2016, we plan to continue to capture inflection points in the industry that will help accelerate our existing strategy. We plan to do so through continued execution and product innovation, as well as partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions when appropriate that complement our organic R&D strategy. 
For example, we see new growth opportunities in the data center interconnect and Metro Ethernet markets. Traffic growth in the networks that form these markets is forcing our customers to consider new architectural approaches to keeping up with traffic demand cost effectively. 
Yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire optical equipment provider, BTI Systems. By combining Juniper's data center switching and IP routing platforms with BTI's cloud and metro networking systems and software, we expect to transform packet-optical networking and provide our customers with open software-driven solutions that are automated, highly programmable, cost-efficient and offer tremendous service agility. 
It is now more evident than ever that everything is shifting to the cloud. Enterprise IT is moving apps and data to public and hybrid cloud. Service providers are building out a distributed telco cloud to drive down operational costs, increase agility and better serve their customer. Cloud adoption requires new network infrastructure build and upgrade across wide area network, data centers and branch offices. And our customers recognize the value of Juniper's networking innovations to help in their transition to cloud architectures. 
Our intent is to lead in the area of software solutions that simplify the operations of networks and to allow our customers across our key vertical to deliver real value over those networks. We anticipate that our increased focus on software business models will result in an increase in software revenue as a percentage of total revenue over time.
I remain optimistic about our entire product line-up across routing, switching, security and automation software that spans 5 solution domains: data center, core, edge, campus and branch, and access and aggregation. We shipped several new products last quarter, including the ACX500 hardened access switch; the QFX5200 top-of-rack data center switch; the SRX1500 security platform for the campus and branch domain and the newest generation of MX line card, the MPC7. These and other new products are getting good early reception from customers, and we expect them to ramp in revenue this year. 
Now I know cybersecurity is top of mind for organizations of all sizes. Investing in security is an imperative for our customers' and to Juniper's strategy. We believe the future of security is intimately tied to the network, and we are investing and innovating in our domain solutions with that direction in mind. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity, security and assurance of all of our products at Juniper.
Against this backdrop that I've laid out and given our assumptions that the global economy will be volatile and customer investments may be lumpy, my team and I have set out the following 3 operating principles for managing the business in 2016: First, we intend to take a prudent stance while going after revenue growth opportunities that we see within our target markets; second, we will remain diligent in managing our operating expenses and intend to expand non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2016. We reiterate our long-term target of operating margins of 25% on a sustainable annualized basis; third, we intend to maintain a healthy balance sheet and continue working towards an optimized capital structure. 
We will seek to fulfill our commitments through continuous process improvement and execution, and I look forward to sharing yet more accomplishments that provide value to our customers and return for our shareholders. I want to thank our employees for their continuous pursuit of excellence and their sincere commitment to helping our customers every day.
Before I conclude, I would like to say a few words on the leadership transition that we announced earlier today. Robyn joined Juniper as our CFO over 8.5 years ago, and has since led the finance and operations organization through a period of extensive change, and frankly, significant accomplishments. I've always been impressed with Robyn's willingness to put customers first and bring her great energy and enthusiasm to some of the most challenging times our company has faced. 
Robyn has developed an outstanding finance, IT and operations organization and has instilled a strong operational and financial discipline in the company, complementing and strengthening our heritage of innovation. Robyn, I thank you for being a great business partner, not only with me but the entire Juniper senior leadership team and the board over the last 8.5 years. And thank you for stepping down in the thoughtful way you have, with a great CFO successor to take over after filing the 10-K in late February and staying on until the summer to ensure a smooth transition. 
Ken, you have been at Juniper since before the IPO, and I know you have been in all parts of the company over those 16-plus years and know the company inside and out. In your current role as the SVP of Finance, you have worked closely with Robyn and me in helping to instill the financial discipline that has resulted in our strong performance in 2015. 
I also know that you appreciate where this company has been, but more importantly, are mindful that there is still more work to do to really achieve our full potential. We are confident that with your leadership, we will continue on this new path of operational excellence and diligent and prudent financial management. Continuing to strengthen these attributes of our culture are essential to our future successes. Robyn, thank you. And Ken, we look forward to your new role. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Robyn for a review of our full year and quarterly financial results."
30439,321351755,923272,"Juniper Networks, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Juniper Networks, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both America",835,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased with our record fourth quarter 2015 results. They reflect strong year-over-year and sequential revenue and earnings growth. We saw year-over-year and sequential revenue growth in both Americas and APAC, as well as solid growth with service providers across all technologies. Specifically, telecom, cable and cloud providers each grew revenue more than 20% year-over-year.
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 7 were telcos and 3 were cloud or cable providers. Of these customers, 5 were located outside of the U.S., reflecting our continued strategy to diversify our revenue across multiple verticals and geographies. 
Our underlying demand metrics continued to be healthy this quarter, with a product's book-to-bill greater than 1, and ending product backlog at $517 million, up 16% year-over-year. Sequentially, product deferred revenue was flat and up 7% year-over-year. 
I'm especially pleased that for the quarter, we delivered strong year-over-year and sequential non-GAAP operating margin and earnings per share expansion. This reflects our continued good execution, focused on revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $117 million, lower than the previous quarter, primarily due to working capital requirements. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $55 million. We repurchased $93 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we've returned approximately $3.6 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016.
Now I'd like to discuss our annual results. Our fiscal 2015 results were strong, with year-over-year revenue increases across all verticals, geographies and technologies. As anticipated, in the second half of 2015, U.S. Tier 1 telcos showed an improvement compared to the first half of 2015 as well as the second half of 2014. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the year, 5 were telcos, 3 of which were outside of the U.S. and 5 were cloud or cable providers. For the year, we expanded operating margins significantly by 3.3 points and grew diluted earnings per share by 40% on a non-GAAP basis, which reflects our solid execution, focused on revenue growth, effective management of our cost structure and significant reduction in share count. We are pleased that we are making good progress to our annualized long-term model of 39% non-GAAP operating expense as a percentage of revenue and towards our non-GAAP operating margin target of 25%. 
For the year, we had strong cash flows from operation of $893 million, primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating margins. Capital expenditures for the year were $210 million, as we focused on investments to drive long-term productivity and support continued innovation and development of new products. We repurchased $1,143,000,000 of shares and paid $156 million in dividends.
Now let's take a look at some of the underlying assumptions behind our Q1 outlook. Although we had good visibility into the first quarter, the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential customer investment lumpiness calls for a conservative outlook. We also anticipate the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies to remain strong, which we effected into our outlook. You can find the detailed outlook for Q1 in the CFO commentary available on our website. 
Now I'll provide an update on our capital return program. Given that we are substantially through our $4.1 billion capital return commitment, we wanted to give you some color on how we look at our capital return policy beyond the 2016 time frame. Going forward, we intend to target a capital return policy of approximately 50% of annual free cash flow, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends. As a reminder, in March of 2016, we have $300 million of debt maturing that we currently intend to refinance, subject to market and other business conditions.
Also yesterday, we announced our intent to acquire BTI Systems. Please note that we expect the transaction to close in Q2. And we will provide more information on the financial details of the combined operations after the transaction is closed. At this point, we don't expect the transaction to have a material impact to our 2016 earnings.
To summarize, I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished in this year, which is reflected in our results. We are executing well against our long-term model, and as we begin the year, we remain focused on execution and delivering on our strategic commitment. 
For the past 8.5 years, I've been privileged to be the CFO of Juniper. We have accomplished a lot over this time, and I feel really good about where the company is positioned and the financial and operational discipline that is in place. I also believe that the company is in great hands with Rami and with Ken as we move forward. And I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

I also feel great about our execution, the engagement that we have with our customers across all of our key market verticals. I think it really comes down to the fact that 2016 has started with a lot of market volatility. And we have to see how that plays out in terms of its effect on spending patterns and deployment with our customers really across all of our key verticals. I think it's really important that we manage the business, and we invest with that assumption in mind, and that's exactly what we're doing."

Routing all up grew 6%, switching 7%, security grew 5%. And that, I think, is a reflection of just the execution by the engineering team, the go-to-market team, our marketing team. And I feel that the opportunity is there for us to continue that growth across all of the technology areas. In security in particular, since you highlighted it, this was an area that required an extra level of focus from us because as you know, we started with a bit of a deficit just a year ago. We refocused our strategy. We enhanced our product set. We definitely did a lot of training and marketing to win the hearts and minds of our partners and our customers. And while I'm not yet ready at this point to say that we are completely done because there's still a lot more execution for us to do in the area of security, I definitely feel much better about the opportunity that we have with that business and the way that we are executing in that business than I did a year ago."

Well, first, I'm happy to hear that you think it's a good idea, and I agree with you completely. I want to just make sure everybody understands. The goal of this acquisition is not to build a large optical business inside of Juniper. The goal is to capture what we believe are very important market inflection points that have to do with the convergence of packet and optical. And this is not a new strategy. This is actually a strategy that I've talked to you and our customers and our partners about over several years. We have already been developing optical interfaces, colored interfaces on our routers. And we think that there are certain market segments, data center interconnect in particular, Metro that are going to need to move to this architectural approach sooner rather than later. And so this acquisition, when it closes in the Q2 time frame, is essentially a way for us to accelerate our innovation in this area by getting key building blocks, and of course, the talent that will help us do it. So that's why, as Robyn mentioned earlier, we don't think it's going to have a material impact on our 2016 financials."

When you talk about being prudent in the lumpiness, 1 month in, I recognize it's not very long and January is always a light month for the first quarter. But have you seen -- have you actually seen things that cause you concern as opposed to reading The Wall Street Journal and CNN and listening to all the other companies that have announced? And then my question would be on margins. You had a really strong services gross margin number relative to what you've done over the last year or 2. And product gross margin was somewhere between -- the real question, I mean, going forward, what should we expect? Is the 63-plus you did in services, is that the new norm? Were there extraordinary things in the quarter that accounted for the strength? And similar question on products."

Let me touch on the guidance and the outlook for Q1 first. So as we said, if I go back 90 days ago, what I said on the earnings call was that we expected Q1 to be 7% to 10% down.

So as we said, if I go back 90 days ago, what I said on the earnings call was that we expected Q1 to be 7% to 10% down. And what we just announced in terms of the guidance at the midpoint is 11% down. So it's modestly down from what we were expecting before and that's us being cautious and prudent. We're not seeing any wholesale signs of any weakness, as Rami mentioned before. Having said that, it is early in the quarter and it's just our experience that where there are headlines, we talk about capital purchases, many of my peers around the world will start to tighten things unless macro environment changes. And so that's why we're being cautious and prudent. It's more experience than actually what we're seeing. So on the margin side, I'm very pleased with the gross margin that we posted for Q4. It's up a couple of ticks year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. It is strong in terms of both the product and the services margin. The services team and the business around services is doing very well within the company. The team continues to work on the cost structure. They continue to take cost out of that business and productivity increase at the same time as improving their customer satisfaction scores. So I'm very pleased with that. If we move to the first quarter guidance on the gross margin, we also typically see a quarter-over-quarter sequential decline in gross margins. Again, it's up year-over-year from Q1 of last year, and that's primarily the result of the volume in the Q1 period of time from product. So services relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter in terms of the gross margin area. Sometimes, we do get some fluctuation in that depending on deployments from products because the PS revenue is part of services, but we're very pleased with our services gross margin."

There is nothing specific to any one particular vertical or even a geography. The macro volatility we're seeing is really widespread, and it touches pretty much all of our customers across verticals and different geos as well. On the second question that you are talking about with respect to data center, I still see that as a tremendous opportunity for us. We are -- if you look at our switching market share, although it's actually nudging up, we're still relatively small, and for that reason, the opportunity for us to penetrate into the data center with switching products, data center interconnect with our MX product line as well as some of the packet optical architectures that we're talking about. And data center is, in fact, the area where we are strongest today from a security standpoint. Finally, where we are really seeing some good momentum is with Contrail and build-out of cloud for telecom operators and large enterprises. The Contrail win rate that we are observing right now with 6 additional wins in the Q4 timeframe alone is really healthy. And we definitely see a pooling of other products along with it. So macro uncertainty aside, I still view data center, and in particular, the move to hybrid cloud environment as a tremendous opportunity for Juniper."

I'd say that the biggest areas of focus and where our competitive differentiation is going to be greatest as well as where our go-to-market attention is also the highest is in the data center opportunity. So you mentioned correctly, so the move to 25- and 50-gig. We just introduced in the Q4 timeframe the QFX5200. In fact, that's the first switch that we offer with a completely disaggregated operating system to truly go after that opportunity. That complements the spine switches that are now in the hands of our customers, at least the early versions in the hands of our customers where we expect revenue to start ramping this year. So anything to do with data center just as a matter of strategy and focus I'm optimistic about. Metro 100-gig, the MX is the sweet spot product now for these 100-gig deployments. And I do expect to be very much relevant, if you will, for those kinds of opportunity. Campus has been a little bit less of a focus relative to the data center but that's only because of the timing of products, if you will. We have a new architecture that we introduced for the campus that we call Fusion architecture. And that architecture really comes to fruition in around the middle of this year. And for large campus environment, I think that makes us very, very competitive. Last -- no, on the Metro opportunity, we did mention that we introduced the latest version of our MX line cards in the Q4 timeframe. This is the MPC7 with very dense industry-leading 100-gig capacity, which is perfectly timed to capture the Metro opportunity that you are mentioning."

Last quarter was a great quarter for the MX and the PTX. This quarter is another fantastic quarter for the MX. So there are really 2 routing product lines that are humming right now in terms of the business momentum that we are building. Both have fantastic roadmaps and both are hitting the mark in terms of both the software capabilities, the services and the density and performance that they offer to our customers. In Q4 in particular, we saw broad-based strength in service providers. This is not a comment specific to just a large Tier 1. This is true for service providers around the world that are building out their Metro, their Edge and their cores with the MX and the PTX. And I'm also very pleased with the performance that we saw in the cable in the Q4 timeframe where cable operators are really just trying to keep ahead of the growth in video traffic. They're doing this with the migration to DOCSIS 3.0, 3.1.

I think in Europe, the areas where we're seeing the greatest success is with the telecom operators. The win rate, the level of engagement on some of the next-generation architecture is in not just routing but in switching, in security and Contrail is very good. And so for that reason, again for 2016 as a whole, I actually think Europe is going to be good. There has been a very deliberate focus inside of Juniper to make sure that there is good diversity across geographies, and we're taking that seriously. I'm very pleased with how the team is executing."

So in the Q4 timeframe, we announced our disaggregated architecture, our customers were very pleased. We got a lot of kudos, if you will, from our customers, telecom operators and enterprises but mostly on the telco side, that this is the right step to take.

I think that it's largely as a result of the timing of large enterprise deployments and especially government. Government was actually very strong for us in Q3. And there was a bit more weakness in government just because of various factors in the Q4 timeframe. If I think about the opportunity for us in Enterprise and our ability to capture it, especially as it pertains to cloud deployments, I actually feel very good about 2016, all of 2016.

I mean, we are seeing the same reports that you're seeing. It's still early in the year, but it is at least one of the factors that we are considering as we provide our outlook. For telcos in particular, the most important thing we need to do is to make sure that we remain extremely relevant to the next-generation architecture that they are now contemplating and will eventually deploy. Things like cloud CPE, things like deploying SDN and transforming their network locations to data center-like entities. I feel really good about that level of engagement that we're having with our telecom operators to be able to capture that opportunity when it becomes real.

[Audio Gap]
despite a challenging start to the year, we delivered both revenue and earnings per share growth on a year-on-year basis. The macro volatility we saw in the beginning of the year, resulted in customer's taking a cautious approach in the enterprise. 
In addition, we experienced unanticipated delays in certain service provider deployment, which impacted revenue in the quarter. 
As we entered the June quarter, we are encouraged by improved visibility with respect to timing of these deployment as well as some early and important design wins with our new products. We remain constructive on the full year 2016, and intend to continue to make progress towards our long-term financial model. 
Let's turn now to some highlights of the business. We continue to execute our strategy with significant advancements in performance in automation across a number of key solution areas. First, with introduction of our QFX10008 switch, which became generally available last quarter, customers can now enjoy the most complete and compelling solutions for the cloud we've ever had. Our cloud solution now includes best-in-class switching products across all layers of the data center. The most flexible data center edge routing product are industry-leading router, the industry's highest performance data center perimeter security solution, our high end SRX, and increasingly essential network orchestration software, our Contrail SDN controller, which once again was just voted by the OpenStack community as the most widely used commercially available controller in the world for the third consecutive time.
Second, our solutions for wide area IP transport across data center interconnect, metro and core is now unparalleled with the introduction of our newest PTX line card, coupled with our multilayer optimization controller Northstar, which we expect to soon combined with optical technology and talent from BTI Systems. We are innovating across layers of IP and optical, much of it via software. And in so doing, we expect to create new levels of network efficiency and operational simplicity for our customers. This is our strength and leverages our heritage in a way that it's highly aligned with how we believe network will evolve overtime.
We also introduced Juniper's Software Defined Secure Network that leverages our recently shipping network product like Sky Advanced Threat Prevention, an innovative cloud-based 0 antimalware ATP solution. And our refreshed branch focus in midrange SRX platform. Unlike the current status quo, it is a unique approach in the industry that embraces the principles of SDN and leverages the full capabilities of the entire network for threat protection and enforcement. To complement our solutions portfolio, we also solidified several new partnerships, including a global strategic partnership with Lenovo, to build next-generation converged data solutions for enterprise and web scale customer. We also expanded our global alliances with NEC and to deliver NFC-based solution that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation. We look forward to sharing more about our important partnerships and go-to-market strategy with you at our upcoming Investor Day in New York. 
Now let me touch on the performance for the first quarter of each of the 3 elements of our business: security, routing and switching. In security, we had a tough quarter. In addition to general weakness in enterprise and telecom, we are also now in the midst of several product transition that affected demand of some of our older SRX security products. In Q1, we delivered several new security solutions, including enhanced SRX products targeting the distributed enterprise, a vastly enhanced version of our security director management software and Sky Advanced Threat Prevention. I had said before, that as we grow the city of our business, we expect it to take time and be a bit bumpy along the way.
But I feel about the long-term roadmap we're executing on and the confidence that we're building with our customers and partners. Security remains an important part of the solutions we sell to our customers, who depends on Juniper to make the successful transition to the cloud. 
In the routing, we saw solid growth from our cloud customers, as they continue to build out their networks to cope with significant IP traffic growth. Our PTX Express Plus products, which began shipping late last quarter, are already seeing strong interest from a number of customers, including several going through beta cycle as well as several important design wins.
I'm pleased with our performance with switching, where we saw year-over-year revenue growth, driven by the cloud data center use case, which continues to be a key focus area for us. We believe that we have a good pipeline for the QFX10000 switches, including the newest QFX10008 spine switch, which has already achieved design win with a number of telecom and cloud provider customers. There is no shortage of change occurring cutting in this competitive landscape that we're in. While industry trends will continue to evolve, we believe our strategy will guide us in successfully navigating challenges and doing what is right for our customer. I remain very excited by all the new opportunities our investments and technology innovations are making possible. As I look ahead in 2016 and beyond, I believe that Juniper is well-positioned to create value for our shareholders on a consistent and sustained basis.
I want to sincerely thank our shareholders for their confidence, our customers for their trust and loyalty, and our employees for their dedication and continuous improvement effort.
Now I'll turn it over to Ken."

Enterprise revenues were i",706,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here today with all of you. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the upcoming days and weeks. The March quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective. Enterprise revenues were impacted by cautious customer buying patterns, due to macroeconomic factors, and to a lesser extent, greater than anticipated weakness due to product transition and campus and branch security. Service provider revenues were impacted by the timing of deployments related to certain U.S. and EMEA Tier 1 telecoms. Despite some of the challenges this quarter, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth, led by increases in Americas, primarily driven by cloud and cable providers as well as growth in our government vertical across all geographies. Our revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure resulted in expanded non-GAAP operating margin and a $0.05 increase to diluted earnings per share on a year-over-year basis.
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were telecoms, 4 were cloud or cable providers, and 1 was an enterprise. Out of these customers, 3 were located outside of The United States. This reflects our continued focus on diversifying our customer base. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter. With the product, but to build greater than one, and a modest increase in product before and revenue year-over-year and sequentially. As we disclosed in the Q4 2015 CFO commentary, we went live with our ERP system on January 18. Overall, we believe the implementation has gone well. However, we're processing and shipment linearity were affected in the quarter, as we ramped up on the new system. This system change resulted in invoicing occurring later in the quarter than customary, which increased DSO by approximately 15 days. We anticipate DSO to return to our target range of 45 to 55 days in Q2 2016.
As is typical with ERP implementations of this magnitude, the stabilization of the new processes and systems will take several months. We're confident that the system implementation will result in productivity improvements and efficiencies, as we move forward. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $172 million, down $47 million year-over-year, and up $55 million sequentially. We repurchased $75 million worth of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of the share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.75 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. 
Now moving on to our Q2 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. Our guidance includes the contribution from acquisition of BTI Systems, which closed on April 1, 2016. We expect BTI to contribute approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue and approximate $10 million of operating expenses in the second quarter. For the year, we expect the operations of BTI to be neutral to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We plan to integrate BTI into our business and do not intend to break out financial details going forward. From a demand perspective, we expect an improvement in deployments from certain U.S. and EMEA Tier 1 telecoms. We also expect enterprise demand to improve modestly versus Q1 levels. The outlook factors in that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. For the full year, we're focused on driving long-term shareholder value and remains constructive on revenue growth for 2016.
We will continue to prudently manage operating expenses and expect to expand operating margins in 2016. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. From a personal perspective, I'm very excited to work with Rami and the team as Juniper's CFO. I can tell you that I'm personally committed to the 2016 operating principles we outlined last quarter on driving revenue growth in our target markets, diligently managing operating expenses and expanding opening margins, and maintaining a healthy balance sheet in optimized capital structure. I look forward to further discussing our long-term financial strategy and outlook with you at our upcoming Investor Day.
And now, with that, I wouldn't open the call for questions."

And also, just confidence level associated with enterprise business all up. It was a slow start to the year. We started this year a recovery through Q1, but it really hit at the very end of the quarter. So that gives us a bit more confidence going into the Q2 timeframe. And yes, we are looking and expecting revenue increasing for the full year 2016. But of course, it means that we should have a good second half of the year. And we base that just based on discussions we're having with our customers, timing of projects. And importantly, we're anticipating, as we've said in the past, our new products, which are now in the market, are going through proof-of-concept for completing a certain opportunities on the world, when to start to ramp in second half of the year.

The QFX product line, we introduced the first version last year. The second version, which is the 2008, just this last -- or this quarter and we're in the process now of essentially competing for various different opportunity. The one thing that I can say is, the opportunities that we are now competing in are opportunities that we never were able to compete with or even engage with our competitors on for various customers around the world. So the first positive thing is, we're expanding our opportunity and it's very evident and it's very clear. Second, certainly our customers have had these products in their labs now for several months, even before they started becoming generally available. And we've been getting feedback through betas and we're integrating that feedback and making sure that the product is ready for general deployability. And then last, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are some wins to speak of year, that would give us confidence. So I think the products, even if you compare them to what changing competitive landscape, are very competitive, both from the standpoint of scale and performance, but also just in terms of the full capability of layer 2 and layer 3 that we've integrated into the switches. Your question around the timing of 10016, it's in the second half of this year is when we anticipated. So we're already bidding it in certain RFPs that require that sort of density. And certainly, the effort and the work that we put into 10008 has gone -- will go towards the work that's remaining in the 10,060 in. So I feel good about the product And then your question around our operating margin and how much it depends on revenue. I'll just let Ken address that."

But we're going to continue to manage OpEx very prudently, particularly when revenue is under pressure. So you could count on us continue to do that. I'll also should note that over the past couple of years, we have increased the proportion of variable cost, that's component of our operating expense. So that's also an additional lever that we have to help us manage operating margins as we go forward. And drive towards our long-term moderate of 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue."

From a ERP implementation, we're actually proud of the fact we went live with the new system. it actually went quite well. We don't believe it had a meaningful impact to revenue. That said, it did have an impact to the timing of orders and shipments. So that's really why it really made the backend loaded. Q1 is typically pretty backend loaded quarter anyway, but with just implementation it became more so. And it's primarily because we were effective down for the first 2 or 3 weeks in the quarter. And as we went live with the new system in January 18, it did take some ramp up time, not only from a system perspective just from a procedure and process perspective.

So certainly I think it's fair to say that the telecom operators, U.S. maybe elsewhere around the world as well, are off to a fairly slow start this year in terms of their CapEx expenditures. There a number of factors that play here, whether it's M&A or spectrum or just revaluating their overall network architectures and making sure that they are developing their networks to meet the future demands from an agility, from an operational simplicity standpoint and from an ability to deliver next generation capabilities to their end-users. I think the most important thing for Juniper now is to make sure that we are working and engaging the telecom operators very effectively and ensuring that we remain relevant in the new architecture that they're deploying. This is where the combination of our switching, our routing and our orchestration software and namely this is Contrail, is really helping us tremendously. So I feel good that we're engaging in a way that is going to enable us to benefit from the spend that they will end up putting into these next generation architectures. Until then, I think they're going to continue to run their networks harder and essentially free up the capacity and the management cycles within their organizations to develop those NexGen architectures. The other things that we must do is to continue to diversify our portfolio. We saw real strength in Q4 in a cable operators. In Q1, cloud operators. And I can tell you that the products that we're developing and we've introduced into the markets have broad applicability and have been developed with a very keen eye on the requirements of each of those strategic verticals, cable, cloud, strategic Enterprises and telcos. But I think the telco space is just a little bit more complicated right now as they evolve their architecture."

The areas where those product transitions I think hurt us in the Q1 timeframe were mostly in cloud, where we had some transitions in -- sorry, its not cloud, campus, where we're trying positions in our switching product lines, in particular the EX. And also in security, where as you know in security, we have for the last year, been executing on the new strategy. We have been delivering new products to our customers and I feel very good about those products. But we've also taken a bit of an aggressive stance towards end of life thing our older SRX products with the goal of ensuring that we have maximal capacity, engineering and go-to-market to think about the newer products, the next generation products. Things like the virtual products, the cloud-based security products. And I do think that, that had more of an impact than we initially expected in the Q1 timeframe."

So in thinking about security, it's probably useful to reflect back on 2015. We started with our refocused strategy and we executed on new products, first focusing on the surface provider space, the high end of the security market, where we actually saw some good momentum last year. And we certainly saw a lot of great enhancements in the products that itself. The thing about the service provider element of our security business is that it's lumpy. And they are couple of things that impacted us in the Q1 timeframe. First is, we got hit with the downwards part of the lump, if you will, on the SP side, where there weren't any large orders from the service provider or cloud space for those highend customers. Again and it's a part of the business that's just difficult to predict, that's going to be somewhat lumpy. And then there were the transitions that we have to deal with in the Q1 timeframe. We have recently introduced a new set of security products for the enterprise SRX1500, the SRX300 and ATP solutions and enhanced cloud management system that are no or all hitting the market, because our customers we're getting that feedback. But it's going to take some time to get all of the transitions worked out.
You're right in stating that last year was supposed to be a year of stability. We ended up actually exceeding our expectations in that time frame. I think where I might have gotten wrong or what I might have gotten wrong is the timing. I think we expected some of those transition issues to happen last year. It looks like that happening more in the first part of this year. And I feel good about the strategy all up. I feel good about the execution right now. We just have to work through these transition issues throughout this year. We're off to us to start, so I'm not confused about the fact that there is a deficit to work through on a security side to get back to growth. But I think we were reasonably conservative in our long-term outlook 3-year outlook of 1% to 3% ending in 2017 timeframe, but that is still very much achievable."

What BTI does is that it helps us to accelerate the strategy that we're already executing on towards being able to achieve those architectures. And I feel very good about the opportunity. I also feel good about how we're thoughtfully integrating the BTI assets into our overall portfolio. It is a growing market. It's certainly a competitive market.

Not confused about the fact that we're going to see or we're seeing competition in this area. I mean, that's a very attractive market and so competition is to be expected. And I would -- think about it from a couple of different ways. They are sort of different use cases that we go after in Juniper. There are use cases that require quite a lot of flexibility, software sophistication and so on that we capture with products likes MX. And the MX has incredible amount of flexibility and features that are very sticky in our customer networks. And for that reason, the various can be somewhat higher. Than there are more streamlined accounting use cases and opportunities that we go after with more efficient products for pure routing more transport like that PTX. Nothing new, this is something that we almost invented just a few hours ago, with introduction of PTX product line. And now, we're enhancing the PTX product line to go out after the streamlined opportunities even more aggressively. And last but not least, there is introduction of our spines, which actually opens up a brand-new opportunity for us to compete in the cloud provider space. And that's exactly what we're doing. I think if you aggregate all of these opportunities together and you include the competitive pressures that will exist in the market, the opportunity for us is something that we are very excited about and we're competing effectively for."

On Lenovo, we too are excited about the potential for this partnership. It's still early days in terms of doing the things that are necessary from a go-to-market and an R&D standpoint to go after the broader opportunity. It is really hinges on the convergence of compute, storage and networking. And as you probably know, there is a class of customer that wants a package solution that includes all these limits plus the orchestration software. So a key part of our strategy with Lenovo is to develop solutions that are essentially turnkey in nature that will help our customers get to an automated data center far quicker. It is a global partnership, but certainly we expect it to help us in China, where Lenovo enjoys particular strength.

Despite a challenging start to the year, we delivered both revenue and earnings per share growth on a year-on-year basis. The macro volatility we saw in the beginning of the year resulted in customers taking a cautious approach in the enterprise. 
In addition, we experienced unanticipated delays in certain service provider deployments, which impacted revenue in the quarter. As we entered the June quarter, we are encouraged by improved visibility with respect to the timing of these deployments as well as some early and important design wins with our new products. We remain constructive on the full year 2016 and intend to continue to make progress towards our long-term financial model. 
Let's turn now to some highlights of the business. We continued to execute our strategy with significant advancements in performance in automation across a number of key solution areas. First, with the introduction of our QFX10008 spine switch, which became generally available last quarter, customers can now enjoy the most complete and compelling solution for the cloud we've ever had. Our cloud solution now includes best-in-class switching products across all layers of the data center: the most flexible data center edge routing product, our industry-leading MX universal edge router; the industry's highest performance data center perimeter security solution, our high-end SRX; and increasingly essential network orchestration software, our Contrail SDN controller, which, once again, was just voted by the OpenStack community as the most widely used, commercially available controller in the world for the third consecutive time.
Second, our solution for wide area IP transport across data center interconnect, metro and core is now unparalleled with the introduction of our newest PTX line card, coupled with our multilayer optimization controller, NorthStar, which we expect to soon combine with optical technology and talent from BTI Systems. We are innovating across layers of IP and optical, much of it via software, and in so doing, we expect to create new levels of network efficiency and operational simplicity for our customers. This is our strength and leverages our heritage in a way that is highly aligned with how we believe network will evolve over time.
We also introduced Juniper's software-defined secure network that leverages our recently shipping security product like Sky Advanced Threat Prevention, an innovative, cloud-based, phase [ph] 0, anti-malware ATP solution, and our refreshed, branch-focused and midrange SRX platform. Unlike the current status quo, it is a unique approach in the industry that embraces the principles of SDN and leverages the full capabilities of the entire network for threat protection and enforcement. 
To complement our solution portfolio, we also solidified several new partnerships, including a global strategic partnership with Lenovo, to build next-generation converged data center solutions for enterprise and web scale customer. We also expanded our global alliances with NEC and Amdocs to deliver NFV-based solution that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation. 
We look forward to sharing more about our important partnerships and go-to-market strategy with you at our upcoming Investor Day in New York. 
Now let me touch on the performance for the first quarter of each of the 3 elements of our business: security, routing and switching. In security, we had a tough quarter. In addition to general weakness in enterprise and telecom, we are also now in the midst of several product transition that affected demand to some of our older SRX security products. 
In Q1, we delivered several new security solutions, including enhanced SRX products targeting the distributed enterprise and vastly enhanced version of our security director management software and Sky Advanced Threat Prevention. I have said before that as we grow this area of our business, we expect it to take time and be a bit bumpy along the way. But I feel good about the long-term road map we're executing on and the confidence that we are building with our customers and partners. Security remains an important part of the solutions we sell to our customers, who depends on Juniper to make the successful transition to the cloud. 
In routing, we saw solid growth from our cloud customers as they continue to build out their networks to cope with significant IP traffic growth. Our PTX ExpressPlus product, which began shipping late last quarter, are already seeing strong interest from a number of customers, including several going through beta cycles as well as several important design wins.
I'm pleased with our performance with switching, where we saw year-over-year revenue growth, driven by the cloud data center use case, which continues to be a key focus area for us. We believe that we have a good pipeline for the QFX10000 switches, including the newest QFX10008 spine switch, which has already achieved design win with a number of telecom and cloud provider customers. 
There is no shortage of change occurring in this competitive landscape that we're in. While industry trends will continue to evolve, we believe our strategy will guide us in successfully navigating challenges and doing what is right for our customers. I remain very excited by all the new opportunities our investments and technology innovations are making possible. As I look ahead in 2016 and beyond, I believe that Juniper is well-positioned to create value for our shareholders on a consistent and sustained basis.
I want to sincerely thank our shareholders for their confidence, our customers for their trust and loyalty and our employees for their dedication and continuous improvement effort.
Now I'll turn it over to Ken."

Enterprise revenues were",706,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here today with all of you. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the upcoming days and weeks. 
The March quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective. Enterprise revenues were impacted by cautious customer buying patterns due to macroeconomic factors and, to a lesser extent, greater-than-anticipated weakness due to product transitions in the campus and branch security. 
Service provider revenues were impacted by the timing of deployments related to certain U.S. and EMEA Tier 1 telecoms. Despite some of the challenges this quarter, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth, led by increases in the Americas, primarily driven by cloud and cable providers, as well as growth in our government vertical across all geographies. 
Our revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure resulted in expanded non-GAAP operating margin and a $0.05 increase to diluted earnings per share on a year-over-year basis.
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were telecoms, 4 were cloud or cable providers, and 1 was an enterprise. Of these customers, 3 were located outside of the United States. This reflects our continued focus on diversifying our customer base. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with a product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a modest increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. 
As we disclosed in the Q4 2015 CFO commentary, we went live with our ERP system on January 18. Overall, we believe implementation had gone well. However, order processing and shipment linearity were affected in the quarter as we ramped up on the new system. This system change resulted in invoicing occurring later in the quarter than customary, which increased DSO by approximately 15 days. We anticipate DSO to return to our target range of 45 to 55 days in Q2 2016.
As is typical with ERP implementations of this magnitude, the stabilization of the new processes and systems will take several months. We are confident that the system implementation will result in productivity improvements and efficiencies as we move forward. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $172 million, down $47 million year-over-year and up $55 million sequentially. We repurchased $75 million worth of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of the share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.75 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. 
Now moving on to our Q2 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. Our guidance includes the contribution from our acquisition of BTI Systems, which closed on April 1, 2016. We expect BTI to contribute approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue and approximately $10 million of operating expenses in the second quarter. For the year, we expect the operations of BTI to be neutral to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We plan to integrate BTI into our business and do not intend to break out financial details going forward. 
From a demand perspective, we expect an improvement in deployments from certain U.S. and EMEA Tier 1 telecoms. We also expect enterprise demand to improve modestly versus Q1 levels. The outlook factors in that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. 
For the full year, we are focused on driving long-term shareholder value and remain constructive on revenue growth for 2016. We will continue to prudently manage operating expenses and expect to expand operating margins in 2016. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
From a personal perspective, I'm very excited to work with Rami and the team as Juniper's CFO. I can tell you that I'm personally committed to the 2016 operating principles we outlined last quarter of driving revenue growth in our target markets, diligently managing operating expenses and expanding operating margins and maintaining a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. I look forward to further discussing our long-term financial strategy and outlook with you at our upcoming Investor Day.
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

It was a slow start to the year. We started to see a recovery throughout Q1, but it really hit near the very end of the quarter. So that gives us a bit more confidence going into the Q2 time frame. And, yes, we are looking and expecting revenue increasing for the full year 2016 that, of course, means that we should have a good second half of the year.

Or should we expect some additional cost savings there as we get beyond Q2? And then I was hoping perhaps, Rami, you could update us on the timing of QFX10016, provide some additional details regarding the pipeline you're seeing developed for the 10008? And what's giving you confidence these platforms are likely to win against some of the competitive platforms in the market and why customers are picking QFX over the alternatives?"

Let me start with the second question first, and then, certainly, Ken and I can address the first one. The QFX product line, we introduced the first version last year, the second version, which is the 2008 [ph], just this last -- or this quarter, and we're in the process now of essentially competing for various different opportunities. The one thing that I can say is, the opportunities that we are now competing in are opportunities that we never were able to compete with or even engage with our competitors on for various customers around the world. So the first positive thing is, we're expanding our opportunity, and it's -- that's very evident and it's very clear. Second, certainly, our customers have had these products in their labs now for several months, even before they started becoming generally available. And we've been getting feedback through betas, and we're integrating that feedback and making sure that the product is ready for general deployability. And then last, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are some wins to speak of here that would give us confidence. So I think the products, even if you compare them to what is a changing competitive landscape, are very competitive, both from the standpoint of scale and performance, but also just in terms of the full capability of layer 2 and layer 3 that we've integrated into those switches. Your question around the timing of the 10016 is it's in the second half of this year is when we anticipate it. So we're already bidding it in certain RFPs that require that sort of density. And certainly, the effort and the work that we put into the 10008 has gone into -- will go towards the work that's remaining in the 10016. So I feel good about the products all up. And then your question around the -- our operating margin and how much it depends on revenue, I'll just let Ken address that."

In addition to that, we're still seeing the benefit from some of the restructurings we've gone -- we've been going through for the last couple of years. We're going to continue to manage OpEx very prudently, particularly when revenue is under pressure. So you could count on us continue to do that. I also should note that over the past couple of years, we have increased the proportion of variable cost. That's a component to our operating expense. So that's also an additional lever that we have to help us manage operating margins as we go forward. We continue to drive towards our long-term model of 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue."

From a ERP implementation, we're actually proud of the fact we went live with the new system. It actually went quite well. We don't believe it had a meaningful impact to revenue. That said, it did have an impact to the timing of orders and shipments. So that's really why it really made the quarter back-end-loaded. Q1 is typically a pretty back-end-loaded quarter anyway, but with the system implementation, it became more so. And it's primarily because we were effectively down for the first 2 or 3 weeks in the quarter. And as we went live with the new system on January 18, it did take some ramp-up time, not only from a system perspective but just from a procedure and process perspective. So the growing pains and learning curve associated with that resulted in a delay as far as the timing of the orders."

So, certainly, I think it's fair to say that the telecom operators, U.S., maybe elsewhere around the world as well, have -- are off to a fairly slow start this year in terms of their CapEx expenditures. There are a number of factors that play here, whether it's M&A or spectrum or just reevaluating their overall network architectures and making sure that they are developing their networks to meet the future demands from an agility, from an operational simplicity standpoint and from an ability to deliver next-generation capabilities to their end users. I think the most important thing for Juniper now is to make sure that we are working and engaging with telecom operators very effectively in ensuring that we remain relevant in the new architecture that they're deploying. This is where our -- the combination of our switching, our routing and our orchestration software, and, namely, this is Contrail, is really helping us tremendously. So I feel good that we're engaging in a way that is going to enable us to benefit from the spend that they will end up putting into these next-generation architectures. Until then, I think they're going to continue to run their networks hotter and essentially free up the capacity and the management cycles within their organizations to develop those next-gen architectures. The other thing that we must do is to continue to diversify our portfolio. We saw real strength in Q4 in the cable operators; in Q1, cloud operators. And I can tell you that the products that we're developing and we've introduced into the markets have a broad applicability and have been developed with a very keen eye on the requirements of each of those strategic verticals, cable, cloud, strategic enterprises and telcos. But I think the telco space is just a little bit more complicated right now as they evolve their architectures."

I think there were product transitions that affected us as well, affected us, quite frankly, more than what we had expected. The areas where those product transitions, I think, hurt us in the Q1 time frame were mostly in cloud, where we had some transitions in our -- sorry, it's not cloud, I should say campus, where we had transitions in our switching product lines, in particular, the EX, and also in security, where, as you know in security, we have, for the last year, been executing on a new strategy. We have been delivering new products to our customers, and I feel very good about those products. But we've also taken a bit of an aggressive stance toward end-of-life-ing some of our older SRX products, with the goal of ensuring that we have maximal capacity, engineering and go-to-market to think about the newer products, the next-generation products, things like the virtual products, the cloud-based security products.

So in thinking about security, it's probably useful to reflect back on 2015. We started with a refocused strategy, and we executed on new products, first, focusing on the surface provider space, the high-end of the security market, where we actually saw some good momentum last year. And we certainly saw a lot of great enhancements in the product set itself. The thing about the service provider element of our security business is that it's lumpy. And there are a couple of things that impacted us in the Q1 time frame. First is, we got hit with the downwards part of the lump, if you will, on the SP side, where there weren't any large orders from the service provider or cloud space for those high-end customers. Again, it's a part of the business that's just difficult to predict, that's going to be somewhat lumpy. And then there were the transitions that we have to deal with in the Q1 time frame. We have recently introduced a new set of security products for the enterprise, SRX1500, the SRX300, a cloud-based ATP solution and enhanced cloud management system that I know are all hitting the mark with our customers because we're getting that feedback. But it's going to take some time to get all of the transitions worked out. I -- you're right in stating that last year was supposed to be a year of stability. We ended up actually exceeding our expectations in that time frame. I think where I might have gotten wrong -- or what I might have gotten wrong is the timing. I think we expected some of those transition issues to happen last year. They're -- it looks like they're happening more in the first part of this year. And I feel good about the strategy all up. I feel good about the execution right now. We just have to work through these transition issues throughout this year. We're off to a slow start. So I'm not confused about the fact that there is a deficit to work through on the security side to get back to growth. But I think we were reasonably conservative enough in our long-term outlook -- 3-year outlook of 1% to 3% ending in the 2017 time frame, that, that is still very much achievable."

And I think if you look at their CapEx guidance for the full year, it looks encouraging. We remain very relevant, not just in the DCI space, but in many different parts of our web-scale customers' networks. Not confused about the fact that we are going to see or we're seeing competition in this area. I mean, it's a very attractive market, and so competition is to be expected. And I would think about it from a couple of different ways. There are sort of different use cases that we go after in -- at Juniper. There are use cases that require quite a lot of flexibility, software sophistication and so on that we capture with products like vMX. And the MX has an incredible amount of flexibility and features that are very sticky in our customer networks. And for that reason, the barriers to entry, I guess, can be somewhat higher. Then there are more streamlined routing use cases and opportunities that we go after with more efficient products for pure routing or transport like the PTX. Nothing new, this is something that we almost invented just a few years ago with the introduction of the PTX product line. And now we're enhancing the PTX product line to go out after those streamlined opportunities even more aggressively. And last but not least, there is the introduction of our spines, which actually opens up a brand-new opportunity for us to compete in the cloud provider space. And that's exactly what we're doing. I think if you aggregate all of these opportunities together and you include the competitive pressures that will exist in the market, the opportunity for us is something that we are very excited about and we're competing effectively for."

That compounded with our ERP transition that we mentioned, did really nothing to help our visibility. In fact, we were system down for a few weeks in January. So it was largely as we expected early but down. But it just never came back as quickly as we thought it would. We really thought the pickup from a linearity perspective would happen mid-quarter and really happened late quarter.

On Lenovo, we, too, are excited about the potential for this partnership. It's still early days in terms of doing the things that are necessary from a go-to-market and an R&D standpoint to go after the broad opportunity. It is -- really, it hinges on the convergence of compute, storage and networking. And as you probably know, there is a class of customer that wants a packaged solution that includes all of these elements, plus the orchestration software. So a key part of our strategy with Lenovo is to develop solutions that are essentially turnkey in nature, that will help our customers get to an automated data center far quicker. It is a global partnership, but certainly, we expect it to help us in China, where Lenovo enjoys particular strength. And in terms of the timing, I think this is going to take several quarters for us to do what's necessary, both in terms of the technology integration as well as the go-to-market enablement and training that needs to happen to tap into the full opportunity. And again, I am quite excited about the potential for this opportunity. OpenStack, you're right, the conference just took place a short while ago. Juniper, just as we have in the past, was there in full force with a number of key speaking slots. We're very proud of the fact that our SDN controller got voted for the third time in a row as the #1 deployed SDN controller worldwide. And we see this firsthand in terms of the telco as well as the large-scale enterprises that we're engaging in, with, on next-generation automated data center architectures. And it's a -- we have just a fantastic team, a great product that I'm just very excited about.

But there are, not to be underestimated, many customers that require a lot of complex encapsulations and decapsulations and complex routing functions that require a great deal of flexibility right down to the hardware that can only be captured with a class of product like vMX. The key point here for us is, we have the most complete portfolio of tools at our disposal right now between the MX, the PTX and the QFX to compete very effectively, irrespective of what the architectural approach that our customers have in mind. And that holds true for any of our competitors in the market."

Despite a challenging start to the year, we delivered both revenue and earnings per share growth on a year-on-year basis. The macro volatility we saw in the beginning of the year resulted in customers taking a cautious approach in the enterprise. 
In addition, we experienced unanticipated delays in certain service provider deployments, which impacted revenue in the quarter. As we entered the June quarter, we are encouraged by improved visibility with respect to the timing of these deployments as well as some early and important design wins with our new products. We remain constructive on the full year 2016 and intend to continue to make progress towards our long-term financial model. 
Let's turn now to some highlights of the business. We continued to execute our strategy with significant advancements in performance in automation across a number of key solution areas. First, with the introduction of our QFX10008 spine switch, which became generally available last quarter, customers can now enjoy the most complete and compelling solution for the cloud we've ever had. Our cloud solution now includes best-in-class switching products across all layers of the data center: the most flexible data center edge routing product, our industry-leading MX universal edge router; the industry's highest performance data center perimeter security solution, our high-end SRX; and increasingly essential network orchestration software, our Contrail SDN controller, which, once again, was just voted by the OpenStack community as the most widely used, commercially available controller in the world for the third consecutive time.
Second, our solution for wide area IP transport across data center interconnect, metro and core is now unparalleled with the introduction of our newest PTX line card, coupled with our multilayer optimization controller, NorthStar, which we expect to soon combine with optical technology and talent from BTI Systems. We are innovating across layers of IP and optical, much of it via software, and in so doing, we expect to create new levels of network efficiency and operational simplicity for our customers. This is our strength and leverages our heritage in a way that is highly aligned with how we believe network will evolve over time.
We also introduced Juniper's software-defined secure network that leverages our recently shipping security product like Sky Advanced Threat Prevention, an innovative, cloud-based, phase [ph] 0, anti-malware ATP solution, and our refreshed, branch-focused and midrange SRX platform. Unlike the current status quo, it is a unique approach in the industry that embraces the principles of SDN and leverages the full capabilities of the entire network for threat protection and enforcement. 
To complement our solution portfolio, we also solidified several new partnerships, including a global strategic partnership with Lenovo, to build next-generation converged data center solutions for enterprise and web scale customers. We also expanded our global alliances with NEC and Amdocs to deliver NFV-based solution that allow service providers and enterprises to gain greater service agility through automation. 
We look forward to sharing more about our important partnerships and go-to-market strategy with you at our upcoming Investor Day in New York. 
Now let me touch on the performance for the first quarter of each of the 3 elements of our business: security, routing and switching. In security, we had a tough quarter. In addition to general weakness in enterprise and telecom, we are also now in the midst of several product transitions that affected demand to some of our older SRX security products. 
In Q1, we delivered several new security solutions, including enhanced SRX products targeting the distributed enterprise an vastly enhanced version of our security director management software and Sky Advanced Threat Prevention. I have said before that as we grow this area of our business, we expect it to take time and be a bit bumpy along the way. But I feel good about the long-term road map we're executing on and the confidence that we are building with our customers and partners. Security remains an important part of the solutions we sell to our customers, who depend on Juniper to make the successful transition to the cloud. 
In routing, we saw solid growth from our cloud customers as they continue to build out their networks to cope with significant IP traffic growth. Our PTX ExpressPlus product, which began shipping late last quarter, are already seeing strong interest from a number of customers, including several going through beta cycles as well as several important design wins.
I'm pleased with our performance with switching, where we saw year-over-year revenue growth, driven by the cloud data center use case, which continues to be a key focus area for us. We believe that we have a good pipeline for the QFX10000 switches, including the newest QFX10008 spine switch, which has already achieved design win with a number of telecom and cloud provider customers. 
There is no shortage of change occurring in this competitive landscape that we're in. While industry trends will continue to evolve, we believe our strategy will guide us in successfully navigating challenges and doing what is right for our customers. I remain very excited by all the new opportunities our investments and technology innovations are making possible. As I look ahead in 2016 and beyond, I believe that Juniper is well-positioned to create value for our shareholders on a consistent and sustained basis.
I want to sincerely thank our shareholders for their confidence, our customers for their trust and loyalty and our employees for their dedication and continuous improvement effort.
Now I'll turn it over to Ken."

Enterprise revenues were",706,"Thank you, Rami, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here today with all of you. I look forward to meeting with many of you in the upcoming days and weeks. 
The March quarter was challenging from a revenue perspective. Enterprise revenues were impacted by cautious customer buying patterns due to macroeconomic factors and, to a lesser extent, greater-than-anticipated weakness due to product transitions in the campus and branch security. 
Service provider revenues were impacted by the timing of deployments related to certain U.S. and EMEA Tier 1 telecoms. Despite some of the challenges this quarter, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth, led by increases in the Americas, primarily driven by cloud and cable providers, as well as growth in our government vertical across all geographies. 
Our revenue growth and effective management of our cost structure resulted in expanded non-GAAP operating margin and a $0.05 increase to diluted earnings per share on a year-over-year basis.
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were telecoms, 4 were cloud or cable providers, and 1 was an enterprise. Of these customers, 3 were located outside of the United States. This reflects our continued focus on diversifying our customer base. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with a product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a modest increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. 
As we disclosed in the Q4 2015 CFO commentary, we went live with our ERP system on January 18. Overall, we believe implementation has gone well. However, order processing and shipment linearity were affected in the quarter as we ramped up on the new system. This system change resulted in invoicing occurring later in the quarter than customary, which increased DSO by approximately 15 days. We anticipate DSO to return to our target range of 45 to 55 days in Q2 2016.
As is typical with ERP implementations of this magnitude, the stabilization of the new processes and system will take several months. We are confident that the system implementation will result in productivity improvements and efficiencies as we move forward. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $172 million, down $47 million year-over-year and up $55 million sequentially. We repurchased $75 million worth of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of the share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.75 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. 
Now moving on to our Q2 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. Our guidance includes the contribution from our acquisition of BTI Systems, which closed on April 1, 2016. We expect BTI to contribute approximately $10 million to $15 million of revenue and approximately $10 million of operating expenses in the second quarter. For the year, we expect the operations of BTI to be neutral to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. We plan to integrate BTI into our business and do not intend to break out financial details going forward. 
From a demand perspective, we expect an improvement in deployments from certain U.S. and EMEA Tier 1 telecoms. We also expect enterprise demand to improve modestly versus Q1 levels. The outlook factors in that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. 
For the full year, we are focused on driving long-term shareholder value and remain constructive on revenue growth for 2016. We will continue to prudently manage operating expenses and expect to expand operating margins in 2016. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
From a personal perspective, I'm very excited to work with Rami and the team as Juniper's CFO. I can tell you that I'm personally committed to the 2016 operating principles we outlined last quarter of driving revenue growth in our target markets, diligently managing operating expenses and expanding operating margins and maintaining a healthy balance sheet and an optimized capital structure. I look forward to further discussing our long-term financial strategy and outlook with you at our upcoming Investor Day.
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

It was a slow start to the year. We started to see a recovery throughout Q1, but it really hit near the very end of the quarter. So that gives us a bit more confidence going into the Q2 time frame. And, yes, we are looking at and expecting revenue increasing for the full year 2016 that, of course, means that we should have a good second half of the year. And we base that just based on the discussions we're having with our customers, timing of projects.

The QFX product line, we introduced the first version last year, the second version, which is the 2008 [ph], just this last -- or this quarter, and we're in the process now of essentially competing for various different opportunities. The one thing that I can say is, the opportunities that we are now competing in are opportunities that we never were able to compete with or even engage with our competitors on for various customers around the world. So the first positive thing is, we're expanding our opportunity, and it's -- that's very evident and it's very clear. Second, certainly, our customers have had these products in their labs now for several months, even before they started becoming generally available. And we've been getting feedback through betas, and we're integrating that feedback and making sure that the product is ready for general deployability. And then last, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there are some wins to speak of here that would give us confidence. So I think the products, even if you compare them to what is a changing competitive landscape, are very competitive, both from the standpoint of scale and performance, but also just in terms of the full capability of layer 2 and layer 3 that we've integrated into those switches. Your question around the timing of the 10016 is it's in the second half of this year is when we anticipate it. So we're already bidding it in certain RFPs that require that sort of density. And certainly, the effort and the work that we put into the 10008 has gone into -- will go towards the work that's remaining in the 10016. So I feel good about the products all up.

We're going to continue to manage OpEx very prudently, particularly when revenue is under pressure. So you could count on us continue to do that. I also should note that over the past couple of years, we have increased the proportion of variable cost. That's a component to our operating expense. So that's also an additional lever that we have to help us manage operating margins as we go forward. We'll continue to drive towards our long-term model of 39% of OpEx as a percentage of revenue."

From a ERP implementation, we're actually proud of the fact we went live with the new system. It actually went quite well. We don't believe it had a meaningful impact to revenue. That said, it did have an impact to the timing of orders and shipments. So that's really why it really made the quarter back-end-loaded. Q1 is typically a pretty back-end-loaded quarter anyway, but with the system implementation, it became more so. And it's primarily because we were effectively down for the first 2 or 3 weeks in the quarter. And as we went live with the new system on January 18, it did take some ramp-up time, not only from a system perspective but just from a procedure and process perspective.

So, certainly, I think it's fair to say that the telecom operators, U.S., maybe elsewhere around the world as well, have -- are off to a fairly slow start this year in terms of their CapEx expenditures. There are a number of factors that play here, whether it's M&A or spectrum or just reevaluating their overall network architectures and making sure that they are developing their networks to meet the future demands from an agility, from an operational simplicity standpoint and from an ability to deliver next-generation capabilities to their end users. I think the most important thing for Juniper now is to make sure that we are working and engaging with telecom operators very effectively in ensuring that we remain relevant in the new architecture that they're deploying. This is where our -- the combination of our switching, our routing and our orchestration software, and, namely, this is Contrail, is really helping us tremendously. So I feel good that we're engaging in a way that is going to enable us to benefit from the spend that they will end up putting into these next-generation architectures. Until then, I think they're going to continue to run their networks hotter and essentially free up the capacity and the management cycles within their organizations to develop those next-gen architectures. The other thing that we must do is to continue to diversify our portfolio. We saw real strength in Q4 in the cable operators; in Q1, cloud operators. And I can tell you that the products that we're developing and we've introduced into the markets have a broad applicability and have been developed with a very keen eye on the requirements of each of those strategic verticals, cable, cloud, strategic enterprises and telcos. But I think the telco space is just a little bit more complicated right now as they evolve their architectures."

First and foremost, there was a slow start from a macro standpoint. And as we said, it did improve but improved only near the end of the Q1 time frame. It's not the only factor. I think there were product transitions that affected us as well, affected us, quite frankly, more than what we had expected. The areas where those product transitions, I think, hurt us in the Q1 time frame were mostly in cloud, where we had some transitions in our -- sorry, it's not cloud, I should say campus, where we had transitions in our switching product lines, in particular, the EX, and also in security, where, as you know in security, we have, for the last year, been executing on a new strategy. We have been delivering new products to our customers, and I feel very good about those products. But we've also taken a bit of an aggressive stance toward end-of-life-ing some of our older SRX products, with the goal of ensuring that we have maximal capacity, engineering and go-to-market to think about the newer products, the next-generation products, things like the virtual products, the cloud-based security products.

So in thinking about security, it's probably useful to reflect back on 2015. We started with a refocused strategy, and we executed on new products, first, focusing on the surface provider space, the high-end of the security market, where we actually saw some good momentum last year. And we certainly saw a lot of great enhancements in the product set itself. The thing about the service provider element of our security business is that it's lumpy. And there are a couple of things that impacted us in the Q1 time frame. First is, we got hit with the downwards part of the lump, if you will, on the SP side, where there weren't any large orders from the service provider or cloud space for those high-end customers. Again, it's a part of the business that's just difficult to predict, that's going to be somewhat lumpy. And then there were the transitions that we had to deal with in the Q1 time frame. We have recently introduced a new set of security products for the enterprise, SRX1500, the SRX300, a cloud-based ATP solution an enhanced cloud management system that I know are all hitting the mark with our customers because we're getting that feedback. But it's going to take some time to get all of the transitions worked out. I -- you're right in stating that last year was supposed to be a year of stability. We ended up actually exceeding our expectations in that time frame. I think where I might have gotten wrong -- or what I might have gotten wrong is the timing. I think we expected some of those transition issues to happen last year. They're -- it looks like they're happening more in the first part of this year. And I feel good about the strategy all up. I feel good about the execution right now. We just have to work through these transition issues throughout this year. We're off to a slow start. So I'm not confused about the fact that there is a deficit to work through on the security side to get back to growth. But I think we were reasonably conservative enough in our long-term outlook -- 3-year outlook of 1% to 3% ending in the 2017 time frame, that, that is still very much achievable."

Not confused about the fact that we are going to see or we're seeing competition in this area. I mean, it's a very attractive market, and so competition is to be expected. And I would think about it from a couple of different ways. There are sort of different use cases that we go after in -- at Juniper. There are use cases that require quite a lot of flexibility, software sophistication and so on that we capture with products like vMX. And the MX has an incredible amount of flexibility and features that are very sticky in our customer networks. And for that reason, the barriers to entry, I guess, can be somewhat higher. Then there are more streamlined routing use cases and opportunities that we go after with more efficient products for pure routing or transport like the PTX. Nothing new, this is something that we almost invented just a few years ago with the introduction of the PTX product line. And now we're enhancing the PTX product line to go out after those streamlined opportunities even more aggressively. And last but not least, there is the introduction of our spines, which actually opens up a brand-new opportunity for us to compete in the cloud provider space. And that's exactly what we're doing. I think if you aggregate all of these opportunities together and you include the competitive pressures that will exist in the market, the opportunity for us is something that we are very excited about and we're competing effectively for."

But on this call, it sounds as though things were kind of bad at the beginning of the quarter and that things picked up over the course of it, partially because of the ERP, but also partially because of the end market. As I recall, from the last call, it sounded as though you -- at the time of the last call, in late January, you hadn't actually seen stuff or your customers erode their order patterns yet, but you were taking your guidance down a little bit just to be prudent. So that would suggest that things would have gotten worse over the course of the quarter. So could you help us square that away?"

So at the time of the call, our visibility into actual results for the Q1 were relatively low, as we'd expect them to be given that point in the quarter and the seasonality or the linearity within the quarter, I should say. That compounded with our ERP transition that we mentioned, did really nothing to help our visibility. In fact, we were system down for a few weeks in January. So it was largely as we expected early but down. But it just never came back as quickly as we thought it would. We really thought the pickup from a linearity perspective would happen mid-quarter and really happened late quarter. And that's really our traditional pattern as we start slow and start picking up in the middle. And in this particular quarter, it didn't pick up quite as quickly as we thought it would."

On Lenovo, we, too, are excited about the potential for this partnership. It's still early days in terms of doing the things that are necessary from a go-to-market and an R&D standpoint to go after the broad opportunity. It is -- really, it hinges on the convergence of compute, storage and networking. And as you probably know, there is a class of customer that wants a packaged solution that includes all of these elements, plus the orchestration software. So a key part of our strategy with Lenovo is to develop solutions that are essentially turnkey in nature, that will help our customers get to an automated data center far quicker. It is a global partnership, but certainly, we expect it to help us in China, where Lenovo enjoys particular strength. And in terms of the timing, I think this is going to take several quarters for us to do what's necessary, both in terms of the technology integration as well as the go-to-market enablement and training that needs to happen to tap into the full opportunity. And again, I am quite excited about the potential for this opportunity. OpenStack, you're right, the conference just took place a short while ago. Juniper, just as we have in the past, was there in full force with a number of key speaking slots. We're very proud of the fact that our SDN controller got voted for the third time in a row as the #1 deployed SDN controller worldwide. And we see this firsthand in terms of the telco as well as the large-scale enterprises that we're engaging in, with, on next-generation automated data center architectures. And it's a -- we have just a fantastic team, a great product that I'm just very excited about. And in terms of OpenStack itself and the deployments and the acceptance of OpenStack in the market, we're seeing some increasing interest in customers that want to go down the OpenStack path as opposed to other offerings that are out there."

We delivered a solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2016 as we navigated through a challenging macro environment. Total revenue was $1,221,000,000, stronger than the outlook we provided and up sequentially across all geographies, technologies end sectors. Services revenue was again solid, up 11% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. We also delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially with operating income up 37%, operating margin up 3 points and diluted EPS up 57% on a GAAP basis. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was up 30%. Operating margin was up 3 points and diluted EPS was up 35%. I am proud of the disciplined executions from our team. And as we look ahead, I remain confident that our strategy and differentiated portfolio will enable us to achieve our long-term target. I'll talk a bit about the progress we are making with our highly focused strategy to be the worldwide leader of network innovation. From a technology perspective, our agenda is focused on 2 important dimensions. The first is scale and performance, and the second is automation through software innovation.
On the dimension of automation. We believe it is the key attribute required for our customers to achieve vast levels of agility and efficiency in delivering services over their networks. Automation is fundamental not just to Juniper, but to the health of our entire industry and it is the most important attribute of our newly announced cloud-enabled brand solution, which we believe will allow enterprises and managed services providers alike to deliver on-demand Cloud services seamlessly. A critical technology element of our cloud-enabled brand solution is Contrail, a powerful tool for network virtualization and automation that is enabling our customers IT and business evolution to the cloud. 
In both the enterprise and service providers sectors, we already have multiple multimillion dollar Contrail deployment. We see many unique opportunities and growth drivers for Contrail. One of the most interesting and forward-looking use cases pertains to the Internet of Things enabling virtualized and secure connectivity to vast members of connected devices. For example, a Tier 1 telco has deployed Contrail for its NFC platform that not only virtualizes many of its networking application, but also enabled at-scale deployment of connected car services such as real-time mapping, traffic, news and music streaming. 
Similarly, we have been also in production for over a year now with the large industrial conglomerate who's industrial Internet allows it and its partners to perform data mining and data collection from various machines like wind turbines, jet engines, elevators and MRI scanners. We are also seeing increased momentum with managed service providers, leveraging our open platforms for FDN and NFV. We believe we are in a unique position to help them achieve new levels of agility and cost optimization and offer their enterprise customers best-of-breed technology choices without the complexity that typically comes from managing multi vendor solution. 
Some great examples of our momentum include: Verizon, which selected our Cloud CPE solution as the foundational platform for its virtual network services; Orange business services, which is now using our Contrail SDN Controller for it's easy go network as a service offering; and AT&T, which is offering Juniper's virtual routing function as an option for its Enterprise customers looking for on demand virtualized network services. The scale and performance of routing, switching and security continue to be a fundamental importance to our customers who are constantly trying to stay ahead of network traffic growth and trying to do so economically. 
Innovating in dimension has been our hallmark since the inception of this company with the breakthrough products like DM40, DMX and the PTX, but over the years have redefined the economics of networking. As bandwidth intensive applications continue to soar and the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the need to continue to innovate in the dimension of scale and performance is only increasing in time, and we also believe there is still plenty of room for that innovation both in systems and in intelligent software that enables more efficient use of network capacity. 
To that end, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our NorthStar Controller, that optimizes across both packet and optical demand dynamically and in real time, unlocking new levels of capacity in our customers network. Technology is only part of the challenge in any network transformation. Having the right skills is a big,if not a bigger challenge. That's why we recently announced the expansion of our successful open live program with 6 new locations across North America, Europe and Asia, which will provide customers and partners with a range of resources to build and learn about emerging virtualization and automation technology. 
Now moving on, I'd like to comment on our Routing, Switching and Security business this quarter. In routing. We are very pleased with the diversification across geographies, verticals and product mix. Many customers are enthusiastically embracing our newest MX and PTX products. Our PTX line grew sequentially and year-over-year to reach record revenue with core network deployments across our cloud, telco and cable customers. As our customers migrate from 10 gig to 100 gig connection, we believe our technology leadership in both the core and edge network layers gives us a clear competitive advantage to gain market share. 
In Switching. We saw strength in the data center across telco, cable, cloud provider, hosting and Enterprise customers. Our QFX10000 family of switchings is ramping well and we see a solid pipeline in the second half of the year. In Security, we did experience another difficult quarter as we continued to work hard to turn around this component of our business. As I've said before, our strategy and product transition are going to take time to play out and will result in some lumpiness in the business. We remain committed to developing and delivering to our customers complete and differentiated demand level solutions for the Cloud, SD mobile and Enterprise network that includes elements of routing, switching and security all working tightly together.
We are operating in a difficult macro environment that has been affected by recent economic and geopolitical volatility. However, we remain focused on what we can control and believe that solid execution, coupled with a strong portfolio of solution, will position us to navigate through effects on spending patterns in the future. We are continuing to make balanced decisions between growth and profitability while making investments that best position us to address the network's most critical networking need. We remain focused on driving long-term sustainable growth while generating strong cash flow. And we continue to focusing in managing our business prudently while strengthening our investments in scale, performance and automation through software innovation. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and employees for their continuing dedication as we move along our journey. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing support and investment. Now I'll turn it over to Ken for his comments."

Sequentially, revenue grew across all technologies, geographies and markets. Enterprise growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter, was driven by improved spending patterns following a cautious Q1. Service provider revenue grew 6% sequentially, primarily driven by telecom deployments and an increase in revenue from cloud providers. Our services business continued to be strong with solid growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter. 5 were telecoms, 4 were cloud providers and 1 was an enterprise. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with a product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a strong increase in product deferred revenue of year-over-year and sequentially. In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $354 million, up $91 million year-over-year and up $182 million, sequentially. We repurchased 126 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.91 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. While I'm pleased with the overall results, the macro environment in Q2 was more challenging than we originally anticipated and gross margins came in below our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins were 63%, down 7/10 [ph] sequentially. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by elevated pricing pressure primarily in EMEA as well as product mix, this was partially offset by improvement in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. Now moving on to Q3 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We remain constructive on our revenue for 2016 and expect modest growth despite the current macro environment. We will continue to prudently manage our operating expenses. However, we expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q2 levels in the near term. As a result, we expect operating margins for the full year 2016 to decline slightly relative to the full year of 2015. 
We are confident in our long-term model and remain focused on growth and operating margin expansion. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And now with that, I'd like to open the call up for questions."

With respect to gross margins. It's more of the latter thing that you discussed, okay? This is more around the macro concerns in Europe in particular. And that is primarily a result of foreign exchange. So something we had been thinking about and monitoring closely in order to offset the dollar exchange, weaker euro, and additional discounting was something that we had thought was necessary and we're seeing it play out. And then there is yes, there's a secondary component, which is product mix. I just want to say 2 additional things before I pass it on to Ken. First is, I think we demonstrated in Q2 that despite the fact that we saw weaker-than-expected gross margins, we were able to tightly control our operating expenses to protect our operating margin. So I'm proud of the discipline that we saw in terms of execution from the team. And you can expect more of that going forward. And the second thing is, as we look at the innovation of our products across all of our portfolio products, that include the new products that we're introducing to the market now. One of the things that we've always focused on and will continue to focus on is the innovation that goes into the reduction of the COGS -- the cost of goods sold per second of routing, switching and security. and I view that as something that will be helpful certainly as a tailwind in the future as we see those products ramp up.

So an example of that, that we saw in Q2 was the BTI acquisition. Though we expect the acquisition to result in neutral earnings for the year, it did have a slight impact -- negative impact to both gross margin and operating margin for the second quarter, for example, the product mix that hit us in Q2. In addition to that, I mean there's a lot of different product mix contributors whether it chasse versus line cards as a percentage of software. So product mix could result in either headwinds are tailwinds. At this point, I think we're definitely not giving up on our long-term model of 64%, we're focused on delivering innovation and delivering our cost structure improvements. And we'll go forward from here."

I think what we're seeing here is this strategy of focusing very deliberately on data centers and cloud buildouts pay off for us. In terms of verticals, the strength in telcos, in Cloud and especially Q2, we saw a strong government sector as well play out for us nicely. We've -- we have said consistently that the new products despite switches, the 10K switches are mostly going to contribute to revenue in the second half. And that remains the case. There certainly some orders and early revenue that came in in Q2 time frame. But right now, I would characterize the situation we're in as we're competing aggressively for net new wins, new opportunities. And the nice thing that I'm observing now is that we are able to compete in opportunities that we were never able to compete in historically because of the lack of having this important part of the end-to-end switching portfolio. Last thing, I'll just say is there are some transitions that are happening in the data centers space as our customers go from 10 gig and 40 gig to 25 gig and 100 gig. I think that plays out nicely because at the end of the day, these data centers are essentially becoming high-performance networking problems that are Layer 3 in nature. That's exactly the kind of really high-performance problem that I think Juniper loves to solve."

Certainly, it's a question that has come up. I think at the end of the day, the things that matters the most to our customers across all verticals, including the Cloud vertical is -- are the capabilities of the products and the solutions themselves from the standpoint of flexibility, Layer 3 stack capabilities, the density and performance, the price per port et cetera. And I will just say that I am very comfortable with where we are today based on the technology decision that we have made historically that includes silicon decisions. And if you recall what I had mentioned in our last analyst event, I sort of categorized the market in 3 distinct buckets. There are those that care about very flexible routing with a lot of features and a lot of flexibility and programmability. Those that care more about LAN transport white their network transport efficiency and those that care about cost efficiency as it pertains to switching. And I don't think that we have ever been this strong across all 3 of those domains today with our product portfolio. Now going forward, we will constantly be evaluating what we do internally in terms of developing our own silicon technology and what we can get from merchants silicon vendors and making the right decisions based on the capability that we can get internally versus those that we can do internally and that's exactly what we're doing right now. So net-net, this a competitive industry. We've never lost sight of that. But I'm comfortable with where we are from a technology standpoint and our ability to compete."

So that's actually something that we are happy about. I think that if I look at the routing opportunity -- the last thing -- the second thing I would say about revenues is just from a demand routing standpoint, our bookings were strong. A lot of the deferred revenue that we saw in Q2 was also connected to routing. So that gives us confidence in the second half of the year as it pertains to routing. Certainly, there's a cloud, there's a telco, there's a cable component to our Routing business. I feel good about the Cloud component. I think that the new products are going to have a big role in the Cloud provider network. And I think that, that should start in the second half the year. Telco is a bit more of a mixed message. I think if I look at a global opportunity, there are certainly good opportunity especially in international for our routing products that includes the MX and the new PTX products. I think visibility for Tier 1 telcos in particular for the second half remain somewhat challenging. I think on the Enterprise side, we saw good -- very good in fact, sequential recovery in Q2 that was across switching and routing. And I feel pretty good about that in the second half as well. So I think there is actually quite a lot of good things happening from a routing standpoint if you factor in the opportunities as the refresh cycle that we're undertaking right now, and thank you for reminding me, Ken. There was a secondary question about security. So security, sequentially up over Q1. But certainly, nowhere near what it would need to be for us to be happy or content with the performance of this business. We're disappointed in the results. I think this is a business that is right now in transition. And I expect it to be in transition for the remainder of this year. As I've always said that this transition is going to be somewhat lumpy in terms of how the business is going to perform. Last year, I'd say that the performance was better than my expectations. It was largely driven by some large telco and cloud deployments that this year haven't really played out yet to offset some of the transitions that we are executing on in the Enterprise side. And that's where the focus is. I think we have a very compelling and competitive provider solution for high-bandwidth security obligations. It's true also for the cloud, the part of the business that requires more attention and focus and the one that we're actually going to need attention and focus today is on the Enterprise side. The feedback that we're getting from our partners, our customers on the road map, on the products that we have introduced thus far, is very encouraging. But there is still tons of execution for us to work through through the rest of this year. And I expect the growth to happen next year."

So we are thinking about this from an overall architectural standpoint, how the technologies tied together, and of course, then positioning security along with the routing and switching. So I think that's playing out already quite nicely on the Cloud side. From an Enterprise standpoint, Enterprise Campus and so on, there is still more featured products to develop. New hardware to release into the market to get the cost per bit or the price per bit more competitive in the security space.

The vulnerability that you discussed is at this point, largely behind us. We took the matter very seriously. We did a very thorough internal review to make sure that the vulnerability was very specific to our old legacy ScreenOS security products and made sure that there is no such effect on the -- and we, in fact, invited a third-party company to come in and help us with this assessment, but there's no vulnerability on the Juno side. We were open with our customers, and I think we got a lot of kudos from our customers on how we handled the situation. I'm not saying that it has had no effect, but I think the team did a good job of minimizing any effects. Right now, I think the main issue with security is -- there is a critical mass of new products, new features, new technology. We need to get into the market to be able to go after the largest market opportunity that exists. Right now, we're competitive. But in specific areas in use cases, and we need to be competitive in a broader set of use cases and security. That's what we're absolutely maniacally focused on. On security, the thing you should notice as I mentioned, there is a strong revenue synergy associated with switching and routing. But there's also an equally strong cost synergy because much of the innovation that we put into switching and routing, also contributes to our security product portfolio. On your question related to our partners, Nokia and Ericsson. There's no real new news there. I think both of these customers we -- or these partners, we have talked about how the volume of business, it's still relatively small percentage of our overall revenue as a company. It has been on the decline well before some of the acquisitions and partnerships that have been announced. And that's primarily because Juniper has been taken its destiny into it's own hands. So in Europe for example, the theater that you mentioned, we have over the years, been taking more and more of the Tier 1 telecom operators to a direct model, direct engagement model. And that has played out well for us in terms of the business -- the strategic nature of the relationships with those customers. Net-net, I think between the deliberate strategy that we're taking to go direct with certain customers that we need to go direct, especially those that have volume business that's large enough as well as the partnerships that we have available today whether it be with any fee or with Ericsson or with IBM or with Amdocs, I am not concerned at all about our ability to reach our customers in EMEA or elsewhere in the world."

We have been executing at Juniper at a very deliberate strategy of focusing on where the growth is and where we can differentiate the most in the switching area. And that is on the Enterprise IT data centers, in private cloud and public Cloud. And that's why we've seen our Switching business performed very well. We do go after campus opportunities. But we mostly limit ourselves and our focus on the largest campuses that are typically very mission-critical and the on ramp to the Cloud. And we also of course, focus on customers that are able and willing to pick best-of-breed decisions between wired and wireless, right?

Absolutely, which is why it is so important for us to continue to focus on cost of goods sold improvements in our products, innovate in the area of ensuring that we can compete very effectively in those 3 different use cases that I mentioned just previously around the rich routing, lean routing and switching with -- and also to preserve our long-term targets for gross margins. And based on everything that I know that innovations and the technologies that we're developing in the company, the plan that we had going forward, I feel comfortable that, that can be done. I think soft -- from a software standpoint, we had provided guidance that by the 20 -- 2019 time frame, we will see that around 45% of our overall revenue is going to come from software and services.

From a software, Rami's right, the 45% was our long-term model of our services in software, just to levels that folks we had about 3% of our business was software last year.

We're not breaking out the exact math, but they both had roughly an equal impact to call it traditional 64% or our long-term model of 64 versus the 63 result.

We want to make sure that we're in the middle of this architecture transformation that's happening so that once they start to prove out the model and to make revenue -- and to start growing their virtualized solution business that we benefit from then. And I would say that although the revenue contribution to Juniper is still very small, the opportunity is very large in the future. And I think we're in many cases in coal position in working and developing these solutions for our customers. I know SD LAN is sort of a very big topic these days, I think our best and most immediate opportunity is to support and help our service provider and telco customers in developing very effective agile cost competitive solutions that will help them in competing effectively with the stand-alone point player SD LAN players that are out there.

We delivered a solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2016 as we navigated through a challenging macro environment. Total revenue was $1,221,000,000, stronger than the outlook we've provided and up sequentially across all geographies, technologies and sectors. Services revenue was again solid, up 11% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. We also delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, with operating income up 37%, operating margin up 3 points and diluted EPS up 57% on a GAAP basis. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was up 30%. Operating margin was up 3 points and diluted EPS was up 35%. I am proud of the disciplined executions from our team, and as we look ahead, I remain confident that our strategy and differentiated portfolio will enable us to achieve our long-term target. 
I'll talk a bit about the progress we are making with our highly focused strategy to be the worldwide leader of network innovation. From a technology perspective, our agenda is focused on 2 important dimensions. The first is scale and performance, and the second is automation through software innovation.
On the dimension of automation. We believe it is the key attribute required for our customers to achieve vast new levels of agility and efficiency in delivering services over their networks. Automation is fundamental not just to Juniper but to the health of our entire industry, and it is the most important attribute of our newly announced cloud-enabled brand solution, which we believe will allow enterprises and managed services providers alike to deliver on-demand Cloud services seamlessly. 
A critical technology element of our cloud-enabled brand solution is Contrail, a powerful tool for network virtualization and automation that is enabling our customers' IT and business evolution to the cloud. 
In both the enterprise and service provider sectors, we already have multiple multi-million dollar Contrail deployment. We see many unique opportunities and growth drivers for Contrail. One of the most interesting and forward-looking use cases pertains to the Internet of Things, enabling virtualized and secure connectivity to vast members of connected devices. 
For example, a tier 1 telco has deployed Contrail for its NFC platform that not only virtualizes many of its networking application but also enabled at-scale deployment of connected car services such as real-time mapping, traffic, news and music streaming. 
Similarly, we have been also in production for over a year now with the large industrial conglomerate who's industrial Internet allows it and its partners to perform data mining and data collection from various machines like wind turbines, jet engines, elevators and MRI scanners. We are also seeing increased momentum with managed service providers, leveraging our open platforms for SDN and NFV. We believe we are in a unique position to help them achieve new levels of agility and cost optimization and offer their enterprise customers best-of-breed technology choices without the complexity that typically comes from managing multi-vendor solution. 
Some great examples of our momentum include: Verizon, which selected our Cloud CPE solution as the foundational platform for its virtual network services; Orange Business Services, which is now using our Contrail SDN Controller for it's easy-go network-as-a-service offering; and AT&T, which is offering Juniper's virtual routing function as an option for its enterprise customers looking for on-demand virtualized network services. 
The scale and performance of routing, switching and security continue to be fundamentally important to our customers who are constantly trying to stay ahead of network traffic growth and trying to do so economically. 
Innovating in mid dimension has been our hallmark since the inception of this company with breakthrough products, like the M40, the MX and the PTX that, over the years, have redefined the economics of networking. As bandwidth-intensive applications continue to soar and the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the need to continue to innovate in the dimension of scale and performance is only increasing in time, and we also believe there's still plenty of room for that innovation, both in systems and in intelligent software that enables more efficient use of network capacity. 
To that end, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our NorthStar Controller, that optimizes across both packet and optical domains dynamically and in real time, unlocking new levels of capacity in our customers' network. 
Technology is only part of the challenge in any network transformation. Having the right skills is a big, if not a bigger challenge. That's why we've recently announced the expansion of our successful open live program with 6 new locations across North America, Europe and Asia, which will provide customers and partners with a range of resources to build and learn about emerging virtualization and automation technology. 
Now moving on, I'd like to comment on our routing, switching and security business this quarter. 
In routing, we are very pleased with the diversification across geographies, verticals and product mix. Many customers are enthusiastically embracing our newest MX and PTX products. Our PTX line grew sequentially and year-over-year to reach record revenue with core network deployments across our cloud, telco and cable customers. As our customers migrate from 10-gig to 100-gig connection, we believe our technology leadership in both the core and edge network layers gives us a clear competitive advantage to gain market share. 
In switching, we saw strength in the data center across telco, cable, cloud provider, hosting and Enterprise customers. Our QFX10000 family of spine switching is ramping well, and we see a solid pipeline in the second half of the year. 
In security, we did experience another difficult quarter as we continue to work hard to turn around this component of our business. As I've said before, our strategy and product transition are going to take time to play out and will result in some lumpiness in the business. We remain committed to developing and delivering to our customers complete and differentiated domain level solutions for the cloud, SP mobile and enterprise network that include elements of routing, switching and security, all working tightly together.
We are operating in a difficult macro environment that has been affected by recent economic and geopolitical volatility. However, we remain focused on what we can control and believe that solid execution, coupled with a strong portfolio of solution, will position us to navigate through effects on spending patterns in the future. 
We are continuing to make balanced decisions between growth and profitability while making investments that best position us to address our  customers' most critical networking need. We remain focused on driving long-term sustainable growth while generating strong cash flow. And we continue to focusing in managing our business prudently while strengthening our investments in scale, performance and automation through software innovation. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and employees for their continuing dedication as we move along our journey. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing support and investment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken for his comments."

Sequentially, revenue grew across all technologies, geographies and markets. Enterprise growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter was driven by improved spending patterns following a cautious Q1. Service provider revenue grew 6% sequentially, primarily driven by telecom deployments and an increase in revenue from cloud providers. Our services business continued to be strong with solid growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were telecoms, 4 were cloud or cable providers and 1 was an enterprise. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a strong increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $354 million, up $91 million year-over-year and up $182 million, sequentially. We've repurchased 126 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.91 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. 
While I'm pleased with the overall results, the macro environment in Q2 was more challenging than we originally anticipated, and gross margins came in below our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins were 63%, down 7/10 sequentially. 
The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by elevated pricing pressure primarily in EMEA as well as product mix. This was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. 
Now moving on to Q3 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We remain constructive on our revenue for 2016 and expect modest growth despite the current macro environment. We will continue to prudently manage our operating expenses. However, we expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q2 levels in the near term. As a result, we expect operating margins for the full year 2016 to decline slightly relative to the full year of 2015. 
We are confident in our long-term model and remain focused on growth and operating margin expansion. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

With respect to gross margins, it's more of the latter thing that you discussed, okay? This is more around the macro concerns in Europe, in particular, and that is primarily a result of foreign exchange. So something we had been thinking about and monitoring closely in order to offset the dollar exchange, weaker euro, and additional discounting was something that we had thought was necessary, and we're seeing it play out. 
And then there is, yes, the secondary component, which is product mix. I just want to say 2 additional things before I pass it on to Ken. First is, I think we demonstrated in Q2 that despite the fact that we saw weaker-than-expected gross margins, we were able to tightly control our operating expenses to protect our operating margin. So I'm proud of the discipline that we saw in terms of execution from the team. And you can expect more of that going forward. And the second thing is, as we look at the innovation of our products across all of our portfolio of products, and that includes the new products that we're introducing to the market now. One of the things that we've always focused on, and we will continue to focus on, is the innovation that goes into the reduction of the COGS, the cost of goods sold per bit per second of routing, switching and security. And I view that as something that will be helpful, certainly, as a tailwind in the future as we see those products ramp up. Ken?"

So an example of that, that we saw in Q2 was the BTI acquisition. Though we expect the acquisition to result in neutral earnings for the year, it did have a slight impact, negative impact, to both the gross margin and operating margin in the second quarter. That'd be an example of the product mix that hit us in Q2. 
In addition to that, I mean, there's a lot of different product mix contributors, whether it chassis versus line cards or percentage of software. So product mix could result in either headwinds or tailwinds. At this point, I think it's -- we're definitely not giving up on our long-term model of 64%.

I think what we're seeing here is this strategy of focusing very deliberately on data centers, and cloud buildouts pay off for us. In terms of verticals, the strength in telcos, in Cloud, and especially Q2, we saw a strong government sector as well play out for us nicely. 
We've -- we have said consistently that the new products, the spine switches, the 10K switches are mostly going to contribute to revenue in the second half, and that remains the case. There are certainly some orders and early revenue that came in Q2 time frame. But right now, I would characterize the situation we're in as we're competing aggressively for net new wins, new opportunities. And the nice thing that I'm observing now is that we are able to compete in opportunities that we were never able to compete in historically because of the lack of having this important part of the end-to-end switching portfolio. 
Last thing I'll just say is, there are some transitions that are happening in the data center space as our customers go from 10 gig and 40 gig to 25 gig and 100 gig. I think that plays out nicely because at the end of the day, these data centers are essentially becoming high-performance networking problems that are Layer 3 in nature. That's exactly the kind of really high-performance problem that, I think, Juniper loves to solve."

And I will just say that I am very comfortable with where we are today based on the technology decision that we have made historically that includes silicon decisions. And if you recall what I had mentioned in our last analyst event, if I sort of categorized the market in 3 distinct buckets, there are those that care about very flexible routing with a lot of features and a lot of flexibility and programmability. Those that care more about LAN transport, wider network transport efficiency and those that care about cost efficiency as it pertains to switching. And I don't think that we have ever been this strong across all 3 of those domains today with our product portfolio. Now going forward, we will constantly be evaluating what we do internally in terms of developing our own silicon technology and what we can get from merchants silicon vendors and making the right decisions based on the capabilities that we can get externally versus that, that we can do internally. And that's exactly what we're doing right now. So net-net, this a competitive industry. We've never lost sight of that. But I'm comfortable with where we are from a technology standpoint and our ability to compete."

And then from a revenue standpoint, actually, we're -- what we said is that we remain constructive on the full year from a revenue standpoint 2016 versus 2015.

On the routing, I think that we actually are encouraged by what we've seen in routing in terms of the sequential improvement from the Q1 standpoint. And we really saw this across all geos. So that's actually something that we are happy about. I think that if I look at the routing opportunity -- the last thing I would -- the second thing I would say about revenues is just from a demand metrics standpoint, our bookings were strong. A lot of the deferred revenue that we saw in Q2 was also connected to routing. So that gives us confidence in the second half of the year as it pertains to routing. Certainly, there's a cloud, there's a telco, there's a cable component to our routing business. I feel good about the cloud component. I think that the new products are going to have a big role in the cloud provider network, and I think that should start in the second half the year. 
Telco is a bit more of a mixed message, I think. If I look at the global opportunity, there are certainly good opportunities, especially in international, for our routing products that includes the MX and the new PTX products. I think visibility for Tier 1 telcos, in particular, for the second half remains somewhat challenging. 
I think on the enterprise side, we saw good -- very good, in fact, sequential recovery in Q2 that was across switching and routing, and I feel pretty good about that in the second half as well. 
So I think there is actually quite a lot of good things happening from a routing standpoint if you factor in the opportunities as the refresh cycle that we're undertaking right now. 
Oh, and thank you for reminding me, Ken. There was a secondary question about security. So security, sequentially up over Q1, but certainly, nowhere near what it would need to be for us to be happy or content with the performance of this business. We're disappointed in the results. I think this is a business that is, right now, in transition. And I expect it to be in transition for the remainder of this year. As I've always said that it's -- this transition is going to be somewhat lumpy in terms of how the business is going to perform. Last year, I'd say that the performance was better than my expectations. It was largely driven by some large telco and cloud deployments that this year haven't really played out yet to offset some of the transitions that we are executing on in the Enterprise side. And that's where the focus is. I think we have a very compelling and competitive service provider solution for high-bandwidth security applications. It's true also for the cloud. The part of the business that requires more attention and focus and the one that we're actually giving the attention and focus to today is on the enterprise side. The feedback that we're getting from our partners, our customers on the road map, on the products that we have introduced, thus far, is very encouraging. But there are still tons of execution for us to work through, through the rest of this year. And I expect the growth to happen next year."

What it's going to take is more execution on our part and a bit of time, to be honest. The security space is a very competitive space. The thing that, I think, Juniper can leverage to our advantage is the fact that we're really thinking about it from a solution standpoint. So as we go to our customers and help them build out a private cloud data center or hybrid cloud data center or things like on-premises Cloud CPE solutions, there is a security element to each and every one of those solution. So we are thinking about this from an overall architectural standpoint, how the technologies tie together, and of course, then positioning security along with the routing and switching. 
So I think that's playing out already quite nicely on the cloud side. From an enterprise standpoint, enterprise campus and so on, there's still more features to develop, new hardware to release into the market to get the cost per bit or the price per bit more competitive in the security space. And I think next year is the year where we'll have enough critical mass to start seeing a recovery in the business."

The vulnerability that you discussed is, at this point, largely behind us. We took the matter very seriously. We did a very thorough internal review to make sure that the vulnerability was very specific to our old legacy ScreenOS security products and made sure that there is no such effect on the -- and we, in fact, invited a third-party company to come in to help us with the assessment -- this assessment, that there is no vulnerability on the Junos side. We were open with our customers. And I think we got a lot of kudos from our customers on how we handled the situation. I'm not saying that it has had no effect, but I think that the team did a good job of minimizing any effects. 
Right now, I think the main issue with security is we -- there is a critical mass of new products, new features, new technology. We need to get into the market to be able to go after the largest market opportunity that exists. Right now, we're competitive. But in specific areas in use cases, and we need to be competitive in a broader set of use cases in security, that's what we're absolutely maniacally focused on. 
On security, the thing you should notice -- as I mentioned, there is a strong revenue synergy associated with switching and routing, but there's also an equally strong cost synergy because much of the innovation that we've put into switching and routing also contributes to our security product portfolio. 
On your question related to our partners, Nokia and Ericsson, there's no real new news there. I think with -- both of these customers, we -- or these partners, we have talked about how the volume of business, it's still -- it had relatively small percentage of our overall revenue as a company. It has been on the decline well before some of the acquisitions and partnerships that have been announced. And that's primarily because Juniper had been taking its destiny into it's own hands. So in Europe, for example, the theater that you mentioned, we have, over the years, been taking more and more of the Tier 1 telecom operators to a direct model, direct engagement model, and that has played out well for us in terms of the business and the strategic nature of the relationships with those customers. 
Net-net, I think between the deliberate strategy that we're taking to go direct with certain customers that we need to go direct, especially those that have volume business that's large enough as well as the partnerships that we have available today, whether it be with NEC or with Ericsson or with IBM or with Amdocs, I am not concerned at all about our ability to reach our customers in EMEA or elsewhere in the world."

And that is in enterprise IT data centers, in private cloud, in public Cloud. And that's why we've seen our switching business performed really well. 
We do go after campus opportunities, but we mostly limit ourselves and our focus on the largest campuses that are typically very mission-critical and on ramps to the cloud. And we also, of course, focus on customers that are able and willing to pick best-of-breed decisions between wired and wireless, right?

So I think where this is going to start to benefit both Juniper and Lenovo is next year. I remain optimistic and excited about the opportunity in working with Lenovo. As you know, there is a large part of the market that is interested in converged stack architectures and having really compelling servers, storage and networking working tightly together is something that I think is going to be helpful to our business."

So first of all, on the near-term, you talked about challenges in the EMEA region, but it doesn't look to me that we've seen all that much movement during the June quarter of the euro-to-dollar exchange rate pre the Brexit vote. So I'm just wondering whether this was an issue where it had been building up for some time and the competitor who sells in euros basically, you concluded, you had to respond that things wouldn't move back in your favor. And then when we look out to 2017, I think most of us expect you'll face a new competitor in routing, particularly in the data center. And we're wondering how that competitive dynamic could play out with a new entrant that it sounds like they will be somewhat aggressive on pricing. And then looking out even further, the last part of this gross margin trend is when does the soft business, the Contrail and NorthStar products, when did they become material enough to be a tailwind to gross margin?"

Let me start, and maybe I'll start with more of the 2017 competitive question that you have. First, I would say that this is not -- that competitive around new entrants into the market, introducing the sort of routing capability and so forth, that's not the issue that we're seeing in the Q3 and the Q2 time frame. Are we anticipating that this industry is going to be -- to continue to be competitive? Absolutely. Which is why it is so important for us to continue to focus on cost of goods sold improvements in our products to innovate in the area of ensuring that we can compete very effectively in those 3 different use cases that I mentioned just previously around the rich routing, lean routing and switching with -- and also to preserve our long-term targets for gross margins. And based on everything that I know that innovations and the technologies that we're developing in the company, the plan that we have going forward, I feel comfortable that, that can be done. 
I think soft -- from a software standpoint, we had provided guidance that by the 2019 time frame, we will see that around 45% of our overall revenue is going to come from software and services, and a lot of that is going to be in the area of recurring revenue in software. And I think that certainly helps us from a gross margin standpoint. I'll let Ken talk some more to that."

So it's really more of the long-term buildup of the FX concerns or the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, I should say. 
From the software, Rami's right. The 45% was our long-term model of services in software, just to level set, folks. We had about 3% of our business was software last year, and I would expect it to grow gradually between that and call it 15% to 20% if you presume services remains relatively stable. It'll be -- software standalone would be 3% today to 15% to 20% by 2019, and it should progress pretty gradually between now and then. We are seeing some benefit today, right? I mean, we talked about product mix. There are headwinds. There are tailwinds.

We're working on cost innovation, cost improvements, cost structure as well as product innovation, I should say, in making sure we sell the value of that. 
From a BTI perspective, I do expect BTI to ramp. And it does have a slight impact to gross margin percentage.

The other impact, we talked about pricing pressure as well as margin. We're not breaking out the exact math, but they both had roughly an equal impact to the, call it, traditional 64%, and our long-term model of 64% versus the 63% result. Our product mix really has the ability to go either way. In this particular quarter, it cost us a couple of cents and hurt us, but we do have chassis sales out there. We could fill up line cards.

We delivered a solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2016 as we navigated through a challenging macro environment. Total revenue was $1,221,000,000, stronger than the outlook we've provided and up sequentially across all geographies, technologies and sectors. Services revenue was again solid, up 11% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. We also delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, with operating income up 37%, operating margin up 3 points and diluted EPS up 57% on a GAAP basis. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was up 30%. Operating margin was up 3 points and diluted EPS was up 35%. I am proud of the disciplined executions from our team, and as we look ahead, I remain confident that our strategy and differentiated portfolio will enable us to achieve our long-term target. 
I'll talk a bit about the progress we are making with our highly focused strategy to be the worldwide leader of network innovation. From a technology perspective, our agenda is focused on 2 important dimensions. The first is scale and performance, and the second is automation through software innovation.
On the dimension of automation. We believe it is the key attribute required for our customers to achieve vast new levels of agility and efficiency in delivering services over their networks. Automation is fundamental not just to Juniper but to the health of our entire industry, and it is the most important attribute of our newly announced cloud-enabled brand solution, which we believe will allow enterprises and managed services providers alike to deliver on-demand Cloud services seamlessly. 
A critical technology element of our cloud-enabled brand solution is Contrail, a powerful tool for network virtualization and automation that is enabling our customers' IT and business evolution to the cloud. 
In both the enterprise and service provider sectors, we already have multiple multi-million dollar Contrail deployment. We see many unique opportunities and growth drivers for Contrail. One of the most interesting and forward-looking use cases pertains to the Internet of Things, enabling virtualized and secure connectivity to vast numbers of connected devices. 
For example, a tier 1 telco has deployed Contrail for its NFC platform that not only virtualizes many of its networking application but also enables at-scale deployment of connected car services such as real-time mapping, traffic, news and music streaming. 
Similarly, we have been also in production for over a year now with the large industrial conglomerate whose industrial Internet allows it and its partners to perform data mining and data collection from various machines like wind turbines, jet engines, elevators and MRI scanners. We are also seeing increased momentum with managed service providers, leveraging our open platforms for SDN and NFV. We believe we are in a unique position to help them achieve new levels of agility and cost optimization and offer their enterprise customers best-of-breed technology choices without the complexity that typically comes from managing multi-vendor solutions. 
Some great examples of our momentum include: Verizon, which selected our Cloud CPE solution as the foundational platform for its virtual network services; Orange Business Services, which is now using our Contrail SDN Controller for its easy-go network-as-a-service offering; and AT&T, which is offering Juniper's virtual routing function as an option for its enterprise customers looking for on-demand virtualized network services. 
The scale and performance of routing, switching and security continue to be of fundamental importance to our customers who are constantly trying to stay ahead of network traffic growth and trying to do so economically. 
Innovating in this dimension has been our hallmark since the inception of this company with breakthrough products, like the M40, the MX and the PTX that, over the years, have redefined the economics of networking. As bandwidth-intensive applications continue to soar and the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the need to continue to innovate in the dimension of scale and performance is only increasing in time, and we also believe there's still plenty of room for that innovation, both in systems and in intelligent software that enables more efficient use of network capacity. 
To that end, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our NorthStar Controller, that optimizes across both packet and optical domains dynamically and in real time, unlocking new levels of capacity in our customers' networks. 
Technology is only part of the challenge in any network transformation. Having the right skills is a big, if not a bigger challenge. That's why we've recently announced the expansion of our successful OpenLab program with 6 new locations across North America, Europe and Asia, which will provide customers and partners with a range of resources to build and learn about emerging virtualization and automation technology. 
Now moving on, I'd like to comment on our routing, switching and security business this quarter. 
In routing, we are very pleased with the diversification across geographies, verticals and product mix. Many customers are enthusiastically embracing our newest MX and PTX products. Our PTX line grew sequentially and year-over-year to reach record revenue with core network deployments across our cloud, telco and cable customers. As our customers migrate from 10-gig to 100-gig connection, we believe our technology leadership in both the core and edge network layers gives us a clear competitive advantage to gain market share. 
In switching, we saw strength in the data center across telco, cable, cloud provider, hosting and Enterprise customers. Our QFX10000 family of spine switching is ramping well, and we see a solid pipeline in the second half of the year. 
In security, we did experience another difficult quarter as we continue to work hard to turn around this component of our business. As I've said before, our strategy and product transition are going to take time to play out and will result in some lumpiness in the business. We remain committed to developing and delivering to our customers complete and differentiated domain level solutions for the cloud, SP mobile and enterprise network that include elements of routing, switching and security, all working tightly together.
We are operating in a difficult macro environment that has been affected by recent economic and geopolitical volatility. However, we remain focused on what we can control and believe that solid execution, coupled with a strong portfolio of solution, will position us to navigate through effects on spending patterns in the future. 
We are continuing to make balanced decisions between growth and profitability while making investments that best position us to address our customers' most critical networking need. We remain focused on driving long-term sustainable growth while generating strong cash flow. And we continue to focusing in managing our business prudently while strengthening our investments in scale, performance and automation through software innovation. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and employees for their continuing dedication as we move along our journey. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing support and investment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken for his comments."

Sequentially, revenue grew across all technologies, geographies and markets. Enterprise growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter was driven by improved spending patterns following a cautious Q1. Service provider revenue grew 6% sequentially, primarily driven by telecom deployments and an increase in revenue from cloud providers. Our services business continued to be strong with solid growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were telecoms, 4 were cloud or cable providers and 1 was an enterprise. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a strong increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $354 million, up $91 million year-over-year and up $182 million, sequentially. We've repurchased 126 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.91 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. 
While I'm pleased with the overall results, the macro environment in Q2 was more challenging than we originally anticipated, and gross margins came in below our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins were 63%, down 7/10 sequentially. 
The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by elevated pricing pressure primarily in EMEA as well as product mix. This was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. 
Now moving on to Q3 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We remain constructive on our revenue for 2016 and expect modest growth despite the current macro environment. We will continue to prudently manage our operating expenses. However, we expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q2 levels in the near term. As a result, we expect operating margins for the full year 2016 to decline slightly relative to the full year of 2015. 
We are confident in our long-term model and remain focused on growth and operating margin expansion. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

With respect to gross margins, it's more of the latter thing that you discussed, okay? This is more around the macro concerns in Europe, in particular, and that is primarily a result of foreign exchange. So something we had been thinking about and monitoring closely in order to offset the dollar exchange, weaker euro, and additional discounting was something that we had thought was necessary, and we're seeing it play out. 
And then there is, yes, the secondary component, which is product mix. I just want to say 2 additional things before I pass it on to Ken. First is, I think we demonstrated in Q2 that despite the fact that we saw weaker-than-expected gross margins, we were able to tightly control our operating expenses to protect our operating margin. So I'm proud of the discipline that we saw in terms of execution from the team. And you can expect more of that going forward. And the second thing is, as we look at the innovation of our products across all of our portfolio of products, and that includes the new products that we're introducing to the market now. One of the things that we've always focused on, and we will continue to focus on, is the innovation that goes into the reduction of the COGS, the cost of goods sold per bit per second of routing, switching and security. And I view that as something that will be helpful, certainly, as a tailwind in the future as we see those products ramp up. Ken?"

So an example of that, that we saw in Q2 was the BTI acquisition. Though we expect the acquisition to result in neutral earnings for the year, it did have a slight impact, negative impact, to both the gross margin and operating margin in the second quarter. That'd be an example of the product mix that hit us in Q2. In addition to that, I mean, there's a lot of different product mix contributors, whether it chassis versus line cards or percentage of software. So product mix could result in either headwinds or tailwinds. At this point, I think it's -- we're definitely not giving up on our long-term model of 64%. We're focused on delivering innovation and continuing our cost structure improvements, and we'll go forward from here."

I think what we're seeing here is this strategy of focusing very deliberately on data centers, and cloud buildouts pay off for us. In terms of verticals, the strength in telcos, in Cloud, and especially Q2, we saw a strong government sector as well play out for us nicely. 
We've -- we have said consistently that the new products, the spine switches, the 10000 switches are mostly going to contribute to revenue in the second half, and that remains the case. There are certainly some orders and early revenue that came in Q2 time frame. But right now, I would characterize the situation we're in as we're competing aggressively for net new wins, new opportunities. And the nice thing that I'm observing now is that we are able to compete in opportunities that we were never able to compete in historically because of the lack of having this important part of the end-to-end switching portfolio. Last thing I'll just say is, there are some transitions that are happening in the data center space as our customers go from 10 gig and 40 gig to 25 gig and 100 gig. I think that plays out nicely because at the end of the day, these data centers are essentially becoming high-performance networking problems that are Layer 3 in nature. That's exactly the kind of really high-performance problem that, I think, Juniper loves to solve."

And I will just say that I am very comfortable with where we are today based on the technology decision that we have made historically that includes silicon decisions. And if you recall what I had mentioned in our last analyst event, if I sort of categorized the market in 3 distinct buckets, there are those that care about very flexible routing with a lot of features and a lot of flexibility and programmability; those that care more about WAN transport, wide area network transport efficiency and those that care about cost efficiency as it pertains to switching. And I don't think that we have ever been this strong across all 3 of those domains today with our product portfolio. Now going forward, we will constantly be evaluating what we do internally in terms of developing our own silicon technology and what we can get from merchant silicon vendors and making the right decisions based on the capabilities that we can get externally versus that, that we can do internally. And that's exactly what we're doing right now. So net-net, this a competitive industry. We've never lost sight of that.

So that's actually something that we are happy about. I think that if I look at the routing opportunity -- the last thing I would -- the second thing I would say about revenue is just from a demand metrics standpoint, our bookings were strong. A lot of the deferred revenue that we saw in Q2 was also connected to routing. So that gives us confidence in the second half of the year as it pertains to routing. Certainly, there's a cloud, there's a telco, there's a cable component to our routing business. I feel good about the cloud component. I think that the new products are going to have a big role in the cloud provider network, and I think that should start in the second half the year. Telco is a bit more of a mixed message, I think. If I look at the global opportunity, there are certainly good opportunities, especially in international, for our routing products that includes the MX and the new PTX products. I think visibility for Tier 1 telcos, in particular, for the second half remains somewhat challenging. I think on the enterprise side, we saw good -- very good, in fact, sequential recovery in Q2 that was across switching and routing, and I feel pretty good about that in the second half as well. So I think there is actually quite a lot of good things happening from a routing standpoint if you factor in the opportunities as the refresh cycle that we're undertaking right now. Oh, and thank you for reminding me, Ken. There was a secondary question about security. So security, sequentially up over Q1, but certainly, nowhere near what it would need to be for us to be happy or content with the performance of this business. We're disappointed in the results. I think this is a business that is, right now, in transition. And I expect it to be in transition for the remainder of this year. As I've always said that it's -- this transition is going to be somewhat lumpy in terms of how the business is going to perform. Last year, I'd say that the performance was better than my expectations. It was largely driven by some large telco and cloud deployments that this year haven't really played out yet to offset some of the transitions that we are executing on in the Enterprise side. And that's where the focus is. I think we have a very compelling and competitive service provider solution for high-bandwidth security applications. It's true also for the cloud. The part of the business that requires more attention and focus and the one that we're actually giving the attention and focus to today is on the enterprise side. The feedback that we're getting from our partners, our customers on the road map, on the products that we have introduced, thus far, is very encouraging. But there are still tons of execution for us to work through, through the rest of this year. And I expect the growth to happen next year."

So we are thinking about this from an overall architectural standpoint, how the technologies tie together, and of course, then positioning security along with the routing and switching.

We were open with our customers. And I think we got a lot of kudos from our customers on how we handled the situation. I'm not saying that it has had no effect, but I think that the team did a good job of minimizing any effects. Right now, I think the main issue with security is we -- there is a critical mass of new products, new features, new technology. We need to get into the market to be able to go after the largest market opportunity that exists. Right now, we're competitive. But in specific areas in use cases, and we need to be competitive in a broader set of use cases in security, that's what we're absolutely maniacally focused on.

On your question related to our partners, Nokia and Ericsson, there's no real new news there. I think with -- both of these customers, we -- or these partners, we have talked about how the volume of business, it's still -- it's a relatively small percentage of our overall revenue as a company. It has been on the decline well before some of the acquisitions and partnerships that have been announced. And that's primarily because Juniper had been taking its destiny into its own hands. So in Europe, for example, the theater that you mentioned, we have, over the years, been taking more and more of the Tier 1 telecom operators to a direct model, direct engagement model, and that has played out well for us in terms of the business and the strategic nature of the relationships with those customers. Net-net, I think between the deliberate strategy that we're taking to go direct with certain customers that we need to go direct, especially those that have volume business that's large enough as well as the partnerships that we have available today, whether it be with NEC or with Ericsson or with IBM or with Amdocs, I am not concerned at all about our ability to reach our customers in EMEA or elsewhere in the world."

So how -- what are the sort of the ebbs and flows of -- given that security is down, do you expect the switching to kind of contribute to the routing contributor? And is the security really going to be down that much in that 20%, 25% range decline? Just give us a little bit of a sense of how to think about Q4."

We have been executing at Juniper on a very deliberate strategy of focusing on where the growth is and where we can differentiate the most in the switching area. And that is in enterprise IT data centers, in private cloud, in public Cloud. And that's why we've seen our switching business perform really well. We do go after campus opportunities, but we mostly limit ourselves and our focus on the largest campuses that are typically very mission-critical and on ramps to the cloud. And we also, of course, focus on customers that are able and willing to pick best-of-breed decisions between wired and wireless, right? So we can work effectively with our wireless partners in going after that, opportunity. So I think that if you consider all that, a flattish switching performance for campus is something that I'm actually okay with.

Which is why it is so important for us to continue to focus on cost of goods sold improvements in our products to innovate in the area of ensuring that we can compete very effectively in those 3 different use cases that I mentioned just previously around the rich routing, lean routing and switching with -- and also to preserve our long-term targets for gross margins. And based on everything that I know that innovations and the technologies that we're developing in the company, the plan that we have going forward, I feel comfortable that, that can be done. I think soft -- from a software standpoint, we had provided guidance that by the 2019 time frame, we will see that around 45% of our overall revenue is going to come from software and services, and a lot of that is going to be in the area of recurring revenue in software.

From the software, Rami's right. The 45% was our long-term model of services in software, just to level set, folks. We had about 3% of our business was software last year, and I would expect it to grow gradually between that and call it 15% to 20% if you presume services remains relatively stable. It'll be -- software standalone would be 3% today to 15% to 20% by 2019, and it should progress pretty gradually between now and then. We are seeing some benefit today, right?

Our product mix really has the ability to go either way. In this particular quarter, it will cost us a couple of tenths and hurt us, but we do have chassis sales out there.

I think the macro environment, as it relates to these geopolitical issues et cetera, are kind of being different in every geo. But we are seeing a bit of global pressure. But really, it was specific to EMEA and specific to certain geographies in EMEA."

And I would say that although the revenue contribution to Juniper is still very small, the opportunity is very large in the future. And I think we're, in many cases, in pole position in working and developing these solutions for our customers. I know SD-WAN is sort of a very big topic these days. I think our best and most immediate opportunity is to support and help our service provider and telco customers in developing very effective agile cost-competitive solutions that will help them in competing effectively with the standalone point player SD-WAN players that are out there.

If you look at SDN as it pertains to the cloud virtualization, cloud orchestration, there, I'm pleased with the pace of adoption, the win rates even if revenue is -- it's still relatively small compared to our overall revenue of the company for Contrail. What I like about it is it's a very strategic part of every sale, every engagement. It's almost entirely subscription-based recurring revenue. And it's setting ourselves up for selling virtualized security, virtualized routing, et cetera in the future. I think that part is moving according to plan. 
As far as these new cloud-enabled brand solutions, a lot of it was going to depend on the success of the telcos in making those services successful to their end-customers, in particular, the enterprise customers. So we're helping them do that because we recognize that if we help them do that and they grow that business, we will be able to grow a brand new revenue stream for the company, and that's something that I'm very excited about. 
Not -- I don't think it's going to happen meaningfully this year, but I'm hopeful that it'll start to contribute in a meaningful way next year."

We delivered a solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2016 as we navigated through a challenging macro environment. Total revenue was $1,221,000,000, stronger than the outlook we've provided and up sequentially across all geographies, technologies and sectors. Services revenue was again solid, up 11% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. We also delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, with operating income up 37%, operating margin up 3 points and diluted EPS up 57% on a GAAP basis. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was up 30%. Operating margin was up 3 points and diluted EPS was up 35%. I am proud of the disciplined executions from our team, and as we look ahead, I remain confident that our strategy and differentiated portfolio will enable us to achieve our long-term target. 
I'll talk a bit about the progress we are making with our highly focused strategy to be the worldwide leader of network innovation. From a technology perspective, our agenda is focused on 2 important dimensions. The first is scale and performance, and the second is automation through software innovation.
On the dimension of automation. We believe it is the key attribute required for our customers to achieve vast new levels of agility and efficiency in delivering services over their networks. Automation is fundamental not just to Juniper but to the health of our entire industry, and it is the most important attribute of our newly announced cloud-enabled brand solution, which we believe will allow enterprises and managed services providers alike to deliver on-demand Cloud services seamlessly. 
A critical technology element of our cloud-enabled brand solution is Contrail, a powerful tool for network virtualization and automation that is enabling our customers' IT and business evolution to the cloud. 
In both the enterprise and service provider sectors, we already have multiple multi-million dollar Contrail deployment. We see many unique opportunities and growth drivers for Contrail. One of the most interesting and forward-looking use cases pertains to the Internet of Things, enabling virtualized and secure connectivity to vast numbers of connected devices. 
For example, a tier 1 telco has deployed Contrail for its NFC platform that not only virtualizes many of its networking application but also enables at-scale deployment of connected car services such as real-time mapping, traffic, news and music streaming. 
Similarly, we have been also in production for over a year now with the large industrial conglomerate whose industrial Internet allows it and its partners to perform data mining and data collection from various machines like wind turbines, jet engines, elevators and MRI scanners. We are also seeing increased momentum with managed service providers, leveraging our open platforms for SDN and NFV. We believe we are in a unique position to help them achieve new levels of agility and cost optimization and offer their enterprise customers best-of-breed technology choices without the complexity that typically comes from managing multi-vendor solutions. 
Some great examples of our momentum include: Verizon, which selected our Cloud CPE solution as the foundational platform for its virtual network services; Orange Business Services, which is now using our Contrail SDN Controller for its easy-go network-as-a-service offering; and AT&T, which is offering Juniper's virtual routing function as an option for its enterprise customers looking for on-demand virtualized network services. 
The scale and performance of routing, switching and security continue to be of fundamental importance to our customers who are constantly trying to stay ahead of network traffic growth and trying to do so economically. 
Innovating in this dimension has been our hallmark since the inception of this company with breakthrough products, like the M40, the MX and the PTX that, over the years, have redefined the economics of networking. As bandwidth-intensive applications continue to soar and the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the need to continue to innovate in the dimension of scale and performance is only increasing in time, and we also believe there's still plenty of room for that innovation, both in systems and in intelligent software that enables more efficient use of network capacity. 
To that end, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our NorthStar Controller, that optimizes across both packet and optical domains dynamically and in real time, unlocking new levels of capacity in our customers' networks. 
Technology is only part of the challenge in any network transformation. Having the right skills is a big, if not a bigger challenge. That's why we've recently announced the expansion of our successful OpenLab program with 6 new locations across North America, Europe and Asia, which will provide customers and partners with a range of resources to build and learn about emerging virtualization and automation technology. 
Now moving on, I'd like to comment on our routing, switching and security business this quarter. 
In routing, we are very pleased with the diversification across geographies, verticals and product mix. Many customers are enthusiastically embracing our newest MX and PTX products. Our PTX line grew sequentially and year-over-year to reach record revenue with core network deployments across our cloud, telco and cable customers. As our customers migrate from 10-gig to 100-gig connection, we believe our technology leadership in both the core and edge network layers gives us a clear competitive advantage to gain market share. 
In switching, we saw strength in the data center across telco, cable, cloud provider, hosting and Enterprise customers. Our QFX10000 family of spine switching is ramping well, and we see a solid pipeline in the second half of the year. 
In security, we did experience another difficult quarter as we continue to work hard to turn around this component of our business. As I've said before, our strategy and product transition are going to take time to play out and will result in some lumpiness in the business. We remain committed to developing and delivering to our customers complete and differentiated domain level solutions for the cloud, SP mobile and enterprise network that include elements of routing, switching and security, all working tightly together.
We are operating in a difficult macro environment that has been affected by recent economic and geopolitical volatility. However, we remain focused on what we can control and believe that solid execution, coupled with a strong portfolio of solution, will position us to navigate through effects on spending patterns in the future. 
We are continuing to make balanced decisions between growth and profitability while making investments that best position us to address our customers' most critical networking need. We remain focused on driving long-term sustainable growth while generating strong cash flow. And we continue to focusing in managing our business prudently while strengthening our investments in scale, performance and automation through software innovation. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and employees for their continuing dedication as we move along our journey. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing support and investment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken for his comments."

Sequentially, revenue grew across all technologies, geographies and markets. Enterprise growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter was driven by improved spending patterns following a cautious Q1. Service provider revenue grew 6% sequentially, primarily driven by telecom deployments and an increase in revenue from cloud providers. Our services business continued to be strong with solid growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were telecoms, 4 were cloud or cable providers and 1 was an enterprise. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a strong increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $354 million, up $91 million year-over-year and up $182 million, sequentially. We've repurchased 126 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.91 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. 
While I'm pleased with the overall results, the macro environment in Q2 was more challenging than we originally anticipated, and gross margins came in below our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins were 63%, down 7/10 sequentially. 
The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by elevated pricing pressure primarily in EMEA as well as product mix. This was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. 
Now moving on to Q3 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We remain constructive on our revenue for 2016 and expect modest growth despite the current macro environment. We will continue to prudently manage our operating expenses. However, we expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q2 levels in the near term. As a result, we expect operating margins for the full year 2016 to decline slightly relative to the full year of 2015. 
We are confident in our long-term model and remain focused on growth and operating margin expansion. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

With respect to gross margins, it's more of the latter thing that you discussed, okay? This is more around the macro concerns in Europe, in particular, and that is primarily a result of foreign exchange. So something we had been thinking about and monitoring closely in order to offset the dollar exchange, weaker euro, and additional discounting was something that we had thought was necessary, and we're seeing it play out. 
And then there is, yes, the secondary component, which is product mix. I just want to say 2 additional things before I pass it on to Ken. First is, I think we demonstrated in Q2 that despite the fact that we saw weaker-than-expected gross margins, we were able to tightly control our operating expenses to protect our operating margin. So I'm proud of the discipline that we saw in terms of execution from the team. And you can expect more of that going forward. And the second thing is, as we look at the innovation of our products across all of our portfolio of products, and that includes the new products that we're introducing to the market now. One of the things that we've always focused on, and we will continue to focus on, is the innovation that goes into the reduction of the COGS, the cost of goods sold per bit per second of routing, switching and security. And I view that as something that will be helpful, certainly, as a tailwind in the future as we see those products ramp up. Ken?"

So an example of that, that we saw in Q2 was the BTI acquisition. Though we expect the acquisition to result in neutral earnings for the year, it did have a slight impact, negative impact, to both the gross margin and operating margin in the second quarter. That'd be an example of the product mix that hit us in Q2. In addition to that, I mean, there's a lot of different product mix contributors, whether it chassis versus line cards or percentage of software. So product mix could result in either headwinds or tailwinds. At this point, I think it's -- we're definitely not giving up on our long-term model of 64%.

In terms of verticals, the strength in telcos, in Cloud, and especially Q2, we saw a strong government sector as well play out for us nicely. 
We've -- we have said consistently that the new products, the spine switches, the 10000 switches are mostly going to contribute to revenue in the second half, and that remains the case. There are certainly some orders and early revenue that came in Q2 time frame. But right now, I would characterize the situation we're in as we're competing aggressively for net new wins, new opportunities. And the nice thing that I'm observing now is that we are able to compete in opportunities that we were never able to compete in historically because of the lack of having this important part of the end-to-end switching portfolio. Last thing I'll just say is, there are some transitions that are happening in the data center space as our customers go from 10 gig and 40 gig to 25 gig and 100 gig. I think that plays out nicely because at the end of the day, these data centers are essentially becoming high-performance networking problems that are Layer 3 in nature. That's exactly the kind of really high-performance problem that, I think, Juniper loves to solve."

Certainly, it's a question that has come up. I think at the end of the day, the things that matters the most to our customers across all verticals, including the Cloud vertical, is -- are the capabilities of the products and the solutions themselves from the standpoint of flexibility, Layer 3 stack capabilities, the density and performance, the price per port et cetera. And I will just say that I am very comfortable with where we are today based on the technology decision that we have made historically that includes silicon decisions. And if you recall what I had mentioned in our last analyst event, if I sort of categorized the market in 3 distinct buckets, there are those that care about very flexible routing with a lot of features and a lot of flexibility and programmability; those that care more about WAN transport, wide area network transport efficiency and those that care about cost efficiency as it pertains to switching. And I don't think that we have ever been this strong across all 3 of those domains today with our product portfolio. Now going forward, we will constantly be evaluating what we do internally in terms of developing our own silicon technology and what we can get from merchant silicon vendors and making the right decisions based on the capabilities that we can get externally versus that, that we can do internally. And that's exactly what we're doing right now. So net-net, this a competitive industry. We've never lost sight of that. But I'm comfortable with where we are from a technology standpoint and our ability to compete."

And then from a revenue standpoint, actually, we're -- what we said is that we remain constructive on the full year from a revenue standpoint 2016 versus 2015. Where we're being a bit more cautious is on our operating margin. And that's primarily as a result of the gross margin impact that we're seeing in Q2 -- that we saw in Q2.

On the routing, I think that we actually are encouraged by what we've seen in routing in terms of the sequential improvement from the Q1 standpoint. And we really saw this across all geos. So that's actually something that we are happy about. I think that if I look at the routing opportunity -- the last thing I would -- the second thing I would say about revenue is just from a demand metrics standpoint, our bookings were strong. A lot of the deferred revenue that we saw in Q2 was also connected to routing. So that gives us confidence in the second half of the year as it pertains to routing. Certainly, there's a cloud, there's a telco, there's a cable component to our routing business. I feel good about the cloud component. I think that the new products are going to have a big role in the cloud provider network, and I think that should start in the second half the year. Telco is a bit more of a mixed message, I think. If I look at the global opportunity, there are certainly good opportunities, especially in international, for our routing products that includes the MX and the new PTX products. I think visibility for Tier 1 telcos, in particular, for the second half remains somewhat challenging. I think on the enterprise side, we saw good -- very good, in fact, sequential recovery in Q2 that was across switching and routing, and I feel pretty good about that in the second half as well. So I think there is actually quite a lot of good things happening from a routing standpoint if you factor in the opportunities as the refresh cycle that we're undertaking right now. Oh, and thank you for reminding me, Ken. There was a secondary question about security. So security, sequentially up over Q1, but certainly, nowhere near what it would need to be for us to be happy or content with the performance of this business. We're disappointed in the results. I think this is a business that is, right now, in transition. And I expect it to be in transition for the remainder of this year. As I've always said that it's -- this transition is going to be somewhat lumpy in terms of how the business is going to perform. Last year, I'd say that the performance was better than my expectations. It was largely driven by some large telco and cloud deployments that this year haven't really played out yet to offset some of the transitions that we are executing on in the Enterprise side. And that's where the focus is. I think we have a very compelling and competitive service provider solution for high-bandwidth security applications. It's true also for the cloud. The part of the business that requires more attention and focus and the one that we're actually giving the attention and focus to today is on the enterprise side. The feedback that we're getting from our partners, our customers on the road map, on the products that we have introduced, thus far, is very encouraging. But there are still tons of execution for us to work through, through the rest of this year. And I expect the growth to happen next year."

What it's going to take is more execution on our part and a bit of time, to be honest. The security space is a very competitive space. The thing that, I think, Juniper can leverage to our advantage is the fact that we're really thinking about it from a solution standpoint. So as we go to our customers and help them build out a private cloud data center or hybrid cloud data center or things like on-premises Cloud CPE solutions, there is a security element to each and every one of those solution. So we are thinking about this from an overall architectural standpoint, how the technologies tie together, and of course, then positioning security along with the routing and switching. So I think that's playing out already quite nicely on the cloud side. From an enterprise standpoint, enterprise campus and so on, there's still more features to develop, new hardware to release into the market to get the cost per bit or the price per bit more competitive in the security space. And I think next year is the year where we'll have enough critical mass to start seeing a recovery in the business."

The vulnerability that you discussed is, at this point, largely behind us. We took the matter very seriously. We did a very thorough internal review to make sure that the vulnerability was very specific to our old legacy ScreenOS security products and made sure that there is no such effect on the -- and we, in fact, invited a third-party company to come in to help us with the assessment -- this assessment, that there is no vulnerability on the Junos side. We were open with our customers. And I think we got a lot of kudos from our customers on how we handled the situation. I'm not saying that it has had no effect, but I think that the team did a good job of minimizing any effects. Right now, I think the main issue with security is we -- there is a critical mass of new products, new features, new technology. We need to get into the market to be able to go after the largest market opportunity that exists. Right now, we're competitive. But in specific areas in use cases, and we need to be competitive in a broader set of use cases in security, that's what we're absolutely maniacally focused on. On security, the thing you should notice -- as I mentioned, there is a strong revenue synergy associated with switching and routing, but there's also an equally strong cost synergy because much of the innovation that we've put into switching and routing also contributes to our security product portfolio. On your question related to our partners, Nokia and Ericsson, there's no real new news there. I think with -- both of these customers, we -- or these partners, we have talked about how the volume of business, it's still -- it's a relatively small percentage of our overall revenue as a company. It has been on the decline well before some of the acquisitions and partnerships that have been announced. And that's primarily because Juniper had been taking its destiny into its own hands. So in Europe, for example, the theater that you mentioned, we have, over the years, been taking more and more of the Tier 1 telecom operators to a direct model, direct engagement model, and that has played out well for us in terms of the business and the strategic nature of the relationships with those customers. Net-net, I think between the deliberate strategy that we're taking to go direct with certain customers that we need to go direct, especially those that have volume business that's large enough as well as the partnerships that we have available today, whether it be with NEC or with Ericsson or with IBM or with Amdocs, I am not concerned at all about our ability to reach our customers in EMEA or elsewhere in the world."

So how -- what are the sort of the ebbs and flows of -- given that security is down, do you expect the switching to kind of contribute to the routing contributor?

We have been executing at Juniper on a very deliberate strategy of focusing on where the growth is and where we can differentiate the most in the switching area. And that is in enterprise IT data centers, in private cloud, in public Cloud. And that's why we've seen our switching business perform really well. We do go after campus opportunities, but we mostly limit ourselves and our focus on the largest campuses that are typically very mission-critical and on ramps to the cloud. And we also, of course, focus on customers that are able and willing to pick best-of-breed decisions between wired and wireless, right?

So I think where this is going to start to benefit both Juniper and Lenovo is next year. I remain optimistic and excited about the opportunity in working with Lenovo. As you know, there is a large part of the market that is interested in converged stack architectures and having really compelling servers, storage and networking working tightly together is something that I think is going to be helpful to our business."

So first of all, on the near-term, you talked about challenges in the EMEA region, but it doesn't look to me that we've seen all that much movement during the June quarter of the euro-to-dollar exchange rate pre the Brexit vote. So I'm just wondering whether this was an issue where it had been building up for some time and the competitor who sells in euros basically, you concluded, you had to respond that things wouldn't move back in your favor. And then when we look out to 2017, I think most of us expect you'll face a new competitor in routing, particularly in the data center. And we're wondering how that competitive dynamic could play out with a new entrant that it sounds like they will be somewhat aggressive on pricing. And then looking out even further, the last part of this gross margin trend is when does the software business, the Contrail and NorthStar products, when did they become material enough to be a tailwind to gross margin?"

Are we anticipating that this industry is going to be -- to continue to be competitive? Absolutely. Which is why it is so important for us to continue to focus on cost of goods sold improvements in our products to innovate in the area of ensuring that we can compete very effectively in those 3 different use cases that I mentioned just previously around the rich routing, lean routing and switching with -- and also to preserve our long-term targets for gross margins. And based on everything that I know that innovations and the technologies that we're developing in the company, the plan that we have going forward, I feel comfortable that, that can be done. I think soft -- from a software standpoint, we had provided guidance that by the 2019 time frame, we will see that around 45% of our overall revenue is going to come from software and services, and a lot of that is going to be in the area of recurring revenue in software. And I think that certainly helps us from a gross margin standpoint. I'll let Ken talk some more to that."

So it's really more of the long-term buildup of the FX concerns or the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, I should say. 
From the software, Rami's right. The 45% was our long-term model of services in software, just to level set, folks. We had about 3% of our business was software last year, and I would expect it to grow gradually between that and call it 15% to 20% if you presume services remains relatively stable. It'll be -- software standalone would be 3% today to 15% to 20% by 2019, and it should progress pretty gradually between now and then. We are seeing some benefit today, right? I mean, we talked about product mix. There are headwinds. There are tailwinds.

We are -- we have clearly not given up on the 64% operating model. We're working on cost innovation, cost improvements, cost structure as well as product innovation, I should say, in making sure we sell the value of that. From a BTI perspective, I do expect BTI to ramp. And it does have a slight impact to gross margin percentage. However, I would state that the first quarter of ramp, we did have some startup costs, et cetera that has BTI scales. It will become more margin favorable than it is today as we go forward."

EMEA was down as a percentage of total revenue in both 1Q and 2Q versus last year. That was about 1.5 to 4 percentage points. I recognize some of that is the lower price impacting revenues. But your product gross margin was down almost 1 percentage point sequentially following 100- to over 200-basis-point decline in the first quarter from calendar '15 levels, and the quarter represents an all-time low.

We're not breaking out the exact math, but they both had roughly an equal impact to the, call it, traditional 64%, and our long-term model of 64% versus the 63% result. Our product mix really has the ability to go either way. In this particular quarter, it will cost us a couple of tenths and hurt us, but we do have chassis sales out there.

We delivered a solid financial performance for the second quarter of 2016 as we navigated through a challenging macro environment. Total revenue was $1,221,000,000, stronger than the outlook we've provided and up sequentially across all geographies, technologies and sectors. Services revenue was again solid, up 11% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. We also delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, with operating income up 37%, operating margin up 3 points and diluted EPS up 57% on a GAAP basis. 
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was up 30%. Operating margin was up 3 points and diluted EPS was up 35%. I am proud of the disciplined executions from our team, and as we look ahead, I remain confident that our strategy and differentiated portfolio will enable us to achieve our long-term target. 
I'll talk a bit about the progress we are making with our highly focused strategy to be the worldwide leader of network innovation. From a technology perspective, our agenda is focused on 2 important dimensions. The first is scale and performance, and the second is automation through software innovation.
On the dimension of automation. We believe it is the key attribute required for our customers to achieve vast new levels of agility and efficiency in delivering services over their networks. Automation is fundamental not just to Juniper but to the health of our entire industry, and it is the most important attribute of our newly announced cloud-enabled brand solution, which we believe will allow enterprises and managed services providers alike to deliver on-demand Cloud services seamlessly. 
A critical technology element of our cloud-enabled brand solution is Contrail, a powerful tool for network virtualization and automation that is enabling our customers' IT and business evolution to the cloud. 
In both the enterprise and service provider sectors, we already have multiple multi-million dollar Contrail deployment. We see many unique opportunities and growth drivers for Contrail. One of the most interesting and forward-looking use cases pertains to the Internet of Things, enabling virtualized and secure connectivity to vast numbers of connected devices. 
For example, a tier 1 telco has deployed Contrail for its NFC platform that not only virtualizes many of its networking application but also enables at-scale deployment of connected car services such as real-time mapping, traffic, news and music streaming. 
Similarly, we have been also in production for over a year now with the large industrial conglomerate whose industrial Internet allows it and its partners to perform data mining and data collection from various machines like wind turbines, jet engines, elevators and MRI scanners. We are also seeing increased momentum with managed service providers, leveraging our open platforms for SDN and NFV. We believe we are in a unique position to help them achieve new levels of agility and cost optimization and offer their enterprise customers best-of-breed technology choices without the complexity that typically comes from managing multi-vendor solutions. 
Some great examples of our momentum include: Verizon, which selected our Cloud CPE solution as the foundational platform for its virtual network services; Orange Business Services, which is now using our Contrail SDN Controller for its easy-go network-as-a-service offering; and AT&T, which is offering Juniper's virtual routing function as an option for its enterprise customers looking for on-demand virtualized network services. 
The scale and performance of routing, switching and security continue to be of fundamental importance to our customers who are constantly trying to stay ahead of network traffic growth and trying to do so economically. 
Innovating in this dimension has been our hallmark since the inception of this company with breakthrough products, like the M40, the MX and the PTX that, over the years, have redefined the economics of networking. As bandwidth-intensive applications continue to soar and the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the need to continue to innovate in the dimension of scale and performance is only increasing in time, and we also believe there's still plenty of room for that innovation, both in systems and in intelligent software that enables more efficient use of network capacity. 
To that end, we are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with our NorthStar Controller, that optimizes across both packet and optical domains dynamically and in real time, unlocking new levels of capacity in our customers' networks. 
Technology is only part of the challenge in any network transformation. Having the right skills is a big, if not a bigger challenge. That's why we've recently announced the expansion of our successful OpenLab program with 6 new locations across North America, Europe and Asia, which will provide customers and partners with a range of resources to build and learn about emerging virtualization and automation technology. 
Now moving on, I'd like to comment on our routing, switching and security business this quarter. 
In routing, we are very pleased with the diversification across geographies, verticals and product mix. Many customers are enthusiastically embracing our newest MX and PTX products. Our PTX line grew sequentially and year-over-year to reach record revenue with core network deployments across our cloud, telco and cable customers. As our customers migrate from 10-gig to 100-gig connection, we believe our technology leadership in both the core and edge network layers gives us a clear competitive advantage to gain market share. 
In switching, we saw strength in the data center across telco, cable, cloud provider, hosting and Enterprise customers. Our QFX10000 family of spine switching is ramping well, and we see a solid pipeline in the second half of the year. 
In security, we did experience another difficult quarter as we continue to work hard to turn around this component of our business. As I've said before, our strategy and product transition are going to take time to play out and will result in some lumpiness in the business. We remain committed to developing and delivering to our customers complete and differentiated domain level solutions for the cloud, SP mobile and enterprise network that include elements of routing, switching and security, all working tightly together.
We are operating in a difficult macro environment that has been affected by recent economic and geopolitical volatility. However, we remain focused on what we can control and believe that solid execution, coupled with a strong portfolio of solution, will position us to navigate through effects on spending patterns in the future. 
We are continuing to make balanced decisions between growth and profitability while making investments that best position us to address our customers' most critical networking need. We remain focused on driving long-term sustainable growth while generating strong cash flow. And we continue to focusing in managing our business prudently while strengthening our investments in scale, performance and automation through software innovation. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and employees for their continuing dedication as we move along our journey. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing support and investment. 
Now I'll turn it over to Ken for his comments."

Sequentially, revenue grew across all technologies, geographies and markets. Enterprise growth of 23% quarter-over-quarter was driven by improved spending patterns following a cautious Q1. Service provider revenue grew 6% sequentially, primarily driven by telecom deployments and an increase in revenue from cloud providers. Our services business continued to be strong with solid growth both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 5 were telecoms, 4 were cloud or cable providers and 1 was an enterprise. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter with product book-to-bill greater than 1 and a strong increase in product deferred revenue year-over-year and sequentially. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $354 million, up $91 million year-over-year and up $182 million, sequentially. We've repurchased 126 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $3.91 billion of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4.1 billion by the end of 2016. 
While I'm pleased with the overall results, the macro environment in Q2 was more challenging than we originally anticipated, and gross margins came in below our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margins were 63%, down 7/10 sequentially. 
The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by elevated pricing pressure primarily in EMEA as well as product mix. This was partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. 
Now moving on to Q3 guidance, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We remain constructive on our revenue for 2016 and expect modest growth despite the current macro environment. We will continue to prudently manage our operating expenses. However, we expect gross margins to remain approximately at their Q2 levels in the near term. As a result, we expect operating margins for the full year 2016 to decline slightly relative to the full year of 2015. 
We are confident in our long-term model and remain focused on growth and operating margin expansion. The outlook assumes that the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to other currencies will remain relatively stable at current levels. I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. 
And now with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

With respect to gross margins, it's more of the latter thing that you discussed, okay? This is more around the macro concerns in Europe, in particular, and that is primarily a result of foreign exchange. So something we had been thinking about and monitoring closely in order to offset the dollar exchange, weaker euro, and additional discounting was something that we had thought was necessary, and we're seeing it play out. 
And then there is, yes, the secondary component, which is product mix. I just want to say 2 additional things before I pass it on to Ken. First is, I think we demonstrated in Q2 that despite the fact that we saw weaker-than-expected gross margins, we were able to tightly control our operating expenses to protect our operating margin. So I'm proud of the discipline that we saw in terms of execution from the team. And you can expect more of that going forward. And the second thing is, as we look at the innovation of our products across all of our portfolio of products, and that includes the new products that we're introducing to the market now. One of the things that we've always focused on, and we will continue to focus on, is the innovation that goes into the reduction of the COGS, the cost of goods sold per bit per second of routing, switching and security. And I view that as something that will be helpful, certainly, as a tailwind in the future as we see those products ramp up. Ken?"

So an example of that, that we saw in Q2 was the BTI acquisition. Though we expect the acquisition to result in neutral earnings for the year, it did have a slight impact, negative impact, to both the gross margin and operating margin in the second quarter. That'd be an example of the product mix that hit us in Q2. In addition to that, I mean, there's a lot of different product mix contributors, whether it chassis versus line cards or percentage of software. So product mix could result in either headwinds or tailwinds. At this point, I think it's -- we're definitely not giving up on our long-term model of 64%. We're focused on delivering innovation and continuing our cost structure improvements, and we'll go forward from here."

In terms of verticals, the strength in telcos, in Cloud, and especially Q2, we saw a strong government sector as well play out for us nicely. 
We've -- we have said consistently that the new products, the spine switches, the 10000 switches are mostly going to contribute to revenue in the second half, and that remains the case. There are certainly some orders and early revenue that came in Q2 time frame. But right now, I would characterize the situation we're in as we're competing aggressively for net new wins, new opportunities. And the nice thing that I'm observing now is that we are able to compete in opportunities that we were never able to compete in historically because of the lack of having this important part of the end-to-end switching portfolio. Last thing I'll just say is, there are some transitions that are happening in the data center space as our customers go from 10 gig and 40 gig to 25 gig and 100 gig. I think that plays out nicely because at the end of the day, these data centers are essentially becoming high-performance networking problems that are Layer 3 in nature. That's exactly the kind of really high-performance problem that, I think, Juniper loves to solve."

And I will just say that I am very comfortable with where we are today based on the technology decision that we have made historically that includes silicon decisions. And if you recall what I had mentioned in our last analyst event, if I sort of categorized the market in 3 distinct buckets, there are those that care about very flexible routing with a lot of features and a lot of flexibility and programmability; those that care more about WAN transport, wide area network transport efficiency and those that care about cost efficiency as it pertains to switching. And I don't think that we have ever been this strong across all 3 of those domains today with our product portfolio. Now going forward, we will constantly be evaluating what we do internally in terms of developing our own silicon technology and what we can get from merchant silicon vendors and making the right decisions based on the capabilities that we can get externally versus that, that we can do internally. And that's exactly what we're doing right now. So net-net, this a competitive industry. We've never lost sight of that.

So that's actually something that we are happy about. I think that if I look at the routing opportunity -- the last thing I would -- the second thing I would say about revenue is just from a demand metrics standpoint, our bookings were strong. A lot of the deferred revenue that we saw in Q2 was also connected to routing. So that gives us confidence in the second half of the year as it pertains to routing. Certainly, there's a cloud, there's a telco, there's a cable component to our routing business. I feel good about the cloud component. I think that the new products are going to have a big role in the cloud provider network, and I think that should start in the second half the year. Telco is a bit more of a mixed message, I think. If I look at the global opportunity, there are certainly good opportunities, especially in international, for our routing products that includes the MX and the new PTX products. I think visibility for Tier 1 telcos, in particular, for the second half remains somewhat challenging. I think on the enterprise side, we saw good -- very good, in fact, sequential recovery in Q2 that was across switching and routing, and I feel pretty good about that in the second half as well. So I think there is actually quite a lot of good things happening from a routing standpoint if you factor in the opportunities as the refresh cycle that we're undertaking right now. Oh, and thank you for reminding me, Ken. There was a secondary question about security. So security, sequentially up over Q1, but certainly, nowhere near what it would need to be for us to be happy or content with the performance of this business. We're disappointed in the results. I think this is a business that is, right now, in transition. And I expect it to be in transition for the remainder of this year. As I've always said that it's -- this transition is going to be somewhat lumpy in terms of how the business is going to perform. Last year, I'd say that the performance was better than my expectations. It was largely driven by some large telco and cloud deployments that this year haven't really played out yet to offset some of the transitions that we are executing on in the Enterprise side. And that's where the focus is. I think we have a very compelling and competitive service provider solution for high-bandwidth security applications. It's true also for the cloud. The part of the business that requires more attention and focus and the one that we're actually giving the attention and focus to today is on the enterprise side. The feedback that we're getting from our partners, our customers on the road map, on the products that we have introduced, thus far, is very encouraging. But there are still tons of execution for us to work through, through the rest of this year. And I expect the growth to happen next year."

So we are thinking about this from an overall architectural standpoint, how the technologies tie together, and of course, then positioning security along with the routing and switching. So I think that's playing out already quite nicely on the cloud side.

We did a very thorough internal review to make sure that the vulnerability was very specific to our old legacy ScreenOS security products and made sure that there is no such effect on the -- and we, in fact, invited a third-party company to come in to help us with the assessment -- this assessment, that there is no vulnerability on the Junos side. We were open with our customers. And I think we got a lot of kudos from our customers on how we handled the situation. I'm not saying that it has had no effect, but I think that the team did a good job of minimizing any effects. Right now, I think the main issue with security is we -- there is a critical mass of new products, new features, new technology. We need to get into the market to be able to go after the largest market opportunity that exists. Right now, we're competitive. But in specific areas in use cases, and we need to be competitive in a broader set of use cases in security, that's what we're absolutely maniacally focused on. On security, the thing you should notice -- as I mentioned, there is a strong revenue synergy associated with switching and routing, but there's also an equally strong cost synergy because much of the innovation that we've put into switching and routing also contributes to our security product portfolio. On your question related to our partners, Nokia and Ericsson, there's no real new news there. I think with -- both of these customers, we -- or these partners, we have talked about how the volume of business, it's still -- it's a relatively small percentage of our overall revenue as a company. It has been on the decline well before some of the acquisitions and partnerships that have been announced. And that's primarily because Juniper had been taking its destiny into its own hands. So in Europe, for example, the theater that you mentioned, we have, over the years, been taking more and more of the Tier 1 telecom operators to a direct model, direct engagement model, and that has played out well for us in terms of the business and the strategic nature of the relationships with those customers. Net-net, I think between the deliberate strategy that we're taking to go direct with certain customers that we need to go direct, especially those that have volume business that's large enough as well as the partnerships that we have available today, whether it be with NEC or with Ericsson or with IBM or with Amdocs, I am not concerned at all about our ability to reach our customers in EMEA or elsewhere in the world."

So how -- what are the sort of the ebbs and flows of -- given that security is down, do you expect the switching to kind of contribute to the routing contributor? And is the security really going to be down that much in that 20%, 25% range decline? Just give us a little bit of a sense of how to think about Q4."

Just net-net, I'd say the business was probably more flattish if you look at campus switching, specifically. But let me just qualify this a bit. We have been executing at Juniper on a very deliberate strategy of focusing on where the growth is and where we can differentiate the most in the switching area. And that is in enterprise IT data centers, in private cloud, in public Cloud. And that's why we've seen our switching business perform really well. We do go after campus opportunities, but we mostly limit ourselves and our focus on the largest campuses that are typically very mission-critical and on ramps to the cloud. And we also, of course, focus on customers that are able and willing to pick best-of-breed decisions between wired and wireless, right? So we can work effectively with our wireless partners in going after that, opportunity. So I think that if you consider all that, a flattish switching performance for campus is something that I'm actually okay with.

Which is why it is so important for us to continue to focus on cost of goods sold improvements in our products to innovate in the area of ensuring that we can compete very effectively in those 3 different use cases that I mentioned just previously around the rich routing, lean routing and switching with -- and also to preserve our long-term targets for gross margins. And based on everything that I know that innovations and the technologies that we're developing in the company, the plan that we have going forward, I feel comfortable that, that can be done. I think soft -- from a software standpoint, we had provided guidance that by the 2019 time frame, we will see that around 45% of our overall revenue is going to come from software and services, and a lot of that is going to be in the area of recurring revenue in software.

From the software, Rami's right. The 45% was our long-term model of services in software, just to level set, folks. We had about 3% of our business was software last year, and I would expect it to grow gradually between that and call it 15% to 20% if you presume services remains relatively stable. It'll be -- software standalone would be 3% today to 15% to 20% by 2019, and it should progress pretty gradually between now and then. We are seeing some benefit today, right?

I think actually, the cloud-enabled branch solutions that we're developing are, in fact, a potential tailwind for us.

And I would say that although the revenue contribution to Juniper is still very small, the opportunity is very large in the future. And I think we're, in many cases, in pole position in working and developing these solutions for our customers. I know SD-WAN is sort of a very big topic these days. I think our best and most immediate opportunity is to support and help our service provider and telco customers in developing very effective agile cost-competitive solutions that will help them in competing effectively with the standalone point player SD-WAN players that are out there.

And it's setting ourselves up for selling virtualized security, virtualized routing, et cetera in the future. I think that part is moving according to plan. 
As far as these new cloud-enabled brand solutions, a lot of it was going to depend on the success of the telcos in making those services successful to their end-customers, in particular, the enterprise customers. So we're helping them do that because we recognize that if we help them do that and they grow that business, we will be able to grow a brand new revenue stream for the company, and that's something that I'm very excited about.

We delivered another solid quarter with total revenue at $1,285,000,000, stronger than the outlook we provided and up sequentially across all technologies and geographies. We again delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, including strong operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance, particularly with our focus on execution, and we continue to take steps necessary to position the company for continued growth. 
I've said before that I believe that we have a great strategy in place to be a pure play innovator in IP networking that is going to transform the economics of networking with leading scale, performance and automation. As the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the market is shifting in our favor and will actually help us accelerate our strategy to power this cloud transformation. 
The investments we've made over the last few years have culminated in the strongest and most highly differentiated product portfolio in the history of this company. We now have a set of new products across key technology areas that we expect will help us achieve our revenue potential for the second half of this year and beyond. If you look at the products we've recently introduced in the market, they were developed with a keen understanding of what cloud providers want and need. In many cases, they were developed in partnership with our customers. One of the most important things that we must do as a company, is to ensure that we help our customers succeed as they transition to the cloud. 
Now I'd like to summarize some highlights this quarter across routing, switching and security. We are pleased to see our routing business continue to grow sequentially and year-over-year. While we are particularly pleased with growth in the cloud vertical, we saw our diversification strategy play out across telco and cable verticals in our product mix and across geographies. 
Our PTX line had another record revenue quarter, and along with our MX platform, they are proving to be our customers' preferred choices for their core and edge as they move faster to deployment with increasing confidence and appreciation of our technology differentiation. 
I'm very pleased with our strong performance in switching where we saw continued growth in the data center, and with cloud and content providers. We've seen a lot of interest for our new QFX products from cloud providers as well as large telcos, cable providers, large enterprises and federal governments who are demanding high capacity, high-speed networking. For the Q3 period, total revenue for our QFX switch line grew at 50% year-over-year. 
Our deliberate focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast-growing data center switching portfolio over the past 2 [ph] years, and I believe we now have a complete portfolio that is going to help us continue to grow our switching business in the future. 
Security continues to be a business that is in transition for us. We've made progress in certain areas, introducing new management software and enhancing the overall efficacy of our flagship SRX platform, which in fact has recently received third-party validation for excellent security efficacy in next-gen firewall testing. 
Earlier this month at our annual customer event, NXTWORK 2016, we announced critical enhancements to our security portfolio, extending our software-defined secure network vision with advanced automated enforcement throughout the network. These additions include Junos Space Security Director's Policy Enforcer, which delivers deeper network threat prevention down to the switch level. We also announced new midrange firewalls, the SRX4100 and the SRX4200, that are optimized for hybrid cloud environment. 
Looking ahead, our priority remains on innovation, execution and on improving our performance and operating efficiency. At Investor Day earlier this year, we stated that we are constructive on 2016 growth for the full year. We remain constructive on the second half of 2016 and are pleased with the traction our new products are seeing with customers. 
The market trends taking place in the industry play to our core competencies and provide growth opportunities for a challenger like Juniper. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on them. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Finally, I want to extend a very big thank you to our employees who each play a role in helping shape a stronger Juniper. 
With that said, I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss results of the quarter in more detail."

The results of the September quarter reflects solid sequential revenue and earnings growth. Our sequential revenue growth was balanced across all technologies, markets and geographies, and we are pleased with the momentum of our new products. 
We saw continued data center strength, particularly with our QFX family of products, which grew 50% year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 4 were cloud or cable providers, 4 were telecoms and 2 were enterprises. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with product book-to-bill greater than 1 and an increase in product deferred revenue, up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $245 million, down $109 million sequentially, primarily due to payments for incentive compensation. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $112 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
As many of you know, we initiated a capital return program in early 2014. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $4,060,000,000 [ph] of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4,100,000,000 and we reiterate our commitment to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividends beginning in 2017. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Year-over-year, the decrease in product gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was due to product mix and elevated pricing pressure, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. 
Now moving on to Q4 outlook, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products and expect continued strength with cloud providers and enterprise customers. 
While we continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on cost improvements. We expect gross margins to remain approximately at the Q3 levels in the near term. 
On a full-year basis, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect revenue growth, which is consistent with our outlook from previous quarters, as well as earnings per share growth. We are focused on growth and continued earnings expansion and are confident in our strategy and long-term model. 
I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

And what are the implications of success in that application on your core routing business? How should we think about that? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could provide some additional color on the pricing environment. Last quarter, you suggested we'd likely to see some gross margin improvement as volumes pick up in Q4. We could potentially get back to the 64% levels over time. Now it sounds like you don't expect to see any improvement in Q4. So perhaps you can touch upon what's changed. Is pricing pressures still concentrated in Europe? Is it more broad-based? To what extent we should be thinking about 63% as the new normal? Or do you think you can see some more improvement next year?"

So first, very pleased with the performance of our switching business in the Q3 time frame. In particular, what you're seeing is that the focus that we have on the data center and the cloud opportunity is really starting to pay off for us, and you can see that in the strength of the QFX portfolio all up [ph]. As you know, the new products that we've introduced, the 10002, the 10008 and the upcoming 10016, are all intended to round out an end-to-end switching portfolio that make us competitive in far more switching opportunities than we've ever been historically. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So we're now participating in proof of concepts, in RFPs, et cetera that we, quite frankly, just never had access to historically. So the new products that we've introduced are they themselves starting to ramp, as we expected in the second half. But more importantly, they round out our portfolio in a way that gives us more competitiveness overall. And now add to that our Contrail Orchestration system, routing at the edge of the data center and security, and we really have a very compelling end-to-end cloud data center portfolio that we're, I think, leveraging very effectively. On your question around Jericho and silicon, obviously, a question that we get quite a lot. Every new product we develop, we do it with a keen eye on making sure that we choose the very best silicon for that product. We're not religious about what silicon that we choose. But I will say this: every decision that we've made thus far in all products across routing and switching that we have developed has been absolutely the right one. And that means in certain cases, we're going to use custom; in certain cases, we're going to use merchant. And that might change over time as we look out and we develop sort of the roadmap across switching and routing in the future. But for now, rest assured I feel very good about the decisions that we've made thus far in our silicon choices. I think you had one more thing, which is around routing. The data center problem is, in fact, a high-performance networking problem that requires a robust routing stack. And that is one of the key differentiators of our QFX product line. Ken?"

We saw a little more normalization across quarter-on-quarter. Still a very competitive market, though I would definitely keep that in mind. A lot of factors go into our guidance for gross margin. Clearly, the macro environment, the competitive landscape, customer mix, product mix, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in some of those dimensions. So I think the prudent thing at this point, which is what we set into our guidance, is to assume 63%, not only in Q4 but in the near term as we continue to work through the macro uncertainties and some of the other fluctuations there in gross margin. We're very focused on continuing to deliver innovation and continuing to improve our cost structure, and we are driving towards our 64% long-term gross margin model.

I think they are -- it includes success in certain cloud providers, in the enterprise, in federal government and also, in fact, in some telcos opportunities as well. When I think about the competitiveness of our product portfolio in switching, there are very different aspects of it. First is scale. And typically, when people hear the word scale, they think of the number of ports on a box. But it's actually more complicated than that, also around number of routes, number of hosts, number of IP addresses, what we call logical scale. And we've really pushed the envelope on the logical scale of our products that gives us an edge compared to anything that's out there today. Then there's the robust routing capabilities. We have the full Junos IP stack on this thing, which makes it very suitable for high-performance, high-scale data center opportunities. Telemetry, you're absolutely right. The team has done a fantastic job of innovating in terms of new modern telemetry capabilities. Do I expect that the competitive landscape will evolve? Absolutely. We innovate all the time with the assumption that our competitors are aggressive and they're moving fast. And that's why we just have to move faster. And I think we're doing that. I think the most important thing you need to understand as you look at these switching and cloud opportunity is that we're playing an offensive game. We are out to take share in switching in the data center with a new end-to-end portfolio that is very competitive."

And it's driven -- our business in EMEA is driven mostly by large telcos. Now there are certainly some factors in EMEA that we are keeping a very close eye on. Economic stability, Brexit, foreign exchange and so on, that give us some room or some cause to be a little bit concerned about it going forward. But so far, I would say just judging by the performance we've seen in Q3, things are looking pretty good. Last but not least, APAC continues to be a good growth engine for us. I think the team there is executing really well with 18% year-over-year growth, driven by a number of different verticals, cloud in particular. And we're even seeing good sequential growth in China with the partnerships that we've announced there and with our product portfolio that's actually working quite well for us over there.

I think that the cloud opportunity remains robust for the forseeable future, I mean, end of this year and, I think, into next year. Large cloud providers and as well as the second-tier cloud providers that are, what we call born in the cloud, their business models evolve around the cloud opportunity, are essentially recognizing that their wide area networks and their data center networks are essential to delivering the kinds of experience that their customers demand. And for that reason, I think spending there will be robust. Telcos is a little bit of a different story and I've been consistent in how I've talked about the telco opportunity in the last few quarters. First, I think just judging by the conversations we have with our telco customers as well as their CapEx reports for the year and how much have they spent thus far, we do expect there to be some spending by telcos in the Q4 period. Longer term in telcos, all service providers or many service providers are going through an architectural transformation. They're really thinking about how to leverage their networks as essentially a distributed cloud network. And we are very pleased with how we're working very closely with our telco customers, who we obviously enjoy very close working relationship with, to help them with that transformation. And that speaks to our broad portfolio -- switching, routing, security -- and very much around our cloud software, Contrail being a very powerful tool that we have today to engage very strategically with these architectural transformations that are happening in our telco customers. Summing that all up, I think that for -- because of this transformation that's happening, telcos, we can expect, will divert their focus to that transition and less on just building out their core or their edge networks in the way that they have done in the past. The most important thing is that we remain very engaged, very close with them in their transformation so that we can benefit from the new types of build-outs that they will be deploying, and I think that will start in the 2017 time frame. So they're going through this shift, and we just have to make sure that we stay very close and we capitalize on the solutions we're offering them to help them with the shift itself."

When we think about our software strategy, there are several different elements to it. There is the controller elements, the software-defined networking elements to which Contrail certainly belongs, but also other products like our NorthStar wide area SDN Controller. There is the virtual network functions and the solutions around them. So the success that we've seen with the Cloud CPE solution at AT&T, Verizon as well as other Tier 1 telcos is indicative of the kinds of investment that we're making today that we believe are going to pay off in the future, I think starting next year. And then last but not least, the third leg of the stool is around this aggregation strategy. Over time, we do believe that the way in which we sell the value of our switching, our security and routing to an extent, is going to be more commensurate in how we invest in these products where the bulk of our investment is in fact, in the software. And for that reason, over time, I think it's going to be gradual. IT's not going to happen overnight, which is why we've given ourselves a few years to get to our target. What you're going to see I think, is our customers are going to buy the value in terms of software SKUs that are essentially decoupled from the hardware. It's still early days.

I think that the work that Juniper did 1.5 year, 2 years ago in streamlining and refocusing the company is really paying off for us today. So I do think that we are focused on the right areas, for the right opportunities. And the growth potential in each of the areas that we're focusing on is definitely there. You touched on 2 of them. Optical is a really important part of our overall solution. We're not thinking about optical as a stand-alone business. I think there are enough stand-alone optical players in this world. We think about optical as an element of an end-to-end solution with key emphasis on the metro and the data center interconnect markets. These are the opportunities that I think are right for disruption with a converse patent optical solution that's managed through really highly automated software. And I think that's the key behind the acquisition that we made of DTI. [ph] We now have the technology. We have the capability. We have the talent to enable us to integrate and develop these solutions for the data center interconnect and the metro market. And then in security, we've said it in the opening remarks. It's a business in transition. We continue to see the sequential momentum that we need to see in the business. We have undertaken it at the beginning of this year some very large, somewhat tricky product transitions where we're replacing older security products with newer ones, and we're seeing good ramp-up and growth in the newer technology that we've introduced in the market. So as I think about security, the opportunities there, I think our vision of the software-defined secure network is the right one, and we're hearing very good positive comments from our customers, our partners as well as industry analysts. Our software efficacy is only getting better every quarter. And it really comes down to that last critical piece of refreshing the older portfolio with a newer portfolio that gives us the ability to compete from an economic standpoint, a cost per bit per second of security. The QFX 4100 and 4200 product, we just announced them at our annual customer event a few weeks ago, and they will be making their way into the market very shortly. And that's an example of that refresh cycle that I'm talking about. And you talked about cloud-based security. I do think that, that is a direction of travel for security in the future. And this is why we're also investing in our virtual security product, like the virtual SRX, where we're seeing actually, good momentum now offered off of the Amazon Web Services [ph] marketplace, and as well as our ATP, our Advanced Threat Prevention, Sky ATP [ph] service that's offered from the cloud. So these are indicative of investments today that we think will pay off in the second horizon of security, which is all around the cloud."

But to be clear, we actually think of the SD WAN opportunity maybe a little bit differently than our peers in the industry. We think of SD WAN as just one point solution of a broad set of solutions that are the Enterprise customers will want and desire from telcos in the future. And so when you look at our solution, it really is around an open platform that the foundation of which is, Contrail is an orchestration system. And the NFX 250 is essentially an open platform that sits at the customer pram. It can run a multitude of services, SD WAN being one of them, security being the second one of them, load-balancing capability being a third one, et cetera, et cetera. And we actually sort of defined this vision, a couple of years ago. And what we're seeing now from our customers is, a keen acceptance of this as being the true future that they want to go and to achieve. I think of this as highly complementary to our overall opportunity at Juniper. Our existing physical box-centric, sort of CPE business is relatively small, unlike many of our competitors. And so we can play a much more disruptive game there. And then to your question around that, does this have an impact on the MPLS WAN space, if you will. I think a lot of the solutions will depend on hybrid model where they will leverage the Internet for certain types of traffic as well as manage MPLS or other types of traffic. I think if you integrate the whole opportunity, I think it's a net add for us."

And I already mentioned pricing was actually relatively stable. We didn't see a much change quarter-on-quarter as it relates to pricing. But product mix and it's really at a level below just routing, switching and security, it gets down to the product line and even within the product line, whether it's chassis and line cards, or a percentage of other commodity products within our solution. So it's a volatile product mix equation that does have propensity to go up or down a few tenths in any given quarter. We're pleased with our results in Q3, very in line with what we expected to WAN.

The exact same thing as routing because what you're doing is you're leveraging more -- you're leveraging more modern silicone technology et cetera, that tends to better optimize the cost per bit per second of your solution. So as you think about the types of things that we're looking at to achieve our long-term gross margin goal, their supply chain management and cost there, there's the innovation that goes with the introduction of new technologies that our tailwind to gross margin. Then there's just innovation, take for example, some of the work that we're doing in the optical space, in particular the recent acquisition in silicon photonics, which will have -- not an immediate, but in the long-term, I think positive effect on gross margin and the last but not least, the business model transformation. As you think about the evolution towards more software-based business models, all these things are factors that we believe will have a positive impact long-term on gross margin."

And in particular, where you see Juniper taking the most share is in fact, in the high-speed opportunities, which is over 10-gig. 100-gig being a perfect sweet spot for us. So if you know Juniper, you know that where we do exceptionally well is where scale and performance matters. And where data centers require 100-gig interfaces.

We delivered another solid quarter with total revenue at $1,285,000,000, stronger than the outlook we provided and up sequentially across all technologies and geographies.

We delivered another solid quarter with total revenue at $1,285,000,000, stronger than the outlook we provided and up sequentially across all technologies and geographies. We again delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, including strong operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance, particularly with our focus on execution, and we continue to take steps necessary to position the company for continued growth. 
I've said before that I believe that we have a great strategy in place to be a pure play innovator in IP networking that is going to transform the economics of networking with leading scale, performance and automation. As the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the market is shifting in our favor and will actually help us accelerate our strategy to power this cloud transformation. 
The investments we've made over the last few years have culminated in the strongest and most highly differentiated product portfolio in the history of this company. We now have a set of new products across key technology areas that we expect will help us achieve our revenue potential for the second half of this year and beyond. If you look at the products we've recently introduced in the market, they were developed with a keen understanding of what cloud providers want and need. In many cases, they were developed in partnership with our customers. One of the most important things that we must do as a company, is to ensure that we help our customers succeed as they transition to the cloud. 
Now I'd like to summarize some highlights this quarter across routing, switching and security. We are pleased to see our routing business continue to grow sequentially and year-over-year. While we are particularly pleased with growth in the cloud vertical, we saw our diversification strategy play out across telco and cable verticals in our product mix and across geographies. 
Our PTX line had another record revenue quarter, and along with our MX platform, they are proving to be our customers' preferred choices for their core and edge as they move faster to deployment with increasing confidence and appreciation of our technology differentiation. 
I'm very pleased with our strong performance in switching where we saw continued growth in the data center, and with cloud and content providers. We've seen a lot of interest for our new QFX products from cloud providers as well as large telcos, cable providers, large enterprises and federal governments who are demanding high capacity, high-speed networking. For the Q3 period, total revenue for our QFX switch line grew at 50% year-over-year. 
Our deliberate focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast-growing data center switching portfolio over the past 2 years, and I believe we now have a complete portfolio that is going to help us continue to grow our switching business in the future. 
Security continues to be a business that is in transition for us. We've made progress in certain areas, introducing new management software and enhancing the overall efficacy of our flagship SRX platform, which in fact has recently received third-party validation for excellent security efficacy in next-gen firewall testing. 
Earlier this month at our annual customer event, NXTWORK 2016, we announced critical enhancements to our security portfolio, extending our software-defined secure network vision with advanced automated enforcement throughout the network. These additions include Junos Space Security Director's Policy Enforcer, which delivers deeper network threat prevention down to the switch level. We also announced new midrange firewalls, the SRX4100 and the SRX4200, that are optimized for hybrid cloud environment. 
Looking ahead, our priority remains on innovation, execution and on improving our performance and operating efficiency. At Investor Day earlier this year, we stated that we are constructive on 2016 growth for the full year. We remain constructive on the second half of 2016 and are pleased with the traction our new products are seeing with customers. 
The market trends taking place in the industry play to our core competencies and provide growth opportunities for a challenger like Juniper. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on them. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Finally, I want to extend a very big thank you to our employees who each play a role in helping shape a stronger Juniper. 
With that said, I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss results of the quarter in more detail."

The results of the September quarter reflects solid sequential revenue and earnings growth. Our sequential revenue growth was balanced across all technologies, markets and geographies, and we are pleased with the momentum of our new products. 
We saw continued data center strength, particularly with our QFX family of products, which grew 50% year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 4 were cloud or cable providers, 4 were telecoms and 2 were enterprises. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with product book-to-bill greater than 1 and an increase in product deferred revenue, up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $245 million, down $109 million sequentially, primarily due to payments for incentive compensation. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $112 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
As many of you know, we initiated a capital return program in early 2014. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $4,060,000,000 of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4,100,000,000 and we reiterate our commitment to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividends beginning in 2017. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Year-over-year, the decrease in product gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was due to product mix and elevated pricing pressure, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. 
Now moving on to Q4 outlook, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products and expect continued strength with cloud providers and enterprise customers. 
While we continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on cost improvements. We expect gross margins to remain approximately at the Q3 levels in the near term. 
On a full-year basis, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect revenue growth, which is consistent with our outlook from previous quarters, as well as earnings per share growth. We are focused on growth and continued earnings expansion and are confident in our strategy and long-term model. 
I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

I was hoping you could help us understand which of these models have been driving the strength. If there were any large deals here or if it was more broad-based. And perhaps, to what degree do you see this lineup competing for routing opportunities versus Jericho-based alternatives? And what are the implications of success in that application on your core routing business? How should we think about that? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could provide some additional color on the pricing environment. Last quarter, you suggested we'd likely to see some gross margin improvement as volumes pick up in Q4. We could potentially get back to the 64% levels over time. Now it sounds like you don't expect to see any improvement in Q4. So perhaps you can touch upon what's changed. Is pricing pressures still concentrated in Europe? Is it more broad-based? To what extent we should be thinking about 63% as the new normal? Or do you think you can see some more improvement next year?"

So first, very pleased with the performance of our switching business in the Q3 time frame. In particular, what you're seeing is that the focus that we have on the data center and the cloud opportunity is really starting to pay off for us, and you can see that in the strength of the QFX portfolio all up. As you know, the new products that we've introduced, the 10002, the 10008 and the upcoming 10016, are all intended to round out an end-to-end switching portfolio that make us competitive in far more switching opportunities than we've ever been historically. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So we're now participating in proof of concepts, in RFPs, et cetera that we, quite frankly, just never had access to historically. So the new products that we've introduced are they themselves starting to ramp, as we expected in the second half. But more importantly, they round out our portfolio in a way that gives us more competitiveness overall. And now add to that our Contrail Orchestration system, routing at the edge of the data center and security, and we really have a very compelling end-to-end cloud data center portfolio that we're, I think, leveraging very effectively. On your question around Jericho and silicon, obviously, a question that we get quite a lot. Every new product we develop, we do it with a keen eye on making sure that we choose the very best silicon for that product. We're not religious about what silicon that we choose. But I will say this: every decision that we've made thus far in all products across routing and switching that we have developed has been absolutely the right one. And that means in certain cases, we're going to use custom; in certain cases, we're going to use merchant. And that might change over time as we look out and we develop sort of the roadmap across switching and routing in the future. But for now, rest assured I feel very good about the decisions that we've made thus far in our silicon choices. I think you had one more thing, which is around routing. The data center problem is, in fact, a high-performance networking problem that requires a robust routing stack. And that is one of the key differentiators of our QFX product line. Ken?"

From a pricing perspective, we did talk about elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2. For Q3, we saw that normalize a bit, so we didn't see the continuation of the elevated pressure. We saw a little more normalization across quarter-on-quarter. Still a very competitive market, though I would definitely keep that in mind. A lot of factors go into our guidance for gross margin. Clearly, the macro environment, the competitive landscape, customer mix, product mix, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in some of those dimensions. So I think the prudent thing at this point, which is what we set into our guidance, is to assume 63%, not only in Q4 but in the near term as we continue to work through the macro uncertainties and some of the other fluctuations there in gross margin. We're very focused on continuing to deliver innovation and continuing to improve our cost structure, and we are driving towards our 64% long-term gross margin model. But again, I think the prudent thing to do for the time being in Q4 and the near term would be to assume 64% -- I'm sorry, 63%."

And if I'm not mistaken, Arista, who is probably one of your main competitor in that segment, brought up a new product line with improved telemetry offerings. And so my question would be, do you think the competitive landscape could evolve a bit in the next 2 or 3 quarters, with a competitor getting closer to you at least on that dimension?

First, I think that the success that we've seen in the QFX all up is more broad-based than just the large cloud providers. I think they are -- it includes success in certain cloud providers, in the enterprise, in federal government and also, in fact, in some telcos opportunities as well. When I think about the competitiveness of our product portfolio in switching, there are very different aspects of it. First is scale. And typically, when people hear the word scale, they think of the number of ports on a box. But it's actually more complicated than that, also around number of routes, number of hosts, number of IP addresses, what we call logical scale. And we've really pushed the envelope on the logical scale of our products that gives us an edge compared to anything that's out there today. Then there's the robust routing capabilities. We have the full Junos IP stack on this thing, which makes it very suitable for high-performance, high-scale data center opportunities. Telemetry, you're absolutely right. The team has done a fantastic job of innovating in terms of new modern telemetry capabilities. Do I expect that the competitive landscape will evolve? Absolutely. We innovate all the time with the assumption that our competitors are aggressive and they're moving fast. And that's why we just have to move faster. And I think we're doing that. I think the most important thing you need to understand as you look at these switching and cloud opportunity is that we're playing an offensive game. We are out to take share in switching in the data center with a new end-to-end portfolio that is very competitive."

And it's driven -- our business in EMEA is driven mostly by large telcos. Now there are certainly some factors in EMEA that we are keeping a very close eye on. Economic stability, Brexit, foreign exchange and so on, that give us some room or some cause to be a little bit concerned about it going forward. But so far, I would say just judging by the performance we've seen in Q3, things are looking pretty good. Last but not least, APAC continues to be a good growth engine for us. I think the team there is executing really well with 18% year-over-year growth, driven by a number of different verticals, cloud in particular.

Large cloud providers and as well as the second-tier cloud providers that are, what we call born in the cloud, their business models evolve around the cloud opportunity, are essentially recognizing that their wide area networks and their data center networks are essential to delivering the kinds of experience that their customers demand. And for that reason, I think spending there will be robust. Telcos is a little bit of a different story, and I've been consistent in how I've talked about the telco opportunity over the last few quarters. First, I think just judging by the conversations we have with our telco customers as well as their CapEx reports for the year and how much they have spent thus far, we do expect there to be some spending by telcos in the Q4 period. Longer term in telcos, all service providers or many service providers are going through an architectural transformation. They're really thinking about how to leverage their networks as essentially a distributed cloud network. And we are very pleased with how we're working very closely with our telco customers, who we obviously enjoy very close working relationship with, to help them with that transformation. And that speaks to our broad portfolio -- switching, routing, security -- and very much around our cloud software, Contrail, being a very powerful tool that we have today to engage very strategically with these architectural transformations that are happening in our telco customers. Summing that all up, I think that for -- because of this transformation that's happening, telcos, we can expect, will divert their focus to that transition and less on just building out their core or their edge networks in the way that they have done in the past. The most important thing is that we remain very engaged, very close with them in their transformation so that we can benefit from the new types of build-outs that they will be deploying, and I think that will start in the 2017 time frame. So they're going through this shift, and we just have to make sure that we stay very close and we capitalize on the solutions we're offering them to help them with the shift itself."

When we developed and released the PTX into the market, we had a thesis around how telcos and cloud providers are going to be thinking about the evolution of their wide area networks, the data center interconnect networks. And while it had taken us some time to convince our customers and to help them in making the architectural transition towards those lean core networks or the super core networks that we call them, what we're seeing right now is exactly as what we had expected and hoped for, which is a real acceptance, and in fact, enthusiasm for these sorts of super core, lean core architectures that are driving the PTX business. So very pleased with the PTX growth thus far. We have a highly differentiated core product in the PTX after the introduction of the new line cards for that platform in the first half of this year. And I am bullish about the growth of the PTX going forward as well."

So you're absolutely right in that Contrail continues to see more and more interest, more and more adoption, especially with the OpenStack, but not exclusively the OpenStack community. More and more for example, customers are jumping on to the Kubernetes, a container type of solutions that -- for which Contrail is also highly suited. When we think about our software strategy, there are several different elements to it. There is the controller element, the software-defined networking element to which Contrail certainly belongs, but also other products like our NorthStar wide area SDN Controller. There is the virtual network functions and the solutions around them. So the success that we've seen with the Cloud CPE solution at AT&T, Verizon as well as other Tier 1 telcos is indicative of the kinds of investment that we're making today that we believe are going to pay off in the future, I think starting next year. And then last but not least, the third leg of the stool is around our -- this aggregation strategy. Over time, we do believe that the way in which we sell the value of our switching, our security and routing to an extent, is going to be more commensurate with how we invest in these products, where the bulk of our investment is, in fact, in the software. And for that reason, over time, I think this is going to be gradual. It's not going to happen overnight, which is why we've given ourselves a few years to get to our target. What you're going to see, I think, our customers are going to buy the value in terms of software SKUs that are essentially decoupled from the hardware. It's still early days. There is an entire industry that needs to sort of transform around that change in business model. But we're working towards that goal, and we're working very aggressively towards it."

I think that the work that Juniper did 1.5 year, 2 years ago in streamlining and refocusing the company is really paying off for us today. So I do think that we are focused on the right areas, for the right opportunities. And the growth potential in each of the areas that we're focusing on is definitely there. You touched on 2 of them. Optical is a really important part of our overall solution. We're not thinking about optical as a stand-alone business. I think there are enough stand-alone optical players in this world. We think about optical as an element of an end-to-end solution with key emphasis on the metro and the data center interconnect markets. These are the opportunities that I think are ripe for disruption with a converged packet optical solution that's managed through really highly automated software. And I think that's the key behind the acquisition that we made of DTI. We now have the technology. We have the capability. We have the talent to enable us to integrate and develop these solutions for the data center interconnect and the metro market. And then in security, we've said it in the opening remarks. It's a business in transition. We continue to see the sequential momentum that we need to see in the business. We have undertaken at the beginning of this year some very large, somewhat tricky product transitions, where we're replacing older security products with newer ones, and we're seeing good ramp-up in growth in the newer technology that we've introduced in the market. So as I think about security, the opportunities there, I think our vision of a software-defined secure network is the right one, and we're hearing very good, positive comments from our customers, our partners as well as industry analysts. Our software efficacy is only getting better every quarter. And it really comes down to that last critical piece of refreshing the older portfolio with a newer portfolio that gives us the ability to compete from an economic standpoint, a cost per bit per second of security. The QFX 4100 and 4200 product, we just announced them at our annual customer event a few weeks ago, and they will be making their way into the market very shortly. And that's an example of that refresh cycle that I'm talking about. And you talked about cloud-based security. I do think that, that is a direction of travel for security in the future. And this is why we're also investing in our virtual security product, like the virtual SRX, where we're seeing actually good momentum now offered off of the Amazon Web Services marketplace, and as well as our ATP, our Advanced Threat Prevention, Sky ATP service that's offered from the cloud. So these are indicative of investments today that we think will pay off in the second horizon of security, which is all around the cloud."

We think of SD-WAN as just one point solution of a broad set of solutions that are -- that enterprise customers will want and desire from telcos in the future. And so when you look at our solution, it really is around an open platform that the foundation of which is Contrail as an orchestration system. And the NFX250 is essentially an open platform that sits at the customer prem. It can run a multitude of services, SD-WAN being one of them, security being the second one of them, load balancing capability being a third one, et cetera, et cetera. And we actually sort of defined this vision a couple of years ago. And what we're seeing now from our customers is, a keen acceptance of this as being the true future that they want to go and to achieve. I think of this as highly complementary to our overall opportunity at Juniper. Our existing physical box-centric sort of CPE business is relatively small, unlike many of our competitors', and so we can play a much more disruptive game there. And then to your question around does this have an impact on the MPLS WAN space, if you will. I think a lot of the solutions will depend on a hybrid model, where they will leverage the Ethernet for certain types of traffic as well as manage MPLS or other types of traffic. All up, I think if you integrate the all up [ph] opportunity, I think it's a net add for us."

But product mix, and it's really at the level below just routing, switching and security. It gets down to the product lines, and even within the product lines, whether it's chassis and line cards and a percentage of other commodity products within our solution. So it's a volatile product mix equation. It does have propensity to go up or down a few tenths in any given quarter. We're pleased with our results in Q3, very in line with what we expected to land.

Then there's just innovation, take for example, some of the work that we're doing in the optical space, in particular the recent acquisition in silicon-photonics, which will have -- not an immediate, but in the long-term, I think positive effect on gross margin.

And then also, I think last quarter, you talked about some of the margin pressure is really being focused in Europe. Is that still the case?"

We delivered another solid quarter with total revenue at $1,285,000,000, stronger than the outlook we provided and up sequentially across all technologies and geographies. We again delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, including strong operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance, particularly with our focus on execution, and we continue to take steps necessary to position the company for continued growth. 
I've said before that I believe that we have a great strategy in place to be a pure play innovator in IP networking that is going to transform the economics of networking with leading scale, performance and automation. As the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the market is shifting in our favor and will actually help us accelerate our strategy to power this cloud transformation. 
The investments we've made over the last few years have culminated in the strongest and most highly differentiated product portfolio in the history of this company. We now have a set of new products across key technology areas that we expect will help us achieve our revenue potential for the second half of this year and beyond. If you look at the products we've recently introduced in the market, they were developed with a keen understanding of what cloud providers want and need. In many cases, they were developed in partnership with our customers. One of the most important things that we must do as a company, is to ensure that we help our customers succeed as they transition to the cloud. 
Now I'd like to summarize some highlights this quarter across routing, switching and security. We are pleased to see our routing business continue to grow sequentially and year-over-year. While we are particularly pleased with growth in the cloud vertical, we saw our diversification strategy play out across telco and cable verticals in our product mix and across geographies. 
Our PTX line had another record revenue quarter, and along with our MX platform, they are proving to be our customers' preferred choices for their core and edge as they move faster to deployment with increasing confidence and appreciation of our technology differentiation. 
I'm very pleased with our strong performance in switching where we saw continued growth in the data center, and with cloud and content providers. We've seen a lot of interest for our new QFX products from cloud providers as well as from large telcos, cable providers, large enterprises and federal governments who are demanding high capacity, high-speed networking. For the Q3 period, total revenue for our QFX switch line grew at 50% year-over-year. 
Our deliberate focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast-growing data center switching portfolio over the past 2 years, and I believe we now have a complete portfolio that is going to help us continue to grow our switching business in the future. 
Security continues to be a business that is in transition for us. We've made progress in certain areas, introducing new management software and enhancing the overall efficacy of our flagship SRX platform, which in fact has recently received third-party validation for excellent security efficacy in next-gen firewall testing. 
Earlier this month at our annual customer event, NXTWORK 2016, we announced critical enhancements to our security portfolio, extending our software-defined secure network vision with advanced automated enforcement throughout the network. These additions include Junos Space Security Director's Policy Enforcer, which delivers deeper network threat prevention down to the switch level. We also announced new midrange firewalls, the SRX4100 and the SRX4200, that are optimized for hybrid cloud environment. 
Looking ahead, our priority remains on innovation, execution and on improving our performance and operating efficiency. At Investor Day earlier this year, we stated that we are constructive on 2016 growth for the full year. We remain constructive on the second half of 2016 and are pleased with the traction our new products are seeing with customers. 
The market trends taking place in the industry play to our core competencies and provide growth opportunities for a challenger like Juniper. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on them. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Finally, I want to extend a very big thank you to our employees who each play a role in helping shape a stronger Juniper. 
With that said, I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss results of the quarter in more detail."

The results of the September quarter reflects solid sequential revenue and earnings growth. Our sequential revenue growth was balanced across all technologies, markets and geographies, and we are pleased with the momentum of our new products. 
We saw continued data center strength, particularly with our QFX family of products, which grew 50% year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 4 were cloud or cable providers, 4 were telecoms and 2 were enterprises. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with product book-to-bill greater than 1 and an increase in product deferred revenue, up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $245 million, down $109 million sequentially, primarily due to payments for incentive compensation. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $112 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
As many of you know, we initiated a capital return program in early 2014. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $4,060,000,000 of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4,100,000,000 and we reiterate our commitment to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividends beginning in 2017. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Year-over-year, the decrease in product gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was due to product mix and elevated pricing pressure, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. 
Now moving on to Q4 outlook, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products and expect continued strength with cloud providers and enterprise customers. 
While we continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on cost improvements. We expect gross margins to remain approximately at the Q3 levels in the near term. 
On a full-year basis, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect revenue growth, which is consistent with our outlook from previous quarters, as well as earnings per share growth. We are focused on growth and continued earnings expansion and are confident in our strategy and long-term model. 
I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

And then for Ken, I was hoping you could provide some additional color on the pricing environment. Last quarter, you suggested we'd likely to see some gross margin improvement as volumes pick up in Q4. We could potentially get back to the 64% levels over time. Now it sounds like you don't expect to see any improvement in Q4. So perhaps you can touch upon what's changed. Is pricing pressures still concentrated in Europe? Is it more broad-based?

So first, very pleased with the performance of our switching business in the Q3 time frame. In particular, what you're seeing is that the focus that we have on the data center and the cloud opportunity is really starting to pay off for us, and you can see that in the strength of the QFX portfolio all up. As you know, the new products that we've introduced, the 10002, the 10008 and the upcoming 10016, are all intended to round out an end-to-end switching portfolio that make us competitive in far more switching opportunities than we've ever been historically. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So we're now participating in proof of concepts, in RFPs, et cetera that we, quite frankly, just never had access to historically. So the new products that we've introduced are they themselves starting to ramp, as we expected in the second half. But more importantly, they round out our portfolio in a way that gives us more competitiveness overall. And now add to that our Contrail Orchestration system, routing at the edge of the data center and security, and we really have a very compelling end-to-end cloud data center portfolio that we're, I think, leveraging very effectively. On your question around Jericho and silicon, obviously, a question that we get quite a lot. Every new product we develop, we do it with a keen eye on making sure that we choose the very best silicon for that product. We're not religious about what silicon that we choose. But I will say this: every decision that we've made thus far in all products across routing and switching that we have developed has been absolutely the right one. And that means in certain cases, we're going to use custom; in certain cases, we're going to use merchant. And that might change over time as we look out and we develop sort of the roadmap across switching and routing in the future. But for now, rest assured I feel very good about the decisions that we've made thus far in our silicon choices. I think you had one more thing, which is around routing. The data center problem is, in fact, a high-performance networking problem that requires a robust routing stack. And that is one of the key differentiators of our QFX product line. Ken?"

From a pricing perspective, we did talk about elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2. For Q3, we saw that normalize a bit, so we didn't see the continuation of the elevated pressure. We saw a little more normalization across quarter-on-quarter. Still a very competitive market, though I would definitely keep that in mind. A lot of factors go into our guidance for gross margin. Clearly, the macro environment, the competitive landscape, customer mix, product mix, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in some of those dimensions. So I think the prudent thing at this point, which is what we set into our guidance, is to assume 63%, not only in Q4 but in the near term as we continue to work through the macro uncertainties and some of the other fluctuations there in gross margin. We're very focused on continuing to deliver innovation and continuing to improve our cost structure, and we are driving towards our 64% long-term gross margin model. But again, I think the prudent thing to do for the time being in Q4 and the near term would be to assume 64% -- I'm sorry, 63%."

And my other assumption is that what you've been able to bring to the market in terms of telemetry and the quality of your telemetry features have weighted a lot in your commercial success. And if I'm not mistaken, Arista, who is probably one of your main competitor in that segment, brought up a new product line with improved telemetry offerings. And so my question would be, do you think the competitive landscape could evolve a bit in the next 2 or 3 quarters, with a competitor getting closer to you at least on that dimension?

First, I think that the success that we've seen in the QFX all up is more broad-based than just the large cloud providers. I think they are -- it includes success in certain cloud providers, in the enterprise, in federal government and also, in fact, in some telcos opportunities as well. When I think about the competitiveness of our product portfolio in switching, there are various different aspects of it. First is scale. And typically, when people hear the word scale, they think of the number of ports on a box. But it's actually more complicated than that, also around number of routes, number of hosts, number of IP addresses, what we call logical scale. And we've really pushed the envelope on the logical scale of our products that gives us an edge compared to anything that's out there today. Then there's the robust routing capabilities. We have the full Junos IP stack on this thing, which makes it very suitable for high-performance, high-scale data center opportunities. Telemetry, you're absolutely right. The team has done a fantastic job of innovating in terms of new modern telemetry capabilities. Do I expect that the competitive landscape will evolve? Absolutely. We innovate all the time with the assumption that our competitors are aggressive and they're moving fast. And that's why we just have to move faster. And I think we're doing that. I think the most important thing you need to understand as you look at these switching and cloud opportunity is that we're playing an offensive game. We are out to take share in switching in the data center with a new end-to-end portfolio that is very competitive."

And it's driven -- our business in EMEA is driven mostly by large telcos. Now there are certainly some factors in EMEA that we are keeping a very close eye on. Economic stability, Brexit, foreign exchange and so on, that give us some room or some cause to be a little bit concerned about it going forward. But so far, I would say just judging by the performance we've seen in Q3, things are looking pretty good. Last but not least, APAC continues to be a good growth engine for us. I think the team there is executing really well with 18% year-over-year growth, driven by a number of different verticals, cloud in particular. And we're even seeing good sequential growth in China with the partnerships that we've announced there and with our product portfolio that's actually working quite well for us over there.

I think that the cloud opportunity remains robust for the forseeable future, I mean, end of this year and, I think, into next year. Large cloud providers and as well as the second-tier cloud providers that are, what we call born in the cloud, their business models evolve around the cloud opportunity, are essentially recognizing that their wide area networks and their data center networks are essential to delivering the kinds of experience that their customers demand. And for that reason, I think spending there will be robust. Telcos is a little bit of a different story, and I've been consistent in how I've talked about the telco opportunity over the last few quarters. First, I think just judging by the conversations we have with our telco customers as well as their CapEx reports for the year and how much they have spent thus far, we do expect there to be some spending by telcos in the Q4 period. Longer term in telcos, all service providers or many service providers are going through an architectural transformation. They're really thinking about how to leverage their networks as essentially a distributed cloud network. And we are very pleased with how we're working very closely with our telco customers, who we obviously enjoy very close working relationship with, to help them with that transformation. And that speaks to our broad portfolio -- switching, routing, security -- and very much around our cloud software, Contrail, being a very powerful tool that we have today to engage very strategically with these architectural transformations that are happening in our telco customers. Summing that all up, I think that for -- because of this transformation that's happening, telcos, we can expect, will divert their focus to that transition and less on just building out their core or their edge networks in the way that they have done in the past. The most important thing is that we remain very engaged, very close with them in their transformation so that we can benefit from the new types of build-outs that they will be deploying, and I think that will start in the 2017 time frame. So they're going through this shift, and we just have to make sure that we stay very close and we capitalize on the solutions we're offering them to help them with the shift itself."

More and more for example, customers are jumping on to the Kubernetes, a container type of solutions that -- for which Contrail is also highly suited. When we think about our software strategy, there are several different elements to it. There is the controller element, the software-defined networking element to which Contrail certainly belongs, but also other products like our NorthStar wide area SDN Controller. There is the virtual network functions and the solutions around them. So the success that we've seen with the Cloud CPE solution at AT&T, Verizon as well as other Tier 1 telcos is indicative of the kinds of investment that we're making today that we believe are going to pay off in the future, I think starting next year. And then last but not least, the third leg of the stool is around our -- this aggregation strategy. Over time, we do believe that the way in which we sell the value of our switching, our security and routing to an extent, is going to be more commensurate with how we invest in these products, where the bulk of our investment is, in fact, in the software. And for that reason, over time, I think this is going to be gradual. It's not going to happen overnight, which is why we've given ourselves a few years to get to our target. What you're going to see, I think, our customers are going to buy the value in terms of software SKUs that are essentially decoupled from the hardware. It's still early days. There is an entire industry that needs to sort of transform around that change in business model. But we're working towards that goal, and we're working very aggressively towards it."

I think that the work that Juniper did 1.5 year, 2 years ago in streamlining and refocusing the company is really paying off for us today. So I do think that we are focused on the right areas, for the right opportunities. And the growth potential in each of the areas that we're focusing on is definitely there. You touched on 2 of them. Optical is a really important part of our overall solution. We're not thinking about optical as a stand-alone business. I think there are enough stand-alone optical players in this world. We think about optical as an element of an end-to-end solution with key emphasis on the metro and the data center interconnect markets. These are the opportunities that I think are ripe for disruption with a converged packet optical solution that's managed through really highly automated software. And I think that's the key behind the acquisition that we made of DTI. We now have the technology. We have the capability. We have the talent to enable us to integrate and develop these solutions for the data center interconnect and the metro market. And then in security, we've said it in the opening remarks. It's a business in transition. We continue to see the sequential momentum that we need to see in the business. We have undertaken at the beginning of this year some very large, somewhat tricky product transitions, where we're replacing older security products with newer ones, and we're seeing good ramp-up in growth in the newer technology that we've introduced in the market. So as I think about security, the opportunities there, I think our vision of a software-defined secure network is the right one, and we're hearing very good, positive comments from our customers, our partners as well as industry analysts. Our software efficacy is only getting better every quarter. And it really comes down to that last critical piece of refreshing the older portfolio with a newer portfolio that gives us the ability to compete from an economic standpoint, a cost per bit per second of security. The QFX 4100 and 4200 product, we just announced them at our annual customer event a few weeks ago, and they will be making their way into the market very shortly. And that's an example of that refresh cycle that I'm talking about. And you talked about cloud-based security. I do think that, that is a direction of travel for security in the future. And this is why we're also investing in our virtual security products, like the virtual SRX, where we're seeing actually good momentum now offered off of the Amazon Web Services marketplace, and as well as our ATP, our Advanced Threat Prevention, Sky ATP service that's offered from the cloud. So these are indicative of investments today that we think will pay off in the second horizon of security, which is all around the cloud."

But to be clear, we actually think of the SD-WAN opportunity maybe a little bit differently than our peers in the industry. We think of SD-WAN as just one point solution of a broad set of solutions that are -- that enterprise customers will want and desire from telcos in the future. And so when you look at our solution, it really is around an open platform that the foundation of which is Contrail as an orchestration system. And the NFX250 is essentially an open platform that sits at the customer prem. It can run a multitude of services, SD-WAN being one of them, security being the second one of them, load balancing capability being a third one, et cetera, et cetera. And we actually sort of defined this vision a couple of years ago. And what we're seeing now from our customers is, a keen acceptance of this as being the true future that they want to go and to achieve. I think of this as highly complementary to our overall opportunity at Juniper. Our existing physical box-centric sort of CPE business is relatively small, unlike many of our competitors', and so we can play a much more disruptive game there. And then to your question around does this have an impact on the MPLS WAN space, if you will. I think a lot of the solutions will depend on a hybrid model, where they will leverage the internet for certain types of traffic as well as manage MPLS or other types of traffic. All up, I think if you integrate the whole opportunity, I think it's a net add for us."

But product mix, and it's really at the level below just routing, switching and security. It gets down to the product lines, and even within the product lines, whether it's chassis and line cards and a percentage of other commodity products within our solution. So it's a volatile product mix equation that does have propensity to go up or down a few tenths in any given quarter. We're pleased with our results in Q3, very in line with what we expected to land.

Because what you're doing is you're leveraging [indiscernible], you're leveraging more modern silicon technology et cetera, that tends to better optimize the cost per bit per second of your solution. So as you think about the types of things that we're looking at to achieve our long-term gross margin goal, there's supply chain management and cost there, there's the innovation that goes with the introduction of new technologies that are tailwinds to gross margins. Then there's just innovation, take for example, some of the work that we're doing in the optical space, in particular the recent acquisition in silicon-photonics, which will have -- not an immediate, but in the long-term, I think positive effect on gross margin. And the last but not least, the business model transformation. As you think about the evolution towards more software-based business models, all these things are factors that we believe will have a positive impact long-term on gross margins."

And in particular, where you see Juniper taking the most share is, in fact, in the high-speed opportunities, which is over 10-gig, 100-gig being a perfect sweet spot for us. So if you know Juniper, you know that where we do exceptionally well is where scale and performance matters and where data centers require 100-gig interfaces.

We delivered another solid quarter with total revenue at $1,285,000,000, stronger than the outlook we provided and up sequentially across all technologies and geographies. We again delivered strong profitability metrics sequentially, including strong operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. I'm pleased with our overall performance, particularly with our focus on execution, and we continue to take steps necessary to position the company for continued growth. 
I've said before that I believe that we have a great strategy in place to be a pure play innovator in IP networking that is going to transform the economics of networking with leading scale, performance and automation. As the world moves rapidly to the cloud, we believe that the market is shifting in our favor and will actually help us accelerate our strategy to power this cloud transformation. 
The investments we've made over the last few years have culminated in the strongest and most highly differentiated product portfolio in the history of this company. We now have a set of new products across key technology areas that we expect will help us achieve our revenue potential for the second half of this year and beyond. If you look at the products we've recently introduced in the market, they were developed with a keen understanding of what cloud providers want and need. In many cases, they were developed in partnership with our customers. One of the most important things that we must do as a company, is to ensure that we help our customers succeed as they transition to the cloud. 
Now I'd like to summarize some highlights this quarter across routing, switching and security. We are pleased to see our routing business continue to grow sequentially and year-over-year. While we are particularly pleased with growth in the cloud vertical, we saw our diversification strategy play out across telco and cable verticals in our product mix and across geographies. 
Our PTX line had another record revenue quarter, and along with our MX platform, they are proving to be our customers' preferred choices for their core and edge as they move faster to deployment with increasing confidence and appreciation of our technology differentiation. 
I'm very pleased with our strong performance in switching where we saw continued growth in the data center, and with cloud and content providers. We've seen a lot of interest for our new QFX products from cloud providers as well as from large telcos, cable providers, large enterprises and federal governments who are demanding high capacity, high-speed networking. For the Q3 period, total revenue for our QFX switch line grew at 50% year-over-year. 
Our deliberate focus on the cloud opportunity has resulted in a fast-growing data center switching portfolio over the past 2 years, and I believe we now have a complete portfolio that is going to help us continue to grow our switching business in the future. 
Security continues to be a business that is in transition for us. We've made progress in certain areas, introducing new management software and enhancing the overall efficacy of our flagship SRX platform, which in fact has recently received third-party validation for excellent security efficacy in next-gen firewall testing. 
Earlier this month at our annual customer event, NXTWORK 2016, we announced critical enhancements to our security portfolio, extending our software-defined secure network vision with advanced automated enforcement throughout the network. These additions include Junos Space Security Director's Policy Enforcer, which delivers deeper network threat prevention down to the switch level. We also announced new midrange firewalls, the SRX4100 and the SRX4200, that are optimized for hybrid cloud environment. 
Looking ahead, our priority remains on innovation, execution and on improving our performance and operating efficiency. At Investor Day earlier this year, we stated that we are constructive on 2016 growth for the full year. We remain constructive on the second half of 2016 and are pleased with the traction our new products are seeing with customers. 
The market trends taking place in the industry play to our core competencies and provide growth opportunities for a challenger like Juniper. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on them. 
I want to thank our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued confidence and support. Finally, I want to extend a very big thank you to our employees who each play a role in helping shape a stronger Juniper. 
With that said, I'll turn the call over to Ken, who will discuss results of the quarter in more detail."

The results of the September quarter reflects solid sequential revenue and earnings growth. Our sequential revenue growth was balanced across all technologies, markets and geographies, and we are pleased with the momentum of our new products. 
We saw continued data center strength, particularly with our QFX family of products, which grew 50% year-over-year. 
In reviewing our top 10 customers for the quarter, 4 were cloud or cable providers, 4 were telecoms and 2 were enterprises. Of these customers, 2 were located outside of the United States. 
Our underlying demand metrics were healthy this quarter, with product book-to-bill greater than 1 and an increase in product deferred revenue, up 24% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. 
In the quarter, we had cash flow from operations of $245 million, down $109 million sequentially, primarily due to payments for incentive compensation. 
During the quarter, we repurchased $112 million of shares and paid $38 million in dividends. 
As many of you know, we initiated a capital return program in early 2014. Since the first quarter of 2014, inclusive of share repurchases and dividends, we have returned approximately $4,060,000,000 of capital to shareholders against our commitment to return $4,100,000,000 and we reiterate our commitment to return approximately 50% of annual free cash flow inclusive of share repurchases and dividends beginning in 2017. 
Non-GAAP gross margin was within our guided range for the quarter. Year-over-year, the decrease in product gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was due to product mix and elevated pricing pressure, partially offset by improvements in our cost structure. While the pricing environment is challenging, we remain focused on delivering innovation and continued improvements to our cost structure. 
In the quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $494 million, which was slightly below the low end of our guidance range. This is a result of our continued focus on prudent cost discipline. 
Now moving on to Q4 outlook, which is detailed in our CFO commentary available on our website. We are focused on executing to our strategy and capitalizing on the momentum of our new products and expect continued strength with cloud providers and enterprise customers. 
While we continue to see pricing pressure and product mix fluctuations, we remain focused on cost improvements. We expect gross margins to remain approximately at the Q3 levels in the near term. 
On a full-year basis, at the midpoint of our guidance, we expect revenue growth, which is consistent with our outlook from previous quarters, as well as earnings per share growth. We are focused on growth and continued earnings expansion and are confident in our strategy and long-term model. 
I would like to thank our team for their continued dedication and commitment to Juniper's success. And with that, I'd like to open the call for questions."

I was hoping you could help us understand which of these models have been driving the strength. If there were any large deals here or if it was more broad-based. And perhaps, to what degree do you see this lineup competing for routing opportunities versus Jericho-based alternatives? And what are the implications of success in that application on your core routing business? How should we think about that? And then for Ken, I was hoping you could provide some additional color on the pricing environment. Last quarter, you suggested we'd likely to see some gross margin improvement as volumes pick up in Q4. We could potentially get back to the 64% levels over time. Now it sounds like you don't expect to see any improvement in Q4. So perhaps you can touch upon what's changed. Is pricing pressures still concentrated in Europe? Is it more broad-based? To what extent we should be thinking about 63% as the new normal? Or do you think you can see some more improvement next year?"

So first, very pleased with the performance of our switching business in the Q3 time frame. In particular, what you're seeing is that the focus that we have on the data center and the cloud opportunity is really starting to pay off for us, and you can see that in the strength of the QFX portfolio all up. As you know, the new products that we've introduced, the 10002, the 10008 and the upcoming 10016, are all intended to round out an end-to-end switching portfolio that make us competitive in far more switching opportunities than we've ever been historically. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So we're now participating in proof of concepts, in RFPs, et cetera that we, quite frankly, just never had access to historically. So the new products that we've introduced are they themselves starting to ramp, as we expected in the second half. But more importantly, they round out our portfolio in a way that gives us more competitiveness overall. And now add to that our Contrail Orchestration system, routing at the edge of the data center and security, and we really have a very compelling end-to-end cloud data center portfolio that we're, I think, leveraging very effectively. On your question around Jericho and silicon, obviously, a question that we get quite a lot. Every new product we develop, we do it with a keen eye on making sure that we choose the very best silicon for that product. We're not religious about what silicon that we choose. But I will say this: every decision that we've made thus far in all products across routing and switching that we have developed has been absolutely the right one. And that means in certain cases, we're going to use custom; in certain cases, we're going to use merchant. And that might change over time as we look out and we develop sort of the roadmap across switching and routing in the future. But for now, rest assured I feel very good about the decisions that we've made thus far in our silicon choices. I think you had one more thing, which is around routing. The data center problem is, in fact, a high-performance networking problem that requires a robust routing stack. And that is one of the key differentiators of our QFX product line. Ken?"

From a pricing perspective, we did talk about elevated pricing pressure that we experienced in Q2. For Q3, we saw that normalize a bit, so we didn't see the continuation of the elevated pressure. We saw a little more normalization across quarter-on-quarter. Still a very competitive market, though I would definitely keep that in mind. A lot of factors go into our guidance for gross margin. Clearly, the macro environment, the competitive landscape, customer mix, product mix, there's a fair amount of uncertainty in some of those dimensions. So I think the prudent thing at this point, which is what we set into our guidance, is to assume 63%, not only in Q4 but in the near term as we continue to work through the macro uncertainties and some of the other fluctuations there in gross margin. We're very focused on continuing to deliver innovation and continuing to improve our cost structure, and we are driving towards our 64% long-term gross margin model. But again, I think the prudent thing to do for the time being in Q4 and the near term would be to assume 64% -- I'm sorry, 63%."

And if I'm not mistaken, Arista, who is probably one of your main competitor in that segment, brought up a new product line with improved telemetry offerings. And so my question would be, do you think the competitive landscape could evolve a bit in the next 2 or 3 quarters, with a competitor getting closer to you at least on that dimension?

First, I think that the success that we've seen in the QFX all up is more broad-based than just the large cloud providers. I think they are -- it includes success in certain cloud providers, in the enterprise, in federal government and also, in fact, in some telcos opportunities as well. When I think about the competitiveness of our product portfolio in switching, there are various different aspects of it. First is scale. And typically, when people hear the word scale, they think of the number of ports on a box. But it's actually more complicated than that, also around number of routes, number of hosts, number of IP addresses, what we call logical scale. And we've really pushed the envelope on the logical scale of our products that gives us an edge compared to anything that's out there today. Then there's the robust routing capabilities. We have the full Junos IP stack on this thing, which makes it very suitable for high-performance, high-scale data center opportunities. Telemetry, you're absolutely right. The team has done a fantastic job of innovating in terms of new modern telemetry capabilities. Do I expect that the competitive landscape will evolve? Absolutely. We innovate all the time with the assumption that our competitors are aggressive and they're moving fast. And that's why we just have to move faster. And I think we're doing that. I think the most important thing you need to understand as you look at these switching and cloud opportunity is that we're playing an offensive game. We are out to take share in switching in the data center with a new end-to-end portfolio that is very competitive."

And it's driven -- our business in EMEA is driven mostly by large telcos. Now there are certainly some factors in EMEA that we are keeping a very close eye on. Economic stability, Brexit, foreign exchange and so on, that give us some room or some cause to be a little bit concerned about it going forward. But so far, I would say just judging by the performance we've seen in Q3, things are looking pretty good. Last but not least, APAC continues to be a good growth engine for us. I think the team there is executing really well with 18% year-over-year growth, driven by a number of different verticals, cloud in particular.

Large cloud providers and as well as the second-tier cloud providers that are, what we call born in the cloud, their business models evolve around the cloud opportunity, are essentially recognizing that their wide area networks and their data center networks are essential to delivering the kinds of experience that their customers demand. And for that reason, I think spending there will be robust. Telcos is a little bit of a different story, and I've been consistent in how I've talked about the telco opportunity over the last few quarters. First, I think just judging by the conversations we have with our telco customers as well as their CapEx reports for the year and how much they have spent thus far, we do expect there to be some spending by telcos in the Q4 period. Longer term in telcos, all service providers or many service providers are going through an architectural transformation. They're really thinking about how to leverage their networks as essentially a distributed cloud network. And we are very pleased with how we're working very closely with our telco customers, who we obviously enjoy very close working relationship with, to help them with that transformation. And that speaks to our broad portfolio -- switching, routing, security -- and very much around our cloud software, Contrail, being a very powerful tool that we have today to engage very strategically with these architectural transformations that are happening in our telco customers. Summing that all up, I think that for -- because of this transformation that's happening, telcos, we can expect, will divert their focus to that transition and less on just building out their core or their edge networks in the way that they have done in the past. The most important thing is that we remain very engaged, very close with them in their transformation so that we can benefit from the new types of build-outs that they will be deploying, and I think that will start in the 2017 time frame. So they're going through this shift, and we just have to make sure that we stay very close and we capitalize on the solutions we're offering them to help them with the shift itself."

And while it had taken us some time to convince our customers and to help them in making the architectural transition towards those lean core networks or the super core networks that we call them, what we're seeing right now is exactly as what we had expected and hoped for, which is a real acceptance, and in fact, enthusiasm for these sorts of super core, lean core architectures that are driving the PTX business. So very pleased with the PTX growth thus far. We have a highly differentiated core product in the PTX after the introduction of the new line cards for that platform in the first half of this year. And I am bullish about the growth of the PTX going forward as well."

So you're absolutely right in that Contrail continues to see more and more interest, more and more adoption, especially with the OpenStack, but not exclusively the OpenStack community. More and more for example, customers are jumping on to the Kubernetes, a container type of solutions that -- for which Contrail is also highly suited. When we think about our software strategy, there are several different elements to it. There is the controller element, the software-defined networking element to which Contrail certainly belongs, but also other products like our NorthStar wide area SDN Controller. There is the virtual network functions and the solutions around them. So the success that we've seen with the Cloud CPE solution at AT&T, Verizon as well as other Tier 1 telcos is indicative of the kinds of investment that we're making today that we believe are going to pay off in the future, I think starting next year. And then last but not least, the third leg of the stool is around our -- this aggregation strategy. Over time, we do believe that the way in which we sell the value of our switching, our security and routing to an extent, is going to be more commensurate with how we invest in these products, where the bulk of our investment is, in fact, in the software. And for that reason, over time, I think this is going to be gradual. It's not going to happen overnight, which is why we've given ourselves a few years to get to our target. What you're going to see, I think, our customers are going to buy the value in terms of software SKUs that are essentially decoupled from the hardware. It's still early days. There is an entire industry that needs to sort of transform around that change in business model. But we're working towards that goal, and we're working very aggressively towards it."

I think that the work that Juniper did 1.5 year, 2 years ago in streamlining and refocusing the company is really paying off for us today. So I do think that we are focused on the right areas, for the right opportunities. And the growth potential in each of the areas that we're focusing on is definitely there. You touched on 2 of them. Optical is a really important part of our overall solution. We're not thinking about optical as a stand-alone business. I think there are enough stand-alone optical players in this world. We think about optical as an element of an end-to-end solution with key emphasis on the metro and the data center interconnect markets. These are the opportunities that I think are ripe for disruption with a converged packet optical solution that's managed through really highly automated software. And I think that's the key behind the acquisition that we made of DTI. We now have the technology. We have the capability. We have the talent to enable us to integrate and develop these solutions for the data center interconnect and the metro market. And then in security, we've said it in the opening remarks. It's a business in transition. We continue to see the sequential momentum that we need to see in the business. We have undertaken at the beginning of this year some very large, somewhat tricky product transitions, where we're replacing older security products with newer ones, and we're seeing good ramp-up in growth in the newer technology that we've introduced in the market. So as I think about security, the opportunities there, I think our vision of a software-defined secure network is the right one, and we're hearing very good, positive comments from our customers, our partners as well as industry analysts. Our software efficacy is only getting better every quarter. And it really comes down to that last critical piece of refreshing the older portfolio with a newer portfolio that gives us the ability to compete from an economic standpoint, a cost per bit per second of security. The QFX 4100 and 4200 product, we just announced them at our annual customer event a few weeks ago, and they will be making their way into the market very shortly. And that's an example of that refresh cycle that I'm talking about. And you talked about cloud-based security. I do think that, that is a direction of travel for security in the future. And this is why we're also investing in our virtual security products, like the virtual SRX, where we're seeing actually good momentum now offered off of the Amazon Web Services marketplace, and as well as our ATP, our Advanced Threat Prevention, Sky ATP service that's offered from the cloud. So these are indicative of investments today that we think will pay off in the second horizon of security, which is all around the cloud."

But to be clear, we actually think of the SD-WAN opportunity maybe a little bit differently than our peers in the industry. We think of SD-WAN as just one point solution of a broad set of solutions that are -- that enterprise customers will want and desire from telcos in the future. And so when you look at our solution, it really is around an open platform that the foundation of which is Contrail as an orchestration system. And the NFX250 is essentially an open platform that sits at the customer prem. It can run a multitude of services, SD-WAN being one of them, security being the second one of them, load balancing capability being a third one, et cetera, et cetera. And we actually sort of defined this vision a couple of years ago. And what we're seeing now from our customers is, a keen acceptance of this as being the true future that they want to go and to achieve. I think of this as highly complementary to our overall opportunity at Juniper. Our existing physical box-centric sort of CPE business is relatively small, unlike many of our competitors', and so we can play a much more disruptive game there. And then to your question around does this have an impact on the MPLS WAN space, if you will. I think a lot of the solutions will depend on a hybrid model, where they will leverage the internet for certain types of traffic as well as manage MPLS or other types of traffic. All up, I think if you integrate the whole opportunity, I think it's a net add for us."

But product mix, and it's really at the level below just routing, switching and security. It gets down to the product lines, and even within the product lines, whether it's chassis and line cards and a percentage of other commodity products within our solution. So it's a volatile product mix equation that does have propensity to go up or down a few tenths in any given quarter. We're pleased with our results in Q3, very in line with what we expected to land.

Technology matters, the broader portfolio of solution matters, things like professional services and our ability to go and to help our customers in evolving their networks from a legacy network to a cloud, highly automated data center with solutions like Contrail. All of these are factors. I'm not saying pricing is not a factor, but it's much more complicated than just a pricing discussion. It's not just tied to switching and it's not only tied to Europe. I think it's broader base than that. Right, Ken?"

From a pricing perspective, specifically discounting, we did see some stabilization there this quarter as compared to last.

But from a numbers perspective, we did see some lumpiness in the government vertical. It's an important vertical for us, but it's not one of our largest cup of verticals, so it does have a propensity to be up or down in certain deployments as they happen around the world. I would make sure folks understand that government is an international vertical for us, so we do a fair amount of business internationally in government sector as well. And what you saw in Q2 was actually a very strong government number. And so sequentially, we saw a little bit of a retraction but its -- we're still very focused on that vertical going forward. It's really more deployment based than anything else."
