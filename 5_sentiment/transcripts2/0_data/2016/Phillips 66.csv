This allowed us to maintain a stro",684,"Thanks, Clayton. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. 
We had a good year in 2015. Adjusted earnings were $4.2 billion, which is our highest since 2012. We generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations. This allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility while funding our capital program and returning $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We made significant progress on our growth projects in Midstream and Chemicals, and we continued to improve returns in our Refining and Marketing businesses. Despite the difficult environment experienced throughout the energy industry, our diversified asset portfolio has performed well. 
We continue to execute our plan. For us, it all starts with operating excellence. We spent $1.2 billion in sustaining capital in 2015. And from an operating reliability perspective, our businesses ran well. 
2015 was a very safe year for us. We tied our best year ever for recordable injuries. At Refining, Chemicals and Midstream were top performers in injury rates.  We also maintained the improvement in our environmental performance demonstrated in previous years. 
We ended 2015 with a solid quarter, especially when considering the current commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings were $710 million or $1.31 per share. Market cracks were down significantly in the fourth quarter from the highs that we saw last summer, but our global Refining business continue to run well with 94% utilization. Marketing earnings were healthy, and this continues to be a high-return business for us. 2015 adjusted return on capital employed was 35% for this segment.  In Midstream, we commenced operations of the Sweeny Fractionator One and supporting Clements Storage Caverns. 
2016 will be another busy year for us with several other Midstream projects scheduled for completion. Our Freeport LNG export terminal is now 80% complete. It's on track, on budget with an expected start-up in the fourth quarter of 2016. access and the pipeline projects also continue to make good progress and remain on schedule for completion by the end of this year.
Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our midstream growth strategy. The fee-based assets with PSXP's folder continued to perform well and are not impacted by the current market conditions. PSXP continues on track to achieve its stated growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 90% for the year at PSXP, while distribution growth and coverage were also strong. In addition, PSXP was able to raise $1.5 billion of low-cost capital through the debt and equity capital markets in 2015.
PSX continues to work on reducing costs and converting contracts to fee-based structures to improve its financial strength and flexibility. The equity contributions from the owners in the fourth quarter helped in that regard. We expect that DCP will be self-funded going forward.
In Chemicals, cash margins fell during the fourth quarter. However, they remain strong by historical standards. CPChem's geographically advantaged footprint allows it to remain profitable and able to self-fund its growth projects. Development continues on CPChem U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals projects, which will increase CPChem's U.S. ethylene and polyethylene capacity by over 40%. Overall goal progress on the project is approaching 70% complete with start-up planned in mid-2017. This project remains on time and on budget. 
We had another strong cash flow quarter. We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations. We used $1 billion of that cash flow in capital spending to support Midstream growth and maintaining operating integrity and our Refining system. 
We also continue to return capital to our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 3 years, shareholder distributions have totaled more than $9 billion.
Looking forward to 2016, our focus remains on operating well and executing our $3.9 billion capital budget. We continue to target a 60-40 split between the investment and distributions, and we have targeted a dividend increase in 2016 of at least 10%. 
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to take us through the quarter's results."

Good morning.  Starting on Slide 4, fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $710 million or $1.31 per share. Reported net income was $650 million, including several special items excluded from our adjusted earnings. The special items decreased earnings by $60 million and included $104 million in impairments at DCP and a $33 million lower of cost or market write-down of inventory at our Wood River joint venture, offset by an $88 million gain tied to favorable changes in German tax law. Excluding negative working capital changes of $300 million, cash from operations was $1.8 billion.  Capital spending for the quarter was $1 billion excluding the $1.5 billion contribution to DCP Midstream.  Dividends and share repurchases in the fourth quarter totaled $704 million. And excluding special items, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 31%. 
Slide 5 compares fourth quarter and third quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were down $937 million. All segments had lower earnings, but Refining accounted for most of the reduction.
Next, we'll cover each of the segments. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. Transportation benefited from higher equity earnings and volumes. In , Sweeny Fractionator One came online during December. Included in the transportation and NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter, PSXP contributed earnings of $37 million to the Midstream segment and increased its quarterly LP distribution by 7% over the third quarter.  DCP Midstream continues to work on its self-help initiatives to reduce costs, manage its portfolio and restructure contracts.
2015 adjusted return on capital employed to the Midstream segment was 5% based on an average capital employed of $6.8 billion. The return for this segment continues to reflect the impact of increased capital employed, driven by our significant growth investments as well as the impact of lower commodity prices on DCP earnings.
Moving to Slide 7. Midstream's fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $42 million, down $49 million from the third quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter was $78 million, up $1 million from the prior quarter. NGL adjusted losses were $2 million for the quarter. The $34 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by the timing of adjustments related to the tax extenders bill signed in December as well as additional costs associated with the Sweeny hub. Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were higher in the fourth quarter due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids marketing margins as well as the impact of lower commodity prices.
In Chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 92% and margins trended lower. SA&S was negatively impacted by planned turnaround activity.  The 2015 adjusted return of capital employed for our Chemical segment was 19% based on an average capital employed of $4.9 billion. 
As shown on Slide 9, fourth quarter adjusted earnings for Chemicals were $182 million, down from $272 million in the third quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $80 million was largely due to lower cash margins. However, demand for polyethylene and normal olefins product remained healthy during the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings for SA&S declined to $9 million on lower equity earnings, driven by lower volumes due to turnaround activities at CPChem's equity affiliates and lower margins. This was partially offset by higher volumes in specialty chemicals.
In Refining, realized margins were $9.41 per barrel for the quarter as market crack spreads decreased significantly. Market capture increased from 72% to 74% in the fourth quarter as we saw improvement in clean product differentials and lower losses on secondary products. Refining crude utilization was 94%. clean product yield was 85%, representing a record quarter. 
Pretax turnaround costs were $130 million compared to guidance of approximately $150 million, due primarily to the deferral of some planned maintenance. 2015 adjusted return on capital employed for Refining was 19%. This is based on average capital employed of $13.6 billion. 
Slide 11 shows a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. The Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $376 million, down $676 million from last quarter. The reduction was probably due to lower market cracks in all regions. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings were lower this quarter due to lower gasoline and distillate margins, partially offset by higher volumes as capacity utilization exceeded 100%.  The Gulf Coast region saw lower margins and had lower volumes due to downtime at Lake Charles and Sweeny. In the central corridor, market cracks dropped by more than $8 per barrel, which accounted for approximately 90% of the $251 reduction in adjusted earnings from the first quarter. In addition, Wood River and City also had downtime due to turnaround activity.
In the western region, grass cracks fell nearly $15 per barrel. Volumes and controllable costs were also impacted by a major turnaround of our L.A. refinery that we completed in the third quarter. Santa Maria continued to be impacted by the Plain pipeline outage. 
Next, we'll cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $9.41 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack spread of $12.77 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 74%. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries as it relates to our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 85% clean product yields for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. 
Losses in secondary products were lower this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs narrowed. Feedstock advantage was somewhat higher than the third quarter, but still below average as crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category, mainly includes costs associated with RINS, freight, product differentials and inventory impacts.
Let's move to marketing specialties where we posted a solid quarter thanks to favorable global marketing margins. However, specialties saw reduced earnings on lower lubricants margins. The 2015 adjusted return on capital employed for M&S was 35% on average capital employed of $2.7 billion. 
Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the fourth quarter of $227 million, down $117 million from the third quarter. In marketing in other, the $93 million decrease was largely due to lower volumes in both domestic and international marketing, which decreased from the high margins in the third quarter. This was partially offset by the renewal of biodiesel tax credits. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased to $29 million due to narrowing base oil and finished lubricants margins and lower finished lubricants volumes.
On Slide 15, the Corporate and Other segment had an after-tax net loss of $117 million this quarter, an increase of $5 million from the third quarter. Net interest expense increased by $4 million, primarily due to lower capitalized interest. Corporate overhead and other expenses were in line with the prior quarter.
On Slide 16, we summarized our financial results for the year. 2015 adjusted earnings were $4.2 billion or $7.67 per share. Excluding negative working capital changes of $200 million, cash from operations was $5.9 billion. Capital spending for the year was $4.3 billion excluding the $1.5 billion contribution to DCP Midstream. Total shareholder distributions were $2.7 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio excluding Phillips 66 Partners was 25%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our adjusted net debt-to-capital ratio was 17%. The adjusted return on capital employed for 2015 was 14%.
Moving to Slide 17. 2015 adjusted earnings were higher than 2014 as lower earnings from Midstream and Chemicals were more than offset by improvements from our Refining and Marketing and specialties businesses. We have an 11% increase in adjusted earnings, and adjusted earnings per share increased by $1.05 or 16%.
Slide 18 shows cash flow for 2015. We began the year with a cash balance of $5.2 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $5.9 billion. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by $200 million. In the first quarter, $1.1 billion in debt and approximately $400 million in equity was issued by PSXP. We also retired $800 million in Phillips 66 senior notes.
in 2015, we funded $5.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments. This is -- this included $4.3 billion of capital spend, including $3 billion in Midstream and $1.1 billion in Refining. We also distributed $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the year with 529 million shares outstanding. Excluding the DCP contribution, 61% of our available cash went to reinvestment and 39% to distributions. At the end of 2015, our cash balance was $3.1 billion.
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. 
For 2016, we expect full year turnaround expenses to be between $525 million and $575 million pretax. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $480 million to $500 million. And we expect full year D&A of about $1.2 billion.
In the first quarter Chemicals, we expect the global utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rates to also be in the mid-90s and pretax turnaround expense to be approximately $150 million.  In Corporate and Other court, we expect after-tax costs to be between $120 million and $125 million. And companywide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s.
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

So should we assume that you can't do much of the dropdown, you correspondingly scale down your buyback, or that you're going to increase your balance sheet to maintain the buyback in a certain way?"

You might even call this the dropdown type. And great portfolio of existing EBITDA that can be dropped, we've got these projects lined up in the queue. That imply that with the add to that right and then you kind of look at where it PSXP is trading kind around 3%. So I think investors look at PSXP, they get the growth story. They understand the growth story. I think it's a confidence in our ability to execute that. And so we would say that we think the capital markets are going to be open to us in 2016, and our plan is to be out there in there. And you've got the number about right. We kind of said kind of $2 billion a year that we need to be through the capital markets and the debt markets. They hit this $1.1 billion of EBITDA in 2018 at the MLP. And so we stand by that guidance and we will stay there. We should be at $4 billion to $5 billion mid-cycle of cash. And you kind of add another $1.5 billion to $2 billion coming out of the MLP. So I think we're fine in terms of funding our capital program and in terms of funding or growing distributions through increasing our dividend.

The other thing for me, you got to give the folks a lot of credit. They've done a great job of pulling costs out, restructuring contracts where they can in the portfolio. So if you look at kind of pre-2015 cash breakeven, we need about $0.60 to break even on cash on NGLs. And as we kind of exit 2015, we have moved that down to about $0.40 a gallon breakeven. And then the actions that are being further taken in 2016, we expect that the cash breakeven will be somewhere mid-30s. So I think DCP is going to be fine in this environment that we're in for 2016.

So I think it's about creating more options of the Refining site for ourselves as well as others. And it does also, once you get the Beaumont, creates an opportunity to export should that develop. So I think there's a lot of good options. And I think that project, we look at it is going to be -- continue to be the lowest cost option to get Bakken to the markets that we're talking about serving."

This allowed us to maintain",685,"Thanks, Clayton. Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. 
We had a good year in 2015. Adjusted earnings were $4.2 billion, which was our highest since 2012. We generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations. This allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility while funding our capital program and returning $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We made significant progress on our growth projects in Midstream and Chemicals, and we continued to improve returns in our Refining and Marketing businesses. Despite the difficult environment experienced throughout the energy industry, our diversified asset portfolio has performed well. 
We continue to execute our plan. For us, it all starts with operating excellence. We spent $1.2 billion in sustaining capital in 2015. And from an operating reliability perspective, our businesses ran well. 
2015 was a very safe year for us. We tied our best year ever for recordable injuries. And Refining, Chemicals and Midstream were top performers in injury rates. We also maintained the improvement in our environmental performance demonstrated in previous years. 
We ended 2015 with a solid quarter, especially when considering the current commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings were $710 million or $1.31 per share. Market cracks were down significantly in the fourth quarter from the highs that we saw last summer, but our global Refining business continue to run well with 94% utilization. Marketing earnings were healthy, and this continues to be a high-return business for us. 2015 adjusted return on capital employed was 35% for this segment. In Midstream, we commenced operations of the Sweeny Fractionator One and supporting Clemens Storage Caverns. 
2016 will be another busy year for us with several other Midstream projects scheduled for completion. Our Freeport LNG Export Terminal is now 80% complete. It's on track, on budget with an expected start-up in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Dakota Access and ETCOP pipeline projects also continue to make good progress and remain on schedule for completion by the end of this year.
Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. The fee-based assets within PSXP's portfolio continue to perform well and are not impacted by the current market conditions. PSXP continues on track to achieve its stated growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 90% for the year at PSXP, while distribution growth and coverage were also strong. In addition, PSXP was able to raise $1.5 billion of low-cost capital through the debt and equity capital markets in 2015.
DCP continues to work on reducing costs and converting contracts to fee-based structures to improve its financial strength and flexibility. The equity contributions from the owners in the fourth quarter helped in that regard. We expect that DCP will be self-funded going forward.
In Chemicals, cash margins fell during the fourth quarter; however, they remain strong by historical standards. CPChem's geographically advantaged footprint allows it to remain profitable and able to self-fund its growth projects. Development continues on CPChem's U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project, which will increase CPChem's U.S. ethylene and polyethylene capacity by over 40%. Overall progress on the project is approaching 70% complete with start-up planned in mid-2017. This project remains on time and on budget. 
We had another strong cash flow quarter. We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations. We used $1 billion of that cash flow in capital spending to support Midstream growth and maintaining operating integrity in our Refining system. 
We also continue to return capital to our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 3 years, shareholder distributions have totaled more than $9 billion.
Looking forward to 2016, our focus remains on operating well and executing our $3.9 billion capital budget. We continue to target a 60-40 split between reinvestment and distributions, and we have targeted a dividend increase in 2016 of at least 10%. 
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to take us through the quarter's results."

Reported net income was $650 million, including several special items excluded from adjusted earnings. These special items decreased earnings by $60 million and included $104 million in impairments at DCP and a $33 million lower of cost or market write-down of inventory at our Wood River Borger joint venture, offset by an $88 million gain tied to favorable changes in German tax law. Excluding negative working capital changes of $300 million, cash from operations was $1.8 billion. Capital spending for the quarter was $1 billion excluding the $1.5 billion contribution to DCP Midstream. Dividends and share repurchases in the fourth quarter totaled $704 million. And excluding special items, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 31%. 
Slide 5 compares fourth quarter and third quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were down $937 million. All segments had lower earnings, but Refining accounted for most of the reduction.
Next, we'll cover each of the segments. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. Transportation benefited from higher equity earnings and volumes. In NGLs, Sweeny Fractionator One came online during December. Included in the transportation and NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter, PSXP contributed earnings of $37 million to the Midstream segment and increased its quarterly LP distribution by 7% over the third quarter. DCP Midstream continues to work on its self-help initiatives to reduce costs, manage its portfolio and restructure contracts.
2015 adjusted return on capital employed to the Midstream segment was 5% based on an average capital employed of $6.8 billion. The return for this segment continues to reflect the impact of increased capital employed, driven by our significant growth investments as well as the impact of low commodity prices on DCP earnings.
Moving to Slide 7. Midstream's fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $42 million, down $49 million from the third quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter was $78 million, up $1 million from the prior quarter. NGL adjusted losses were $2 million for the quarter. The $34 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by the timing of adjustments related to the tax extenders bill signed in December as well as additional costs associated with the Sweeny hub. Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were higher in the fourth quarter, mainly due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids marketing margins as well as the impact of lower commodity prices.
In Chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 92% and margins trended lower. SA&S was negatively impacted by planned turnaround activity. The 2015 adjusted return on capital employed for our Chemical segment was 19% based on an average capital employed of $4.9 billion. 
As shown on Slide 9, fourth quarter adjusted earnings for Chemicals were $182 million, down from $272 million in the third quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $80 million was largely due to lower cash margins. However, demand for polyethylene and normal alpha olefin products remained healthy during the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings for SA&S declined to $9 million on lower equity earnings, driven by lower volumes due to turnaround activities at CPChem's equity affiliates and lower margins. This was partially offset by higher volumes in specialty chemicals.
In Refining, realized margins were $9.41 per barrel for the quarter as market crack spreads decreased significantly. Market capture increased from 72% to 74% in the fourth quarter as we saw improvements in clean product differentials and lower losses on secondary products. Refining crude utilization was 94%. Clean product yield was 85%, representing a record quarter. 
Pretax turnaround costs were $130 million compared to guidance of approximately $150 million, due primarily to the deferral of some planned maintenance. 2015 adjusted return on capital employed for Refining was 19%. This is based on average capital employed of $13.6 billion. 
Slide 11 shows a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. The Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $376 million, down $676 million from last quarter. The reduction was probably due to lower market cracks in all regions. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings were lower this quarter due to lower gasoline and distillate margins, partially offset by higher volumes as capacity utilization exceeded 100%. The Gulf Coast region saw lower margins and had lower volumes due to downtime at Lake Charles and Sweeny. In the Central Corridor, market cracks dropped by more than $8 per barrel, which accounted for approximately 90% of the $251 reduction in adjusted earnings from the third quarter. In addition, Wood River and Ponca City also had downtime due to turnaround activity.
In the Western region, grass cracks fell nearly $15 per barrel. Volumes and controllable costs were also impacted by a major turnaround at our L.A. refinery that we completed in the fourth quarter. Santa Maria continued to be impacted by the Plains pipeline outage. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $9.41 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $12.77 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 74%. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries as it relates to our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 85% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. 
Losses due to secondary products were lower this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs narrowed. Feedstock advantage was somewhat higher than the third quarter, but still below average as crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a solid quarter, thanks to favorable global marketing margins. However, Specialties saw reduced earnings on lower lubricants margins. The 2015 adjusted return on capital employed for M&S was 35% on average capital employed of $2.7 billion. 
Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the fourth quarter of $227 million, down $117 million from the third quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $93 million decrease was largely due to lower margins in both domestic and international marketing, which decreased from the notably high margins in the third quarter. This was partially offset by the renewal of biodiesel tax credits. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased to $29 million due to narrowing base oil and finished lubricants margins and lower finished lubricants volumes.
On Slide 15, the Corporate and Other segment had an aftertax net cost of $117 million this quarter, an increase of $5 million from the third quarter. Net interest expense increased by $4 million, primarily due to lower capitalized interest, but corporate overhead and other expenses were in line with the prior quarter.
On Slide 16, we summarized our financial results for the year. 2015 adjusted earnings were $4.2 billion or $7.67 per share. Excluding negative working capital changes of $200 million, cash from operations was $5.9 billion. Capital spending for the year was $4.3 billion excluding the $1.5 billion contribution to DCP Midstream. Total shareholder distributions were $2.7 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio excluding Phillips 66 Partners was 25%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our adjusted net debt-to-capital ratio was 17%. The adjusted return on capital employed for 2015 was 14%.
Moving to Slide 17. 2015 adjusted earnings were higher than 2014 as lower earnings from Midstream and Chemicals were more than offset by improvements from our Refining and Marketing and Specialties businesses. We had an 11% increase in adjusted earnings, and adjusted earnings per share increased by $1.05 or 16%.
Slide 18 shows cash flow for 2015. We began the year with a cash balance of $5.2 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $5.9 billion. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by $200 million. In the first quarter, $1.1 billion in debt and approximately $400 million in equity was issued by PSXP. We also retired $800 million in Phillips 66 senior notes.
During 2015, we funded $5.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments. This is -- this included $4.3 billion of capital spend, including $3 billion in Midstream and $1.1 billion in Refining. We also distributed $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the year with 529 million shares outstanding. Excluding the DCP contribution, 61% of our available cash went to reinvestment and 39% to distributions. At the end of 2015, our cash balance was $3.1 billion.
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. 
For 2016, we expect full year turnaround expenses to be between $525 million and $575 million pretax. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $480 million and $500 million. And we expect full year D&A of about $1.2 billion.
In the first quarter, Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to also be in the mid-90s and pretax turnaround expense to be approximately $150 million. In Corporate and Other, we expect aftertax costs to be between $120 million and $125 million. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s.
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

I don't know whether that you have changed. And also that, I mean, from the CapEx that you spent $3.9 billion in dividend, about $1.3 billion with your cash flow from operations, you don't have much for the buyback.

So let me try to start with the question and I'll -- Certainly, we understand the question, Paul. As we look out there, there's a lot of stress in the space with people that are overlevered and will have difficulty accessing the capital equity markets given their prohibitively high cost of capital. We look at PSXP, strong sponsorship, strong investment-grade rating, you might even call us a drop-down titan, maybe, but a great portfolio of existing EBITDA that can be dropped. We've got these projects lined up in the queue that are in flight that really add to that. And then you kind of look at where PSXP is trading kind around 3%. So I think that investors look at PSXP, they get the growth story. They understand the growth story. I think that's a confidence in our ability to execute that. And so we would say that we think the capital markets are going to be open to us in 2016, and our plan is to be out there in there. And you've got the number about right. We kind of said kind of $2 billion a year that we need to be through the capital markets and the debt markets. They hit this $1.1 billion of EBITDA in 2018 at the MLP. And so we stand by that guidance and we'll stay there. We should generate $4 billion to $5 billion mid-cycle of cash, then you kind of add another $1.5 billion to $2 billion coming out of the MLP. So I think we're fine in terms of funding our capital program and in terms of funding growing distributions through increasing our dividend. And we'll have -- as long as our shares are trading below interesting value, we're going to take shares in."

And then the actions that are being further taken in 2016, we expect that the cash breakeven will be somewhere mid-30s. So I think DCP is going to be fine in this environment that we're in for 2016.

And so our view is volumes are still pretty good this year versus last. Not a lot of growth inherently in that business by the nature of it. But we see nothing fundamental there. And I think we would say next year, to us, probably looks a lot like -- or this year looks a lot like last year in terms of how we look at the lubricants. But it's a business we like, good returns. I think this quarter just had some noise around it. And I would also say that you can imagine customers don't particularly like to buy a lot when they see the price falling. So we don't see a lot of inventories go into the chain, but they don't want to get caught on higher-cost inventory. So there's always some effect when you see that in any quarter which that occurs."

I think it clearly connects the west -- the Texas market with Louisiana. We -- there's still a drive for that. That line is underwritten on the commitment side with TND [ph]. So there's been interest in that on the Refining side to get a new source of supply. And I think that's still a piece of what needs to happen. So I think that just continues to make crude options more available now to the eastern Gulf versus what we've seen just really in the wester Gulf. If you look at DAPL, ETCOP, in the Bakken to Patoka, then Patoka to Beaumont, I think there's a pretty good call on northern tier on the Bakken today. Again, that line is underwritten with TND's [ph], but very good counterparties. And so I think you'll continue to see when that comes in service at the end of this year, early next year, the ability to move those crudes then into the markets that want that and then ultimately down into the Beaumont area as an option as well. And ultimately, for us, we think DAPL, ETCOP as a potential way to supply Bayway via the pipe and then around with the Jones Act tanker in the Bayway to make it very competitive with the real option that exists from the Bakken to Bayway today. So I think it's all about creating more options on the Refining side for ourselves as well as others. And it does, also, once you get to Beaumont, creates the opportunity to export should that develop. So I think just a lot of good options. And I that's -- I think that project, we look at it is going to be -- continue to be the lowest cost option to get Bakken to the markets that we're talking about serving."

This allowed us to maintain",685,"Thanks, Clayton. Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. 
We had a good year in 2015. Adjusted earnings were $4.2 billion, which was our highest since 2012. We generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations. This allowed us to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility while funding our capital program and returning $2.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We made significant progress on our growth projects in Midstream and Chemicals, and we continued to improve returns in our Refining and Marketing businesses. Despite the difficult environment experienced throughout the energy industry, our diversified asset portfolio has performed well. 
We continue to execute our plan. For us, it all starts with operating excellence. We spent $1.2 billion in sustaining capital in 2015. And from an operating reliability perspective, our businesses ran well. 
2015 was a very safe year for us. We tied our best year ever for recordable injuries. And Refining, Chemicals and Midstream were top performers in injury rates. We also maintained the improvement in our environmental performance demonstrated in previous years. 
We ended 2015 with a solid quarter, especially when considering the current commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings were $710 million or $1.31 per share. Market cracks were down significantly in the fourth quarter from the highs that we saw last summer, but our global Refining business continues to run well with 94% utilization. Marketing earnings were healthy, and this continues to be a high-return business for us. 2015 adjusted return on capital employed was 35% for this segment. In Midstream, we commenced operations of the Sweeny Fractionator One and supporting Clemens Storage Caverns. 
2016 will be another busy year for us with several other Midstream projects scheduled for completion. Our Freeport LPG Export Terminal is now 80% complete. It's on track, on budget with an expected start-up in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Dakota Access and ETCOP pipeline projects also continue to make good progress and remain on schedule for completion by the end of this year.
Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. The fee-based assets within PSXP's portfolio continue to perform well and are not impacted by the current market conditions. PSXP continues on track to achieve its stated growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
Adjusted EBITDA was up nearly 90% for the year at PSXP, while distribution growth and coverage were also strong. In addition, PSXP was able to raise $1.5 billion of low-cost capital through the debt and equity capital markets in 2015.
DCP continues to work on reducing costs and converting contracts to fee-based structures to improve its financial strength and flexibility. The equity contributions from the owners in the fourth quarter helped in that regard. We expect that DCP will be self-funded going forward.
In Chemicals, cash margins fell during the fourth quarter; however, they remain strong by historical standards. CPChem's geographically advantaged footprint allows it to remain profitable and able to self-fund its growth projects. Development continues on CPChem's U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project, which will increase CPChem's U.S. ethylene and polyethylene capacity by over 40%. Overall progress on the project is approaching 70% complete with start-up planned in mid-2017. This project remains on time and on budget. 
We had another strong cash flow quarter. We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations. We used $1 billion of that cash flow in capital spending to support Midstream growth and maintaining operating integrity in our Refining system. 
We also continue to return capital to our shareholders. During the fourth quarter, we returned over $700 million through dividends and share repurchases. Over the last 3 years, shareholder distributions have totaled more than $9 billion.
Looking forward to 2016, our focus remains on operating well and executing our $3.9 billion capital budget. We continue to target a 60-40 split between reinvestment and distributions, and we have targeted a dividend increase in 2016 of at least 10%. 
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to take us through the quarter's results."

These special items decreased earnings by $60 million and included $104 million in impairments at DCP and a $33 million lower of cost or market write-down of inventory at our Wood River Borger joint venture, offset by an $88 million gain tied to favorable changes in German tax law. Excluding negative working capital changes of $300 million, cash from operations was $1.8 billion. Capital spending for the quarter was $1 billion excluding the $1.5 billion contribution to DCP Midstream. Dividends and share repurchases in the fourth quarter totaled $704 million. And excluding special items, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 31%. 
Slide 5 compares fourth quarter and third quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were down $937 million. All segments had lower earnings, but Refining accounted for most of the reduction.
Next, we'll cover each of the segments. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. Transportation benefited from higher equity earnings and volumes. In NGLs, Sweeny Fractionator One came online during December. Included in the transportation and NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter, PSXP contributed earnings of $37 million to the Midstream segment and increased its quarterly LP distribution by 7% over the third quarter. DCP Midstream continues to work on its self-help initiatives to reduce costs, manage its portfolio and restructure contracts.
2015 adjusted return on capital employed to the Midstream segment was 5% based on an average capital employed of $6.8 billion. The return for this segment continues to reflect the impact of increased capital employed, driven by our significant growth investments as well as the impact of low commodity prices on DCP earnings.
Moving to Slide 7. Midstream's fourth quarter adjusted earnings were $42 million, down $49 million from the third quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter was $78 million, up $1 million from the prior quarter. NGL adjusted losses were $2 million for the quarter. The $34 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by the timing of adjustments related to the tax extenders bill signed in December as well as additional costs associated with the Sweeny hub. Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were higher in the fourth quarter, mainly due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids marketing margins as well as the impact of lower commodity prices.
In Chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 92% and margins trended lower. SA&S was negatively impacted by planned turnaround activity. The 2015 adjusted return on capital employed for our Chemical segment was 19% based on an average capital employed of $4.9 billion. 
As shown on Slide 9, fourth quarter adjusted earnings for Chemicals were $182 million, down from $272 million in the third quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $80 million was largely due to lower cash margins. However, demand for polyethylene and normal alpha olefin products remained healthy during the quarter. 
Adjusted earnings for SA&S declined to $9 million on lower equity earnings, driven by lower volumes due to turnaround activities at CPChem's equity affiliates and lower margins. This was partially offset by higher volumes in specialty chemicals.
In Refining, realized margins were $9.41 per barrel for the quarter as market crack spreads decreased significantly. Market capture increased from 72% to 74% in the fourth quarter as we saw improvements in clean product differentials and lower losses on secondary products. Refining crude utilization was 94%. Clean product yield was 85%, representing a record quarter. 
Pretax turnaround costs were $130 million compared to guidance of approximately $150 million, due primarily to the deferral of some planned maintenance. 2015 adjusted return on capital employed for Refining was 19%. This is based on average capital employed of $13.6 billion. 
Slide 11 shows a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. The Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $376 million, down $676 million from last quarter. The reduction was primarily due to lower market cracks in all regions. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings were lower this quarter due to lower gasoline and distillate margins, partially offset by higher volumes as capacity utilization exceeded 100%. The Gulf Coast region saw lower margins and had lower volumes due to downtime at Lake Charles and Sweeny. In the Central Corridor, market cracks dropped by more than $8 per barrel, which accounted for approximately 90% of the $251 reduction in adjusted earnings from the third quarter. In addition, Wood River and Ponca City also had downtime due to turnaround activity.
In the Western region, grass cracks fell nearly $15 per barrel. Volumes and controllable costs were also impacted by a major turnaround at our L.A. refinery that we completed in the fourth quarter. Santa Maria continued to be impacted by the Plains pipeline outage. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $9.41 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $12.77 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 74%. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries as it relates to our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 85% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. 
Losses due to secondary products were lower this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs narrowed. Feedstock advantage was somewhat higher than the third quarter, but still below average as crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a solid quarter, thanks to favorable global marketing margins. However, Specialties saw reduced earnings on lower lubricants margins. The 2015 adjusted return on capital employed for M&S was 35% on average capital employed of $2.7 billion. 
Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the fourth quarter of $227 million, down $117 million from the third quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $93 million decrease was largely due to lower margins in both domestic and international marketing, which decreased from the notably high margins in the third quarter. This was partially offset by the renewal of biodiesel tax credits. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased to $29 million due to narrowing base oil and finished lubricants margins and lower finished lubricants volumes.
On Slide 15, the Corporate and Other segment had an aftertax net cost of $117 million this quarter, an increase of $5 million from the third quarter. Net interest expense increased by $4 million, primarily due to lower capitalized interest, but corporate overhead and other expenses were in line with the prior quarter.
On Slide 16, we summarized our financial results for the year. 2015 adjusted earnings were $4.2 billion or $7.67 per share. Excluding negative working capital changes of $200 million, cash from operations was $5.9 billion. Capital spending for the year was $4.3 billion excluding the $1.5 billion contribution to DCP Midstream. Total shareholder distributions were $2.7 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio excluding Phillips 66 Partners was 25%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our adjusted net debt-to-capital ratio was 17%. The adjusted return on capital employed for 2015 was 14%.
Moving to Slide 17. 2015 adjusted earnings were higher than 2014 as lower earnings from Midstream and Chemicals were more than offset by improvements from our Refining and Marketing and Specialties businesses. We had an 11% increase in adjusted earnings, and adjusted earnings per share increased by $1.05 or 16%.
Slide 18 shows cash flow for 2015. We began the year with a cash balance of $5.2 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $5.9 billion. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by $200 million. In the first quarter, $1.1 billion in debt and approximately $400 million in equity was issued by PSXP. We also retired $800 million in Phillips 66 senior notes.
During 2015, we funded $5.8 billion of capital expenditures and investments. This is -- this included $4.3 billion of capital spend, including $3 billion in Midstream and $1.1 billion in Refining. We also distributed $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the year with 529 million shares outstanding. Excluding the DCP contribution, 61% of our available cash went to reinvestment and 39% to distributions. At the end of 2015, our cash balance was $3.1 billion.
This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. 
For 2016, we expect full year turnaround expenses to be between $525 million and $575 million pretax. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $480 million and $500 million. And we expect full year D&A of about $1.2 billion.
In the first quarter, Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to also be in the mid-90s and pretax turnaround expense to be approximately $150 million. In Corporate and Other, we expect aftertax costs to be between $120 million and $125 million. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s.
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

I don't know whether that you have changed. And also that, I mean, from the CapEx that you spent $3.9 billion in dividend, about $1.3 billion with your cash flow from operations, you don't have much for the buyback. So should we assume that if you can't do much of the drop-down, you will correspondingly scale down your buyback, or that you're going to increase your balance sheet to maintain the buyback at a certain rate?"

So let me try to start with the question and I'll -- certainly, we understand the question, Paul. As we look out there, there's a lot of stress in the space with people that are overlevered and will have difficulty accessing the capital equity markets given their prohibitively high cost of capital. We look at PSXP, strong sponsorship, strong investment-grade rating, you might even call us a drop-down titan, maybe, but a great portfolio of existing EBITDA that can be dropped. We've got these projects lined up in the queue that are in flight that really add to that. And then you kind of look at where PSXP is trading kind around 3%. So I think that investors look at PSXP, they get the growth story. They understand the growth story. I think that's a confidence in our ability to execute that. And so we would say that we think the capital markets are going to be open to us in 2016, and our plan is to be out there in there. And you've got the number about right. We kind of said kind of $2 billion a year that we need to be through the capital markets and the debt markets to hit this $1.1 billion of EBITDA in 2018 at the MLP. And so we stand by that guidance and we'll stay there. We should generate $4 billion to $5 billion mid-cycle of cash, then you kind of add another $1.5 billion to $2 billion coming out of the MLP. So I think we're fine in terms of funding our capital program and in terms of funding growing distributions through increasing our dividend. And we'll have -- as long as our shares are trading below intrinsic value, we're going to take shares in."

So the other thing, you've got to give the folks at DCP a lot of credit. They've done a great job of pulling costs out, restructuring contracts where they can in the portfolio. And so if you look kind of pre-2015 cash breakeven, we need about $0.60 to break even on cash on NGLs. And as kind of we exit 2015, we had moved that down to about $0.40 a gallon breakeven. And then the actions that are being further taken in 2016, we expect that the cash breakeven will be somewhere mid-30s. So I think DCP is going to be fine in this environment that we're in for 2016.

So I think we're kind of in flux about what the arb will ultimately be, but we still look at the market here and know that the NGLs need to find another home outside the U.S. So -- and I think there's still fundamental drivers that will push that. And the real question is, how much of the arb? Do we have $100 million of EBITDA from the arb or something different?

And then update us on how you're getting on with the exports, which I think you've partly done, but it would just be interesting if you could give it from a more macro perspective."

Paul, the -- on the NGL site, we continue to see growth in NGL supply, but there is no question that it's going to be at a slower pace as we look out. The other interesting thing is that there's a lot of ethane rejection today as the values don't pull it forward. So I think as the crackers start up, there's going to be an influx of ethane, so to speak, into the NGL piece. But I think that certainly causes us some pause when we think about how large and how much increase beyond today we see in the NGL still see it, but probably not to the extent that we had not seen a couple of years ago with all the E&P activity. On the exports side, a lot of interest still in LPG cargoes for both petrochemical operations and heating markets: Asia, Latin America and even Europe. So I think we're still seeing a lot of interest around the world as people look at alternate supplies, so to speak, on both the fuels and petrochemicals side. So as Greg mentioned earlier, a lot of good progress on the contract sides and just a lot of interest there that we're working to continue to look."

And I think we would say next year, to us, probably looks a lot like -- or this year looks a lot like last year in terms of how we look at the lubricants. But it's a business we like, good returns.

I think it clearly connects the west -- the Texas market with Louisiana. We -- there's still a drive for that. That line is underwritten on the commitment side with T&D [ph]. So there's been interest in that on the Refining side to get a new source of supply. And I think that's still a piece of what needs to happen. So I think that just continues to make crude options more available now to the eastern Gulf versus what we've seen just really in the western Gulf. If you look at DAPL, ETCOP, in the Bakken to Patoka, then Patoka to Beaumont, I think there's a pretty good call on northern tier on the Bakken today. Again, that line is underwritten with T&D's [ph], but very good counterparties. And so I think you'll continue to see when that comes in service at the end of this year, early next year, the ability to move those crudes then into the markets that want that and then ultimately down into the Beaumont area as an option as well. And ultimately, for us, we think DAPL, ETCOP as a potential way to supply Bayway via the pipe and then around with the Jones Act tanker in the Bayway to make it very competitive with the rail option that exists from the Bakken to Bayway today. So I think it's all about creating more options on the Refining side for ourselves as well as others. And it does, also, once you get to Beaumont, creates the opportunity to export should that develop. So I think just a lot of good options.

We had a good operating quarter running well across all of our businesses. However, weaker margins has significant impact on our earnings this quarter. In Refining, distillate crack spreads",706,"Thanks, Rosy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 
We had a good operating quarter running well across all of our businesses. However, weaker margins has significant impact on our earnings this quarter. In Refining, distillate crack spreads were the lowest since 2010. In Chemicals, benchmark industry olefin chain margins were down from last quarter, and Midstream was impacted by lower NGL prices. We experienced solid results from our Marketing and Specialties business.
Total adjusted earnings were $360 million. And excluding working capital changes, we generated $722 million in cash from operations. We remain focused on operating excellence, notably in our growth projects in Midstream and Chemicals we see great value in opportunity long term. We're maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and believe that our strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage that positions as well to execute our plan to the commodity price cycles.
During the quarter, we reinvested $750 million back into the business and distributed $687 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Since May of 2012, we returned $11.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and our repurchase or exchange of 115 million shares. We continue to target a 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to our shareholders, and we've targeted another dividend increase this year of at least 10%.
We've made good progress in our major growth projects. In Midstream, we received all the permits necessary for the Dakota Access Pipeline to start laying pipe in May and we would expect and on schedule completion by year-end. In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is going well. The terminal currently has 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity. We have 3.2 million barrels of new capacity under construction. Longer term, this facility can expand to 16 million barrels of storage capacity. 
Also, development of first phase of Sweeny hub is nearing completion. LPG export terminal is 80% complete, is on time and on budget. The completion of the terminal represents a major step in the development of their world-class energy complex within a Refining, chemical in Midstream assets. 
PSXP remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. The fee-based assets within its portfolio continue to perform well. PSXP increased its limited partner distribution by 5% this quarter and remains on track to achieve a steady growth objective of a 5-year, 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is reducing its cash breakeven through self-help initiatives and expect to achieve breakeven and NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. They're reducing costs, cutting capital substantially and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength and flexibility. 
In addition, the equity contributions from the owners last year strengthened the balance sheet, increased fee-based earnings and position DCP for success in the future. We expect the DCP will be self-funded going forward.
In Chemicals, demand for consumer products remain strong. In response, CPChem's continues to run at high rates across its system. Because CPChem's primary production centers are in North America and in the Middle East, underpinned by Vantage feedstock, we believe CPChem's asset base provides us with a competitive advantage. CPChem's continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is 75% complete with expected start-up in mid-2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. 
In Refining, we see good gasoline supply and demand fundamentals for the remainder the year, we expect strong demand as we head some of the summer driving season. Our focus in Refining is operating excellence, maintaining our cost and capital discipline, increasing returns to selective investment. We projects that are quick payoff, low cost and high returns. During the quarter, we advanced several of these Refining projects. At the Wood River refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At Bayway, work on the SEC modernization is on schedule. At the Billings refinery, effort is underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. Each of these project has a projected return on investment of about 30%.
So that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Having be"

Good morning. Starting on Slide 4, first quarter adjusted earnings were $360 million or $0.67 per share. Reported net income was $385 million. Excluding working capital, cash from operations was $722 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $750 million, with approximately $450 million spend in Midstream primarily at our growth projects. Distributions to shareholders in the first quarter totaled $687 million, including $296 million and dividends and $391 million in share repurchases. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 23%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 5%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is 33%.
Slide 5 compares first quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were down $350 million, primarily driven by lower results in Refining. 
Next, we will cover each of the segments individually.  I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. Transportation continues to generate stable earnings. The NGL business progressed construction on the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. Fractionator utilization was reduced due to turnarounds and the impact of ethane rejection on feedstock composition. Included in the transportation and energy results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter PSXP contributed earnings of $32 million to the Midstream segment. Distributions to Phillips 66 from our LP and GP interests increased 7% over the fourth quarter. DCP Midstream -- continues to work on its self-help initiatives to reduce costs, manage its portfolio and restructure contracts.
On Slide 7, Midstream's first quarter adjusted earnings were $40 million, down $2 million from the fourth quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $72 million, down $6 million from the prior quarter, driven by lower equity earnings from Express pipeline and Explorer pipeline. NGL adjusted losses were $11 million for the first quarter. The $9 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by seasonal storage activity, partially offset by lower tax expense. Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to improved reliability and contract restructuring efforts, partially offset by the impact of lower commodity prices.
In Chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 93%, and margins were lower. SA&S improve higher volumes it equity affiliates. 
As shown on Slide 9, first quarter adjusted earnings for Chemicals were $156 million, down from $182 million in the fourth quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $36 million was largely due to lower margins, driven by reduced polyethylene sales prices. This was partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes and lower controllable costs. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $7 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales volumes due to fourth quarter turnaround activities at CPChem's equity affiliates.
In Refining, realized margins were $7.11 per barrel for the quarter as market crack spreads decreased significantly from the prior quarter. Gasoline market cracks were down 14% from the fourth quarter, due in part of the impact of higher-than-normal industry gasoline production in the fourth quarter as well as the impact of butane blending and seasonally lower demand. Distillate market cracks were at a 6-year low. Market capture decreased from 74% in the fourth quarter to 67% in the first quarter. Clean product yield fell to 82%, with gasoline yield at 43%. yields reflect the impact of turnaround activity as well as accelerated maintenance the secondary units due to the low-margin environment. Pretax turnaround costs were $115 million, $35 million lower than guidance due to the deferral of some catalyst change activity.
Slide 11 shows a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. The Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $86 million, down $290 million from last quarter. The reduction was largely due to the lower market cracks. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings decreased to this quarter primarily due to lower volumes and inventory impacts. The Gulf Coast region saw lower margins and reduced volumes due to planned maintenance and unplanned downtime. 
In the Gulf Coast region as well as the Central Corridor, we had unplanned downtime as we undertook discretionary maintenance our low-margin environment. In the Central Corridor, lower margins accounted for the majority of the reduction in adjusted earnings from the fourth quarter as market cracks were 24% lower. 
On the West Coast, market cracks were 26% lower. Reduced margins were mostly offset by improvements in controllable costs and inventory impacts. Santa Maria continued to be affected by the Plains pipeline outage. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.11 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $10.64 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 67%. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries as it relates to our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 82% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses due to secondary products decreased this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as Coke and NGLs narrowed. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher than the fourth quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with gross margins, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a good quarter, thanks to healthy U.S. margins and volumes. Specialty saw higher earnings on improved margins.  Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the first quarter of $205 million, down $22 million from the fourth quarter. in Marketing and Other, the $36 million decrease was largely due to lower biodiesel tax credits and lower margins in International Marketing. This was partially offset by higher U.S. marketing margins. Specialties adjusted earnings increased to $43 million primarily due to improved base oil margins.
On Slide 15, the Corporate and Other expense had after-tax net costs of $127 million this quarter, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter. Net interest expense increased by $7 million primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with the start up of Sweeny Fractionator One, while corporate overhead and other expenses increased by $3 million due to the timing of legal and environmental charges.
Slide 16 shows cash flow for the quarter. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $722 million. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by $464 million. The cash benefit from a U.S. tax refund received in the quarter was more than offset by the customary first quarter inventory build and the timing marketing receipts and crude cargo payments. We funded $750 million of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed nearly $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 526 million shares . At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $1.7 billion.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the second quarter in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the low 90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be approximately $100 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $120 million and $125 million. And companywide we expect we effective income tax we to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

We're seeing margines up a couple of cents, and we think margins will continue to improve in the petchem chain. We meeting that '16 is to kind of a $4 billion to $5 billion type cash generation from operations. Second thing I would say our view is that for high-quality MLPs, we think that equity markets are open and that we would expect between some combination of debt and equity, we'd raise between $1 billion and $2 billion back into PSX this year. So this kind of moves you to about $5 billion to $7 billion of cash if you want to think about it that way. We can afford a $3.9 billion capital program, $1.2 billion in dividend and $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases given that. I will say just though, we're looking at the things going on.

But the export netback really becomes the upper limit of what we set for the cracking value. Ethane, in our view, giving, coming of rejection and what we see on the start-up of the projects, should still remain at a competitive disadvantage for the long term. And so I think it really is that interplay somewhere between gas value and propane, butane parity and cracking that determines that. But we would expect when new crackers start up, that ethane prices will come up somewhat and pull some of that ethane back out of the gas range.  -- the bottom line is we're still bullish on the operating rate side on Chemicals as well as the competitive advantage that you get from ethane and LPG cracking."

We had a good operating quarter running well across all of our businesses. However, weaker margin has a significant impact on our earnings this quarter. In Refining, distillate crack spreads",715,"Thanks, Rosy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We had a good operating quarter running well across all of our businesses. However, weaker margin has a significant impact on our earnings this quarter. In Refining, distillate crack spreads were the lowest since 2010. In Chemicals, benchmark industry olefin chain margins were down from last quarter, and Midstream was impacted by lower NGL prices. We experienced solid results from our Marketing and Specialties business.
Total adjusted earnings were $360 million. And excluding working capital changes, we generated $722 million in cash from operations. We remain focused on operating excellence and completing our growth projects in Midstream and Chemicals where we see great value in opportunity long term. We're maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and believe that our strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage that positions as well to execute our plans to the commodity price cycles.
During the quarter, we reinvested $750 million back into the business, and we distributed $687 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Since May of 2012, we returned $11.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and our repurchase or exchange of 115 million shares. We continue to target a 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to our shareholders, and we've targeted another dividend increase this year of at least 10%.
We've made good progress on our major growth projects. In Midstream, we received all the permits necessary for the Dakota Access Pipeline to start laying pipe in May, and we would expect and on-schedule completion by year-end. In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is going well. The terminal currently has 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity. We have 3.2 million barrels of new capacity under construction. Longer term, this facility can expand to 16 million barrels of storage capacity. 
Also, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. The LPG export terminal is 80% complete, is on time and on budget. The completion of the terminal will represent a major step in the development of a world-class energy complex with integrated Refining, Chemical and Midstream assets. 
PSXP remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. The fee-based assets within its portfolio continue to perform well. PSXP increased its limited partner distributions by 5% this quarter and remains on track to achieve a steady growth objective of a 5-year, 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is reducing its cash breakeven through self-help initiatives and expects to achieve breakeven and NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. They're reducing costs, cutting capital substantially and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength and flexibility. 
In addition, the equity contributions from the owners last year strengthened the balance sheet, increased fee-based earnings and positioned DCP for success in the future. We expect the DCP will be self-funded going forward.
In Chemicals, demand for consumer products remain strong. In response, CPChem continues to run at high rates across its system. Because CPChem's primary production centers are in North America and in the Middle East, underpinned by advantaged feedstocks, we believe CPChem's asset base provides us with a competitive advantage. CPChem continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is now 75% complete, with expected start-up in mid-2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. 
In Refining, we see good gasoline supply and demand fundamentals for the remainder the year, and we expect strong demand as we head into the summer driving season. Our focus in Refining is operating excellence, maintaining our cost and capital discipline, increasing returns to selective investment. We invested in projects that are quick payoff, low cost and high return. During the quarter, we advanced several of these Refining projects. At the Wood River refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is on schedule. At the Billings refinery, effort is underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. Each of these projects has a projected return on investment of about 30%.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?"

Excluding working capital, cash from operations was $722 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $750 million, with approximately $450 million spent in Midstream, primarily on our growth projects. Distributions to shareholders in the first quarter totaled $687 million, including $296 million in dividends and $391 million in share repurchases. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 23%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 5%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is 33%.
Slide 5 compares first quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were down $350 million, primarily driven by lower results in Refining. Next, we will cover each of the segments individually.  
I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. Transportation continues to generate stable earnings. The NGL business progressed construction on the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. Fractionator utilization was reduced due to turnarounds and the impact of ethane rejection on feedstock composition. Included in the transportation and NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter PSXP contributed earnings of $32 million to the Midstream segment. Distributions to Phillips 66 from our LP and GP interests increased 7% over the fourth quarter. DCP Midstream continues to work on its self-help initiatives to reduce costs, manage its portfolio and restructure contracts.
On Slide 7, Midstream's first quarter adjusted earnings were $40 million, down $2 million from the fourth quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $72 million, down $6 million from the prior quarter, driven by lower equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline and Explorer pipeline. NGL adjusted losses were $11 million for the first quarter. A $9 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by seasonal storage activity, partially offset by lower tax expense. Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to improved reliability and contract restructuring efforts, partially offset by the impact of lower commodity prices.
In Chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 93%, and margins were lower. SA&S had improved equity earnings due to higher volumes at equity affiliates. 
As shown on Slide 9, first quarter adjusted earnings for Chemicals were $156 million, down from $182 million in the fourth quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $36 million was largely due to lower margins, driven by reduced polyethylene sales prices. This was partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes and lower controllable costs. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $7 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales volumes due to fourth quarter turnaround activities at CPChem's equity affiliates.
In Refining, realized margins were $7.11 per barrel for the quarter as market crack spreads decreased significantly from the prior quarter. Gasoline market cracks were down 14% from the fourth quarter due in part to the impact of higher-than-normal industry gasoline production in the fourth quarter as well as the impacts of butane blending and seasonally lower demand. Distillate market cracks were at a 6-year low. Market capture decreased from 74% in the fourth quarter to 67% in the first quarter. Clean product yield fell to 82%, with gasoline yield at 43%. These yields reflect the impact of turnaround activity as well as accelerated maintenance on secondary units due to the low-margin environment. Pretax turnaround costs were $115 million, $35 million lower than guidance due to the deferral of some catalyst change out activity.
Slide 11 shows a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. The Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $86 million, down $290 million from last quarter. The reduction was largely due to lower market cracks. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings decreased this quarter, primarily due to lower volumes and inventory impacts. The Gulf Coast region saw lower margins and reduced volumes due to planned maintenance and unplanned downtime. In the Gulf Coast region as well as the Central Corridor, we had unplanned downtime as we undertook discretionary maintenance in a low-margin environment. In the Central Corridor, lower margins accounted for the majority of the reduction in adjusted earnings from the fourth quarter as market cracks were 24% lower. On the West Coast, market cracks were 26% lower. Reduced margins were mostly offset by improvements in controllable costs and inventory impacts. Santa Maria continued to be affected by the Plains pipeline outage. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.11 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $10.64 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 67%. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries as it relates to our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 82% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses due to secondary products decreased this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs narrowed. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher than the fourth quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a good quarter, thanks to healthy U.S. margins and volumes. Specialties saw higher earnings on improved margins.  
Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the first quarter of $205 million, down $22 million from the fourth quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $36 million decrease was largely due to lower biodiesel tax credits and lower margins in international Marketing. This was partially offset by higher U.S. marketing margins. Specialties adjusted earnings increased to $43 million, primarily due to improved base oil margins.
On Slide 15, the Corporate and Other expense had aftertax net costs of $127 million this quarter, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter. Net interest expense increased by $7 million, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with the start-up of Sweeny Fractionator One, while corporate overhead and other expenses increased by $3 million due to the timing of legal and environmental charges.
Slide 16 shows cash flow for the quarter. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $722 million. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by $464 million. The cash benefit of a U.S. tax refund received in the quarter was more than offset by the customary first quarter inventory build and the timing of marketing receipts and crude cargo payments. We funded $750 million of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed nearly $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 526 million shares  outstanding. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $1.7 billion.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. 
Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the second quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the low 90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be approximately $100 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $120 million and $125 million. And companywide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

The first bucket is really, I don't think the first quarter is reflective of our view of what 2016 is going to be. You've seen cracks have gone from $10 to $15. We've seen NGLs move from $0.37 to $0.47, $0.48. We're seeing good demand for transportation fuels, gasoline. We're seeing good demand for petrochemicals. We're seeing margins up a couple of cents, and we think margins will continue to improve in the petchem chain. So we think that '16 is to kind of a $4 billion to $5 billion-type cash generation year from us from operations. Second, I would say our view is that for high-quality MLPs, we think that the equity markets are open, and that we would expect between some combination of debt and equity, we'd raise between $1 billion and $2 billion back into PSX this year. So this kind of moves you to $5 billion to $7 billion of cash if you want to think about it that way. We can afford a $3.9 billion capital program, $1.2 billion dividend and $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases given that. I will say just though, we're looking at things going on. And we're going through every line item in the capital budget, both for '16 and '17. And we're assuring that our premises that we started with are still valid and that these projects are going to generate returns that are acceptable and meet our requirements.

And then the ethane could reach that perhaps in terms of cracking parity, but the balance really comes about which of those feedstocks you select. But the export netback really becomes the upper limit of what we set for the cracking value. Ethane, in our view, giving -- coming out of rejection and what we see on the start-up of the projects, should still remain at competitive disadvantage for the long term. And so I think it really is that interplay somewhere between gas value and propane, butane parity and the cracking that determines that. But we would expect, when the new crackers start up, that ethane prices will come up somewhat to pull some of that ethane back out of the gas stream.  But we're still -- the bottom line is we're still bullish on the operating rate side on Chemicals as well as the competitive advantage that you get from ethane and LPG cracking."

And that's been a factor in the distillate -- sluggish distillate demand that we're seeing. And we're seeing good consumer demand, weaker industrial. And so I think you've got to take a view that the industrial piece at some point does come back. And I think we're seeing signs of that, perhaps, in Asia, but that's a big piece or the trade piece in the distillate that really drives the industrial side.

But overall, NGL volumes have been up to kind of holding flat. And in fact, we had record propane production, but you've got a refinery input on the propane side as well, which may tie back to gasoline mode.

We had a good operating quarter running well across all of our businesses. However, weaker margins had a significant impact on our earnings this quarter. In Refining, distillate crack spreads",715,"Thanks, Rosy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We had a good operating quarter running well across all of our businesses. However, weaker margins had a significant impact on our earnings this quarter. In Refining, distillate crack spreads were the lowest since 2010. In Chemicals, benchmark industry olefin chain margins were down from last quarter, and Midstream was impacted by lower NGL prices. We experienced solid results from our Marketing and Specialties business.
Total adjusted earnings were $360 million. And excluding working capital changes, we generated $722 million in cash from operations. We remain focused on operating excellence and completing our growth projects in Midstream and Chemicals where we see great value and opportunity long term. We're maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and believe that our strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage that positions us well to execute our plans through the commodity price cycles.
During the quarter, we reinvested $750 million back into the business, and we distributed $687 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Since May of 2012, we've returned $11.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and our repurchase or exchange of 115 million shares. We continue to target a 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to our shareholders, and we've targeted another dividend increase this year of at least 10%.
We've made good progress on our major growth projects. In Midstream, we received all the permits necessary for the Dakota Access Pipeline to start laying pipe in May, and we would expect an on-schedule completion by year-end. In the Gulf Coast the Beaumont Terminal expansion is going well. The terminal currently has 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity. We have 3.2 million barrels of new capacity under construction. Longer term, this facility can expand to 16 million barrels of storage capacity. 
Also, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. The LPG export terminal is 80% complete, is on time and on budget. The completion of the terminal will represent a major step in the development of a world-class energy complex with integrated Refining, Chemical and Midstream assets. 
PSXP remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. The fee-based assets within its portfolio continue to perform well. PSXP increased its limited partner distributions by 5% this quarter and remains on track to achieve a steady growth objective of a 5-year, 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is reducing its cash breakeven through self-help initiatives and expects to achieve breakeven and NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. They're reducing costs, cut capital substantially and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength and flexibility. 
In addition, the equity contributions from the owners last year strengthened the balance sheet, increased fee-based earnings and positioned DCP for success in the future. We expect the DCP will be self-funded going forward.
In Chemicals, demand for consumer products remains strong. In response, CPChem continues to run at high rates across its system. Because CPChem's primary production centers are in North America and in the Middle East, underpinned by advantaged feedstocks, we believe CPChem's asset base provides us with a competitive advantage. CPChem continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is now 75% complete, with expected start-up in mid-2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. 
In Refining, we see good gasoline supply and demand fundamentals for the remainder the year, and we expect strong demand as we head into the summer driving season. Our focus in Refining is operating excellence, maintaining our cost and capital discipline, increasing returns through selective investment. We invest in projects that are quick payout, low cost and high return. During the quarter, we advanced several of these Refining projects. At the Wood River refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is on schedule. At the Billings refinery, effort is underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. Each of these projects has a projected return on investment of about 30%.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?"

Starting on Slide 4, first quarter adjusted earnings were $360 million or $0.67 per share. Reported net income was $385 million. Excluding working capital, cash from operations was $722 million.

Excluding working capital, cash from operations was $722 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $750 million, with approximately $450 million spent in Midstream, primarily on our growth projects. Distributions to shareholders in the first quarter totaled $687 million, including $296 million in dividends and $391 million in share repurchases. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 23%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 5%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is 33%.
Slide 5 compares first quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were down $350 million, primarily driven by lower results in Refining. Next, we will cover each of the segments individually.  
I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. Transportation continues to generate stable earnings. The NGL business progressed construction on the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. Fractionator utilization was reduced due to turnarounds and the impact of ethane rejection on feedstock composition. Included in the transportation and NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter PSXP contributed earnings of $32 million to the Midstream segment. Distributions to Phillips 66 from our LP and GP interests increased 7% over the fourth quarter. DCP Midstream continues to work on its self-help initiatives to reduce costs, manage its portfolio and restructure contracts.
On Slide 7, Midstream's first quarter adjusted earnings were $40 million, down $2 million from the fourth quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $72 million, down $6 million from the prior quarter, driven by lower equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline and Explorer pipeline. NGL adjusted losses were $11 million for the first quarter. A $9 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by seasonal storage activity, partially offset by lower tax expense. Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to improved reliability and contract restructuring efforts, partially offset by the impact of lower commodity prices.
In Chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 93%, and margins were lower. SA&S had improved equity earnings due to higher volumes at equity affiliates. 
As shown on Slide 9, first quarter adjusted earnings for Chemicals were $156 million, down from $182 million in the fourth quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $36 million was largely due to lower margins, driven by reduced polyethylene sales prices. This was partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes and lower controllable costs. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $7 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales volumes due to fourth quarter turnaround activities at CPChem's equity affiliates.
In Refining, realized margins were $7.11 per barrel for the quarter as market crack spreads decreased significantly from the prior quarter. Gasoline market cracks were down 14% from the fourth quarter due in part to the impact of higher-than-normal industry gasoline production in the fourth quarter as well as the impacts of butane blending and seasonally lower demand. Distillate market cracks were at a 6-year low. Market capture decreased from 74% in the fourth quarter to 67% in the first quarter. Clean product yield fell to 82%, with gasoline yield at 43%. These yields reflect the impact of turnaround activity as well as accelerated maintenance on secondary units due to the low-margin environment. Pretax turnaround costs were $115 million, $35 million lower than guidance due to the deferral of some catalyst change-out activity.
Slide 11 shows a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. The Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $86 million, down $290 million from last quarter. The reduction was largely due to lower market cracks. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings decreased this quarter, primarily due to lower volumes and inventory impacts. The Gulf Coast region saw lower margins and reduced volumes due to planned maintenance and unplanned downtime. In the Gulf Coast region as well as the Central Corridor, we had unplanned downtime as we undertook discretionary maintenance in a low-margin environment. In the Central Corridor, lower margins accounted for the majority of the reduction in adjusted earnings from the fourth quarter as market cracks were 24% lower. On the West Coast, market cracks were 26% lower. Reduced margins were mostly offset by improvements in controllable costs and inventory impacts. Santa Maria continued to be affected by the Plains pipeline outage. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.11 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $10.64 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 67%. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries as it relates to our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 82% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses due to secondary products decreased this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs narrowed. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher than the fourth quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a good quarter, thanks to healthy U.S. margins and volumes. Specialties saw higher earnings on improved margins.  
Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the first quarter of $205 million, down $22 million from the fourth quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $36 million decrease was largely due to lower biodiesel tax credits and lower margins in international Marketing. This was partially offset by higher U.S. marketing margins. Specialties adjusted earnings increased to $43 million, primarily due to improved base oil margins.
On Slide 15, the Corporate and Other expense had after-tax net costs of $127 million this quarter, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter. Net interest expense increased by $7 million, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with the start-up of Sweeny Fractionator One, while corporate overhead and other expenses increased by $3 million due to the timing of legal and environmental charges.
Slide 16 shows cash flow for the quarter. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $722 million. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by $464 million. The cash benefit of a U.S. tax refund received in the quarter was more than offset by the customary first quarter inventory build and the timing of marketing receipts and crude cargo payments. We funded $750 million of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed nearly $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 526 million shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $1.7 billion.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. 
Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the second quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the low 90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be approximately $100 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $120 million and $125 million. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

The first bucket is really, I don't think the first quarter is reflective of our view of what 2016 is going to be. You've seen cracks have gone from $10 to $15. We've seen NGLs move from $0.37 to $0.47, $0.48. We're seeing good demand for transportation fuels, gasoline. We're seeing good demand for petrochemicals. We're seeing margins up a couple of cents, and we think margins will continue to improve in the petchem chain. So we think that '16 is still kind of a $4 billion to $5 billion-type cash generation year from us from operations. Second, I would say our view is that for high-quality MLPs, we think that the equity markets are open, and that we would expect between some combination of debt and equity, we'd raise between $1 billion and $2 billion back into PSX this year. So this kind of moves you to $5 billion to $7 billion of cash if you want to think about it that way. We can afford a $3.9 billion capital program, $1.2 billion dividend and $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases given that. I will say just though, we're looking at things going on. And we're going through every line item in the capital budget both for '16 and '17. And we're assuring that our premises that we started with are still valid and that these projects are going to generate returns that are acceptable and meet our requirements. And so we'll be looking at that going forward into this year."

And then the ethane could reach that perhaps in terms of cracking parity, but the balance really comes about which of those feedstocks you select. But the export netback really becomes the upper limit of what we set for the cracking value. Ethane, in our view, giving -- coming out of rejection and what we see on the start-up of the projects, should still remain at a competitive disadvantage for the long term. And so I think it really is that interplay somewhere between gas value and propane, butane parity and the cracking that determines that. But we would expect when the new crackers start up that ethane prices will come up somewhat to pull some of that ethane back out of the gas stream.

Beyond that, it's a longer-term investment, and we'd have to see a longer-term signal. But I think I look at distillate and also say that if the economy, industrially, across the world picks up, you will see more distillate demand. And that's been a factor in the distillate -- sluggish distillate demand that we're seeing. And we're seeing good consumer demand, weaker industrial. And so I think you've got to take a view that the industrial piece at some point does come back. And I think we're seeing signs of that, perhaps, in Asia, but that's a big piece of the trade piece in the distillate that really drives the industrial side. So I think we look at this and say, it's not clear that you've got a permanent separation. We've got to think about that from an investment standpoint."

You would expect with drilling activity, you would eventually expect to see that to break over a bit. But we're still seeing good NGL volumes coming in into the Gulf Coast. The Permian, in particular, looks really good. And I think that ties back to what you see on the crude side. The Eagle Ford being -- we're seeing decline rates both on NGL and crude. But overall, NGL volumes have been up to kind of holding flat. And in fact, we had record propane production, but you've got a refinery input on the propane side as well, which may tie back to gasoline mode. So I'd say, on the NGL side we've seen it hold, and as crude oil prices recover and drilling resumes and if you believe that North America is going to have that incremental call, we're still bullish that the NGL supply is going to continue to increase."

But with the capital expenditures budgets where they are on the upstream, it's hard to see that you're going to see a lot of extra volume over the next 12 months until that program ramps back up.

We had a good operating quarter running well across all of our businesses. However, weaker margins had a significant impact on our earnings this quarter. In Refining, distillate crack spreads",715,"Thanks, Rosy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We had a good operating quarter running well across all of our businesses. However, weaker margins had a significant impact on our earnings this quarter. In Refining, distillate crack spreads were the lowest since 2010. In Chemicals, benchmark industry olefin chain margins were down from last quarter, and Midstream was impacted by lower NGL prices. We experienced solid results from our Marketing and Specialties business.
Total adjusted earnings were $360 million. And excluding working capital changes, we generated $722 million in cash from operations. We remain focused on operating excellence and completing our growth projects in Midstream and Chemicals where we see great value and opportunity long term. We're maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation and believe that our strong balance sheet is a competitive advantage that positions us well to execute our plans through the commodity price cycles.
During the quarter, we reinvested $750 million back into the business, and we distributed $687 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Since May of 2012, we've returned $11.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and our repurchase or exchange of 115 million shares. We continue to target a 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to our shareholders, and we've targeted another dividend increase this year of at least 10%.
We've made good progress on our major growth projects. In Midstream, we received all the permits necessary for the Dakota Access Pipeline to start laying pipe in May, and we would expect an on-schedule completion by year-end. In the Gulf Coast the Beaumont Terminal expansion is going well. The terminal currently has 7.1 million barrels of storage capacity. We have 3.2 million barrels of new capacity under construction. Longer term, this facility can expand to 16 million barrels of storage capacity. 
Also, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. The LPG export terminal is 80% complete, is on time and on budget. The completion of the terminal will represent a major step in the development of a world-class energy complex with integrated Refining, Chemical and Midstream assets. 
PSXP remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. The fee-based assets within its portfolio continue to perform well. PSXP increased its limited partner distributions by 5% this quarter and remains on track to achieve a steady growth objective of a 5-year, 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is reducing its cash breakeven through self-help initiatives and expects to achieve breakeven and NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. They're reducing costs, cut capital substantially and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength and flexibility. 
In addition, the equity contributions from the owners last year strengthened the balance sheet, increased fee-based earnings and positioned DCP for success in the future. We expect the DCP will be self-funded going forward.
In Chemicals, demand for consumer products remains strong. In response, CPChem continues to run at high rates across its system. Because CPChem's primary production centers are in North America and in the Middle East, underpinned by advantaged feedstocks, we believe CPChem's asset base provides us with a competitive advantage. CPChem continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is now 75% complete, with expected start-up in mid-2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. 
In Refining, we see good gasoline supply and demand fundamentals for the remainder the year, and we expect strong demand as we head into the summer driving season. Our focus in Refining is operating excellence, maintaining our cost and capital discipline, increasing returns through selective investment. We invest in projects that are quick payout, low cost and high return. During the quarter, we advanced several of these Refining projects. At the Wood River refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is on schedule. At the Billings refinery, effort is underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. Each of these projects has a projected return on investment of about 30%.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?"

Excluding working capital, cash from operations was $722 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $750 million, with approximately $450 million spent in Midstream, primarily on our growth projects. Distributions to shareholders in the first quarter totaled $687 million, including $296 million in dividends and $391 million in share repurchases. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 23%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 5%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate is 33%.
Slide 5 compares first quarter 2016 and fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were down $350 million, primarily driven by lower results in Refining. Next, we will cover each of the segments individually. 
I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. Transportation continues to generate stable earnings. The NGL business progressed construction on the Freeport LPG Export Terminal. Fractionator utilization was reduced due to turnarounds and the impact of ethane rejection on feedstock composition. Included in the transportation and NGL results is the contribution from Phillips 66 Partners. During the quarter PSXP contributed earnings of $32 million to the Midstream segment. Distributions to Phillips 66 from our LP and GP interests increased 7% over the fourth quarter. DCP Midstream continues to work on its self-help initiatives to reduce costs, manage its portfolio and restructure contracts.
On Slide 7, Midstream's first quarter adjusted earnings were $40 million, down $2 million from the fourth quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $72 million, down $6 million from the prior quarter, driven by lower equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline and Explorer pipeline. NGL adjusted losses were $11 million for the first quarter. A $9 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by seasonal storage activity, partially offset by lower tax expense. Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were lower in the first quarter, primarily due to improved reliability and contract restructuring efforts, partially offset by the impact of lower commodity prices.
In Chemicals, the global olefins and polyolefins capacity utilization rate for the quarter was 93%, and margins were lower. SA&S had improved equity earnings due to higher volumes at equity affiliates. 
As shown on Slide 9, first quarter adjusted earnings for Chemicals were $156 million, down from $182 million in the fourth quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, the decrease of $36 million was largely due to lower margins, driven by reduced polyethylene sales prices. This was partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes and lower controllable costs. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $7 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales volumes due to fourth quarter turnaround activities at CPChem's equity affiliates.
In Refining, realized margins were $7.11 per barrel for the quarter as market crack spreads decreased significantly from the prior quarter. Gasoline market cracks were down 14% from the fourth quarter due in part to the impact of higher-than-normal industry gasoline production in the fourth quarter as well as the impacts of butane blending and seasonally lower demand. Distillate market cracks were at a 6-year low. Market capture decreased from 74% in the fourth quarter to 67% in the first quarter. Clean product yield fell to 82%, with gasoline yield at 43%. These yields reflect the impact of turnaround activity as well as accelerated maintenance on secondary units due to the low-margin environment. Pretax turnaround costs were $115 million, $35 million lower than guidance due to the deferral of some catalyst change-out activity.
Slide 11 shows a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. The Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $86 million, down $290 million from last quarter. The reduction was largely due to lower market cracks. Atlantic Basin adjusted earnings decreased this quarter, primarily due to lower volumes and inventory impacts. The Gulf Coast region saw lower margins and reduced volumes due to planned maintenance and unplanned downtime. In the Gulf Coast region as well as the Central Corridor, we had unplanned downtime as we undertook discretionary maintenance in a low-margin environment. In the Central Corridor, lower margins accounted for the majority of the reduction in adjusted earnings from the fourth quarter as market cracks were 24% lower. On the West Coast, market cracks were 26% lower. Reduced margins were mostly offset by improvements in controllable costs and inventory impacts. Santa Maria continued to be affected by the Plains pipeline outage. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 12. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.11 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $10.64 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 67%. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries as it relates to our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 82% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses due to secondary products decreased this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs narrowed. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher than the fourth quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a good quarter, thanks to healthy U.S. margins and volumes. Specialties saw higher earnings on improved margins. 
Slide 14 shows adjusted earnings for M&S in the first quarter of $205 million, down $22 million from the fourth quarter. In Marketing and Other, the $36 million decrease was largely due to lower biodiesel tax credits and lower margins in international Marketing. This was partially offset by higher U.S. marketing margins. Specialties adjusted earnings increased to $43 million, primarily due to improved base oil margins.
On Slide 15, the Corporate and Other expense had after-tax net costs of $127 million this quarter, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter. Net interest expense increased by $7 million, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with the start-up of Sweeny Fractionator One, while corporate overhead and other expenses increased by $3 million due to the timing of legal and environmental charges.
Slide 16 shows cash flow for the quarter. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations was $722 million. Working capital changes reduced cash flow by $464 million. The cash benefit of a U.S. tax refund received in the quarter was more than offset by the customary first quarter inventory build and the timing of marketing receipts and crude cargo payments. We funded $750 million of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed nearly $700 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 526 million shares outstanding. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $1.7 billion.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. 
Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the second quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the low 90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be approximately $100 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $120 million and $125 million. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

The first bucket is really, I don't think the first quarter is reflective of our view of what 2016 is going to be. You've seen cracks have gone from $10 to $15. We've seen NGLs move from $0.37 to $0.47, $0.48. We're seeing good demand for transportation fuels, gasoline. We're seeing good demand for petrochemicals. We're seeing margins up a couple of cents, and we think margins will continue to improve in the petchem chain. So we think that '16 is still kind of a $4 billion to $5 billion-type cash generation year from us from operations. Second, I would say our view is that for high-quality MLPs, we think that the equity markets are open, and that we would expect between some combination of debt and equity, we'd raise between $1 billion and $2 billion back into PSX this year. So this kind of moves you to $5 billion to $7 billion of cash if you want to think about it that way. We can afford a $3.9 billion capital program, $1.2 billion dividend and $1 billion to $2 billion of share repurchases given that. I will say just though, we're looking at things going on. And we're going through every line item in the capital budget both for '16 and '17. And we're assuring that our premises that we started with are still valid and that these projects are going to generate returns that are acceptable and meet our requirements.

And then the ethane could reach that perhaps in terms of cracking parity, but the balance really comes about which of those feedstocks you select. But the export netback really becomes the upper limit of what we set for the cracking value. Ethane, in our view, giving -- coming out of rejection and what we see on the start-up of the projects, should still remain at a competitive disadvantage for the long term. And so I think it really is that interplay somewhere between gas value and propane, butane parity and the cracking that determines that. But we would expect when the new crackers start up that ethane prices will come up somewhat to pull some of that ethane back out of the gas stream. But we're still -- the bottom line is we're still bullish on the operating rate side on Chemicals as well as the competitive advantage that you get from ethane and LPG cracking."

You would expect with drilling activity, you would eventually expect to see that to break over a bit. But we're still seeing good NGL volumes coming in into the Gulf Coast. The Permian, in particular, looks really good. And I think that ties back to what you see on the crude side. The Eagle Ford being -- we're seeing decline rates both on NGL and crude. But overall, NGL volumes have been up to kind of holding flat. And in fact, we had record propane production, but you've got a refinery input on the propane side as well, which may tie back to gasoline mode. So I'd say, on the NGL side we've seen it hold, and as crude oil prices recover and drilling resumes and if you believe that North America is going to have that incremental call, we're still bullish that the NGL supply is going to continue to increase."

And your guess is as good as mine about exactly where they are. But with the capital expenditures budgets where they are on the upstream, it's hard to see that you're going to see a lot of extra volume over the next 12 months until that program ramps back up. And so sustained crude oil prices would help drive that. And we think over a period of months that's what you'll begin to see. But I think we're kind of -- and I think our view is, we're probably getting closer to the bottom. We may stay here a while. And we're certainly going to continue to see volatility."

So I think we still like it from a return standpoint.

We're committed to our strategy of growing our high-value businesses and are focused on performing well. Operating excellence remains a top priority, operating safely, running our assets well and managing costs.  During the quarter, we delivered solid operational excellence performance. Refining performed at record rates, achieving 100% utilization. For the first half of the year, our personal safety metric, which we believe was already among the best in our industry, improving 16%. And process safety metric improved 75% compared to the prior year. 
In Chemicals, CPChem completed 3 major turnarounds this quarter. Global olefins and polyolefins businesses operated at 91% of capacity. BCP NGL volumes are up and reliability of operations improved. 
Total adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $499 million. The market environment remained challenging as low margins continue to impact DCP Midstream, NGL trading and Refining businesses. However, our fee-based Midstream business performed well, and we continue to see good demand in Chemicals. Although demand for refined products is up relative to last year, the weighted average market crack was more than $5 per barrel from where it was a year ago, and crude differentials remained tight. We remain focused and executing our strategy in those areas under our control. Our growth projects are all progressing well, and we continue to see great value and opportunity long term.
During the second quarter, the Dakota Access Pipeline project began laying pipe and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Once in service, the pipeline is expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which should be in service by year-end. We have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels. 
Also in the Gulf, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. Sweeny Fractionator One is operating well. However, volume mix across all of our fractionators remains impacted by heavier NGL feedstock as a result of continued ethane rejection.
We expect construction of the 150,000 barrel per day Freeport LPG terminal to be completed later this year. 
Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our midstream growth strategy and a significant source of attractive funding. In May, we completed $775 million drop-down, and PSXP successfully issued over $650 million of public equity.  PSXP increased its limited partnership distributions by 5% in the second quarter and remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is making progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP expect to achieve cash breakeven at NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. DCP is working on its cost structure, reducing capital and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength. We expect DCP to be self-funded going forward. 
CPChem continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is now 80% complete with an expected start-up in the second half of 2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending is reduced, we should see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
During the quarter, we advanced several refining projects. At the Wood River refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. As the Billings Refinery, efforts are underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And at Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing. These are all high-return, quick-payout projects. 
Our marketing specialty segment is the highest returning in our portfolio. In the U.S., we are increasing branded and unbranded volumes, and we're selectively pursuing incremental growth opportunities in Europe. 
We're mindful of the current market environment, and we've maintained our capital discipline approach in terms of how we allocate capital. We continue to target a long term 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to the shareholders. During the quarter, we generated over $1.8 billion in cash from operations and a PSXP equity offering. We returned over $570 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter and increased our quarterly dividend by 12.5%.  This represents our sixth dividend increase since the formation of our company, with a 33% compound annual growth rate.  We returned $12.3 billion to shareholders over this 4-year period through dividends and repurchase or exchange of 118 million shares. [ph] We reinvested $620 million into our businesses during the quarter. 
We're looking at all of our projects in our portfolio to ensure that we only advance projects that meet our return expectations. We've made a decision to defer FID on frac 2. We're also working with our partners to project finance at [indiscernible]. 
We're going to give you some more detail on our 2016 capital expenditures later this summer. But at this point, we expect our capital expenditures for the year to come in below $3.3 billion, well below our $3.9 billion capital budget.
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?"

Starting on Slide 4, second quarter net income was $496 million. We had 2 special items that netted to a loss of $3 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $499 million or; $0.94 per share. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Excluding almost $600 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $560 million. 
Undistributed equity earnings totaled almost $350 million.  Capital spending for the quarter was $620 million with approximately $340 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. Distributions to shareholders in the second quarter totaled $571 million, including $329 million in dividends and $242 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. After taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. 
Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 6% for the first half of 2016. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 31%.
Slide 5 compares second quarter and first quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up $139 million, driven mainly by improvements in Chemicals, Refining and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next, we will cover each of the segments individually.  I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing the noncontrolling interest of $22 million, Midstream second quarter adjusted earnings were $39 million, in line with the first quarter. 
Our Transportation business is composed primarily of fee-based assets. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $65 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs, including seasonal maintenance.  Equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline were lower due in part to contract restructuring to lengthen the term of a commitment. These items are partially offset by improved volumes. 
In NGL, adjusted losses were $17 million for the quarter. The $6 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by project expenses related to the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and lower earnings due to timing effects of seasonal storage. These decreases are partially offset by the benefit of higher fractionation volumes compared to the first quarter. 
Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were $9 million in the second quarter, a $12 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies, highly recoveries, continued cost savings and increased commodity prices.
Turning to Slide 7. In Chemicals, industry chain margins increased during the quarter, but demand for polyethylene remains strong. Second quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, up $156 million from the first quarter. 
In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings increased $25 million largely due to higher margins driven by increased polyethylene sales prices. In addition, equity earnings also improved due to stronger margins. This was partially offset by higher operating costs from planned turnaround activity. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SANS rose by $9 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales prices. In Refining, we ran well with 100% crude utilization for the quarter. In addition, clean product yield increased from 82% to 84%, with gasoline yield at 45% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $69 million, $31 million lower than guidance due in part of the deferral of certain maintenance activities. Despite higher market cracks in all regions, realized margins were $7.13 per barrel, roughly the same as in the first quarter. But this was primarily due to higher losses on secondary products and lower clean product differentials. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $152 million, up $66 million from last quarter. Regionally, earnings were higher in the Atlantic Basin, Central Corridor and West Coast, reflecting the benefit of higher margins and volumes. Earnings were lower in the Gulf Coast as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by lower margins caused by lower product differentials and higher secondary product losses. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9.  Our worldwide realized margin was $7.13 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $13.84 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 52% compared to 67% in the first quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. 
Losses from secondary products of $3.41 per barrel were $1.51 per barrel higher this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as Coke and NGLs increased. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher than the first quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. 
The other category mainly includes costs associated with , outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were higher than the first quarter primarily due to lower clean product differentials and higher gross margins prices. 
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a strong second quarter despite the rising commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter were $229 million, up $24 million from the first quarter. In marketing and other, the $37 million increase was largely due to higher margins in international marketing and higher domestic gasoline volumes. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased by $13 million primarily as a result of lower base oil margins, partially offset by higher lubricants volumes. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had after-tax net costs of $111 million this quarter, an improvement of $16 million from the first quarter. Net interest expense decreased by $2 million, while corporate overhead and other expenses decreased by $14 million primarily due to lower legal and remediation accruals and lower taxes.
Slide 12 shows cash flow for the year-to-date. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations in the first half was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $100 million. In May, Phillips 66 Partners raised $656 million in a public equity offering. We funded $1.4 billion of capital expenditures and investments. And we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 523 million shares outstanding. At the end of June, our cash balance stood at $2.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items.
In the third quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $120 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $115 million and $125 million after-tax. And companywide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

So we're still seeing supply and we're still seeing ethane interjection that's there to feed the new crackers start-up. until crackers start up on the ethane side, we think that will be the main driver starting to pull more ethane out of the gas stream, which should strengthen the ethane price. On the propane side, we've had strong exports. And that's kept for propane market really connected to the international pricing in the international markets. We saw some short-term cancellations, I think, this summer as really the differentials between the U.S. and some other market start to close. But we're starting to see corrections. And our view is long term, you still have excess in both ethane and propane. And then the propane has to leave the market to rebalance and clear it. And so I think that what you see us, you see the market start to readjust and returning to see some of that now in the pricing this month in July. So I think still overall still see a lot of value that LPG value chain and growing production as soon as crude oil production, gas production resumes out in the future."

If I can just go to the 30,000-foot level and just talk about the Sweeny hub in general, we still think that that's a great project and we see value creation opportunity there. If you think about NGL pipes coming out of the Permian, West Texas and the Eagle Ford and going by Sweeny, you think about world-class refining, world-class petrochemicals. We have the largest single site ethylene facility at Sweeny. We have -- we're building 1.2 million tons of polyethylene capacity building the fractionator. We're building the caverns. [ph] We're building the interconnecting pipes to Belvieu and on to Freeport, and then the 150,000 barrel a day LPG export facility. So we still like that concept in what we're creating there. I think short-term what you're seeing in the market, there's going to be stress in the LPG side of it. The frac is running well. It's running to design limits. We're seeing certainly heavier feed than what we premised. So we're running about 80 at the frac today versus 100%. But it's completely loaded in the back end of the frac. The other thing I would say is, as this project is coming up, we have a lot of project expenses that are hitting us beyond just the frac. So think about the pipes and the caverns and the commissioning the start-up of the LPG export facility. So you should expect to see those costs continue through the end of 2016. But when we talk about the frac itself, we drop it, all of it. It's at PSXP today. The [indiscernible] is off [ph] about $100 million, so $25 million a quarter. There's a little bit of leakage that goes to the noncontrolling interest, but -- so then you take that and bring it to the net income level. And that was more than offset by the project expenses we had and the seasonal trading activities that we had in our NGL business. So I think that we are not worried about this whole NGL complex we're building at Sweeny in terms of it coming up. And we're looking forward to getting the LPG export up later this year. We'll start commissioning activities actually the next couple of weeks as we start thinking about that. And so I just want to say that we still really like this project a lot.

We're committed to our strategy of growing our high-value businesses and are focused on performing well. Operating excellence remains a top priority, operating safely, running our assets well and managing cost. During the quarter, we delivered solid operational excellence performance. Refining performed at record rates, achieving 100% utilization. For the first half of the year, our personnel safety metric, which we believe was already among the best in our industry, improved 16%. And our process safety metric improved 75% compared to the prior year. 
In Chemicals, CPChem completed 3 major turnarounds this quarter. The global olefins and polyolefins businesses operated at 91% of capacity. DCP NGL volumes were up and reliability of operations improved. 
Total adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $499 million. The market environment remained challenging as low margins continued to impact our DCP Midstream, NGL trading and Refining businesses. However, our fee-based Midstream business performed well, and we continue to see good demand in Chemicals. Although demand for refined products is up relative to last year, the weighted average market crack was more than $5 per barrel from where it was a year ago and crude differentials remained tight. We remain focused on executing our strategy in those areas under our control. Our growth projects are all progressing well, and we continue to see great value and opportunity long term.
During the second quarter, the Dakota Access Pipeline project began laying pipe and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Once in service, the DAPL ETCOP pipeline is expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which should be in service by year end. We have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels. 
Also in the Gulf, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. Sweeny Fractionator One is operating well; however, volume mix across all of our fractionators remains impacted by heavier NGL feedstock as a result of continued ethane rejection.
We expect construction of the 150,000 barrel per day Freeport LPG export terminal to be completed later this year. Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our midstream growth strategy and a significant source of attractive funding. In May, we completed $775 million drop-down, and PSXP successfully issued over $650 million of public equity.  PSXP increased its limited partner distributions by 5% in the second quarter and remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is making progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP expects to achieve cash breakeven at NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. DCP is working on its cost structure, reducing capital and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength. We expect DCP to be self-funded going forward. 
CPChem continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is now 80% complete with an expected startup in the second half of 2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending is reduced, we should see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
During the quarter, we advanced several refining projects. At the Wood River Refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At the Billings Refinery, efforts are underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And at Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing. These are all high-return, quick-payout projects. 
Our Marketing and Specialties segment is the highest returning in our portfolio. In the U.S., we are increasing branded and unbranded volumes, and we're selectively pursuing incremental growth opportunities in Europe. 
We're mindful of the current market environment, and we've maintained our capital-disciplined approach in terms of how we allocate capital. We continue to target a long-term 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to the shareholders. During the quarter, we generated over $1.8 billion in cash from operations and a PSXP equity offering. We returned over $570 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter and increased our quarterly dividend by 12.5%. This represents our sixth dividend increase since the formation of our company with a 33% compound annual growth rate. We've returned $12.3 billion to shareholders over this 4-year period through dividends and repurchase or exchange of 118 million shares. We reinvested $620 million into our businesses during the quarter. 
We're looking at all of our projects in our portfolio to ensure that we only advance projects that meet our return expectations. We've made a decision to defer FID on Frac 2. We're also working with our partners to project finance DAPL ETCOP.
We're going to give you some more detail around our 2016 capital expenditures later this summer. But at this point, we expect our capital expenditures for the year to come in below $3.3 billion, well below our $3.9 billion capital budget.
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?"

Starting on Slide 4, second quarter net income was $496 million. We had 2 special items that netted to a loss of $3 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $499 million or $0.94 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Excluding almost $600 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $560 million. Undistributed equity earnings totaled almost $350 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $620 million with approximately $340 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. Distributions to shareholders in the second quarter totaled $571 million, including $329 million in dividends and $242 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 6% for the first half of 2016. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 31%.
Slide 5 compares second quarter and first quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up $139 million, driven mainly by improvements in Chemicals, Refining and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next we will cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing the noncontrolling interest of $22 million, Midstream's second quarter adjusted earnings were $39 million, in line with the first quarter. Our Transportation business is composed primarily of fee-based assets. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $65 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs including seasonal maintenance. Equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline were lower, due in part to contract restructuring to lengthen the term of a commitment. These items were partially offset by improved volumes. 
In NGL, adjusted losses were $17 million for the quarter. The $6 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by project expenses related to the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and lower earnings due to timing effects of seasonal storage. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of higher fractionation volumes compared to the first quarter. 
Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were $9 million in the second quarter, a $12 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies, higher recoveries, continued cost savings and increased commodity prices.
Turning to Slide 7. In Chemicals, industry chain margins increased during the quarter as demand for polyethylene remains strong. Second quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, up $156 million from the first quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings increased $25 million largely due to higher margins driven by increased polyethylene sales prices. In addition, equity earnings also improved due to stronger margins. This was partially offset by higher operating cost from planned turnaround activity. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S rose by $9 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales prices. 
In Refining, we ran well with 100% crude utilization for the quarter. In addition, clean product yield increased from 82% to 84%, with gasoline yield at 45% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $69 million, $31 million lower than guidance, due in part of the deferral of certain maintenance activities. Despite higher market cracks in all regions, realized margins were $7.13 per barrel, roughly the same as in the first quarter. This was primarily due to higher losses on secondary products and lower clean product differentials. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $152 million, up $66 million from last quarter. Regionally, earnings were higher in the Atlantic Basin, Central Corridor and West Coast, reflecting the benefit of higher margins and volumes. Earnings were lower in the Gulf Coast as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by lower margins caused by lower product differentials and higher secondary product losses. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.13 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $13.84 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 52% compared to 67% in the first quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $3.41 per barrel were $1.51 per barrel higher this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs increased. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher in the -- than the first quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were higher than the first quarter, primarily due to lower clean product differentials and higher RINs prices. 
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties, where we posted a strong second quarter despite the rising commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter were $229 million, up $24 million from the first quarter. In marketing and other, the $37 million increase was largely due to higher margins in international marketing and higher domestic gasoline volumes. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased by $13 million, primarily as a result of lower base oil margins, partially offset by higher lubricants volumes. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had after-tax net costs of $111 million this quarter, an improvement of $16 million from the first quarter. Net interest expense decreased by $2 million, while corporate overhead and other expenses decreased by $14 million primarily due to lower legal and remediation accruals and lower taxes.
Slide 12 shows cash flow for the year-to-date. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations in the first half was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $100 million. In May, Phillips 66 Partners raised $656 million in a public equity offering. We funded $1.4 billion of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 523 million shares outstanding. At the end of June, our cash balance stood at $2.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the third quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rates to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $120 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $115 million and $125 million after-tax. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

Ethane started coming out of rejection, but we've actually seen kind of NGL prices begin to fall. And I think that the real key on this is, a, export demand and the pet chem demand in the industry. So we're still seeing supply, and we're still seeing ethane in rejection that's there to feed the new cracker startup. So until those crackers start up on the ethane side, we think that would be the main driver starting to pull more ethane out of the gas stream, which should strengthen the ethane price. On the propane side, we've had strong exports, and that's kept the propane market really connected to the international pricing in the international markets. We saw some short-term cancellations, I think, this summer as really the differentials between the U.S. and some other markets start to close. But we're starting to see corrections. And our view is that long term, you still have excess length in both ethane and propane and that propane has to lead the market to rebalance and clear. And so I think that what you see is you see the market start to readjust. And we're starting to see some of that now in the pricing this month in July. So I think we're still -- overall still see a lot of value in that LPG value chain and growing production as soon as crude oil production, gas production resumes out in the future."

So I think it speaks to strength there. The RINs are always interesting in terms of what's the impact in terms of the costs and the capture as it moves with the price, but I think that put a bias into the price of the product as well. And I think we're able to capture some of that. It certainly shows up as a cost in Refining, but it's a tailwind as well if you generate the RIN in marketing.

If I can just go to the 30,000-foot level and just talk about the Sweeny hub in general, we still think that, that's a great project and we see value creation opportunity there. If you think about NGL pipes coming out of the Permian, West Texas and the Eagle Ford and going by Sweeny, you think about world-class refining, world-class petrochemicals, we have the largest single site ethylene facility at Sweeny. We have -- we're building 1.2 million tons of polyethylene capacity, building the fractionator. We're building the caverns. We're building the interconnecting pipes to Belvieu and on to Freeport and then the 150,000 barrel a day LPG export facility. So we still like that concept and what we're creating there. I think short term, what you're seeing in the market, there's going to be stress in the LPG side of it. The frac is running well. It's running to design limits. We're seeing certainly heavier feed than what we premised. And so we're running about 80 a day at the frac today versus 100%, but it's completely loaded in the back end of the frac. The other thing I would say is, as this project is coming up, we have a lot of project expenses that are hitting us beyond just the frac. So think about the pipes and the caverns and the commissioning, the startup of the LPG export facility. So you should expect to see those costs continue through the end of 2016. But we talk about the frac itself, we drop it, all of it. It's at PSXP today. The [indiscernible] about $100 million, so $25 million a quarter. There's a little bit of leakage that goes to the noncontrolling interest. But then -- so then you take that and bring it to the net income level. And that was more than offset by the project expenses we had and the seasonal trading activities that we had in our NGL business. So I think that -- but we're not worried about this whole NGL complex that we're building at Sweeny in terms of it coming up. And we're looking forward to getting the LPG export up later this year. We'll start commissioning activities actually in the next couple of weeks as we start thinking about that. And so I just want to say that we still really like this project a lot.

We're committed to our strategy of growing our high-value businesses and are focused on performing well. Operating excellence remains a top priority, operating safely, running our assets well and managing cost. During the quarter, we delivered solid operational excellence performance. Refining performed at record rates, achieving 100% utilization. For the first half of the year, our personnel safety metric, which we believe was already among the best in our industry, improved 16%. And our process safety metric improved 75% compared to the prior year. 
In Chemicals, CPChem completed 3 major turnarounds this quarter. The global olefins and polyolefins businesses operated at 91% of capacity. DCP NGL volumes were up and reliability of operations improved. 
Total adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $499 million. The market environment remained challenging as low margins continued to impact our DCP Midstream, NGL trading and Refining businesses. However, our fee-based Midstream business performed well, and we continue to see good demand in Chemicals. Although demand for refined products is up relative to last year, the weighted average market crack was more than $5 per barrel from where it was a year ago and crude differentials remained tight. We remain focused on executing our strategy in those areas under our control. Our growth projects are all progressing well, and we continue to see great value and opportunity long term.
During the second quarter, the Dakota Access Pipeline project began laying pipe and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Once in service, the DAPL ETCOP pipeline is expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which should be in service by year end. We have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels. 
Also in the Gulf, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. Sweeny Fractionator One is operating well; however, volume mix across all of our fractionators remains impacted by heavier NGL feedstock as a result of continued ethane rejection.
We expect construction of the 150,000 barrel per day Freeport LPG export terminal to be completed later this year. Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our midstream growth strategy and a significant source of attractive funding. In May, we completed $775 million drop-down, and PSXP successfully issued over $650 million of public equity.  PSXP increased its limited partner distributions by 5% in the second quarter and remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is making progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP expects to achieve cash breakeven at NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. DCP is working on its cost structure, reducing capital and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength. We expect DCP to be self-funded going forward. 
CPChem continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is now 80% complete with an expected startup in the second half of 2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending is reduced, we should see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
During the quarter, we advanced several refining projects. At the Wood River Refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At the Billings Refinery, efforts are underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And at Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing. These are all high-return, quick-payout projects. 
Our Marketing and Specialties segment is the highest returning in our portfolio. In the U.S., we are increasing branded and unbranded volumes, and we're selectively pursuing incremental growth opportunities in Europe. 
We're mindful of the current market environment, and we've maintained our capital-disciplined approach in terms of how we allocate capital. We continue to target a long-term 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to the shareholders. During the quarter, we generated over $1.8 billion in cash from operations and a PSXP equity offering. We returned over $570 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter and increased our quarterly dividend by 12.5%. This represents our sixth dividend increase since the formation of our company with a 33% compound annual growth rate. We've returned $12.3 billion to shareholders over this 4-year period through dividends and repurchase or exchange of 118 million shares. We reinvested $620 million into our businesses during the quarter. 
We're looking at all of our projects in our portfolio to ensure that we only advance projects that meet our return expectations. We've made a decision to defer FID on Frac 2. We're also working with our partners to project finance DAPL ETCOP.
We're going to give you some more detail around our 2016 capital expenditures later this summer. But at this point, we expect our capital expenditures for the year to come in below $3.3 billion, well below our $3.9 billion capital budget.
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?"

Starting on Slide 4, second quarter net income was $496 million. We had 2 special items that netted to a loss of $3 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $499 million or $0.94 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Excluding almost $600 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $560 million. Undistributed equity earnings totaled almost $350 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $620 million with approximately $340 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. Distributions to shareholders in the second quarter totaled $571 million, including $329 million in dividends and $242 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 6% for the first half of 2016. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 31%.
Slide 5 compares second quarter and first quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up $139 million, driven mainly by improvements in Chemicals, Refining and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next we will cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing the noncontrolling interest of $22 million, Midstream's second quarter adjusted earnings were $39 million, in line with the first quarter. Our Transportation business is composed primarily of fee-based assets. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $65 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs including seasonal maintenance. Equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline were lower, due in part to contract restructuring to lengthen the term of a commitment. These items were partially offset by improved volumes. 
In NGL, adjusted losses were $17 million for the quarter. The $6 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by project expenses related to the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and lower earnings due to timing effects of seasonal storage. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of higher fractionation volumes compared to the first quarter. 
Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were $9 million in the second quarter, a $12 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies, higher recoveries, continued cost savings and increased commodity prices.
Turning to Slide 7. In Chemicals, industry chain margins increased during the quarter as demand for polyethylene remains strong. Second quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, up $156 million from the first quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings increased $25 million largely due to higher margins driven by increased polyethylene sales prices. In addition, equity earnings also improved due to stronger margins. This was partially offset by higher operating cost from planned turnaround activity. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S rose by $9 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales prices. 
In Refining, we ran well with 100% crude utilization for the quarter. In addition, clean product yield increased from 82% to 84%, with gasoline yield at 45% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $69 million, $31 million lower than guidance, due in part of the deferral of certain maintenance activities. Despite higher market cracks in all regions, realized margins were $7.13 per barrel, roughly the same as in the first quarter. This was primarily due to higher losses on secondary products and lower clean product differentials. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $152 million, up $66 million from last quarter. Regionally, earnings were higher in the Atlantic Basin, Central Corridor and West Coast, reflecting the benefit of higher margins and volumes. Earnings were lower in the Gulf Coast as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by lower margins caused by lower product differentials and higher secondary product losses. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.13 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $13.84 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 52% compared to 67% in the first quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $3.41 per barrel were $1.51 per barrel higher this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs increased. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher in the -- than the first quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were higher than the first quarter, primarily due to lower clean product differentials and higher RINs prices. 
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties, where we posted a strong second quarter despite the rising commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter were $229 million, up $24 million from the first quarter. In marketing and other, the $37 million increase was largely due to higher margins in international marketing and higher domestic gasoline volumes. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased by $13 million, primarily as a result of lower base oil margins, partially offset by higher lubricants volumes. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had after-tax net costs of $111 million this quarter, an improvement of $16 million from the first quarter. Net interest expense decreased by $2 million, while corporate overhead and other expenses decreased by $14 million primarily due to lower legal and remediation accruals and lower taxes.
Slide 12 shows cash flow for the year-to-date. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations in the first half was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $100 million. In May, Phillips 66 Partners raised $656 million in a public equity offering. We funded $1.4 billion of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 523 million shares outstanding. At the end of June, our cash balance stood at $2.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the third quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rates to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $120 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $115 million and $125 million after-tax. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s.

So we're still seeing supply, and we're still seeing ethane in rejection that's there to feed the new cracker startup. So until those crackers start up on the ethane side, we think that would be the main driver starting to pull more ethane out of the gas stream, which should strengthen the ethane price. On the propane side, we've had strong exports, and that's kept the propane market really connected to the international pricing in the international markets. We saw some short-term cancellations, I think, this summer as really the differentials between the U.S. and some other markets start to close. But we're starting to see corrections. And our view is that long term, you still have excess length in both ethane and propane and that propane has to lead the market to rebalance and clear. And so I think that what you see is you see the market start to readjust. And we're starting to see some of that now in the pricing this month in July. So I think we're still -- overall still see a lot of value in that LPG value chain and growing production as soon as crude oil production, gas production resumes out in the future."

So I think it reflects the strength on the demand side. And so we were able to capture a little better margin in terms of the value, if you will, of our distribution wholesale markets. So I think it speaks to strength there. The RINs are always interesting in terms of what's the impact in terms of the costs and the capture as it moves with the price, but I think that put a bias into the price of the product as well. And I think we're able to capture some of that. It certainly shows up as a cost in Refining, but it's a tailwind as well if you generate the RIN in marketing.

The bulk of that is in CPChem, but you also see it with WRB, JV, Excel Paralubes and then the several other smaller JVs. Some of those, it's reflected of the investment that's taking place inside of those JVs that's consuming that cash. Some of it, a portion is just the timing effect. The distributions aren't necessarily ratable. So when you think about the $560  million of cash flow excluding working capital, if you were to add back the undistributed equity earnings to put it on sort of a consistent basis, that's just over $900 million of operating cash flow, which then lines up with the -- what you'd expect from the earnings generated, given the environment."

Let me take a -- maybe a 30,000-foot view on this question, if I can, and then Tim can come in behind me and give you some of the details. So I know you have a concern around this, and we understand that. If I can just go to the 30,000-foot level and just talk about the Sweeny hub in general, we still think that, that's a great project and we see value creation opportunity there. If you think about NGL pipes coming out of the Permian, West Texas and the Eagle Ford and going by Sweeny, you think about world-class refining, world-class petrochemicals, we have the largest single site ethylene facility at Sweeny. We have -- we're building 1.2 million tons of polyethylene capacity, building the fractionator. We're building the caverns. We're building the interconnecting pipes to Belvieu and on to Freeport and then the 150,000 barrel a day LPG export facility. So we still like that concept and what we're creating there. I think short term, what you're seeing in the market, there's going to be stress in the LPG side of it. The frac is running well. It's running to design limits. We're seeing certainly heavier feed than what we premised. And so we're running about 80 a day at the frac today versus 100%, but it's completely loaded in the back end of the frac. The other thing I would say is, as this project is coming up, we have a lot of project expenses that are hitting us beyond just the frac. So think about the pipes and the caverns and the commissioning, the startup of the LPG export facility. So you should expect to see those costs continue through the end of 2016. But we talk about the frac itself, we drop it, all of it. It's at PSXP today. The [indiscernible] about $100 million, so $25 million a quarter. There's a little bit of leakage that goes to the noncontrolling interest. But then -- so then you take that and bring it to the net income level. And that was more than offset by the project expenses we had and the seasonal trading activities that we had in our NGL business. So I think that -- but we're not worried about this whole NGL complex that we're building at Sweeny in terms of it coming up. And we're looking forward to getting the LPG export up later this year. We'll start commissioning activities actually in the next couple of weeks as we start thinking about that. And so I just want to say that we still really like this project a lot. And Tim, if you want to fill anything I missed, you're welcome to do that."

We're committed to our strategy of growing our high-value businesses and are focused on performing well. Operating excellence remains a top priority, operating safely, running our assets well and managing cost. During the quarter, we delivered solid operational excellence performance. Refining performed at record rates, achieving 100% utilization. For the first half of the year, our personnel safety metric, which we believe was already among the best in our industry, improved 16%. And our process safety metric improved 75% compared to the prior year. 
In Chemicals, CPChem completed 3 major turnarounds this quarter. The global olefins and polyolefins businesses operated at 91% of capacity. DCP NGL volumes were up and reliability of operations improved. 
Total adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $499 million. The market environment remained challenging as low margins continued to impact our DCP Midstream, NGL trading and Refining businesses. However, our fee-based Midstream business performed well, and we continue to see good demand in Chemicals. Although demand for refined products is up relative to last year, the weighted average market crack was more than $5 per barrel from where it was a year ago and crude differentials remained tight. We remain focused on executing our strategy in those areas under our control. Our growth projects are all progressing well, and we continue to see great value and opportunity long term.
During the second quarter, the Dakota Access Pipeline project began laying pipe and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Once in service, the DAPL ETCOP pipeline is expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which should be in service by year end. We have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels. 
Also in the Gulf, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. Sweeny Fractionator One is operating well; however, volume mix across all of our fractionators remains impacted by heavier NGL feedstock as a result of continued ethane rejection.
We expect construction of the 150,000 barrel per day Freeport LPG export terminal to be completed later this year. Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our midstream growth strategy and a significant source of attractive funding. In May, we completed $775 million drop-down, and PSXP successfully issued over $650 million of public equity.  PSXP increased its limited partner distributions by 5% in the second quarter and remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is making progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP expects to achieve cash breakeven at NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. DCP is working on its cost structure, reducing capital and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength. We expect DCP to be self-funded going forward. 
CPChem continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is now 80% complete with an expected startup in the second half of 2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending is reduced, we should see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
During the quarter, we advanced several refining projects. At the Wood River Refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At the Billings Refinery, efforts are underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And at Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing. These are all high-return, quick-payout projects. 
Our Marketing and Specialties segment is the highest returning in our portfolio. In the U.S., we are increasing branded and unbranded volumes, and we're selectively pursuing incremental growth opportunities in Europe. 
We're mindful of the current market environment, and we've maintained our capital-disciplined approach in terms of how we allocate capital. We continue to target a long-term 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to the shareholders. During the quarter, we generated over $1.8 billion in cash from operations and a PSXP equity offering. We returned over $570 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter and increased our quarterly dividend by 12.5%. This represents our sixth dividend increase since the formation of our company with a 33% compound annual growth rate. We've returned $12.3 billion to shareholders over this 4-year period through dividends and repurchase or exchange of 118 million shares. We reinvested $620 million into our businesses during the quarter. 
We're looking at all of our projects in our portfolio to ensure that we only advance projects that meet our return expectations. We've made a decision to defer FID on Frac 2. We're also working with our partners to project finance DAPL ETCOP.
We're going to give you some more detail around our 2016 capital expenditures later this summer. But at this point, we expect our capital expenditures for the year to come in below $3.3 billion, well below our $3.9 billion capital budget.
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?"

Starting on Slide 4, second quarter net income was $496 million. We had 2 special items that netted to a loss of $3 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $499 million or $0.94 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Excluding almost $600 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $560 million. Undistributed equity earnings totaled almost $350 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $620 million with approximately $340 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. Distributions to shareholders in the second quarter totaled $571 million, including $329 million in dividends and $242 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 6% for the first half of 2016. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 31%.
Slide 5 compares second quarter and first quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up $139 million, driven mainly by improvements in Chemicals, Refining and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next we will cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing the noncontrolling interest of $22 million, Midstream's second quarter adjusted earnings were $39 million, in line with the first quarter. Our Transportation business is composed primarily of fee-based assets. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $65 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs including seasonal maintenance. Equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline were lower, due in part to contract restructuring to lengthen the term of a commitment. These items were partially offset by improved volumes. 
In NGL, adjusted losses were $17 million for the quarter. The $6 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by project expenses related to the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and lower earnings due to timing effects of seasonal storage. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of higher fractionation volumes compared to the first quarter. 
Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were $9 million in the second quarter, a $12 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies, higher recoveries, continued cost savings and increased commodity prices.
Turning to Slide 7. In Chemicals, industry chain margins increased during the quarter as demand for polyethylene remains strong. Second quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, up $156 million from the first quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings increased $25 million largely due to higher margins driven by increased polyethylene sales prices. In addition, equity earnings also improved due to stronger margins. This was partially offset by higher operating cost from planned turnaround activity. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S rose by $9 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales prices. 
In Refining, we ran well with 100% crude utilization for the quarter. In addition, clean product yield increased from 82% to 84%, with gasoline yield at 45% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $69 million, $31 million lower than guidance, due in part of the deferral of certain maintenance activities. Despite higher market cracks in all regions, realized margins were $7.13 per barrel, roughly the same as in the first quarter. This was primarily due to higher losses on secondary products and lower clean product differentials. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $152 million, up $66 million from last quarter. Regionally, earnings were higher in the Atlantic Basin, Central Corridor and West Coast, reflecting the benefit of higher margins and volumes. Earnings were lower in the Gulf Coast as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by lower margins caused by lower product differentials and higher secondary product losses. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.13 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $13.84 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 52% compared to 67% in the first quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $3.41 per barrel were $1.51 per barrel higher this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs increased. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher in the -- than the first quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were higher than the first quarter, primarily due to lower clean product differentials and higher RINs prices. 
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties, where we posted a strong second quarter despite the rising commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter were $229 million, up $24 million from the first quarter. In marketing and other, the $37 million increase was largely due to higher margins in international marketing and higher domestic gasoline volumes. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased by $13 million, primarily as a result of lower base oil margins, partially offset by higher lubricants volumes. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had after-tax net costs of $111 million this quarter, an improvement of $16 million from the first quarter. Net interest expense decreased by $2 million, while corporate overhead and other expenses decreased by $14 million primarily due to lower legal and remediation accruals and lower taxes.
Slide 12 shows cash flow for the year-to-date. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations in the first half was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $100 million. In May, Phillips 66 Partners raised $656 million in a public equity offering. We funded $1.4 billion of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 523 million shares outstanding. At the end of June, our cash balance stood at $2.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the third quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rates to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $120 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $115 million and $125 million after-tax. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

So we're still seeing supply, and we're still seeing ethane in rejection that's there to feed the new cracker startup. So until those crackers start up on the ethane side, we think that would be the main driver starting to pull more ethane out of the gas stream, which should strengthen the ethane price. On the propane side, we've had strong exports, and that's kept the propane market really connected to the international pricing in the international markets. We saw some short-term cancellations, I think, this summer as really the differentials between the U.S. and some other markets start to close. But we're starting to see corrections. And our view is that long term, you still have excess length in both ethane and propane and that propane has to lead the market to rebalance and clear. And so I think that what you see is you see the market start to readjust. And we're starting to see some of that now in the pricing this month in July. So I think we're still -- overall still see a lot of value in that LPG value chain and growing production as soon as crude oil production, gas production resumes out in the future."

So I think it reflects the strength on the demand side. And so we were able to capture a little better margin in terms of the value, if you will, of our distribution wholesale markets. So I think it speaks to strength there. The RINs are always interesting in terms of what's the impact in terms of the costs and the capture as it moves with the price, but I think that put a bias into the price of the product as well. And I think we're able to capture some of that. It certainly shows up as a cost in Refining, but it's a tailwind as well if you generate the RIN in marketing.

But I don't see FID on that cracker until sometime 2018, 2019 just as we do the development work and look at things. So into the second part of your question, so next year, capital spending at CPChem will decline with the completion of the Gulf -- the first cracker so that may be in the order of $1 billion a year on that. And then in '18, as you ramp up the production on the new cracker, you'll likely see at the CPChem level, this is both of those numbers, another $800 million to $1 billion with some upside depending on how the market is. So substantial cash flow swing at CPChem if you think about free cash flow. And so we're anticipating that we'll get strong distributions back from CPChem here beginning particularly in 2018."

In terms of potential M&A, I mean, we look at it every day. I would say that price is still relatively high to us relative to the organic opportunities we may have in front of us, but we would look at that. And if we can find assets for the right value, we're certainly willing to do that. I think that the Explorer one was a good example, but that was done at the PSXP level.

So I know you have a concern around this, and we understand that. If I can just go to the 30,000-foot level and just talk about the Sweeny hub in general, we still think that, that's a great project and we see value creation opportunity there. If you think about NGL pipes coming out of the Permian, West Texas and the Eagle Ford and going by Sweeny, you think about world-class refining, world-class petrochemicals, we have the largest single site ethylene facility at Sweeny. We have -- we're building 1.2 million tons of polyethylene capacity, building the fractionator. We're building the caverns. We're building the interconnecting pipes to Belvieu and on to Freeport and then the 150,000 barrel a day LPG export facility. So we still like that concept and what we're creating there. I think short term, what you're seeing in the market, there's going to be stress in the LPG side of it. The frac is running well. It's running to design limits. We're seeing certainly heavier feed than what we premised. And so we're running about 80% a day at the frac today versus 100%, but it's completely loaded in the back end of the frac. The other thing I would say is, as this project is coming up, we have a lot of project expenses that are hitting us beyond just the frac. So think about the pipes and the caverns and the commissioning, the startup of the LPG export facility. So you should expect to see those costs continue through the end of 2016. But we talk about the frac itself, we drop it, all of it. It's at PSXP today. The EBITDA about $100 million, so $25 million a quarter. There's a little bit of leakage that goes to the noncontrolling interest. But then -- so then you take that and bring it to the net income level. And that was more than offset by the project expenses we had and the seasonal trading activities that we had in our NGL business. So I think that -- but we're not worried about this whole NGL complex that we're building at Sweeny in terms of it coming up. And we're looking forward to getting the LPG export up later this year. We'll start commissioning activities actually in the next couple of weeks as we start thinking about that. And so I just want to say that we still really like this project a lot. And Tim, if you want to fill anything I missed, you're welcome to do that."

We're committed to our strategy of growing our high-value businesses and are focused on performing well. Operating excellence remains a top priority, operating safely, running our assets well and managing cost. During the quarter, we delivered solid operational excellence performance. Refining performed at record rates, achieving 100% utilization. For the first half of the year, our personnel safety metric, which we believe was already among the best in our industry, improved 16%. And our process safety metric improved 75% compared to the prior year. 
In Chemicals, CPChem completed 3 major turnarounds this quarter. The global olefins and polyolefins businesses operated at 91% of capacity. DCP NGL volumes were up and reliability of operations improved. 
Total adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $499 million. The market environment remained challenging as low margins continued to impact our DCP Midstream, NGL trading and Refining businesses. However, our fee-based Midstream business performed well, and we continue to see good demand in Chemicals. Although demand for refined products is up relative to last year, the weighted average market crack was more than $5 per barrel from where it was a year ago and crude differentials remained tight. We remain focused on executing our strategy in those areas under our control. Our growth projects are all progressing well, and we continue to see great value and opportunity long term.
During the second quarter, the Dakota Access Pipeline project began laying pipe and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Once in service, the DAPL ETCOP pipeline is expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which should be in service by year end. We have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels. 
Also in the Gulf, development of the first phase of the Sweeny hub is nearing completion. Sweeny Fractionator One is operating well; however, volume mix across all of our fractionators remains impacted by heavier NGL feedstock as a result of continued ethane rejection.
We expect construction of the 150,000 barrel per day Freeport LPG export terminal to be completed later this year. Our master limited partnership, Phillips 66 Partners, remains an important part of our midstream growth strategy and a significant source of attractive funding. In May, we completed $775 million drop-down, and PSXP successfully issued over $650 million of public equity.  PSXP increased its limited partner distributions by 5% in the second quarter and remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compound annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream is making progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP expects to achieve cash breakeven at NGL prices below $0.35 per gallon this year. DCP is working on its cost structure, reducing capital and converting commodity-exposed contracts to fee-based to improve financial strength. We expect DCP to be self-funded going forward. 
CPChem continues to advance the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project. It is now 80% complete with an expected startup in the second half of 2017. Once running, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending is reduced, we should see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
During the quarter, we advanced several refining projects. At the Wood River Refinery, we're undergoing debottlenecking and are on schedule for completion in the third quarter. At the Billings Refinery, efforts are underway to increase the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And at Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing. These are all high-return, quick-payout projects. 
Our Marketing and Specialties segment is the highest returning in our portfolio. In the U.S., we are increasing branded and unbranded volumes, and we're selectively pursuing incremental growth opportunities in Europe. 
We're mindful of the current market environment, and we've maintained our capital-disciplined approach in terms of how we allocate capital. We continue to target a long-term 60-40 split between reinvestment in our business and distributions back to the shareholders. During the quarter, we generated over $1.8 billion in cash from operations and a PSXP equity offering. We returned over $570 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter and increased our quarterly dividend by 12.5%. This represents our sixth dividend increase since the formation of our company with a 33% compound annual growth rate. We've returned $12.3 billion to shareholders over this 4-year period through dividends and repurchase or exchange of 118 million shares. We reinvested $620 million into our businesses during the quarter. 
We're looking at all of our projects in our portfolio to ensure that we only advance projects that meet our return expectations. We've made a decision to defer FID on Frac 2. We're also working with our partners to project finance DAPL ETCOP.
We're going to give you some more detail around our 2016 capital expenditures later this summer. But at this point, we expect our capital expenditures for the year to come in below $3.3 billion, well below our $3.9 billion capital budget.
So now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results. Kevin?"

Starting on Slide 4, second quarter net income was $496 million. We had 2 special items that netted to a loss of $3 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $499 million or $0.94 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Excluding almost $600 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $560 million. Undistributed equity earnings totaled almost $350 million. Capital spending for the quarter was $620 million with approximately $340 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. Distributions to shareholders in the second quarter totaled $571 million, including $329 million in dividends and $242 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 22%. Annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 6% for the first half of 2016. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 31%.
Slide 5 compares second quarter and first quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up $139 million, driven mainly by improvements in Chemicals, Refining and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next we will cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing the noncontrolling interest of $22 million, Midstream's second quarter adjusted earnings were $39 million, in line with the first quarter. Our Transportation business is composed primarily of fee-based assets. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $65 million, down $7 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs including seasonal maintenance. Equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline were lower, due in part to contract restructuring to lengthen the term of a commitment. These items were partially offset by improved volumes. 
In NGL, adjusted losses were $17 million for the quarter. The $6 million decrease from the prior quarter was largely driven by project expenses related to the Freeport LPG Export Terminal and lower earnings due to timing effects of seasonal storage. These decreases were partially offset by the benefit of higher fractionation volumes compared to the first quarter. 
Adjusted losses for DCP Midstream were $9 million in the second quarter, a $12 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies, higher recoveries, continued cost savings and increased commodity prices.
Turning to Slide 7. In Chemicals, industry chain margins increased during the quarter as demand for polyethylene remains strong. Second quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, up $156 million from the first quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings increased $25 million largely due to higher margins driven by increased polyethylene sales prices. In addition, equity earnings also improved due to stronger margins. This was partially offset by higher operating cost from planned turnaround activity. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S rose by $9 million on higher equity earnings from increased sales prices. 
In Refining, we ran well with 100% crude utilization for the quarter. In addition, clean product yield increased from 82% to 84%, with gasoline yield at 45% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $69 million, $31 million lower than guidance, due in part of the deferral of certain maintenance activities. Despite higher market cracks in all regions, realized margins were $7.13 per barrel, roughly the same as in the first quarter. This was primarily due to higher losses on secondary products and lower clean product differentials. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $152 million, up $66 million from last quarter. Regionally, earnings were higher in the Atlantic Basin, Central Corridor and West Coast, reflecting the benefit of higher margins and volumes. Earnings were lower in the Gulf Coast as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by lower margins caused by lower product differentials and higher secondary product losses. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9. Our worldwide realized margin was $7.13 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $13.84 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 52% compared to 67% in the first quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and our production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $3.41 per barrel were $1.51 per barrel higher this quarter as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs increased. Feedstock advantage was slightly higher in the -- than the first quarter, but crude differentials generally remained tight. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were higher than the first quarter, primarily due to lower clean product differentials and higher RINs prices. 
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties, where we posted a strong second quarter despite the rising commodity price environment. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the second quarter were $229 million, up $24 million from the first quarter. In marketing and other, the $37 million increase was largely due to higher margins in international marketing and higher domestic gasoline volumes. Specialties adjusted earnings decreased by $13 million, primarily as a result of lower base oil margins, partially offset by higher lubricants volumes. 
On Slide 11, the Corporate and Other segment had after-tax net costs of $111 million this quarter, an improvement of $16 million from the first quarter. Net interest expense decreased by $2 million, while corporate overhead and other expenses decreased by $14 million primarily due to lower legal and remediation accruals and lower taxes.
Slide 12 shows cash flow for the year-to-date. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations in the first half was $1.3 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $100 million. In May, Phillips 66 Partners raised $656 million in a public equity offering. We funded $1.4 billion of capital expenditures and investments, and we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 523 million shares outstanding. At the end of June, our cash balance stood at $2.2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In the third quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rates to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the mid-90s and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $100 million and $120 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $115 million and $125 million after-tax. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

So we're still seeing supply, and we're still seeing ethane in rejection that's there to feed the new cracker startup. So until those crackers start up on the ethane side, we think that would be the main driver starting to pull more ethane out of the gas stream, which should strengthen the ethane price. On the propane side, we've had strong exports, and that's kept the propane market really connected to the international pricing in the international markets. We saw some short-term cancellations, I think, this summer as really the differentials between the U.S. and some other markets start to close. But we're starting to see corrections. And our view is that long term, you still have excess length in both ethane and propane and that propane has to lead the market to rebalance and clear. And so I think that what you see is you see the market start to readjust. And we're starting to see some of that now in the pricing this month in July.

So I think it speaks to strength there. The RINs are always interesting in terms of what's the impact in terms of the costs and the capture as it moves with the price, but I think that put a bias into the price of the product as well. And I think we're able to capture some of that. It certainly shows up as a cost in Refining, but it's a tailwind as well if you generate the RIN in marketing.

There needs to be some balancing on the inventory side or the production side to balance that out. And that typically tends to be a more marginal or higher cost area is another reason we think about that. So a lot of dynamics in play around that, and we'll have to see how it shakes out.

So I know you have a concern around this, and we understand that. If I can just go to the 30,000-foot level and just talk about the Sweeny hub in general, we still think that, that's a great project and we see value creation opportunity there. If you think about NGL pipes coming out of the Permian, West Texas and the Eagle Ford and going by Sweeny, you think about world-class refining, world-class petrochemicals, we have the largest single site ethylene facility at Sweeny. We have -- we're building 1.2 million tons of polyethylene capacity, building the fractionator. We're building the caverns. We're building the interconnecting pipes to Belvieu and on to Freeport and then the 150,000 barrel a day LPG export facility. So we still like that concept and what we're creating there. I think short term, what you're seeing in the market, there's going to be stress in the LPG side of it. The frac is running well. It's running to design limits. We're seeing certainly heavier feed than what we premised. And so we're running about 80% a day at the frac today versus 100%, but it's completely loaded in the back end of the frac. The other thing I would say is, as this project is coming up, we have a lot of project expenses that are hitting us beyond just the frac. So think about the pipes and the caverns and the commissioning, the startup of the LPG export facility. So you should expect to see those costs continue through the end of 2016. But we talk about the frac itself, we drop it, all of it. It's at PSXP today. The EBITDA about $100 million, so $25 million a quarter. There's a little bit of leakage that goes to the noncontrolling interest. But then -- so then you take that and bring it to the net income level. And that was more than offset by the project expenses we had and the seasonal trading activities that we had in our NGL business. So I think that -- but we're not worried about this whole NGL complex that we're building at Sweeny in terms of it coming up. And we're looking forward to getting the LPG export up later this year. We'll start commissioning activities actually in the next couple of weeks as we start thinking about that. And so I just want to say that we still really like this project a lot.

Third quarter results reflect the benefit of our diversified downstream portfolio and our continued strong operating performance in a challenging market. While Refining was again impacted by difficult market conditions, Marketing and Specialties and Chemicals performed well. And we delivered total adjusted earnings of $556 million or $1.05 per share. 
During the quarter, market cracks narrowed further, crude differentials tightened, and crude and NGL prices remained depressed. We operated safely. We ran our assets well, and our industry-leading safety metrics for the year are the best we've ever achieved. We're holding our costs flat. 
We're continuing to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We recently lowered capital guidance to approximately $3 billion for 2016 and expect our 2017 capital budget to be below $3 billion. We are growing our higher-value businesses and are focused on high-return, value-enhancing projects. We're executing well on our projects under construction and we remain confident that our growth strategy will create value for our shareholders.
We target a long-term 60-40 split between reinvestment and distributions. We expect the free cash flow generated from operations and proceeds from Phillips 66 Partners capital market access to be sufficient to fund our growth program and distributions to our shareholders. We remain committed to a growing, secure and competitive dividend as well as $1 billion to $2 billion per year of share repurchases.
In Midstream, lower energy prices and narrow differentials have reduced the need for major infrastructure projects. We've pivoted to investing in projects that build value around our extensive asset portfolio of refineries and logistics infrastructure.  As we think about long-term global crude demand, we believe that U.S. shale will be called upon to balance the markets, which will provide additional opportunities to create value in Midstream. 
We're finishing construction on several of our major projects. At Freeport, commissioning of 150,000 barrel per day LPG export terminal is underway, with our first cargoes expected to be shipped before year-end. Shipments will be a mix of term and spot cargoes. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline is nearing completion. While the project awaits the issuance of an easement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete work beneath the Missouri River, construction continues on the remaining segments of the pipeline.  DAPL and adjoining ETCOP pipeline, which is complete and ready for commissioning, are expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. Phillips 66 has a 25% interest in each of these joint ventures. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which are expected to be in service by year-end. The Beaumont Terminal continues to be a valuable asset, and we have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels.
Phillips 66 Partners remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. So far, this year, the partnership has raised more than $2 billion in the capital markets through debt and equity issuances, which it has used to significantly grow through asset acquisition and the development of organic projects. Partners remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compounded annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream has made good progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP has reduced its cost structure, decreased its capital spending and continues to convert commodity exposed contracts to a fee basis. We're pleased to see the improvements in our financial results, and we expect that DCP will be self-funded going further.
In Chemicals, global demand remains healthy. CPChem is advancing the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which is about 85% complete. We expect the polyethylene units to start by mid-2017 and the ethane cracker in the second half of 2017. Once these new facilities are in operation, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending will be reduced following the completion of the project, we expect to see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
In Refining this quarter, we completed the sale of the Whitegate refinery in Ireland and advanced several return-enhancing projects. At the Wood River Refinery, the debottlenecking and yield improvement projects were completed this quarter and increased the available heavy oil processing capacity. At the Billings Refinery, we're increasing the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And in Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing on schedule.
During the quarter, we generated nearly $1.2 billion in cash from operations and from a Phillips 66 Partners equity offering. We returned more than $500 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter. Since our company's formation, we've returned $12.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase or exchange of 120 million shares. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results."

Starting on Slide 4, third quarter net income was $511 million. We had several special items that netted to a loss of $45 million. In Chemicals, we had an $89 million impairment of a CPChem equity affiliate. We also received a legal award in the third quarter that increased Refining net income by $43 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $556 million or $1.05 per share. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $883 million and was reduced by a pension fund contribution of over $300 million. Excluding $339 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $544 million. In addition, PSXP raised nearly $300 million from an equity offering during the third quarter. 
Capital spending for the quarter was $661 million, with $365 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. 
Distributions to shareholders in the third quarter totaled $508 million, including $329 million in dividends and $179 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 21%. 
Year-to-date, annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 7%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 30%.
Slide 5 compares third quarter and second quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up by $57 million, driven by improvements in Midstream and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next, we'll cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing noncontrolling interest of $28 million, Midstream's third quarter adjusted earnings were $75 million, $36 million higher than the second quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $63 million, down $2 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs associated with seasonal maintenance and lower volumes due to refinery downtime. This was partially offset by higher equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline, which included the receipt of a $10 million settlement net to us. 
In NGL, adjusted earnings were $3 million for the quarter. This represented a $20 million increase from the prior quarter and was largely driven by higher earnings on seasonal trading and storage activity. 
Our share of adjusted earnings from DCP Midstream was $9 million in the third quarter, an $18 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to favorable contract restructuring efforts, lower costs, improved asset performance and higher natural gas prices.
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Third quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, the same as in the second quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings decreased by $5 million from the prior quarter, reflecting unplanned downtime. This was mostly offset by higher polyethylene chain margins. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $6 million on higher benzene margins. In Refining, we operated well with 97% crude utilization for the quarter. clean product yield was constant at 84%, with gasoline yield at 44% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $117 million, in line with guidance. Realized margin was $7.23 per barrel, roughly the same as in the second quarter. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $134 million, down $18 million from last quarter. Regionally, the Atlantic Basin and West Coast had lower earnings than last quarter, primarily due to lower market cracks. The Central Corridor had adjusted earnings that were $87 million higher than the second quarter, resulting from improved distillate cracks and benefits from higher margins from Canadian crude. And in the Gulf Coast, earnings were slightly lower than the second quarter due to increased costs related to planned maintenance activity. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9. Our worldwide realized margin for the third quarter was $7.23 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $12.96 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 56% compared to 52% in the second quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and their production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $2.94 per barrel were $0.47 per barrel lower this quarter, as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such is coke and NGLs decreased. Feedstock advantage was approximately $1 per barrel lower than the second quarter as crude differentials tightened further, especially the LLS Maya spread. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were lower than the second quarter due to improved product differentials and crude purchase timing, partially offset by higher RINs prices.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a strong third quarter. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the third quarter were $267 million, up $38 million from the second quarter. In marketing and other, the $29 million increase was largely due to increased margins in both the U.S. and Europe. The Ireland wholesale business was sold in September as part of the Whitegate refinery disposition. Specialties adjusted earnings increased by $9 million, primarily as a result of improved base oil margins and higher volumes at the XL joint venture. 
On Slide 11, Corporate and Other segment had adjusted after-tax net costs of $110 million this quarter, an improvement of $1 million from the second quarter.
Slide 12 shows year-to-date cash flow. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations for the first 3 quarters was $1.8 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $500 million. Phillips 66 Partners has raised approximately $1 billion in public equity offering through the third quarter. We have funded $2 billion of capital expenditures and investments. And year-to-date, we have distributed nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the third quarter with 521 million shares outstanding. 
At the end of September, our cash balance stood at $2.3 billion, up slightly from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. Earlier this month, PSXP raised $1.1 billion in the debt capital markets that will positively impact the fourth quarter cash balance. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items.
In the fourth quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-80s due to planned turnaround activity. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s, and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $170 million to $200 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $130 million and $140 million after tax, due in part to increased interest expense from the recently issued PSXP notes. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
We're that, we'll now open the line for questions."

So I think, we feel pretty comfortable within that context. If I could just add on to that. So as move into '17, I think, there's a couple of things. One is capital certainly has come down this year. We're guiding to something under $3 billion in 2017. At CPChem, as we finish up the cracker and these big projects, we get the benefit of that.

And so I think if we readjust going to the fourth quarter, probably not as much incentive as there was last year to continue to produce the higher rates in what in the northern hemisphere is a seasonally weak time. so I think going constructively, continue to get those inventories down's required, both on the crude and products side, to structurally change that. And then I think seasonally, you should expect as the U.S. demand really, you look out, distillate looks good right now in terms of carry, still not a strong crack. gasoline weaker than it has been. And I think that reflects what we see as a seasonally normal driving season. And the real piece of it get good turnarounds right now. Those come out.

So when I think of the planned downtime at CPChem in the third quarter, wondering if that leak into the third quarter or was it ring fenced?

Third quarter results reflect the benefit of our diversified downstream portfolio and our continued strong operating performance in a challenging market. While Refining was again impacted by difficult market conditions, Marketing and Specialties and Chemicals performed well. And we delivered total adjusted earnings of $556 million or $1.05 per share. 
During the quarter, market cracks narrowed further, crude differentials tightened, and crude and NGL prices remained depressed. We operated safely. We ran our assets well, and our industry-leading safety metrics for the year are the best we've ever achieved. We're holding our costs flat. 
We're continuing to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We recently lowered capital guidance to approximately $3 billion for 2016 and expect our 2017 capital budget to be below $3 billion. We are growing our higher-value businesses and are focused on high-return, value-enhancing projects. We're executing well on our projects under construction and we remain confident that our growth strategy will create value for our shareholders.
We target a long-term 60-40 split between reinvestment and distributions. We expect the free cash flow generated from operations and proceeds from Phillips 66 Partners capital market access to be sufficient to fund our growth program and distributions to our shareholders. We remain committed to a growing, secure and competitive dividend as well as $1 billion to $2 billion per year of share repurchases.
In Midstream, lower energy prices and narrow differentials have reduced the need for major infrastructure projects. We've pivoted to investing in projects that build value around our extensive asset portfolio of refineries and logistics infrastructure.  As we think about long-term global crude demand, we believe that U.S. shale will be called upon to balance the markets, which will provide additional opportunities to create value in Midstream. 
We're finishing construction on several of our major projects. At Freeport, commissioning of 150,000 barrel per day LPG export terminal is underway, with our first cargoes expected to be shipped before year-end. Shipments will be a mix of term and spot cargoes. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline is nearing completion. While the project awaits the issuance of an easement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete work beneath the Missouri River, construction continues on the remaining segments of the pipeline.  DAPL and adjoining ETCOP pipeline, which is complete and ready for commissioning, are expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. Phillips 66 has a 25% interest in each of these joint ventures. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which are expected to be in service by year-end. The Beaumont Terminal continues to be a valuable asset, and we have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels.
Phillips 66 Partners remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. So far, this year, the partnership has raised more than $2 billion in the capital markets through debt and equity issuances, which it has used to significantly grow through asset acquisition and the development of organic projects. Partners remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compounded annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream has made good progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP has reduced its cost structure, decreased its capital spending and continues to convert commodity exposed contracts to a fee basis. We're pleased to see the improvements in our financial results, and we expect that DCP will be self-funded going further.
In Chemicals, global demand remains healthy. CPChem is advancing the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which is about 85% complete. We expect the polyethylene units to start by mid-2017 and the ethane cracker in the second half of 2017. Once these new facilities are in operation, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending will be reduced following the completion of the project, we expect to see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
In Refining this quarter, we completed the sale of the Whitegate refinery in Ireland and advanced several return-enhancing projects. At the Wood River Refinery, the debottlenecking and yield improvement projects were completed this quarter and increased the available heavy oil processing capacity. At the Billings Refinery, we're increasing the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And in Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing on schedule.
During the quarter, we generated nearly $1.2 billion in cash from operations and from a Phillips 66 Partners equity offering. We returned more than $500 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter. Since our company's formation, we've returned $12.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase or exchange of 120 million shares. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results."

Starting on Slide 4, third quarter net income was $511 million. We had several special items that netted to a loss of $45 million. In Chemicals, we had an $89 million impairment of a CPChem equity affiliate. We also received a legal award in the third quarter that increased Refining net income by $43 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $556 million or $1.05 per share. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $883 million and was reduced by a pension fund contribution of over $300 million. Excluding $339 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $544 million. In addition, PSXP raised nearly $300 million from an equity offering during the third quarter. 
Capital spending for the quarter was $661 million, with $365 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. 
Distributions to shareholders in the third quarter totaled $508 million, including $329 million in dividends and $179 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 21%. 
Year-to-date, annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 7%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 30%.
Slide 5 compares third quarter and second quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up by $57 million, driven by improvements in Midstream and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next, we'll cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing noncontrolling interest of $28 million, Midstream's third quarter adjusted earnings were $75 million, $36 million higher than the second quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $63 million, down $2 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs associated with seasonal maintenance and lower volumes due to refinery downtime. This was partially offset by higher equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline, which included the receipt of a $10 million settlement net to us. 
In NGL, adjusted earnings were $3 million for the quarter. This represented a $20 million increase from the prior quarter and was largely driven by higher earnings on seasonal trading and storage activity. 
Our share of adjusted earnings from DCP Midstream was $9 million in the third quarter, an $18 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to favorable contract restructuring efforts, lower costs, improved asset performance and higher natural gas prices.
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Third quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, the same as in the second quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings decreased by $5 million from the prior quarter, reflecting unplanned downtime. This was mostly offset by higher polyethylene chain margins. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $6 million on higher benzene margins. In Refining, we operated well with 97% crude utilization for the quarter. clean product yield was constant at 84%, with gasoline yield at 44% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $117 million, in line with guidance. Realized margin was $7.23 per barrel, roughly the same as in the second quarter. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $134 million, down $18 million from last quarter. Regionally, the Atlantic Basin and West Coast had lower earnings than last quarter, primarily due to lower market cracks. The Central Corridor had adjusted earnings that were $87 million higher than the second quarter, resulting from improved distillate cracks and benefits from higher margins from Canadian crude. And in the Gulf Coast, earnings were slightly lower than the second quarter due to increased costs related to planned maintenance activity. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9. Our worldwide realized margin for the third quarter was $7.23 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $12.96 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 56% compared to 52% in the second quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and their production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $2.94 per barrel were $0.47 per barrel lower this quarter, as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such is coke and NGLs decreased. Feedstock advantage was approximately $1 per barrel lower than the second quarter as crude differentials tightened further, especially the LLS Maya spread. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were lower than the second quarter due to improved product differentials and crude purchase timing, partially offset by higher RINs prices.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a strong third quarter. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the third quarter were $267 million, up $38 million from the second quarter. In marketing and other, the $29 million increase was largely due to increased margins in both the U.S. and Europe. The Ireland wholesale business was sold in September as part of the Whitegate refinery disposition. Specialties adjusted earnings increased by $9 million, primarily as a result of improved base oil margins and higher volumes at the XL joint venture. 
On Slide 11, Corporate and Other segment had adjusted after-tax net costs of $110 million this quarter, an improvement of $1 million from the second quarter.
Slide 12 shows year-to-date cash flow. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations for the first 3 quarters was $1.8 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $500 million. Phillips 66 Partners has raised approximately $1 billion in public equity offering through the third quarter. We have funded $2 billion of capital expenditures and investments. And year-to-date, we have distributed nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the third quarter with 521 million shares outstanding. 
At the end of September, our cash balance stood at $2.3 billion, up slightly from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. Earlier this month, PSXP raised $1.1 billion in the debt capital markets that will positively impact the fourth quarter cash balance. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items.
In the fourth quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-80s due to planned turnaround activity. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s, and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $170 million to $200 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $130 million and $140 million after tax, due in part to increased interest expense from the recently issued PSXP notes. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
We're that, we'll now open the line for questions."

So I think, we feel pretty comfortable within that context. If I could just add on to that. So as move into '17, I think, there's a couple of things. One is capital certainly has come down this year. We're guiding to something under $3 billion in 2017. At CPChem, as we finish up the cracker and these big projects, we get the benefit of that. We get the incremental earnings coming off of these projects. And so we think free cash flow actually starts to build into '17."

But the challenge has been as energy prices have -- the dips have narrowed really around the world, the arbs on those have come in substantially. So in the short term, I think, we still see good demand. I feel good about that.

I think, fundamentally, we just look at the market. And I've seen -- recently, you've seen both crude and product inventories in the U.S. start to come down.

And I've seen -- recently, you've seen both crude and product inventories in the U.S. start to come down. That's encouraging, but it's got a long way to go would be our view. So we think that fundamentally keeps kind of a weaker outlook when you think about the product and the crude spread and the crack margin on the business. And the other comment I'd make is if you look at the forward curves, it's different than last year, you're seeing less carry. And so I think that if we readjust going into the fourth quarter, probably not as much incentive as there was last year to continue to produce the higher rates in the northern hemisphere is a seasonally weak time. So I think, going constructively, continue to get those inventories down is required, both on the crude and the products side to structurally change that. And then, I think, seasonally, you should expect that as the U.S. demand really, you look out, distillate looks pretty good right now in terms of carry, still not a strong crack. Gasoline weaker than it has been. And I think that reflects what we'd see as a seasonally normal driving season. And the real outlet piece of this is you get turnarounds right now, those come out, and then, you've got to turn to export markets to absorb the excess, or there will be some type of utilization decrease to balance the markets, but that's really what's required is more balancing."

Third quarter results reflect the benefit of our diversified downstream portfolio and our continued strong operating performance in a challenging market. While Refining was again impacted by difficult market conditions, Marketing and Specialties and Chemicals performed well. And we delivered total adjusted earnings of $556 million or $1.05 per share. 
During the quarter, market cracks narrowed further, crude differentials tightened and crude and NGL prices remained depressed. We operated safely. We ran our assets well, and our industry-leading safety metrics for the year are the best we've ever achieved. We're holding our costs flat. 
We're continuing to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We recently lowered capital guidance to approximately $3 billion for 2016 and expect our 2017 capital budget to be below $3 billion. We are growing our higher-value businesses and are focused on high-return, value-enhancing projects. We're executing well on our projects under construction and we remain confident that our growth strategy will create value for our shareholders.
We target a long-term 60-40 split between reinvestment and distributions. We expect the free cash flow generated from operations and proceeds from Phillips 66 Partners' capital market access to be sufficient to fund our growth program and distributions to our shareholders. We remain committed to a growing, secure and competitive dividend as well as $1 billion to $2 billion per year of share repurchases.
In Midstream, lower energy prices and narrow differentials have reduced the need for major infrastructure projects. We've pivoted to investing in projects that build value around our extensive asset portfolio of refineries and logistics infrastructure.  As we think about long-term global crude demand, we believe that U.S. shale will be called upon to balance the markets, which will provide additional opportunities to create value in Midstream. 
We're finishing construction on several of our major projects. At Freeport, commissioning of the 150,000 barrel per day LPG export terminal is underway, with our first cargoes expected to be shipped before year-end. Shipments will be a mix of term and spot cargoes. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline is nearing completion. While the project awaits the issuance of an easement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete work beneath the Missouri River, construction continues on the remaining segments of the pipeline. DAPL and adjoining ETCOP pipeline, which is complete and ready for commissioning, are expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. Phillips 66 has a 25% interest in each of these joint ventures. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which are expected to be in service by year-end. The Beaumont Terminal continues to be a valuable asset, and we have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels.
Phillips 66 Partners remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. So far, this year, the partnership has raised more than $2 billion in the capital markets through debt and equity issuances, which it has used to significantly grow through asset acquisition and the development of organic projects. Partners remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compounded annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream has made good progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP has reduced its cost structure, decreased its capital spending and continues to convert commodity exposed contracts to a fee basis. We're pleased to see the improvements in our financial results, and we expect that DCP will be self-funded going further.
In Chemicals, global demand remains healthy. CPChem is advancing the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which is about 85% complete. We expect the polyethylene units to start up by mid-2017 and the ethane cracker in the second half of 2017. Once these new facilities are in operation, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending will be reduced following the completion of the project, we expect to see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
In Refining this quarter, we completed the sale of the Whitegate refinery in Ireland and advanced several return-enhancing projects. At the Wood River Refinery, the debottlenecking and yield improvement projects were completed this quarter and increased the available heavy oil processing capacity. At the Billings Refinery, we're increasing the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And in Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing on schedule.
During the quarter, we generated nearly $1.2 billion in cash from operations and from a Phillips 66 Partners equity offering. We returned more than $500 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter. Since our company's formation, we've returned $12.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase or exchange of 120 million shares. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results."

We had several special items that netted to a loss of $45 million. In Chemicals, we had an $89 million impairment of a CPChem equity affiliate. We also received a legal award in the third quarter that increased Refining net income by $43 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $556 million or $1.05 per share. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $883 million and was reduced by a pension fund contribution of over $300 million. Excluding $339 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $544 million. In addition, PSXP raised nearly $300 million from an equity offering during the third quarter. 
Capital spending for the quarter was $661 million, with $365 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. 
Distributions to shareholders in the third quarter totaled $508 million, including $329 million in dividends and $179 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 21%. 
Year-to-date, annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 7%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 30%.
Slide 5 compares third quarter and second quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up by $57 million, driven by improvements in Midstream and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next, we'll cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing noncontrolling interest of $28 million, Midstream's third quarter adjusted earnings were $75 million, $36 million higher than the second quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $63 million, down $2 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs associated with seasonal maintenance and lower volumes due to refinery downtime. This was partially offset by higher equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline, which included the receipt of a $10 million settlement net to us. 
In NGL, adjusted earnings were $3 million for the quarter. This represented a $20 million increase from the prior quarter and was largely driven by higher earnings on seasonal trading and storage activity. 
Our share of adjusted earnings from DCP Midstream was $9 million in the third quarter, an $18 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to favorable contract restructuring efforts, lower costs, improved asset performance and higher natural gas prices.
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Third quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, the same as in the second quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings decreased by $5 million from the prior quarter, reflecting unplanned downtime. This was mostly offset by higher polyethylene chain margins. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $6 million on higher benzene margins. 
In Refining, we operated well with 97% crude utilization for the quarter. Clean product yield was constant at 84%, with gasoline yield at 44% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $117 million, in line with guidance. Realized margin was $7.23 per barrel, roughly the same as in the second quarter. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $134 million, down $18 million from last quarter. Regionally, the Atlantic Basin and West Coast had lower earnings than last quarter, primarily due to lower market cracks. The Central Corridor had adjusted earnings that were $87 million higher than the second quarter, resulting from improved distillate cracks and benefits from higher margins on Canadian crude. And in the Gulf Coast, earnings were slightly lower than the second quarter due to increased costs related to planned maintenance activity. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9. Our worldwide realized margin for the third quarter was $7.23 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $12.96 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 56% compared to 52% in the second quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and their production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $2.94 per barrel were $0.47 per barrel lower this quarter, as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs decreased. Feedstock advantage was approximately $1 per barrel lower than the second quarter as crude differentials tightened further, especially the LLS-Maya spread. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were lower than the second quarter due to improved product differentials and crude purchase timing, partially offset by higher RINs prices.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a strong third quarter. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the third quarter were $267 million, up $38 million from the second quarter. In marketing and other, the $29 million increase was largely due to increased margins in both the U.S. and Europe. The Ireland wholesale business was sold in September as part of the Whitegate refinery disposition. Specialties adjusted earnings increased by $9 million, primarily as a result of improved base oil margins and higher volumes at the XL joint venture. 
On Slide 11, Corporate and Other segment had adjusted after-tax net costs of $110 million this quarter, an improvement of $1 million from the second quarter.
Slide 12 shows year-to-date cash flow. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations for the first 3 quarters was $1.8 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $500 million. Phillips 66 Partners has raised approximately $1 billion in public equity offering through the third quarter. We have funded $2 billion of capital expenditures and investments. And year-to-date, we have distributed nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the third quarter with 521 million shares outstanding. 
At the end of September, our cash balance stood at $2.3 billion, up slightly from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. Earlier this month, PSXP raised $1.1 billion in the debt capital markets that will positively impact the fourth quarter cash balance. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items.
In the fourth quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-80s due to planned turnaround activity. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s, and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $170 million to $200 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $130 million and $140 million after tax, due in part to increased interest expense from the recently issued PSXP notes. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

So I think we feel pretty comfortable within that context. If I could just add on to that. So as move into '17, I think there's a couple of things. One is capital certainly has come down this year.

First of all, I think that the work the DCP has done to reduce our cost structure to cash break-even, they dropped it from kind of $0.60 per gallon NGL somewhere below $0.35 a gallon NGL. So you're seeing that benefit show up. NGL prices quarter-on-quarter actually are just a little bit lower, but natural gas prices were up about $0.80 or so, $0.89, I think. And so that was a benefit to DCC. So you had a combination effect of lower cost plus good throughput volumes and then kind of neutral on NGL prices, a little better on gas prices."

So we think that fundamentally keeps kind of a weaker outlook when you think about the product and the crude spread and the crack margin on the business, so. And the other comment I'd make is if you look at the forward curves, it's different than last year, you're seeing less carry. And so I think that we readjust it going into the fourth quarter, probably not as much incentive as there was last year to continue to produce the higher rates in the northern hemisphere is a seasonally weak time. So I think, going constructively, continue to get those inventories down is required, both on the crude and the products side to structurally change that. And then, I think, seasonally, you should expect that as the U.S. demand really, you look out, distillate looks pretty good right now in terms of carry, still not a strong crack. Gasoline weaker than it has been. And I think that reflects what we'd see as a seasonally normal driving season.

Third quarter results reflect the benefit of our diversified downstream portfolio and our continued strong operating performance in a challenging market. While Refining was again impacted by difficult market conditions, Marketing and Specialties and Chemicals performed well. And we delivered total adjusted earnings of $556 million or $1.05 per share. 
During the quarter, market cracks narrowed further, crude differentials tightened and crude and NGL prices remained depressed. We operated safely. We ran our assets well, and our industry-leading safety metrics for the year are the best we've ever achieved. We're holding our costs flat. 
We're continuing to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We recently lowered capital guidance to approximately $3 billion for 2016 and expect our 2017 capital budget to be below $3 billion. We are growing our higher-value businesses and are focused on high-return, value-enhancing projects. We're executing well on our projects under construction and we remain confident that our growth strategy will create value for our shareholders.
We target a long-term 60-40 split between reinvestment and distributions. We expect the free cash flow generated from operations and proceeds from Phillips 66 Partners' capital market access to be sufficient to fund our growth program and distributions to our shareholders. We remain committed to a growing, secure and competitive dividend as well as $1 billion to $2 billion per year of share repurchases.
In Midstream, lower energy prices and narrow differentials have reduced the need for major infrastructure projects. We've pivoted to investing in projects that build value around our extensive asset portfolio of refineries and logistics infrastructure.  As we think about long-term global crude demand, we believe that U.S. shale will be called upon to balance the markets, which will provide additional opportunities to create value in Midstream. 
We're finishing construction on several of our major projects. At Freeport, commissioning of the 150,000 barrel per day LPG export terminal is underway, with our first cargoes expected to be shipped before year-end. Shipments will be a mix of term and spot cargoes. 
The Dakota Access Pipeline is nearing completion. While the project awaits the issuance of an easement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to complete work beneath the Missouri River, construction continues on the remaining segments of the pipeline. DAPL and adjoining ETCOP pipeline, which is complete and ready for commissioning, are expected to provide the most economic option for moving Bakken crude to the Gulf Coast. Phillips 66 has a 25% interest in each of these joint ventures. 
In the Gulf Coast, the Beaumont Terminal expansion is ongoing. We have 3.2 million barrels of new storage capacity under construction, 2 million of which are expected to be in service by year-end. The Beaumont Terminal continues to be a valuable asset, and we have plans to ultimately expand this facility to 16 million barrels.
Phillips 66 Partners remains an important part of our Midstream growth strategy. So far, this year, the partnership has raised more than $2 billion in the capital markets through debt and equity issuances, which it has used to significantly grow through asset acquisition and the development of organic projects. Partners remains on track to achieve its growth objective of a 5-year 30% distribution compounded annual growth rate through 2018. 
DCP Midstream has made good progress on its strategic initiatives. DCP has reduced its cost structure, decreased its capital spending and continues to convert commodity exposed contracts to a fee basis. We're pleased to see the improvements in our financial results, and we expect that DCP will be self-funded going further.
In Chemicals, global demand remains healthy. CPChem is advancing the U.S. Gulf Coast Petrochemicals Project, which is about 85% complete. We expect the polyethylene units to start up by mid-2017 and the ethane cracker in the second half of 2017. Once these new facilities are in operation, CPChem's global ethylene and polyethylene capacity will increase by approximately 1/3. As capital spending will be reduced following the completion of the project, we expect to see increased distributions from CPChem starting next year.
In Refining this quarter, we completed the sale of the Whitegate refinery in Ireland and advanced several return-enhancing projects. At the Wood River Refinery, the debottlenecking and yield improvement projects were completed this quarter and increased the available heavy oil processing capacity. At the Billings Refinery, we're increasing the amount of heavy Canadian crude we can run to 100%. And in Bayway, work on the FCC modernization is progressing on schedule.
During the quarter, we generated nearly $1.2 billion in cash from operations and from a Phillips 66 Partners equity offering. We returned more than $500 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter. Since our company's formation, we've returned $12.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase or exchange of 120 million shares. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Mitchell to review the quarter results."

We had several special items that netted to a loss of $45 million. In Chemicals, we had an $89 million impairment of a CPChem equity affiliate. We also received a legal award in the third quarter that increased Refining net income by $43 million. After removing these items, adjusted earnings were $556 million or $1.05 per share. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $883 million and was reduced by a pension fund contribution of over $300 million. Excluding $339 million of working capital benefit, operating cash flow was $544 million. In addition, PSXP raised nearly $300 million from an equity offering during the third quarter. 
Capital spending for the quarter was $661 million, with $365 million spent on growth, mostly in Midstream. 
Distributions to shareholders in the third quarter totaled $508 million, including $329 million in dividends and $179 million in share repurchases. 
At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-capital ratio was 27%. And after taking into account our ending cash balance, our net debt-to-capital ratio was 21%. 
Year-to-date, annualized adjusted return on capital employed was 7%. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 30%.
Slide 5 compares third quarter and second quarter adjusted earnings by segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were up by $57 million, driven by improvements in Midstream and Marketing and Specialties. 
Next, we'll cover each of the segments individually. I'll start with Midstream on Slide 6. After removing noncontrolling interest of $28 million, Midstream's third quarter adjusted earnings were $75 million, $36 million higher than the second quarter. Transportation adjusted earnings for the quarter were $63 million, down $2 million from the prior quarter, driven by higher operating costs associated with seasonal maintenance and lower volumes due to refinery downtime. This was partially offset by higher equity earnings from Rockies Express pipeline, which included the receipt of a $10 million settlement net to us. 
In NGL, adjusted earnings were $3 million for the quarter. This represented a $20 million increase from the prior quarter and was largely driven by higher earnings on seasonal trading and storage activity. 
Our share of adjusted earnings from DCP Midstream was $9 million in the third quarter, an $18 million improvement compared to the previous quarter. This was primarily due to favorable contract restructuring efforts, lower costs, improved asset performance and higher natural gas prices.
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Third quarter adjusted earnings for the segment were $190 million, the same as in the second quarter. In olefins and polyolefins, adjusted earnings decreased by $5 million from the prior quarter, reflecting unplanned downtime. This was mostly offset by higher polyethylene chain margins. Global O&P utilization was 91%. Adjusted earnings for SA&S increased by $6 million on higher benzene margins. 
In Refining, we operated well with 97% crude utilization for the quarter. Clean product yield was constant at 84%, with gasoline yield at 44% for the quarter. Pretax turnaround costs were $117 million, in line with guidance. Realized margin was $7.23 per barrel, roughly the same as in the second quarter. 
The chart on Slide 8 provides a regional view of the change in adjusted earnings compared to the previous quarter. In total, the Refining segment had adjusted earnings of $134 million, down $18 million from last quarter. Regionally, the Atlantic Basin and West Coast had lower earnings than last quarter, primarily due to lower market cracks. The Central Corridor had adjusted earnings that were $87 million higher than the second quarter, resulting from improved distillate cracks and benefits from higher margins on Canadian crude. And in the Gulf Coast, earnings were slightly lower than the second quarter due to increased costs related to planned maintenance activity. 
Next, we will cover market capture on Slide 9. Our worldwide realized margin for the third quarter was $7.23 per barrel versus the 3:2:1 market crack of $12.96 per barrel, resulting in an overall market capture of 56% compared to 52% in the second quarter. Market capture is impacted in part by the configuration of our refineries and their production relative to the market crack calculation. With 84% clean product yield for the quarter, we made less gasoline and slightly more distillate than premised in the 3:2:1 market crack. Losses from secondary products of $2.94 per barrel were $0.47 per barrel lower this quarter, as the price differential between crude oil and lower valued products such as coke and NGLs decreased. Feedstock advantage was approximately $1 per barrel lower than the second quarter as crude differentials tightened further, especially the LLS-Maya spread. The other category mainly includes costs associated with RINs, outgoing freight, product differentials and inventory impacts. These costs were lower than the second quarter due to improved product differentials and crude purchase timing, partially offset by higher RINs prices.
Let's move to Marketing and Specialties where we posted a strong third quarter. Adjusted earnings for M&S in the third quarter were $267 million, up $38 million from the second quarter. In marketing and other, the $29 million increase was largely due to increased margins in both the U.S. and Europe. The Ireland wholesale business was sold in September as part of the Whitegate refinery disposition. Specialties adjusted earnings increased by $9 million, primarily as a result of improved base oil margins and higher volumes at the XL joint venture. 
On Slide 11, Corporate and Other segment had adjusted after-tax net costs of $110 million this quarter, an improvement of $1 million from the second quarter.
Slide 12 shows year-to-date cash flow. We began the year with a cash balance of $3.1 billion. Excluding working capital impacts, cash from operations for the first 3 quarters was $1.8 billion. Working capital changes increased cash flow by $500 million. Phillips 66 Partners has raised approximately $1 billion in public equity offering through the third quarter. We have funded $2 billion of capital expenditures and investments. And year-to-date, we have distributed nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We ended the third quarter with 521 million shares outstanding. 
At the end of September, our cash balance stood at $2.3 billion, up slightly from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. Earlier this month, PSXP raised $1.1 billion in the debt capital markets that will positively impact the fourth quarter cash balance. 
This concludes my review of the financial and operational results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items.
In the fourth quarter, in Chemicals, we expect the global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-80s due to planned turnaround activity. In Refining, we expect the worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low 90s, and before-tax turnaround expenses to be between $170 million to $200 million. We expect Corporate and Other costs to come in between $130 million and $140 million after tax, due in part to increased interest expense from the recently issued PSXP notes. And company-wide, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the mid-30s. 
With that, we'll now open the line for questions."

We're guiding to something under $3 billion in 2017. At CPChem, as we finish up the cracker and these big projects, we get the benefit of that. We get the incremental earnings coming off on these projects. And so we think free cash flow actually starts to build into '17."

And the other comment I'd make is if you look at the forward curves, it's different than last year, you're seeing less carry. And so I think that we readjust it going into the fourth quarter, probably not as much incentive as there was last year to continue to produce the higher rates in the northern hemisphere is a seasonally weak time. So I think, going constructively, continue to get those inventories down is required, both on the crude and the products side to structurally change that. And then, I think, seasonally, you should expect that as the U.S. demand really, you look out, distillate looks pretty good right now in terms of carry, still not a strong crack. Gasoline weaker than it has been. And I think that reflects what we'd see as a seasonally normal driving season.

Maybe as an aside, we've actually seen similar patterns in Europe through our German retail operations or Central Europe operations. So it does -- it has been a response on the price side to demand really across the world."
