Our results demonstrate our solid fundamentals and that we are managing all key operational aspects of the business. 
I'll start with a few remarks on our financial highlights leaving the details for Michele and then get to the operating highlights. Our total sales in the fourth quarter increased by 5.1%, which was significantly higher than the jewelry market as a whole. We not only gain share, we gain profitable market share. 
Signet comp sales increased by 4.9%, which among the fastest growth of any U.S. retailers. Due to strong top line and prudent management of our expenses, our operating margin expanded by nearly 200 basis points and our earnings per share were up about 20% as well. Earings growth was also among the top of the industry. 
While delivering a terrific fourth quarter, we also set the table for growth into the future. Our synergies from the Zale acquisition are playing faster than we first expected. We delivered $60 million of synergies in fiscal 2016, above previous expectations and we raised our multiyear synergy guidance. I'll get to those details in a couple of minutes. 
Next, I'd like to discuss the sales drivers of the fourth quarter. The variety of related and overlapping initiatives that drove the fourth quarter performance, which included innovative merchandising, cross-selling, engaging marketing and solid store execution with superior customer service. 
Results were led by our Ever Us program, which is our most talked about new jewelry collection which is offered across all of our national brands and leverages our scale in the jewelry industry. We use our customer knowledge and our expertise in jewelry design to develop an innovative 2 stone diamond ring collection with marketing that appeal to a broad range of customers celebrating life and expressing love. As for the future, the Ever collection is now testing line extensions for the Christmas of 2016, and we hope to highlight these innovations as the year progresses. 
Earrings as well as bracelets, many of which innovative systems were attached were also very successful in the fourth quarter. And bridal also grew in the fourth quarter. It's important to note that bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Bridal brands such as Vera Wang LOVE, Neil Lane, Tolkowsky and the Forever diamond, which is exclusively sold in the our H.Samuel stores led the way. 
Marking initiatives such as our new television creative did very well. We applied learnings from our customer segmentation study, especially around Zales and Jared and increased our advertising ways. This merchandise living in the form of compelling stores which really resonated with our customers. A few comments on the drivers of our leading store banners. Kay Jewelers led the way with a 7.4% comp sales increase and a 9% growth in total sales. The strong performance on top of last year's performance reflects a 2-year comp increase of 12%. Zales lured very strong results, driven by Ever Us and Bridal. [indiscernible] results were driven by gold, diamonds and related jewelry. And Ernest Jones continues momentum driven principally by diamond fashion and bridal jewelry as well as prestige watches. 
And lastly, the store operation processes that enhance Zales and Jared in the third quarter appeared to help the fourth quarter results as well. Our team members have embraced change and we're very pleased with our store execution. Our business performance since our holiday sales call resulted in a strong finish to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. The momentum continuing into the first quarter giving us confidence in what promises to be a strong fiscal 2017, which is reflected in our quarterly and our annual guidance. Since the holiday sales calls, there's been a disconnect between our track record of strong financial results and our strategy for long-term success and the external market perception of valuation. As such, we decided to prerelease our fourth quarter results. 
We reiterate our capital allocation strategy with an aggressive buyback policy that will allow us to take advantage of what we view us a significant buying opportunity. We also considerably increased our dividend to reflect our strong flat cash flows, and reward our loyal shareholders. The demonstration of our long-term commitment that the executive management has in Signet's business, the board approved and fully supported by executive management an increased level of share ownership requirements. We raised our synergy guidance due to significant progress of integrating Zale within Signet. Initiatives are delivering favorable results faster than we first believe, and we have pipeline of work streams from which we deliver our numbers over the next 2 years. So let's take a look at those numbers for a second. 
As a result of the Zale acquisition, Signet will realize significant operating profit synergies. We increased our net synergies target to a range of $225 million to $250 million, which is nearly a 50% increase. Of the synergies remaining the next 2 years, we expect to realize 70% by January in 2017 driven principally by gross margin and operating expense synergies. We increased our expectation because we now have been operating Zales through 2 holiday season and have much more confidence in the operations. 
We have a larger pipelines initiatives, more of them are working and they're working faster. Some of the beginning states that have been going on or will go on this year include product sourcing, indirect material procurement, discount controls, promotions and event coordination, cross-selling extended service plans, labor skilled, TV and media efficiency, improve jewelry and much, much more. It's very important to note that our synergies are been realized in all of our businesses and all of our divisions, in multiple line of our income statement and will favorably affect the financial performance of Signet for years to come. 
So let me give you a couple of examples. When you think about our Ever Us collection that was so successful this past quarter, it did largely well because the credibility built by being sold in each of our national store banners or our repair business, which has been generating incremental profit because of our process changes, our in-sourcing, our technology upgrades and other factors and this phased in approach -- this is a phased-in approach will favorably impact sales and operating expenses for years to come. 
By many message is we're running Signet as 1 company, not a preacquisition entity and a new one. We are improving trend results the running our overall business better. 
With that, I'd like to talk about last year. It was an outstanding year for Signet and I want to take a moment just to review some of the notable accomplishments in fiscal 2016. We've made significant strides in transforming Signet from a company composed of 3 divisions with redundant infrastructure into 1 company supported by leaders who manage each functional area across the entire company. We delivered over $6.5 billion in sales, up over 14%. We were added to prestigious S&P 500 Index. We made important strides in cross-selling our powerful brands, such as Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane bridal to increase their profiles. We introduced Ever Us, arguably one of the most significant innovations in the jewelry industry in years. Innovation in watches and fitness around the industry essentially activates a risk as a more high profile part of the body to accessorize. In response, Signet successfully sold bracelets with innovative fastening as well as our core watch brands such as and Citizen. 
After researching several ways that we can go about improving Zales repair business, we committed to a primary method whereby our Jared design and repair service centers will handle the vast majority of the volume. This change is newly underway and off to a very good start. 
We deployed learnings from our customer segmentation study into marketing, store design and selling techniques. Several synergy around gross margin contributed and we have a lot of runway left to go. We manage brands well successfully expanding merchandise lines led by Diamonds and Rhythm. Our store design team had several wins extending testing new store concept for Zales, Jared and Piercing Pagoda. 
We elevated the efficiency and the effectiveness of our omni-channel approach to selling through greater personalization and customization, along with targeted digital marketing. We made significant enhancements to our selling process at Jared and Zales, which we believe improve their guest experiences. We gain significant market share profitably and expanded our operating margins along the way. And lastly, we elevated our capital very intelligently, increasing the dividend, repurchasing stock and maintaining liquidity and balance sheet strength. And everything that we're doing operationally is meant to maximize earnings per share growth for our shareholders, which we achieved by getting over 20% this year. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Michele to take a look at the financials."
693964,318928183,955619,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2016",2016-03-24,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our fourth quarter results performance. Signet's comps increased 4.9% on top of a 4.2% comp increase in the prior year fourth quarter.

Signet's comps increased 4.9% on top of a 4.2% comp increase in the prior year fourth quarter. Total sales increased 5.1% and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 6.4% for the quarter. 
Now looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 6.9% to $1.45 billion, which included a comp increase of 5%. Sales increases were driven by particular strength in diamond fashion jewelry, including Ever Us, diamond earrings and bracelets. This merchandise mix is droving higher average transaction value of 6% with a decline in the number of transactions of 2.3%. 
Innovative collections typically with higher ATV, such as our Ever Us, sold faster and gain relative share within our portfolio. The Zales jewelry operating segment total sales increased by 2.2% to $577 million and 5.2% on a constant currency exchange basis. 
On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 6.3% and cost increased by 5.4%. Our Canadian sales declined 15.8% and 0.4% on a constant currency basis with comp sales decline of 0.8%. Canada sales were impacted primarily by the Western region of Canada where lower oil and gas prices lead to a recession earlier this year. 
Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and bridal. Now similar Sterling, this merchandise mix of drove a higher transaction value of 6.2% with a decline of 2.1% in the number of transactions. 
Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 8.3% to $78 million with comp sales of 6.4%. Sales increases were driven by gold and diamond jewelry and this merchandise mix of drove a 10% increase in average transaction value, while transaction count declined 2.7%. 
Looking at our U.K. In U.K., our total sales increased 1.7% to $283 million or 5.9% at constant currency rate and included a comp sales increase of 4.7%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases, which also drove a higher average transaction value of 3.7%. The number of transactions increased by 1.1%, driven by diamond jewelry and [indiscernible]. 
So moving on to sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated Q4 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results. 
So on Slide 10, the table provides the reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction costs, which includes our integration-related expenses. Starting on the right side of the slide, on a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.42 per share, representing a 20.4% increase over prior year EPS of $2.84. The next [indiscernible] reflects our transaction and integration costs. These costs relate to consulting costs for integration, an acceleration of severance costs of $7.1 million in Q4 related to organization changes that will benefit FY '17 and beyond and an acceleration of information technology costs of $3.7 million in Q4 related to implementation costs associated with global systems that will also drive future synergies. 
In total, transaction and integration costs were responsible for $0.15 of EPS dilution. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue and amortization of unfavorable contracts were diluted to EPS by $0.06. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.6% or 100 basis points lower than prior year. Our annual effective tax rate was 28.9% or 60 basis points lower than the prior year rate of 29.5%. And on an adjusted Signet basis, which is the far most left column, EPS was $3.63, an increase of 18.6% over last year. 
Looking below the sales line at Signet adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was a little over $1 billion or 42.6% of adjusted sales. That rate was up 170 basis points to last year due primarily to synergies, favorable commodity cost and leverage on store occupancy costs. Our rates continues to benefit from synergy-related initiatives that includes discount controls, extended service plans, vendor terms and other growth margin enhancing programs. 
Sterling Jewelers gross margins increased by 120 basis points and that was due to improve merchandise margins related to favorable commodity cost and leverage in-store occupancy. The Zales division adjusted gross margin rate increased 270 basis points due primarily realization of synergies that favorably impacted merchandise margins, distribution costs, store operating costs and occupancy. U.K. gross margin increased 80 basis points due primarily to store occupancy leverage. 
Adjusted SG&A was $666 million or 27.8% of adjusted sales compared to $629 million or 27.5% of sales in the prior year. The increase of $37 million in SG&A was driven by higher advertising of $7 million, higher store staff cost of $11 million associated with higher sales volume and higher central costs. The increase in central costs was driven by higher recuring I/T expense, higher levels of depreciation, investments in product research and development and standardization of employee compensation among North America. 
From a rate perspective, the higher central costs were partially offset by leverage on advertising and store payroll resulting in an increase of 30 basis points in our SG&A rate. Other operating income was $63.7 million. This increase of $9.6 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. 
Adjusted operating income was $418.4 million and increase of 15.7% over prior year fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 17.4% of sales. This 160-basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by increase in sales and gross margin. Adjusted EPS was $3.63 compared to $3.06 last year, an increase of 18.6%, driven principally by stronger business performance. 
So let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll start with inventory. This is the first year-end since the acquisition of Zale that we have an apples-to-apples result. Our strong year-end inventory position reflect the success of our continued focus on optimization of Zale inventory. Net inventory ended the year at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 0.6% compared to our annual sales growth of 14.2%. This relationship to Zale was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations. 
We increased Zale inventory turn by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store level inventory closer to the Kay average is an inventory co-resident management. We also improve inventory turnover through better sourcing terms and the performance of Ever Us. As move through Q1, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well-positioned. 
So moving on, we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. So before we can discuss our in-house credit metrics, I wanted to spend a few minutes to speak more holistically on our in-house credit operations. We have provided and operated in-house credit for years and it gives us a number of competitive advantages. Our in-house program is an integral part of our business, which builds customer loyalty and enables incremental profitable sales that will just not occur without a consumer financing program. In addition, there are several factors inherent in the U.S. Jewelry business that support the circumstances through which consumer financing is uniquely positioned to generate profitable incremental sales for Signet. We know from our deep history of borrower behaviors that the emotional connection our customers have to their jewelry repurchases supports repayment history. In addition, due to our scale, we are able to administer our credit programs very efficiently and effectively. Credit also complements and supports our best in bridal strategy. Bridal, which speak closest thing in jewelry into a necessity, represents about half of our annual business. About 75% of our Sterling division bridal sales utilize our credit program. This provides us with the opportunity to develop long-term customer relationships, market to our customers and maximize our customer's long-term sales productivity. So with that as a background, there are several points that I want to make sure our very clear to our investors regarding our credit portfolio. First, our credit program is designed for rapidly payment that minimizes risk and enables the customer to make additional jewelry purchases using their credit facility. On average, our receivable portfolio turned every 9 months much quicker than a typical credit card provider. The weighted average minimum monthly payment required is about 9% of outstanding balances, which is nearly doubled what a typical credit card company would require. 
Further, on our monthly repayment terms, which are unlike those credit card repayment terms, don't decline as the customer repays his or her balance, which helps to facilitate the precollection of our loan balances. Second, there is no longtail associated with our credit book. We fully take the expense of any loans that has aged 90 days on [indiscernible] if and when it will raise 120 days [indiscernible] and 240 days contractual, it is charge off the provision. Third, our underwriting standards are proven and have been consistent over a long period of time. This consistency in our underwriting also demonstrated an weighted average FICA score for the portfolio. That for FY '16, our weighted average FICO was 662 and has been in the mid 6 60s for numerous years. The FICO scores of the new customers in our portfolio in FY '16 at 684 was higher than the average for the total portfolio. Fourth, to age our portfolio, we measured delinquency and establish loan allowances using a form of the method. This form of reason which we have used since the inception of owning our in-house credit relies qualified payment determined by management to measure delinquency. A qualifying payment can be no less than 75% of the scheduled minimum payment and increases with the delinquency level. Once an account holder is more than 3 payments behind, the entire year past due amount is required to return to current status. Of all the payments received in the fiscal year, 97% were equal to or greater than the scheduled monthly payment, which is true in fiscal 2015 as well. Fifth, and this is perhaps the most important to understand, is that regardless of aging method use [indiscernible] portfolio, the balance sheet and income statement will yield the same result as under U.S. GAAP, receivables must be stated at the net realized value. So in other words, the net charge-off to the balance sheet and the net added expense in the P&L would be the same under both the regency and contractual aging. There is no difference between the 2 when it comes to our financial statements. We provided in Appendix to our presentation that summarizes our qualifying payment rule. In addition, I refer you to our expanded disclosures in our 10-K that we will file to the relating to underwriting, credit monitoring and collection and our portfolio aging. We hope that these expanded disclosures are found to be helpful. 
So with that, behind us, let's look at our financial metrics related to our Sterling division in-house credit. Our new net accounts receivable increased to $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, representing 12% increase, driven by credit penetration rate and higher average purchases. Our fiscal 2016 credit penetration rate was 61.5% and that compares to 60.5% last year. The higher participation rate was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both with higher average transaction values. The average monthly collection rate for fiscal 2016 was 11.5% compared to 11.9%. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash received divided by accounts receivable. The change of rate of prior year is due primary to 2 reasons: First, as our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. By design, the repayment rate is lower as the price point of merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sale and therefore, the repayment is longer. So this leaves the higher outstanding receivable to be collected. And second, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later in the life of the loan and interest speed earlier. So as our portfolio growth during the last year proportionally, more of it will be repaid later. 
Our allowance as a percent of AR increased 20 basis points due principally to higher receivable balances and higher bad debt. So continuing down Slide 14. Our fiscal 2016 net bad debt was $190.5 million and [indiscernible] $160 million last year. The increase of $30.5 million was driven principally by higher penetration and receivable balances. 
Interesting [indiscernible] finance charges, which makes up virtually all of our other operating income line under our income statement was $252.5 million compared to $217.9 million last year the increase of $34.6 million was due primary to more interest income on a higher outstanding receivable space. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated a full year operating profit of $62 million compared to $57.9 million in the prior year. As you can see on the slide similar trends also assisted in the fourth quarter between the bad debt and that financing cost. In addition, as we have disclosed in our February 29 prerelease, our year-end valuation allowance and nonperforming metric improved as management had expected compared to the third quarter. This improvement was driven not only by the normal seasonality we customarily see but also due to excellent credit execution and credit marketing initiatives designed to favorably influence credit receivable mix. The visibility that we have into our credit portfolio performance, which includes daily collections, weekly roll rates to  30, 60, 90 days and other meaningful indicators leads us to remain highly confident on the strength of our credit portfolio performance. All of these considerations are factored into our Q1 and annual guidance. 
So moving on to capital allocation. I'd like to reiterate our priorities for capital structure in our capital allocation strategy that we produced this time last year. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to invest in our business got to execute our strategic priorities, ensuring adequate liquidity and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our investment-grade rating are important to us because long-term, we may return to the debt market. Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x. We ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. And as EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity. We are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenets of our capital allocation policy. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and/or dividends, assuming no other strategic uses of capital. And in recent years, we have grown both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher know given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the existing authorization of $136 billion. 
So now let's talk about our financial guidance. Signet's first quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4% and first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.90 to $1.95, a growth rate of 17% to 20%. We anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 million of Signet's stocks during the first quarter. We are also initiating annual earnings guidance, along with our customary quarterly guidance. And we's are doing this in order to more effectively communicate the effect of the aboard the revised synergies, which Mark discussed, and the timing of how the synergies will flow. To fostering more long-term view of this motto, Signet and us to continue its annual earnings guidance in lieu of quarterly earnings guidance after fiscal 2017. 
For fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 3% to 4.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55, a growth rate of 20% to 25%. We are planning for the strong earnings flow to come about through both gross margin and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies and the SG&A leverage should flow to the marketing and organizational design efficiencies. 
Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be about 28%. Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million, driven by combination of store remodels, store growth, information technology and facilities expenditure. Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5% and this is further than what we have previously guided of 2% to 3%. Most Signet's new square footage growth is slated for illicit venues other than most most that is focused on higher ROI store banners. 
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our financial performance and the progress that we have made on our synergies today. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

Jared, you got to understand, Jared is different than the mall in by the way, testing from competitive set and the competitive set this H.Samuel a subsidy model subsidy model if you that you will reduce you some will and I mentioned it earlier, if you look at trend of there, Jared actually captured profitable market share compared to the overarching jewelry industry. And again, the majority of Jared customers is outside the mall and majority of jewelry customers are outside of the mall So the Jared and Kay and Zales that a fair comparison. That being said, we did have a lot of good learnings to segmentation study that shared with us that we needed to talk to and communicate with those customers differently but from marketing perspective and from a selling perspective. And we had some enhancements to our selling techniques in our stores as we think it's doing better but this is a transition of stage for Jared to girls actually very excited for Jared operative this year this trenches don't have enough for that but we believe come fourth quarter, Jared had a lot of wonderful event guess we've announced already were going to have Pandora shop-in-shops in our stores. We believe the ponderous a tremendous partner and will increase our full traffic coming to our stores. We've now are put in Vera Wang is now in our Jared stores. We have unique advertising for it Jared, Vera Wang and we are good have some unique Ferland probably been on the work traffic stores. We also have a very special program that's perfectly targeted to the Jared customer that we call the chosen Dymond. We'll talk more about this but it was tested in the fourth quarter did extremely well and it's we're our customer can literally truck their diamond from the point in the mine that it came out of to our cutting factor in Botswana track to the point when it in sundering spouses a response to be had. So we're excited about what going to happen for Jared this year, but it takes time to transition the business. But I want to end is we believe Jared is capturing profitable market share when you compare to the overarching jewelry industry."

The 1 thing I would say is that market Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, the synergies are flowing across our business division.

The way I'm adding it up, it looks to me like you are getting $1.50 lift from synergies and credit and that would take you to about an 8 40 number.

On the marketing front, Oliver, in the second half, there are several things. First of all, we are continuing to refine our great event to get closer and closer and get continued REITs from our segmented customer as to Kay, trudges and Jared segmented study, segmentation study in the U.K. for both our SMO brand and Ernest Jones brand and also conducting just finishing a study for our Peoples brand in the United Kingdom -- excuse me, in Canada. So we will continue to refine our creative to make sure we're penetrating and connecting more to those segmented customer appropriately banners. In addition to that, we will continue to invest thoughtfully and strategically and targeted additional marketing spend or all of our brands were appropriate. So on the marketing side, it's continued refinement of the creative to connect to the segmented customer in TV media and increase investment in digital we're putting a lot of time, money and effort behind our omni-channel experience and making sure that there's a connectivity from the digital perspective whether to online to in-store and the connected you we're putting a lot of investments in special omni-channel experience is that our going to be differentiated by us. The merchandising psychomotor have a lot of anxiety things I mentioned expansions in Ever Usof our daily that historically, in the jewelry industry, when a Beacon program is in us and Beacon program in the past for the student understand the type of jewelry industry. Our programs like the past, present and future anniversary band which is 15 years and with the jewelry necklace, these are programs that we called Beacon programs, and we call our Ever Us program a program as we focus in targeting and highlighting 1 item to expand and usually year 2 is a better year for Beacon programs consistently year 2 outperforms. So we're excited about the year 2 because the customers are just getting the idea understanding what Ever Us represents and is gaining momentum. So we're seeing a naturally thin the more and more customer understand Ever Us is a huge benefit but compounded with that, we're testing expansions. We're addressing here is, we're testing bracelet, we are testing different styles of rings. So Ever Us is still a very exciting operative for the second half this year. I mentioned in Jared we have an exciting diamond program in test mode is chosen we're very excited about our shop in shop Pandora stores within our trend of stores we but other items that are inefficient laboratory being tested as we speak. We are you can see from our is, we feel very excited about our exciting initiatives when it comes to marketing and merchandise and also you didn't ask about it let me share with you the more and more we engaged with our field sales force, the better they get, the more we treat them, the better the can deliver customer experience everything said and then, the most important equation is how that customers served across the counter and delivering those established products.

So I can, what I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing stability in our credit metrics and very confident in terms of credit portfolio performance, all of which is factored in our Q1 and our annual guidance. So with that, said, I think, it kind the hit also on the use of the rings question but directionally, in Q1, when you see the relationship of our net bad debt expenses and finance charge income, we expect that to be broadly in line with last year with I think there's timing of can't mastery numbers so you have to take that into effect that will probably be the same and on a full year basis as a percentage of sales in the relationship of bad debt and finance charge will also be broadly in line with fiscal '16. And I would make the same comment when you think about the allowance as a percentage of our receivable. Getting into ROI in terms and the hybrid approach that we have with ABS and our in-house, which really ease a unique case for us. First of all, I think, Oliver, it's important to note that our overall credit portfolio is still highly profitable, and we have successfully managed this portfolio in over 30 years and all types of business cycles. The virtues of having our in-house credit program given the sales and earnings flow-through when you think about the interest income, the lifetime value of our credit customers, how it complements our best in bridal strategy, I mean, all of these factors really provide a competitive advantage for us to operate this in-house credit program.

Signet Jewelers had excellent fourth quarter. Our results demonstrate our solid fundamentals and that we are managing all key operational aspects of the business.I'll start with a few remarks on our financial h",1510,"Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. Signet Jewelers had excellent fourth quarter. Our results demonstrate our solid fundamentals and that we are managing all key operational aspects of the business.
I'll start with a few remarks on our financial highlights, leaving the details for Michele and then get into the operating highlights. Our total sales in the fourth quarter increased by 5.1%, which was significantly higher than the jewelry market as a whole. We not only gained share, we gained profitable market share.
Signet comp sales increased by 4.9%, which was among the fastest growth of any U.S. retailers. Due to strong top line and prudent management of our expenses, our operating margin expanded by nearly 200 basis points and our earnings per share were up about 20% as well. Earings growth was also among the top of the industry.
While delivering a terrific fourth quarter, we also set the table for growth into the future. Our synergies from the Zale acquisitions are playing off faster than we first expected. We delivered $60 million of synergies in fiscal 2016, above previous expectations and we raised our multiyear synergy guidance. I'll get to those details in a couple of minutes.
Next, I'd like to discuss the sales drivers of the fourth quarter. The variety of related and overlapping initiatives that drove the fourth quarter performance, which included innovative merchandising, cross-selling, engaging marketing and solid store execution with superior customer service.
Results were led by our Ever Us program, which is our much talked about new jewelry collection, which is offered across all of our national brands and leverages our scale in the jewelry industry. We use our customer knowledge and our expertise in jewelry design to develop an innovative 2-stone diamond ring collection with marketing that appeal to a broad range of customers, celebrating life and expressing love. As for the future, the Ever Us collection is now testing line extensions for the Christmas of 2016, and we hope to highlight these innovations as the year progresses.
Earrings as well as bracelets, many of which innovative fastening systems were attached, were also very successful in the fourth quarter. And bridal also grew in the fourth quarter. It's important to note that bridal business is a stable grower, and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Bridal brands such as Vera Wang LOVE, Neil Lane, Tolkowsky and the Forever Diamond, which is exclusively sold in the our H.Samuel stores, led the way. 
Marketing initiatives such as our new television creative did very well. We applied learnings from our customer segmentation study, especially around Zales and Jared and increased our advertising ways. This brought our merchandise to live in the form of compelling stores, which really resonated with our customers. 
A few comments on the drivers of our leading store banners. Kay Jewelers led the way with a 7.4% comp sales increase and a 9% growth in total sales. This strong performance on top of last year performance reflects a 2-year comp increase of 12%. Zales delivered very strong results, driven by Ever Us and Bridal. Piercing Pagoda results were driven by gold, diamonds and religious jewelry. And Ernest Jones continued this momentum, driven principally by diamond fashion and bridal jewelry as well as prestige watches.
And lastly, the store operation processes, they were enhanced Zales and Jared during the third quarter, appeared to help the fourth quarter results as well. Our team members have embraced change and we are very pleased with our store execution. Our business performance since our Holiday Sales Call resulted in a strong finish to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. The momentum continued into the first quarter giving us confidence in what promises to be a strong fiscal 2017, which is reflected in our quarterly and our annual guidance. Since the Holiday Sales Call, there's been a disconnect between our track record of strong financial results and our strategy for long-term success, and the external market perception of our valuation. As such, we decided to prerelease our fourth quarter results.
We reiterate our capital allocation strategy with an aggressive buyback policy that will allow us to take advantage of what we view us a significant buying opportunity. We also considerably increased our dividend to reflect our strong flat cash flows, and reward our loyal shareholders. The demonstration of our long-term commitment that executive management has in Signet's business, the board approved and fully supported by executive management, an increased level of share ownership requirements. We raised our synergy guidance due to significant progress of integrating Zale within Signet. Initiatives are delivering favorable results faster than we first believed, and we have a deep pipeline of work streams from which we deliver our numbers over the next 2 years. So let's take a look at those numbers for a second.
As a result of the Zale acquisition, Signet will realize significant operating profit synergies. We increased our net synergies target to a range of $225 million to $250 million, which is nearly a 50% increase. Of the synergies remaining in the next 2 years, we expect to realize 70% by January end 2017, driven principally by gross margin and operating expense synergies. We increased our expectations because we now have been operating Zales through 2 holiday seasons, and have much more confidence in the operations.
We have a larger pipeline of initiatives, more of them are working and they're working faster. Some of the big initiatives that have been going on or will go on this year, include product sourcing, indirect material procurement, discount controls, promotions and event coordination, cross-selling, extended service plans, labor scheduling, TV and media efficiency, improved jewelry repairs and much, much more. It's very important to know that our synergies are being realized in all of our businesses and all of our divisions, in multiple lines of our income statement, and will favorably affect the financial performance of Signet for years to come.
So let me give you a couple of examples. When you think about our Ever Us collection that was so successful this past quarter, it did largely well because of the credibility of built by being sold in each of our national store banners. Our repair business, which has been generating incremental profit because of our process changings, our in-sourcing, our technology upgrades and other factors, and this phased-in approach -- this is a phased-in approach so will favorably impact sales and operating expenses for years to come.
By many messages that we are running Signet as one company, not a preacquisition entity and a new one. We are improving Signet results by running our overall business better.
With that, I'd like to talk about last year. It was an outstanding year for Signet. And I want to take a moment just to review some of the notable accomplishments in fiscal 2016. We've made significant strides in transforming Signet from a company composed of 3 divisions with redundant infrastructure into one company supported by leaders, who manage each functional area across the entire company. We delivered over $6.5 billion in sales, up over 14%. We were added to prestigious S&P 500 Index. We made important strides in cross-selling our powerful brands, such as Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane bridal to increase their profiles. We introduced Ever Us, arguably one of the most significant innovations in the jewelry industry in years. Innovation in watches and fitness around the industry essentially activates the wrist as a more high profile part of the body to accessorize. In response, Signet successfully sold bracelets with innovative fastening as well as our core watch brands such as Movado and Citizen.
After researching several ways that we can go about improving Zales repair business, we committed to a primary method, whereby our Jared design and repair service centers will handle the vast majority of the volume. This change is newly underway and off to a very good start.
We deployed learnings from our customer segmentation study into marketing, store design and selling techniques. Several synergy versions around gross margin contributed and we have a lot of runway left to go. We manage brands well and successfully extend our merchandise lines, led by Diamonds in Rhythm. Our store design team had several wins, extending testing new store concepts for Zales, Jared and Piercing Pagoda.
We elevate the efficiency and the effectiveness of our omni-channel approach to selling through greater personalization and customization, along with targeted digital marketing. We made significant enhancements to our selling process at Jared and Zales, which we believe, improve their guest experiences. We gain significant market share profitably and expanded our operating margins along the way. And lastly, we allocated our capital very intelligently, increasing the dividend, repurchasing stock and maintaining liquidity and balance sheet strength. And everything that we're doing operationally is meant to maximize earnings per share growth for our shareholders, which we achieved by gaining over 20% this year.
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Michele to take a look at the financials."
693964,318928183,955757,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2016",2016-03-24,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our fourth quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 4.9% on top of a 4.2% comp increase in the prior year fourth quarter. Total sales increased 5.1% and on a constant exchange bas",2791,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our fourth quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 4.9% on top of a 4.2% comp increase in the prior year fourth quarter. Total sales increased 5.1% and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 6.4% for the quarter.
Now looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 6.9% to $1.45 billion, which included a comp increase of 5%. Sales increases were driven by particular strength in diamond fashion jewelry, including Ever Us, diamond earrings and bracelets. This merchandise mix is droving higher average transaction value of 6% with a decline in the number of transactions of 2.3%.
Innovative collections, typically with higher ATV, such as our Ever Us, sold faster and gain relative share within our portfolio. The Zale jewelry operating segment, total sales increased by 2.2% to $577 million and 5.2% on a constant currency exchange basis.
On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 6.3% and costs increased by 5.4%. Our Canadian sales declined 15.8% and 0.4% on a constant currency basis with comp sales decline of 0.8%. Canada sales were impacted primarily by the Western region of Canada, where lower oil and gas prices lead to a recession earlier this year.
Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and bridal. Now similar to Sterling, this merchandise mix drove a higher transaction value of 6.2% with a decline of 2.1% in the number of transactions.
Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 8.3% to $78 million with comp sales of 6.4%. Sales increases were driven by gold and diamond jewelry, and this merchandise mix drove a 10% increase in average transaction value, while transaction count declined 2.7%.
Looking at our U.K. In U.K., our total sales increased 1.7% to $283 million or 5.9% at constant currency rate and included a comp sales increase of 4.7%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases, which also drove a higher average transaction value of 3.7%. The number of transactions increased by 1.1%, driven by diamond jewelry antiques.
So moving on to sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated Q4 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results.
So on Slide 10, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction costs, which includes our integration-related expenses. Starting on the right side of the slide, on a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.42 per share, representing a 20.4% increase over prior year EPS of $2.84. The next column, however reflects our transaction and integration costs. These costs relate to consulting costs for integration, an acceleration of severance costs of $7.1 million in Q4 related to organization changes that will benefit FY '17 and beyond, and an acceleration of information technology costs of $3.7 million in Q4 related to implementation costs associated with global systems that will also drive future synergies.
In total, transaction and integration costs were responsible for $0.15 of EPS dilution. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue and amortization of unfavorable contracts were diluted to EPS by $0.06.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.6% or 100 basis points lower than prior year. Our annual effective tax rate was 28.9% or 60 basis points lower than the prior year rate of 29.5%. And on an adjusted Signet basis, which is the far most left column, EPS was $3.63, an increase of 18.6% over last year.
Looking below the sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was a little over $1 billion or 42.6% of adjusted sales. That rate was up 170 basis points to last year due primarily to synergies, favorable commodity costs and leverage on store occupancy costs. Our rates continues to benefit from synergy-related initiatives that includes discount controls, extended service plans, vendor terms and other growth margin enhancing programs.
Sterling Jewelers gross margin increased by 120 basis points and that was due to improved merchandise margins related to favorable commodity costs and leverage on store occupancy. The Zale division's adjusted gross margin rate increased 270 basis points due primarily to realization of synergies that favorably impacted merchandise margins, distribution costs, store operating costs and rent-in occupancy. U.K. gross margin increased 80 basis points due primarily to store occupancy leverage. 
Adjusted SG&A was $666 million or 27.8% of adjusted sales compared to $629 million or 27.5% of sales in the prior year. The increase of $37 million in SG&A was driven by higher advertising of $7 million, higher store staff cost of $11 million, associated with higher sales volume and higher central costs. The increase in central costs was driven by higher recuring IT expense, higher levels of depreciation, investments in product research and development and standardization of employee compensation among North America.
From a rate perspective, the higher central costs were partially offset by leverage on advertising and store payroll, resulting in an increase of 30 basis points in our SG&A rate. Other operating income was $63.7 million. This increase of $9.6 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.
Adjusted operating income was $418.4 million and increased 15.7% over prior year fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 17.4% of sales. This 160 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by increase in sales and gross margin. Adjusted EPS was $3.63 compared to $3.06 last year, an increase of 18.6%, driven principally by stronger business performance.
So let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll start with inventory. And this is the first year-end since the acquisition of Zale that we have an apples-to-apples result. Our strong year-end inventory position reflect the success of our continued focus on optimization of Zale inventory. Net inventory ended the year at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 0.6% compared to our annual sales growth of 14.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations.
We increased Zale inventory turn by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store level inventory close to the Kay averages, and improving clearance inventory management. We also improved inventory turnover through better sourcing terms and the performance of Ever Us. As we move through Q1, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well positioned. 
So moving on, we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. So before we discuss our in-house credit metrics, I wanted to spend a few minutes to speak more holistically on our in-house credit operations. We have provided and operated in-house credit for 30 years and it gives us a number of competitive advantages. Our in-house program is an integral part of our business, which builds customer loyalty and enables incremental profitable sales that would just not occur without a consumer financing program. In addition, there are several factors inherent in the U.S. Jewelry business that support the circumstances through which consumer financing is uniquely positioned to generate profitable incremental sales for Signet. We know from our deep history of borrower behaviors, that the emotional connection our customers have to their jewelry purchases supports repayment history. In addition, due to our scale, we are able to administer our credit programs very efficiently and effectively. Credit also complements and supports our best in bridal strategy. Bridal, which is the closest thing in jewelry to a necessity, represents about half of our annual business. About 75% of our Sterling division bridal sales utilize our credit program. This provides us with the opportunity to develop a long-term customer relationships, market to our customers and maximize our customer's long-term sales productivity. 
So with that as a background, there are several points that I want to make sure are very clear to our investors regarding our credit portfolio. First, our credit program is designed for rapid repayment that minimizes risk and enables the customer to make additional jewelry purchases using their credit facility. On average, our receivable portfolio turned every 9 months, much quicker than a typical credit card provider. The weighted average minimum monthly payment required is about 9% of outstanding balances, which is nearly double what a typical credit card company would require.
Further, on our monthly repayment terms, which unlike most credit card repayment terms, don't decline as the customer repays his or her balance, which helps to facilitate the precollection of our loan balances. Second, there is no longtail associated with our credit book. We fully take the expense of any loan that is aged 90 days on a recency. If and when a loan reaches a 120 days recency and 240 days contractual, it is charged off against the provision. Third, our underwriting standards are proven and have been consistent over a long period of time. This consistency in our underwriting also is demonstrated in our weighted average FICO score for the portfolio. And for FY '16, our weighted average FICO was 662 and has been in the mid-660s for numerous years. The FICO scores of the new customers in our portfolio in FY '16 at 684 was higher than the average for the total portfolio. Fourth, to age our portfolio, we measure delinquency and establish loan allowances using a form of the recency method. This form of recency, which we have used since the inception of owning our in-house credit relies upon qualifying payment determined by management to measure delinquency. A qualifying payment can be no less than 75% of the scheduled minimum payment and increases with the delinquency level. Once an account holder is more than 3 payments behind, the entire past due amount is required to return to current status. Of all the payments received in the fiscal year, 97% were equal to or greater than the scheduled monthly payment, which is true in fiscal 2015 as well. Fifth, and this is perhaps the most important to understand, is that regardless of aging method used over 1 portfolio, the balance sheet and income statement will yield the same result as under U.S. GAAP, receivables must be stated at the net realizable value. So in other words, the net charge-off to the balance sheet, and the net bad debt expense in the P&L, would be the same under both recency and contractual aging. There is no difference between the 2 when it comes to our financial statements. We provided in Appendix to our presentation that summarizes our qualifying payment rule. In addition, I refer you to our expanded disclosures in our 10-K that we will file today relating to underwriting, credit monitoring and collection and our portfolio aging. We hope that these expanded disclosures are found to be helpful.
So with that, behind us, let's look at our financial metrics related to our Sterling division in-house credit. Our newer net accounts receivable increased to $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, representing a 12% increase, driven by credit penetration rate and higher average purchases. Our fiscal 2016 credit penetration rate was 61.5% and that compares to 60.5% last year. The higher participation rate was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both with higher average transaction values. The average monthly collection rate for fiscal 2016 was 11.5% compared to 11.9%. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash received divided by accounts receivable. The change of rate over prior year is due primarily to 2 reasons: First, as our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. By design, the repayment rate is lower as the price point of merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sale and therefore, the repayment is longer. So this leaves a higher outstanding receivable to be collected. And second, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later in the life of the loan and interest is paid earlier. So as our portfolios grow more in the last year, proportionally more of that will be repaid later. 
Our allowance as a percent of AR increased 20 basis points due principally to higher receivable balances and higher bad debt. So continuing down Slide 14. Our fiscal 2016 net bad debt was $190.5 million and that denotes $160 million last year. The increase of $30.5 million was driven principally by higher penetration and receivable balances.
Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all of our other operating income line under income statement was $252.5 million compared to $217.9 million last year. The increase of $34.6 million was due primary to more interest income on a higher outstanding receivable base. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated a full year operating profit of $62 million compared to $57.9 million in the prior year. As you can see on the slide, similar trends also existed for the fourth quarter between net bad debt and financing costs. In addition, as we have disclosed in our February 29 prerelease, our year-end valuation allowance and nonperforming metrics improved as management had expected compared to the third quarter. This improvement was driven not only by the normal seasonality we customarily see, but also due to excellent credit execution and credit marketing initiatives designed to favorably influence credit receivable mix. The visibility that we have into our credit portfolio performance, which includes daily collections, weekly roll rates to  30, 60, 90 days, and other meaningful indicators, leads us to remain highly confident in the strength of our credit portfolio performance. All of these considerations are factored into our Q1 and annual guidance.
So moving on to capital allocation. I'd like to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we [indiscernible] at this time last year. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to invest in our business, execute our strategic priorities, ensuring adequate liquidity and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our investment-grade rating are important to us because long term, we may return to the debt market. Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x. We ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. And as our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity. We are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenets of our capital allocation policy. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and/or dividends, assuming no other strategic uses of capital. And in recent years, we have grown, both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the existing authorization of $136 billion.
So now let's talk about our financial guidance. Signet's first quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4% and first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.90 to $1.95, a growth rate of 17% to 20%. We anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 million of Signet's stock during the first quarter. We are also initiating annual earnings guidance, along with our customary quarterly guidance. And we are doing this in order to more effectively communicate the effect of the upwardly revised synergies, which Mark discussed, and the timing of how these synergies will flow. To fostering more long-term view of it's model, Signet, it has to continue with annual earnings guidance in lieu of quarterly earnings guidance after fiscal 2017.
For fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 3% to 4.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55, a growth rate of 20% to 25%. We are planning for the strong earnings flow to come about through both gross margin and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies and the SG&A leverage should flow to the marketing and organizational design efficiencies.
Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be about 28%. Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million, driven by combination of store remodels, store growth, information technology and facilities expenditure. Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5% and this is greater than what we had previously guided of 2% to 3%. Most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than enclosed malls, and is focused on higher ROI store banners.
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our financial performance and the progress that we have made on our synergies today. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

Thank you, again. When it comes to what we're doing in customer acquisition through our advertising specifically, the learnings that we've gotten from our segmentations that has really helped us out to focusing on our store brands primary customer. So for example, in Zales, we have a primary customer and we've adjusted our advertising creative to capture more of the Zales segmented primary customer, which is different than that of Kay's and Jared, in which we got wonderful reactions of the consumers and from our store staff just seeing people coming in and really reacting to the ad so well, and we did the same for Jared as well. And also Kay was kind of on the mark the most with their -- with our customer segmentation. So with the guy being the hero and the ads and everything else. So what we did, is not only did we enhance the creative, we also increased our marketing spend. So increased our spend for Zales this fourth quarter, we increased our spend for Jared this fourth quarter, and Kay is kind of at a point where we don't think it's beneficial to increase the spend. What we did is we spread Kay's advertising to start earlier in October and to talk about the bridal business, which we believe that definitely benefited Kay's throughout the fourth quarter. So it's about increasing our marketing spend and thoughtfully and targeted. It's about enhancing our creative to make sure we are capturing that segment and customer better within our store banners."

And the competitive set of Jared is primarily, obviously outside the mall. And if you look at the jewelry industry as a whole, I mentioned it earlier if you look at Jared for the year, Jared actually captured profitable market share as compared to the overarching jewelry industry. And again, the majority of Jared customers is outside the mall and the majority of jewelry customers are outside the mall So to compare Jared to Kay and Zales is just not really a fair comparison. That being said, we did have a lot of good learnings through our segmentation study that shared with us, that we need to talk to and communicate with those customers differently, both from a marketing perspective and from a selling perspective. And we had some enhancements to our selling techniques in our Jared stores. We think it's doing better, but this is a transitional stage for Jared. We're actually very excited about Jared opportunity this year. These transitions don't happen overnight, but we believe come to the fourth quarter, the Jared has a lot of wonderful advantages that we've announced already that we're going to have Pandora shop-in-shops in our stores. And we believe, that the Pandora is a tremendous partner and will increase our foot traffic coming to our stores. We've now -- are putting Vera Wang is now in our Jared stores. We have unique advertising for Jared Vera Wang, and we also are going to have some more unique Vera Wang products within our Jared stores. We also have a very special program that is perfectly targeted to the Jared customer that we call the Chosen Diamond. We'll talk more about this, but it was tested in the fourth quarter, did extremely well, and it's where our customer can literally track their diamond from the point in the mine that it came out of to our cutting factory in Botswana, and track it all the way to the point where it's under their beautiful spouse's or spouse-to-be's hand. So we are very excited about what's going to happen for Jared this year, but it'll take time to transition the business. But I want to end with, we still believe Jared is capturing profitable market share when you compare to the overarching jewelry industry."

So the one thing I would say is that, and Mark had mentioned this in the prepared remarks, the synergies are flowing across our business division. And so that's not to say that I've just cautioned you to think that the majority of this is flowing through Zale, it really is across all of it. With that said, sure, the higher synergies does imply that there's higher medium and long-term operating margin expectation, and so I think if you take that upwardly provided synergy guidance and just flow it through, split it and flow it through from the guidance we gave on IR Day, you'll get the updated, and will get you to the updated margin number."

And I'm wondering if perhaps, maybe you are being a little bit conservative on your guidance because if you take the 685 that you -- 686 that you earned, and then you tax effect the synergies and let's say we use the midpoint of the synergy savings, that's about $1.30 and then you've got the ADS credit benefit this year that you didn't have last year, that's another $0.20. The way I'm adding it up, it looks to me like you are getting $1.50 lift from synergies and credit and that would take you to about an 840 number. So it would seem like you're just kind of adding the synergies and the credit benefit with no organic growth from the core business.

Again, it goes on the heels, I really, really caution anybody from taking the synergies, and trying to look at the synergies and then what's happening in the organic growth.

Synergies flow across our business. And so for example, and I know Mark also provided this during the prepared remarks, a portion of our revenue includes revenue synergies, such as cross-selling. He gave Ever Us as an example, which is a -- it's permanent part of our business and so that's in our synergy number. It's mutually benefiting all of our divisions across the board. So you really can't start pursing out what's core and what's not core.

On the marketing front, Oliver, in the second half, there are several things. First of all, we are continuing to refine our creative and to get closer and closer and get continued reads from our segmented customer as relates to Kay, Zales, Jared and by the way we just had a segmented study, segmentation study in the U.K. for both our H. Samuel brand and our Ernest Jones brand, and we also are conducting and just finished a study of our Peoples brand in the United Kingdom -- excuse me, in Canada. So we will continue to refine our creative to make sure we're penetrating and connecting more to those segmented customer appropriately with appropriate banners. In addition to that, we will continue to invest thoughtfully and strategically and targeted additional marketing spend for all of our brands where appropriate. So on the marketing side, it's continued refinement of the creative to connect to the segmented customer and increased investment in TV media and an increase investment in digital, we're putting a lot of time, money and effort behind our omni-channel experiencing, and making sure that there's a connectivity from the digital perspective whether it'd be online to in-store and then the connectivities. We're putting a lot of investments in our -- in the special omni-channel experiences that's going to be differentiated by us. On the merchandising side, we have a lot of exciting news, I mentioned that the extensions in Ever Us, I will tell you that historically, in the jewelry industry, when a Beacon program is announced, and the Beacon program, in the past, for those you don't understand or the type of jewelry industry, our programs like the past, present and future anniversary band, which is 15 years ago where the jewelry necklace, these are programs that we -- they are called Beacon programs, and we call our Ever Us program a Beacon program as we focus on in targeting and highlighting one item to expand and usually year 2 is a better year for Beacon programs, consistently year 2 outperforms. So we're excited about the year 2 because the customers are just getting the idea understanding what Ever Us represents and is gaining momentum. So we're just seeing a naturally lift, and the more and more customer understand Ever Us is a huge benefit, but compounded with that, we're testing extensions. We're testing earrings, we're testing bracelets, we're testing different styles of rings. So Ever Us is still a very exciting opportunity for the second half this year. I mentioned in Jared, we have an exciting new diamond program that we're in test mode, that's chosen, we're very excited about our shop-in-shop Pandora stores within our Jared stores. We've got other items that are in our vision laboratory that are being tested as we speak. We are -- as you can see from our guidance, we feel very excited about our exciting initiatives when it comes to marketing and merchandising, and it also, you didn't ask about it, but I will share with you, the more and more we engage with our field forces, the better they get. The more we train them, the better they can deliver a superior customer experience because after everything said and done, the most important equation is how that customer is served across the counter and delivering those established products. So that's my answer to that part of the question, Michele?"

So I will take the credit. And so again, what I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing stability in our credit metrics and very confident in terms of our credit portfolio performance, all of which is factored in our Q1 and our annual guidance. So with that said, and I think, this kind of hit on also on the heels of Lorraine's question, but directionally, in Q1, when you see the relationship of our net bad debt expense and finance charge income, would expect that to be broadly in line with last year with I think there's a timing of [indiscernible] in last year's number. So you have to take that into effect and it would probably be the same, and on a full year basis as a percentage of sales that net relationship of bad debt and finance charge will also be broadly in line with fiscal '16. And I would make the same comment when you think about the allowance as a percentage of our receivable. Getting into ROI in terms and the hybrid approach that we have with ADS and our in-house, which really is a unique case for us. And first of all, I think, Oliver, it's really important to note that our overall credit portfolio is still highly profitable, and we have successfully managed this portfolio over 30 years in all types of business cycles. The virtues of having our in-house credit program, given the sales and earnings flow-through when you think about the interest income, the lifetime value of our credit customers, how it complements our best in bridal strategy, I mean, all of these factors really provide a competitive advantage for us to operate this in-house credit program. Now with that said, and as you mentioned, we have ADS that's providing the credit in Zale. So we do have this optimal test case in front of us and this hybrid model will allow us to continue to evaluate the pros and cons of an in-house credit program. And this is no different than any other aspect of our business that we always are continuing to evaluate our business and ways to enhance shareholder value."

And I said this before, but arguably in our business, more than any other retail because we know that a vast majority of jewelry and diamond customers go online first. They need to educate themselves online.

We're just now ramping up, you will see a ramp up opening about -- projecting opening about 30 new Zale stores this year, and we're feeling pretty good about opening the Zale stores. We'll see, we didn't open up many last year, but we'll see how they do so. This year is a good year for us that we're opening up a lot of Kay off-mall stores, which as Michele said, it gives us the highest return, and we see great consistency in the performance of Kay off-mall continues to do well and Jared continues to do well, and we're just getting into Zales and Piercing Pagoda, and we're very excited about the opportunities of new Piercing Pagoda stores, and our new store designs behind the Piercing Pagoda brand."

What we did is we started to pulling credit marketing initiatives in Q3, and really these initiatives were aimed at more of the higher or more better quality credit customer to favorably influence what our credit mix was. And so some of these type of initiatives were like in Jared, you can get a 10% off, it was, hey credit card reactivations reminder, you have open to buy with us, come in and make a purchase.

Signet Jewelers had an excellent fourth quarter. Our results demonstrate our solid fundamentals and that we are managing all key operational aspects of the business.
I'll start with a few remarks on our financial highlights, leaving the details for Michele and then get into the operating highlights. Our total sales in the fourth quarter increased by 5.1%, which was significantly higher than the jewelry market as a whole. We not only gained share, we gained profitable market share.
Signet comp sales increased by 4.9%, which was among the fastest growth of any U.S. retailers. Due to strong top line and prudent management of our expenses, our operating margin expanded by nearly 200 basis points and our earnings per share were up about 20% as well. Earings growth was also among the top of the industry.
While delivering a terrific fourth quarter, we also set the table for growth into the future. Our synergies from the Zale acquisitions are playing out faster than we first expected. We delivered $60 million of synergies in fiscal 2016, above previous expectations and we raised our multiyear synergy guidance. I'll get to those details in a couple of minutes.
Next, I'd like to discuss the sales drivers of the fourth quarter. The variety of related and overlapping initiatives that drove the fourth quarter performance, which included innovative merchandising, cross-selling, engaging marketing and solid store execution with superior customer service.
Results were led by our Ever Us program, which is our much talked about new jewelry collection, which is offered across all of our national brands and leverages our scale in the jewelry industry. We use our customer knowledge and our expertise in jewelry design to develop an innovative 2-stone diamond ring collection with marketing that appeal to a broad range of customers, celebrating life and expressing love. As for the future, the Ever Us collection is now testing line extensions for the Christmas of 2016, and we hope to highlight these innovations as the year progresses.
Earrings as well as bracelets, many of which innovative fastening systems were attached, were also very successful in the fourth quarter. And bridal also grew in the fourth quarter. It's important to note that bridal business is a stable grower, and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Bridal brands such as Vera Wang LOVE, Neil Lane, Tolkowsky and the Forever Diamond, which is exclusively sold in the our H.Samuel stores, led the way. 
Marketing initiatives such as our new television creative did very well. We applied learnings from our customer segmentation study, especially around Zales and Jared and increased our advertising waves. This brought our merchandise to live in the form of compelling stories, which really resonated with our customers. 
A few comments on the drivers of our leading store banners. Kay Jewelers led the way with a 7.4% comp sales increase and a 9% growth in total sales. This strong performance on top of last year performance reflects a 2-year comp increase of 12%. Zales delivered very strong results, driven by Ever Us and Bridal. Piercing Pagoda results were driven by gold, diamonds and religious jewelry. And Ernest Jones continued this momentum, driven principally by diamond fashion and bridal jewelry as well as prestige watches.
And lastly, the store operation processes, they were enhanced Zales and Jared during the third quarter, appeared to help the fourth quarter results as well. Our team members have embraced change and we are very pleased with our store execution. Our business performance since our Holiday Sales Call resulted in a strong finish to the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. The momentum continued into the first quarter giving us confidence in what promises to be a strong fiscal 2017, which is reflected in our quarterly and our annual guidance. Since the Holiday Sales Call, there's been a disconnect between our track record of strong financial results and our strategy for long-term success, and the external market perception of our valuation. As such, we decided to prerelease our fourth quarter results.
We reiterate our capital allocation strategy with an aggressive buyback policy that will allow us to take advantage of what we view as a significant buying opportunity. We also considerably increased our dividend to reflect our strong flat cash flows, and reward our loyal shareholders. The demonstration of our long-term commitment that executive team management has in Signet's business, the board approved and fully supported by executive management, an increased level of share ownership requirements. We raised our synergy guidance due to significant progress of integrating Zale within Signet. Initiatives are delivering favorable results faster than we first believed, and we have a deep pipeline of work streams from which we deliver our numbers over the next 2 years. So let's take a look at those numbers for a second.
As a result of the Zale acquisition, Signet will realize significant operating profit synergies. We increased our net synergies target to a range of $225 million to $250 million, which is nearly a 50% increase. Of the synergies remaining in the next 2 years, we expect to realize 70% by January end 2017, driven principally by gross margin and operating expense synergies. We increased our expectations because we now have been operating Zales through 2 holiday seasons, and have much more confidence in the operations.
We have a larger pipeline of initiatives, more of them are working and they're working faster. Some of the big initiatives that have been going on or will go on this year, include product sourcing, indirect material procurement, discount controls, promotions and event coordination, cross-selling, extended service plans, labor scheduling, TV and media efficiency, improved jewelry repairs and much, much more. It's very important to know that our synergies are being realized in all of our businesses and all of our divisions, in multiple lines of our income statement, and will favorably affect the financial performance of Signet for years to come.
So let me give you a couple of examples. When you think about our Ever Us collection that was so successful this past quarter, it did largely well because of the credibility it built by being sold in each of our national store banners. Our repair business, which has been generating incremental profit because of our process changings, our in-sourcing, our technology upgrades and other factors, and this phased-in approach -- this is a phased-in approach so will favorably impact sales and operating expenses for years to come.
By many messages that we are running Signet as one company, not a preacquisition entity and a new one. We are improving Signet results by running our overall business better.
With that, I'd like to talk about last year. It was an outstanding year for Signet. And I want to take a moment just to review some of the notable accomplishments in fiscal 2016. We've made significant strides in transforming Signet from a company composed of 3 divisions with redundant infrastructure into one company supported by leaders, who manage each functional area across the entire company. We delivered over $6.5 billion in sales, up over 14%. We were added to prestigious S&P 500 Index. We made important strides in cross-selling our powerful brands, such as Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane bridal to increase their profiles. We introduced Ever Us, arguably one of the most significant innovations in the jewelry industry in years. Innovation in watches and fitness around the industry essentially activates the wrist as a more high profile part of the body to accessorize. In response, Signet successfully sold bracelets with innovative fastening as well as our core watch brands such as Movado and Citizen.
After researching several ways that we can go about improving Zales repair business, we committed to a primary method, whereby our Jared design and repair service centers will handle the vast majority of the volume. This change is newly underway and off to a very good start.
We deployed learnings from our customer segmentation study into marketing, store design and selling techniques. Several synergy versions around gross margin contributed and we have a lot of runway left to go. We manage brands well and successfully extend our merchandise lines, led by Diamonds in Rhythm. Our store design team had several wins, extending testing new store concepts for Zales, Jared and Piercing Pagoda.
We elevate the efficiency and the effectiveness of our omni-channel approach to selling through greater personalization and customization, along with targeted digital marketing. We made significant enhancements to our selling process at Jared and Zales, which we believe, improve their guest experiences. We gain significant market share profitably and expanded our operating margins along the way. And lastly, we allocated our capital very intelligently, increasing the dividend, repurchasing stock and maintaining liquidity and balance sheet strength. And everything that we're doing operationally is meant to maximize earnings per share growth for our shareholders, which we achieved by gaining over 20% this year.
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Michele to take a look at the financials."
693964,318928183,955809,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 24, 2016",2016-03-24,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So let's start with our fourth quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 4.9% on top of a 4.2% comp increase in the prior year fourth quarter.

Signet's comps increased 4.9% on top of a 4.2% comp increase in the prior year fourth quarter. Total sales increased 5.1% and on a constant exchange basis, total sales increased 6.4% for the quarter.
Now looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 6.9% to $1.45 billion, which included a comp increase of 5%. Sales increases were driven by particular strength in diamond fashion jewelry, including Ever Us, diamond earrings and bracelets. This merchandise mix drove a higher average transaction value of 6% with a decline in the number of transactions of 2.3%.
Innovative collections, typically with higher ATV, such as our Ever Us, sold faster and gained relative share within our portfolio. The Zale jewelry operating segment, total sales increased by 2.2% to $577 million and 5.2% on a constant currency exchange basis.
On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 6.3% and costs increased by 5.4%. Our Canadian sales declined 15.8% and 0.4% on a constant currency basis with comp sales decline of 0.8%. Canada sales were impacted primarily by the Western region of Canada, where lower oil and gas prices lead to a recession earlier this year.
Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and bridal. Now similar to Sterling, this merchandise mix drove a higher transaction value of 6.2% with a decline of 2.1% in the number of transactions.
Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 8.3% to $78 million with comp sales of 6.4%. Sales increases were driven by gold and diamond jewelry, and this merchandise mix drove a 10% increase in average transaction value, while transaction count declined 2.7%.
Looking at our U.K. In U.K., our total sales increased 1.7% to $283 million or 5.9% at constant currency rate and included a comp sales increase of 4.7%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases, which also drove a higher average transaction value of 3.7%. The number of transactions increased by 1.1%, driven by diamond jewelry antiques.
So moving on to sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated Q4 performance before we turn and analyze Signet's adjusted results.
So on Slide 10, the table provides a reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results. The difference between adjusted Signet and Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and transaction costs, which includes our integration-related expenses. Starting on the right side of the slide, on a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.42 per share, representing a 20.4% increase over prior year EPS of $2.84. The next column over reflects our transaction and integration costs. These costs relate to consulting costs for integration, an acceleration of severance costs of $7.1 million in Q4 related to organization changes that will benefit FY '17 and beyond, and an acceleration of information technology costs of $3.7 million in Q4 related to implementation costs associated with global systems that will also drive future synergies.
In total, transaction and integration costs were responsible for $0.15 of EPS dilution. Purchase accounting adjustments, which reflect a reduction to deferred revenue and amortization of unfavorable contracts were dilutive to EPS by $0.06.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 28.6% or 100 basis points lower than prior year. Our annual effective tax rate was 28.9% or 60 basis points lower than the prior year rate of 29.5%. And on an adjusted Signet basis, which is the far most left column, EPS was $3.63, an increase of 18.6% over last year.
Looking below the sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was a little over $1 billion or 42.6% of adjusted sales. That rate was up 170 basis points to last year due primarily to synergies, favorable commodity costs and leverage on store occupancy costs. Our rates continues to benefit from synergy-related initiatives that includes discount controls, extended service plans, vendor terms and other gross margin enhancing programs.
Sterling Jewelers gross margin increased by 120 basis points and that was due to improved merchandise margins related to favorable commodity costs and leverage on store occupancy. The Zale division's adjusted gross margin rate increased 270 basis points due primarily to realization of synergies that favorably impacted merchandise margins, distribution costs, store operating costs and rent and occupancy. U.K. gross margin increased 80 basis points due primarily to store occupancy leverage. 
Adjusted SG&A was $666 million or 27.8% of adjusted sales compared to $629 million or 27.5% of sales in the prior year. The increase of $37 million in SG&A was driven by higher advertising of $7 million, higher store staff cost of $11 million, associated with higher sales volume and higher central costs. The increase in central costs was driven by higher recurring IT expense, higher levels of depreciation, investments in product research and development and standardization of employee compensation among North America.
From a rate perspective, the higher central costs were partially offset by leverage on advertising and store payroll, resulting in an increase of 30 basis points in our SG&A rate. Other operating income was $63.7 million. This increase of $9.6 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.
Adjusted operating income was $418.4 million and increased 15.7% over prior year fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 17.4% of sales. This 160 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by increase in sales and gross margin. Adjusted EPS was $3.63 compared to $3.06 last year, an increase of 18.6%, driven principally by stronger business performance.
So let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll start with inventory. And this is the first year-end since the acquisition of Zale that we have an apples-to-apples result. Our strong year-end inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on optimization of Zale inventory. Net inventory ended the year at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 0.6% compared to our annual sales growth of 14.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations.
We increased Zale inventory turn by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store level inventory close to the Kay averages, and improving clearance inventory management. We also improved inventory turnover through better sourcing terms and the performance of Ever Us. As we move through Q1, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well positioned. 
So moving on, we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. So before we discuss our in-house credit metrics, I wanted to spend a few minutes to speak more holistically on our in-house credit operations. We have provided and operated in-house credit for 30 years and it gives us a number of competitive advantages. Our in-house program is an integral part of our business, which builds customer loyalty and enables incremental profitable sales that would just not occur without a consumer financing program. In addition, there are several factors inherent in the U.S. Jewelry business that support the circumstances through which consumer financing is uniquely positioned to generate profitable incremental sales for Signet. We know from our deep history of borrower behaviors, that the emotional connection our customers have to their jewelry purchases supports repayment history. In addition, due to our scale, we are able to administer our credit programs very efficiently and effectively. Credit also complements and supports our best in bridal strategy. Bridal, which is the closest thing in jewelry to a necessity, represents about half of our annual business. About 75% of our Sterling division bridal sales utilize our credit program. This provides us with the opportunity to develop a long-term customer relationships, market to our customers and maximize our customer's long-term sales productivity. 
So with that as a background, there are several points that I want to make sure are very clear to our investors regarding our credit portfolio. First, our credit program is designed for rapid repayment that minimizes risk and enables the customer to make additional jewelry purchases using their credit facility. On average, our receivable portfolio turned every 9 months, much quicker than a typical credit card provider. The weighted average minimum monthly payment required is about 9% of outstanding balances, which is nearly double what a typical credit card company would require.
Further, on our monthly repayment terms, which unlike most credit card repayment terms, don't decline as the customer repays his or her balance, which helps to facilitate the quick collection of our loan balances. Second, there is no long-tail associated with our credit book. We fully take the expense of any loan that is aged 90 days on a recency. If and when a loan reaches 120 days recency and 240 days contractual, it is charged off against the provision. Third, our underwriting standards are proven and have been consistent over a long period of time. This consistency in our underwriting also is demonstrated in our weighted average FICO score for the portfolio. And for FY '16, our weighted average FICO was 662 and has been in the mid-660s for numerous years. The FICO scores of the new customers in our portfolio in FY '16 at 684 was higher than the average for the total portfolio. Fourth, to age our portfolio, we measure delinquency and establish loan allowances using a form of the recency method. This form of recency, which we have used since the inception of owning our in-house credit relies upon qualifying payment determined by management to measure delinquency. A qualifying payment can be no less than 75% of the scheduled minimum payment and increases with the delinquency level. Once an account holder is more than 3 payments behind, the entire past due amount is required to return to current status. Of all the payments received in the fiscal year, 97% were equal to or greater than the scheduled monthly payment, which is true in fiscal 2015 as well. Fifth, and this is perhaps the most important to understand, is that regardless of aging method used over 1 portfolio, the balance sheet and income statement will yield the same result as under U.S. GAAP, receivables must be stated at the net realizable value. So in other words, the net charge-off to the balance sheet, and the net bad debt expense in the P&L, would be the same under both recency and contractual aging. There is no difference between the 2 when it comes to our financial statements. We provided in Appendix to our presentation that summarizes our qualifying payment rule. In addition, I refer you to our expanded disclosures in our 10-K that we will file today relating to underwriting, credit monitoring and collection and our portfolio aging. We hope that these expanded disclosures are found to be helpful.
So with that behind us, let's look at our financial metrics related to our Sterling division in-house credit. Our year end net accounts receivable increased to $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year, representing a 12% increase, driven by credit penetration rate and higher average purchases. Our fiscal 2016 credit penetration rate was 61.5% and that compares to 60.5% last year. The higher participation rate was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both with higher average transaction values. The average monthly collection rate for fiscal 2016 was 11.5% compared to 11.9%. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash received divided by accounts receivable. The change of rate over prior year is due primarily to 2 reasons: First, as our mix of bridal increases due to our best in bridal strategy, this creates a higher average receivable. By design, the repayment rate is lower as the price point of merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sale and therefore, the repayment is longer. So this leaves a higher outstanding receivable to be collected. And second, like other consumer loans, more principal is paid off later in the life of the loan and interest is paid earlier. So as our portfolios grow more in the last year, proportionally more of that will be repaid later. 
Our allowance as a percent of AR increased 20 basis points due principally to higher receivable balances and higher bad debt. So continuing down Slide 14. Our fiscal 2016 net bad debt was $190.5 million and that compares to $160 million last year. The increase of $30.5 million was driven principally by higher penetration and receivable balances.
Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all of our other operating income line on our income statement was $252.5 million compared to $217.9 million last year. The increase of $34.6 million was due primarily to more interest income on a higher outstanding receivable base. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated a full year operating profit of $62 million compared to $57.9 million in the prior year. As you can see on the slide, similar trends also existed for the fourth quarter between net bad debt and financing costs. In addition, as we have disclosed in our February 29 prerelease, our year-end valuation allowance and nonperforming metrics improved as management had expected compared to the third quarter. This improvement was driven not only by the normal seasonality we customarily see, but also due to excellent credit execution and credit marketing initiatives designed to favorably influence credit receivable mix. The visibility that we have into our credit portfolio performance, which includes daily collections, weekly roll rates to 30, 60, 90 days, and other meaningful indicators, leads us to remain highly confident in the strength of our credit portfolio performance. All of these considerations are factored into our Q1 and annual guidance.
So moving on to capital allocation. I'd like to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we first introduced at this time last year. We have a strong balance sheet that will allow us to invest in our business, execute our strategic priorities, ensuring adequate liquidity and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our investment-grade ratings are important to us because long term, we may return to the debt market. Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x. We ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. And as our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity. We are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenets of our capital allocation policy. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and/or dividends, assuming no other strategic uses of capital. And in recent years, we have grown both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the existing authorization of $136 billion.
So now let's talk about our financial guidance. Signet's first quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 3% to 4% and first quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.90 to $1.95, a growth rate of 17% to 20%. We anticipate repurchasing approximately 125 million of Signet's stock during the first quarter. We are also initiating annual earnings guidance, along with our customary quarterly guidance. And we are doing this in order to more effectively communicate the effect of the upwardly revised synergies, which Mark discussed, and the timing of how these synergies will flow. To fostering more long-term view of its model, Signet intends to continue with annual earnings guidance in lieu of quarterly earnings guidance after fiscal 2017.
For fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 3% to 4.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55, a growth rate of 20% to 25%. We are planning for the strong earnings flow to come about through both gross margin and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies and the SG&A leverage should flow to the marketing and organizational design efficiencies.
Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be about 28%. Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million, driven by combination of store remodels, store growth, information technology and facilities expenditure. Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5% and this is greater than what we had previously guided of 2% to 3%. Most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than enclosed malls, and is focused on higher ROI store banners.
In closing, we're extremely pleased with our financial performance and the progress that we have made on our synergies today. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

Thank you, again. When it comes to what we're doing in customer acquisition through our advertising specifically, the learnings that we've gotten from our segmentation study has really helped us out to focusing on our store brands primary customer. So for example, in Zales, we have a primary customer and we've adjusted our advertising creative to capture more of the Zales segmented primary customer, which is different than that of Kay's and Jared, in which we got wonderful reactions of the consumers and from our store staff just seeing people coming in and really reacting to the ad so well, and we did the same for Jared as well. And also Kay was kind of on the mark the most with their -- with our customer segmentation. So with the guy being the hero in the ads and everything else. So what we did, is not only did we enhance the creative, we also increased our marketing spend. So increased our spend for Zales this fourth quarter, we increased our spend for Jared this fourth quarter, and Kay is kind of at a point where we don't think it's beneficial to increase the spend. What we did is we spread Kay's advertising to start earlier in October and to talk about the bridal business, which we believe that definitely benefited Kay's throughout the fourth quarter. So it's about increasing our marketing spend and thoughtfully and targeted. It's about enhancing our creative to make sure we are capturing that segmented customer better within our store banners."

And the competitive set of Jared is primarily, obviously outside the mall. And if you look at the jewelry industry as a whole, I mentioned it earlier if you look at Jared for the year, Jared actually captured profitable market share as compared to the overarching jewelry industry. And again, the majority of Jared customers is outside the mall and the majority of jewelry customers are outside the mall So to compare Jared to Kay and Zales is just not really a fair comparison. That being said, we did have a lot of good learnings through our segmentation study that shared with us, that we need to talk to and communicate with those customers differently, both from a marketing perspective and from a selling perspective. And we had some enhancements to our selling techniques in our Jared stores. We think it's doing better, but this is a transitional stage for Jared. We're actually very excited about Jared opportunity this year. These transitions don't happen overnight, but we believe come to the fourth quarter, the Jared has a lot of wonderful advantages that we've announced already that we're going to have Pandora shop-in-shops in our stores. And we believe, that the Pandora is a tremendous partner and will increase our foot traffic coming to our stores. We've now -- are putting Vera Wang is now in our Jared stores. We have unique advertising for Jared Vera Wang, and we also are going to have some more unique Vera Wang products within our Jared stores. We also have a very special program that is perfectly targeted to the Jared customer that we call the Chosen Diamond. We'll talk more about this, but it was tested in the fourth quarter, did extremely well, and it's where our customer can literally track their diamond from the point in the mine that it came out of to our cutting factory in Botswana, and track it all the way to the point where it's on their beautiful spouse's or spouse-to-be's hand. So we are very excited about what's going to happen for Jared this year, but it'll take time to transition the business. But I want to end with, we still believe Jared is capturing profitable market share when you compare to the overarching jewelry industry."

When we talked about back in the IR Day that 9% margin that was just looking at the float through synergies, and what we said is when you looked at our other growth within the Zale business that, that was really more like a 12% or so number. So that's in my mind, I think of it more as a 12% versus the 9%.  And then we said long term, we saw the Zale margin getting to 15%. So the one thing I would say is that, and Mark had mentioned this in the prepared remarks, the synergies are flowing across our business division. And so that's not to say that -- I would just caution you to think that the majority of this is flowing through Zale, it really is across all of it. With that said, sure, the higher synergies does imply that there's higher medium and long-term operating margin expectation, and so I think if you take that upwardly provided synergy guidance and just flow it through, split it and flow it through from the guidance we gave on IR Day, you'll get the updated, and will get you to the updated margin number."

In the comments, the prepared comments we talked about, we're really excited about our gross margin expansion that we expect to see in fiscal 2017. And when we think about that expansion, it will primarily be driven by synergies as we move forward. Commodity costs is always a factor in our gross margin. What I would say though, think about that we are on the average inventory costs. So changes in gold don't flow-through as quick in our P&L, this is primarily a synergy driven gross margin expansion on both sides."

And I'm wondering if perhaps, maybe you are being a little bit conservative on your guidance because if you take the 685 that you -- 686 that you earned, and then you tax effect the synergies and let's say we use the midpoint of the synergy savings, that's about $1.30 and then you've got the ADS credit benefit this year that you didn't have last year, that's another $0.20. The way I'm adding it up, it looks to me like you are getting $1.50 lift from synergies and credit and that would take you to about an 840 number. So it would seem like you're just kind of adding the synergies and the credit benefit with no organic growth from the core business. So I'm wondering if I'm looking at it the right way or perhaps missing something?"

Again, it goes on the heels, I really, really caution anybody from taking the synergies, and trying to look at the synergies and then what's happening in the organic growth. This is very much integrated. It's not split that way and it really is not a fair characterization as we don't operate our business as I mentioned before in our preacquisition mode and a new one. Synergies flow across our business. And so for example, and I know Mark also provided this during the prepared remarks, a portion of our revenue includes revenue synergies, such as cross-selling. He gave Ever Us as an example, which is a -- it's permanent part of our business and so that's in our synergy number. It's mutually benefiting all of our divisions across the board. So you really can't start parsing out what's core and what's not core. The other comment I'd say, Jeff, is keep in mind this is the first time that we are issuing annual guidance and it is early in the year. So stay tuned, we'll see how the year develops. And also, just want to remind you that when you look at the annual guidance we did provide, it's the EPS growth range, I mentioned up 20% to 25%."

On the marketing front, Oliver, in the second half, there are several things. First of all, we are continuing to refine our creative and to get closer and closer and get continued reads from our segmented customer as relates to Kay, Zales, Jared and by the way we just had a segmented study, segmentation study in the U.K. for both our H. Samuel brand and our Ernest Jones brand, and we also are conducting and just finished a study of our Peoples brand in the United Kingdom -- excuse me, in Canada. So we will continue to refine our creative to make sure we're penetrating and connecting more to those segmented customer appropriately with appropriate banners. In addition to that, we will continue to invest thoughtfully and strategically and targeted additional marketing spend for all of our brands where appropriate. So on the marketing side, it's continued refinement of the creative to connect to the segmented customer and increased investment in TV media and an increase investment in digital, we're putting a lot of time, money and effort behind our omni-channel experiencing, and making sure that there's a connectivity from the digital perspective whether it'd be online to in-store and then the connectivities. We're putting a lot of investments in our -- in the special omni-channel experiences that can only be differentiated by us. On the merchandising side, we have a lot of exciting news, I mentioned that the extensions in Ever Us, I will tell you that historically, in the jewelry industry, when a Beacon program is announced, and the Beacon program, in the past, for those you don't understand or are tied to the jewelry industry, our programs like the past, present and future anniversary band, which is 15 years ago, or the journey necklace, these are programs that we -- they are called Beacon programs, and we call our Ever Us program a Beacon program as we focus on in targeting and highlighting one item to expand and usually year 2 is a better year for Beacon programs, consistently year 2 outperforms. So we're excited about the year 2 because the customers are just getting the idea understanding what Ever Us represents and is gaining momentum. So we're just seeing a naturally lift, and the more and more customer understand Ever Us is a huge benefit, but compounded with that, we're testing extensions. We're testing earrings, we're testing bracelets, we're testing different styles of rings. So Ever Us is still a very exciting opportunity for the second half this year. I mentioned in Jared, we have an exciting new diamond program that we're in test mode, that's chosen, we're very excited about our shop-in-shop Pandora stores within our Jared stores. We've got other items that are in our innovation laboratory that are being tested as we speak. We are -- as you can see from our guidance, we feel very excited about our exciting initiatives when it comes to marketing and merchandising, and it also, you didn't ask about it, but I will share with you, the more and more we engage with our field forces, the better they get. The more we train them, the better they can deliver a superior customer experience because after everything said and done, the most important equation is how that customer is served across the counter and delivering those established products. So that's my answer to that part of the question, Michele?"

So I will take the credit. And so again, what I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing stability in our credit metrics and very confident in terms of our credit portfolio performance, all of which is factored in our Q1 and our annual guidance. So with that said, and I think, this kind of hit on also on the heels of Lorraine's question, but directionally, in Q1, when you see the relationship of our net bad debt expense and finance charge income, would expect that to be broadly in line with last year with I think there's a timing out accounts in last year's number. So you have to take that into effect and it would broadly be the same, and on a full year basis as a percentage of sales that net relationship of bad debt and finance charge will also be broadly in line with fiscal '16. And I would make the same comment when you think about the allowance as a percentage of our receivable. Getting into ROI in terms and the hybrid approach that we have with ADS and our in-house, which really is a unique case for us. And first of all, I think, Oliver, it's really important to note that our overall credit portfolio is still highly profitable, and we have successfully managed this portfolio over 30 years in all types of business cycles. The virtues of having our in-house credit program, given the sales and earnings flow-through when you think about the interest income, the lifetime value of our credit customers, how it complements our best in bridal strategy, I mean, all of these factors really provide a competitive advantage for us to operate this in-house credit program. Now with that said, and as you mentioned, we have ADS that's providing the credit in Zale. So we do have this optimal test case in front of us and this hybrid model will allow us to continue to evaluate the pros and cons of an in-house credit program. And this is no different than any other aspect of our business that we always are continuing to evaluate our business and ways to enhance shareholder value."

But we have, and we'll be sharing more with you once we have some more of our tests vetted out, but we see omni-channel being a critical part of the jewelry experience. And I said this before, but arguably in our business, more than any other retail because we know that a vast majority of jewelry and diamond customers go online first. They need to educate themselves online. So one of the things that we have done is we put together a website called JewelryWise, which is an educational website that just answers customers questions about diamonds or emeralds or gold and questions they have, and just experiencing -- letting customers experience education about our products is another way and connecting all of this education in-store and online."

And we continue to test, Dorothy, will be continually looking and testing all of our different opportunities of a cross-selling, but those are some of the major, major lifts.

There are 5 key messages I would like you to take away from our presentation today. First, in what has been a choppy retail environment, we were able to deliver record EPS at the high end of our guidance. Our operating income, our net income and our earnings per share were all up over 20% year-over-year. This was due in large part to managing our expense structure in disciplined fashion and realizing synergies that position Signet well for the long-term. This prudent expense management included results in credit which Michele will speak about in more detail later. Second, we delivered solid sales for the quarter. Although our sales was slightly below our guidance, they were still strong and deliver on our earnings expectations. Year-to-date, we are gaining profitable market share. The third point I want to take away is that we remain a growth story, a prudent, measured and profitable growth story. We remain on pace and are committed to growing our store square footage. Our disciplined internal rate of return requirement on new stores of 20% remains firm. The growth this year will be led by Kay Jewelers outside the enclosed mall. This is a departure from many other retailers that are having to reduce square footage these days. Fourth, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance. Our first quarter results and sales flow-through keep us position to achieve our year-end goals around EPS, adjusted EPS and synergies, despite a lower sales outlook. And fifth, we are conducting a strategic evaluation of our credit portfolio as we are always looking for ways to optimize our operating business model. Goldman Sachs, who has vast experience in this area, has been engaged as the company's advisor in this process. We will consider a full range of options as we evaluate our in-house and outsourced credit programs. These options include, but are not limited to, optimizing credit offerings; optimizing allocated debt and equity capitalization of the credit portfolio, including potential incremental securitization; bringing all credit function in-house over the long term; in sourcing some credit functions and outsourcing others, and outsourcing all credit functions. This evaluation is a top priority and as we move through this, we will remain focused on executing our operational plans and driving profitable growth in our business. 
Moving on to Slide 4 in the financial highlights. I'll leave the specific numbers and details for Michele, but the main headlines and accomplishments from a financial perspective relates our first quarter as follows. We delivered a good sales gain which included 2.4% comp increase. We delivered operating margin expansion and we leveraged both gross margin and SG&A, coupled with meaningful buyback, which demonstrates our confidence in our business and the value we see in our shares. This led to record first quarter EPS with a double-digit percentage increase, and we have sound cash and liquidity levels and we continue to possess a strong balance sheet with clean inventory and a responsible amount of debt. 
Next, I'd like to discuss the main sales drivers of the first quarter. Like the fourth quarter, results were led by our Ever Us, which is our 2-stoned diamond ring collection. Ever Us is now testing line extension in stores for the holiday season and some are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings, as well as necklace with on-trim looks and innovative fastening systems were also very successful in the first quarter. Branded bridal also grow in Q1. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Brands such as Vera Wang Love and Neil Lane led the way. 
Before I go into what's to come for the back half of our company, I want to take a few moments and make a few comments about our place in the jewelry industry. Our internal research shows definitively that consumers still find jewelry gift-giving as one of the best ways to celebrate life and express love. And the numbers support this. As shown on the left side of Slide 6, with 3 and 5-year compounded annual sale growth rates in the teens and 8% growth for 10 years when figuring the recession, Signet has been gaining and continuously gain market share profitably. We consistently outperformed the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance. Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained competitive advantage. Signet is relatively Amazon-proof, as consumers have consistently shown a desire to touch jewelry and get educated by trusted and train professional before making a highly emotional purchase. We are in a consolidating industry. Jewelry in the U.S. growing in dollars and declining in the number of doors. And we have 3 of the most preeminent brands in the space. We know that there are growth opportunities. And we also know how and where to get them, which makes us even more attractive for investment. 
So why invest in Signet? Firstly, we are the clear jewelry market leader with [indiscernible] than 8% of the total market share in the U.S. and it's a highly fragmented and growing middle market industry. We are a square footage grower and will be for years, and we are consolidating in a growing industry. During calendar 2018, after synergies are done and the Zales business model is ready and operating consistently, we intend to grow Zales outside the mall. We continue to deliver high-quality financial results. Our financial flows through is powerful, with consistent comps and market expansion accelerated by the Zale acquisition. We believe this will lead to long-term EPS growth. Coupled with a solid balance sheet, including prudent inventory management and our financials compared pretty well with most of retail. We continue to have confidence that we'll deliver on our annual earnings guidance. We have many competitive advantages that we're leveraging around our store teams, our marketing and our exciting merchandise programs. But allow me to discuss just a few of our exciting, compelling merchandise line extensions and test that should help us deliver on the year by making the bulk of their contribution in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are successfully testing Ever Us line extensions, such as new diamond ring styles, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. And in our experience, Beacon, or industry's trend that's driving type strategies like this, tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. We are also testing a line of Vera Wang fashion diamond jewelry and pearls and pearl jewelry to capitalize on her strong name and her design expertise. In all of our jewelry stores, we are resetting our Pandora presentation, with beautiful new Pandora store-in-stores. As a part of it, we're selling a broader collection of Pandora products and fashion jewelry and we'll support it with new TV advertising and creative in the fourth quarter. We're rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores which shows the customer each stage of a diamond's journey from a rough diamond to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer segment, who tends to value this type of product and information more so than some of our other store banners. We are also designing brand-new TV created to support the Chosen also for the fourth quarter. And lastly, we have new technology for our store teams in Kay and Jared for the fourth quarter that will enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions. We call it clienteling, [ph] and we're very excited about this potential to drive sales and build relations with our customers and our team members. Okay, now back to Signet's overall investment merits as we continue down Slide 7. Our integration is progressing as planned and delivering the synergies along the way. We are living up to the expectations that we've articulated. Where Signet has pockets of underperformance, we have strategies. For example, at Jared, merchandise, marketing and store operation plans will help us deliver a strong holiday season. And finally, we have a thoughtful and balanced capital allocation policy that accounts for strategic investments, meaningful stock repurchases, dividend increases and the preservation of capital. That concludes my prepared remarks and now I'll turn it over to Michele."
693964,330252171,993140,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

So we'll start with our first quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 3.6% comp increase in the prior year first quarter with all 3 of our divisions delivering positive comp sales. Total sales increased 3.2% and on a constant-exchange basis, total sales increased 3.9% for the quarter. In looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 3.8% to $980 million, which included a comp increase of 2.3% on top of a prior year increase of 2.3%. Sales increases were driven principally by strong sales of select branded bridal jewelry as well as fashion jewelry. The Zale jewelry operating segments total sales increased by 2.3% to $381 million and 3.2% on a constant-currency exchange basis. On a geography basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 3.7% and comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 5.4% comp increase in the prior year. Our Canadian total sales declined 6.2% but increased 0.2% on a constant-currency basis, with comp sales decline of 0.6%. Canada sales continue to be impacted primarily by the Western Region of Canada due to the struggling energy industry. Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and branded bridal. Our Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.5% to $69 million, with comp sales of 5.6% on top of 6.1% last year. Sales increases were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. And in the U.K, our total sales decreased 1.7% to $144 million but increased 4% at constant currency rates. Comp sales grew 3.4% and that's on top of a 6.2% comp increase in the prior year. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases in the U.K. 
So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then we'll turn and we'll look at Signet adjusted results. 
So turning to Slide 9. The table provides the reconciliation of Signet adjusted results to consolidated results. And we're continuing to present this reconciliation in fiscal year 2017 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting, as well as severance and IT implementation expenses associated with our global systems that will drive future synergies. Now the difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. So starting in the lower left portion of the slide, on a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.87 per share and that's up 26.4% over last year. In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution, and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration cost and as I just mentioned, relates to severance that's associated with our organizational design changes and consulting costs related to information technology implementation. Integration costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution. So on an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustments, adjusted EPS was $1.95, an increase about [ph] 24.4% over last year. 
So now looking below our sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $604.4 million or 38.2% of adjusted sales. And that's up 40 basis points due primarily to the Zale division at a variety of synergies such as sourcing, discount controls and vendor terms, as well as some favorability in commodity cost and leverage on store occupancy. Sterling Jewelers gross margin increased by 20 basis points due primarily to commodity cost. The Zale division's adjusted gross margin rate increased 90 basis points as synergies favorably affected many areas, including our merchandise margins, distribution costs and store operating costs. 
Our U.K. gross margin decreased 30 basis points, driven principally by lower sales and merchandise margin deleverage as a result of currency exchange rates. Adjusted SG&A was $456.1 million or 28.8% of adjusted sales, and that compares to $451 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of leverage was due primarily to lower store and corporate payroll expenses associated with our organizational realignment as well as lower advertising expenses. This was offset, in part, by information technology expenses related to Signet's IT global implementation. Other operating income was $74.3 million or 4.7% of sales. This increase of $10.8 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income was $222.6 million, an increase of 14.7% over prior year first quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 14.1% of sales. Now this is a 150 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by the increase in sales, as well as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Adjusted EPS was $1.95, which compares to $1.62 last year, an increase of 20.4%, driven principally by our stronger business performance. 
So now let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll take a look at our inventory. Our strong first quarter and inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 1% compared to our sales growth of 3.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations, but most notably, in branded bridal. We increased Zale inventory turns by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store level inventory closer to Kay averages and improving clearance inventory management. As we moved through Q2, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well positioned. So now we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our first quarter credit sales were $605.1 million compared to $573.1 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.6%, which compare to an increase of 9.2% in the prior year. The higher credit sales was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both would have higher average transaction values. The average monthly payment collection rate for the first quarter fiscal 2017 was 12.3% compared to 12.6% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The change in rate over prior year is due primarily to merchandise mix, as bridal, especially higher-priced branded bridal increases, this creates a higher average initial balance. Now by design, the minimum payment rate declines as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sales, therefore, the repayment period is slightly longer and cash collected as a percentage of the receivables declined slightly. The combination of growth in credit sales and collection rate led to an increase of 11% and our net accounts receivables compared to an increase of 14.7% in net receivables in the prior-year quarter. Our quarter ended net accounts receivable increased to $1.65 billion compared to $1.49 billion last year. Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all the other operating line on our income statement, was $72.8 million compared to $64.4 million last year. The increase of $8.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. Our net bad debt was $33.6 million compared to $28.1 million last year. The increase of $5.5 million was driven by our higher receivable balances. But more specifically, our bad debt provisioning establishes a 3% reserve at origination of the receivables based on historical experience. The higher our credit sales, meaning, the more new volume in accounts receivable, the greater the amount contributes to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Now the net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $39.2 million. And that's compared to $36.3 million in the prior year. 
So looking at some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful accounts metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 6.6% in the first quarter. This was up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. But what's most important is that, as we expected, we made more sequential improvement in Q1 of this year than we did in last year. So why is that? The impact of improved collection execution and credit marketing techniques that we began late last year are making more than just seasonal progress. We improved 40 basis points Q4 to Q1 versus 30 basis points over the same period prior year. Now the same trend was true for our nonperforming portion of our receivables as a percent of the gross receivables. At 3.6%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Again, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was better at 40 basis points down versus 30 basis points down in the prior-year period. Building off the Q4 trends that we had discussed in our year-end earnings call in March, we continue to see the same improvement in trends in Q1 and we anticipate that these trends, broadly speaking, will hold true for the remainder of the year. 
So moving on to our capital allocation. I want to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we had first introduced 14 months ago. We have a strong balance sheet and we have also extended our ABS agreement for an additional year. The strength in our balance sheet and flexibility allows us to invest in our business, execute our strategic priorities and return excess cash to shareholders, all while ensuring adequate liquidity. Our investment grade ratings remains important to us because long term, we may return to the debt markets. Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x and we have ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. As our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity and we are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenant of our capital allocation policy. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of our annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and/or dividends, assuming no other strategic use of capital. In recent years, we have been able to grow both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now, given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the previous program. At the end of the quarter, we had $761 million authorized after our $125 million of Q1 share repurchases. 
So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. Signet's second quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2%, which factors in our quarter-to-date performance and also assumes that the environment remains somewhat muted. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.49 to $1.54. Now for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 2% to 3.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55. The comp range has been reduced 100 basis points from our March guidance. Now we all see the trends out there and with a softer consumer environment, we believe it is appropriate that we proactively reset our comp guidance. With that said, we continue to believe that the $8.25 to $8.55 EPS range is achievable for the following reasons: First and just as a reminder, March was the first time we had issued full year guidance and we are just out of the gate into our new fiscal year and appropriately so, we had guided to an earnings range that gave us room to achieve earnings under various scenarios. Second, we are planning for the strong earnings flow-through to come about through both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies. And the SG&A leverage will flow due to marketing and organizational design efficiencies, as well as additional expense levers within management's control. We proved this capability in Q1 where we are able to deliver at the high end of the EPS range despite lower sales from the guidance. And as a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our EPS guidance. 
Now as to other aspects of our guidance. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Under the recent U.S. Treasury and IRS proposed regulations, tax treatment of related party debt and the tax deductibility of interest expense are limited to only certain related party transactions. Signet's related party financing arrangements, which stem primarily from the Zale acquisition, are grandfathered under the proposal and there is no impact on our short- to medium-term forecasted effective tax rate. Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million, driven by a combination of new stores, store remodels, information technology and facilities expenditures. Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5%, with most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues, other than in-closed malls. We are also reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance which we increased February 29. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. That means the $60 million we realized last year plus another $98 million to $115 [ph] million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies.

We're seeing decline as everybody else is seeing a decline that we saw in the first quarter. We do have a third-party company that tracks the traffic in the malls, and it is showing that the retail traffic as a whole was down for the first quarter. We have some traffic counters in our Jared stores, some in our Kay stores. And we're seeing declines, not as much you're seeing with some of the third-party provider out there. But to your point, bridal is our stable type of business where it is a premeditated purchase, and people are coming in to our stores thinking about bridal and shopping beforehand. So we don't believe we're as affected by retail traffic in jewelry as our retail competitors, but there is an affect obviously if there's less people in the malls, and more so, like you said, for gift-giving. Now gift-giving is also a premeditated purchase, but we're just seeing less traffic in the malls as of right now and just overall retail traffic is down. But we still the consumer is vibrant out there, and we're seeing in -- on our own sales, we're seeing that we had a very respectable comp increase as it relates compared to the rest of the retail industry world."

And in this category, as I stated, the customer engagement is critical. The experience that they have in the stores is critical. We believe that our team members in our stores are better trained and better equipped to educate our customers on this critical and emotional customers and educate our customers about the quality of the diamonds and understanding their needs.

So let me start with your question in terms of -- so gross margin and SG&A and some of the primary drivers that we're very much focused on. So first, just start at with the synergies of -- and really pushing the synergies through gross margin both with SG&A. I mentioned in the call of, the gross margin, what we're really starting to see if we [indiscernible] and we continue to expect to have opportunities as we move into the year on the synergy front, really relate to our discounting controls that we put in place. There's repairs. Our vendor term. We did actually move from in-sourcing our special events to outsourcing that. That's just had a favorable impact on the gross margin. So there's a lot related to synergies that we see flowing through there. And in addition, there's still a little bit of favorability we're getting out of [indiscernible] cost front. That's flowing through the gross margin. On the SG&A side, on the synergy front, we've seen a lot of work and we talked about this during the fourth quarter where we had accelerated some of the work around our organizational design efficiency. And so we're starting to see those benefits. We'll continue to see the benefits flowing through [indiscernible] to that in terms of payroll savings. We've also really had been looking at optimizing our labor scheduling as it relates to our store payroll. So we continue to expect to see favorability flowing through that in the years leveraging our SG&A. And then more importantly, as i was referencing, there's additional expense levers that management really does have control over. And although we'll want to continue to preserve our more customer-facing expenses, those expenses such as our advertising line item, et cetera, for those that are less direct to customer-facing, whether it's our travels, supplies, our SportsCenter, those are the ones that we're really able to tighten our belt and really taking more disciplined approach to give us the confidence that we'll be able to hit our EPS guidance."

And I want to start off by stating -- and I just need to start off because we said in the announcement that our credit metrics and our credit portfolio are strong. As we said, our credit metrics are improving sequentially and within our expectations and all we thought for and involved in our earnings guidance both on a quarterly basis and on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are strong. To answer your questions, the reason why we're doing this credit project, to your point is, yes, we have had some good experience with ADS. We've had a full quarter now under our belt where ADS has been managing our entire credit portfolio for Zales from January through now. We're having some good experiences, and we're learning more. And at Signet, we're an evolving company. We're always looking for ways to better improve our business, our [indiscernible] business. That being said, we always feel those ways for us to getting smarter understanding more about our business. And we also seen other major retailers out there. And I'm sure a lot of you know of them that have carried internal receivables and have sold their receivables and have done work with receivables of recent. And we just understand, as an evolution, I want to make sure that we're on top of it. We're a business that is constantly looking for ways to improve our sales. Actually, our mission statement is we're always looking to continuously improve. So we look at every facet of our business on a regular basis to make sure that we're continuously improving how we can enhance our business for operations and for our shareholder. And credit is no different. We've done major credit announcements in the past. So as we mentioned -- as I mentioned in my remarks, Oliver, possible outcomes could be outsourcing of all credit functions, possible outcomes could be some in-housing our credit functions, some could be outsourced. Other things that we'll be analyzing as a way of optimizing our debt structures on Accounts Receivable. Can we optimize our credit offerings? We're looking at variations of options to make sure that we're improving our ability to do sales, maximizing our profitability and enhancing our business model. And as far as timing goes, Oliver, it's a top priority for us. We will be thoughtful, though, and we'll be diligent about the work that we're going to be to take time to be very thoughtful. And we are working real-time right now with Goldman Sachs on this with a lot of experience in this world and has done a lot of this type of work with other retailers. So that's why we're comfortable sharing with you today, but we're not going to share time line with you because we want to do this thoughtful and methodically. But we will keep you up to date when appropriate."

The provision will be the same. [indiscernible] will be the same. But to that point, the reason why we use our recency is, one, we have done it since the beginning of time and it really has worked well for us over the years with the type of lending that we do. Jewelry lending, that emotional connection. And it does optimize our collection for us. And so with the use of the recency, it does help us to engage with the borrowers, start collecting quicker. And it gives the customers flexibility based on the disciplined criteria that we had outlined for recency aging on what a customer has to be [indiscernible] to stay current. [indiscernible] that customer in good standing if they're having a challenging month where they can remit a full payment. And that psychology and that flexibility of working with that customer puts that customer first. And that, at the end of the day, really drives maximization and optimization of our collection efforts. And then as I said, importantly, the financial results will be the same. That will continue. And when you see the 10-Q that we plan to file within the next week or so, you'll -- in the footnote, you'll see the same type of a breakdown of our aging. So we've continued to provide that, the 30 day, 60 [indiscernible] and the 90 days. In terms of FICO scores, that will be an annual disclosure for us. But what I can tell you is that FICO scores are broadly in the same range of what we saw in Q4, which everybody would expect, that you're not going to have major shift quarter-to-quarter on that."

And we still feel very strong and build good increase for Zales going forward. There, we continue to see benefits from our cross-selling of brands. We continue to see tremendous benefit. And we think there's going to be a huge benefit for the Zales having our repair business, repair business being internal, not being done by third-party contractors, which will help the top line not only in the business, but ultimately, you take care of a repair customer, you have a new customer for life. And you take care of that customer. So we have a lot of areas of the business that are going to increase the top line, but we're focused in, right now, making sure that we get the model in place and we get the appropriate level of SG&A in line for that business model. So we do see good opportunities to continue to grow Zales going forward. And if you look at the accounts of the Zales business itself, in this past first quarter, it was up over 3.5%, which is better than most of retail. So we're still very, very good about the opportunities for Zales on the sales line. As far as there could be average sales in Pandora, we did see some of these slowing down, but not in our Pandora business. We have a big business. Pandora is just in our Jared stores. And we're very happy and excited about our Pandora partnership. As we said, we have these new stores. It will take us a year to roll them out, but we will have all of our new stores, our new stores, Pandora stores in our Jared stores by the 1st of November. Right now, we just completed about 50 doors and initials -- early but initial sales results are very better -- very good to us. So we see great opportunities with Pandora and increasing our partnership and Pandora. And a big benefit of Pandora partnership that we have, Simeon, is not just selling more beads, but Pandora's done a great job of designing new jewelry products at lower price points that we really haven't done a great job with in the past and have not had a good inventory assortment of the Pandora jewelry products.

In addition, we did some field training related to the ADS rollout. I'd also say that when we think about the credit value proposition, it relates to ADS.

We guided -- so we had to be 3% to 4%, and we put that guidance out there March 26. We had Valentines down to our belt. That being said, we had April ahead of us, which leads up to obviously some critical shopping for Mother's Day. And there was a slowdown in April. If you just look at what we had accomplished compared to what our guidance was, at the time we gave the guidance, there as no doubt there's a slowdown of April that we experienced, like all of retail. We're all been exposed all the retail numbers out there for the first quarter. So our numbers slowdowns were better than most. That being said, going into May, we're seeing a similar level to May, not better, not worse. You're seeing a little -- similar levels. So the guidance we've given you for Q2 is assuming that things don't get better and things don't get worse from an economic environment basis. But even though you didn't ask, I want to say to you that we still feel very strongly about our earnings guidance for the year. And we believe that we have a great opportunities in the second half as I stated. And we have a lot of initiatives, Ike. We have more initiative this year than we even had last year. As I mentioned with the extension of [indiscernible]  As I mentioned with the Chosen Diamond for Jared that tested wonderfully. We're excited about the Pandora store in stores. We're very excited about the Vera Wang extension that's going into diamond jewelry and pearl jewelry. And we're very, very excited about this new technology that are enabling our people in our stores to be more sophisticated and be more knowledgeable about their customers' past experience and what they bought and what they can go buy in the future to help them communicate better with our customers. So yes, we saw a slowdown in April, but we're still outperforming most of retail and we still feel very bullish, assuming the economy stays stable, that we're going to have a very good second half and fourth quarter."

And all that it has done -- been done manually the past, we're going to be able now and to having give our associates real-time information through their iPads to understand what their customers have bought in the past, what birthdays are coming up, how to communicate with them more intelligently  also be able to use this term -- this technology for CRM.

And [indiscernible] Jared and for Kay, they will be fully ready for this aspect of this new technology for the fourth quarter, and we think there's a good opportunity to increase our sales and get incremental sales, which is communicating more effectively with our customers. As far as Vera Wang and the extension of jewelry, we just think it's a great opportunity. Vera, as I said, is a tremendous designer. And she's just such credibility in the bridal area, and she has a great eye so she can design some beautiful jewelry, pearl jewelry, pearls and diamond jewelry for us and for our business. And so far, it's testing well. And we don't want to say for certain because they're still in the testing zone, if the test continues to be successful, we may see some major extensions of Vera Wang jewelry roll out potentially in our sales stores for the fourth quarter. But we'll keep you up to speed on that. As far as Ever Us goes, as you said, Dorothy, it is a tremendous success story for us and having an item and a trend that we've created. And we just -- this just continue to grow for us. And the test that we're starting to see in necklaces, we see opportunities potentially other parts of jewelry, different styles are really going well. we don't see a slowdown. As we -- as I said in my prepared remarks, from our experience, these types of trend changing are beacon-type strategies. From our experience, that should gain momentum because as well as it did for us last year and into this year, it's still a small, small portion of customers out there that have -- just really an understanding of what Ever Us is all about. So we believe, there's tremendous upside for the Ever Us collection going into the fourth quarter and into the future."

Look, the fashion business is a business that we've had to stay on top of and it's not -- you got to continue -- investing it in and innovate new opportunities and used us updated with Ever Us. And we have a lot of exciting things in the pipeline. I touched on several of them. One is Pandora is all about fashion. Pandora jewelry is all about fashion. When you think about the Vera Wang designs and what we're going to do, it's all about fashion. So we have a lot in the works, and we're testing the pipeline. We're just showing some for competitive reasons, that we're always looking to be innovative and look for new ways of continuing to test new things in fashion. Dorothy, given opportunity, to just say something broader. For us to continually gain market share in the jewelry industry over the last 5, 10 and 20 years, and for us to continue going forward, we, as a company, have got to be innovative. We got to consistently have new ideas in the pipeline, not only as it relates to fashion, which is critical, but all facets of our business. So we are continuing -- that's why we opened the design center. That's why our designers are continually looking for new ways and looking at fashion trends to continually test and look for new ways to sell fashion and gift-giving products to our customers. So we believe in the good, healthy pipeline in fashion. As far as the jewelry business goes, Janet, we have said that we believe -- firmly, we believe that, even though Jared's comps were down in the first quarter, total sales were up. And we believe are gaining profitable market share in the jewelry industry. We believe that firmly because Jared is growing at a healthy, profitable way. That being said, we have made some enhancements and refinements to the Jared model. We talked about how we've changed the selling tactics that we use. We talked about how we're changing some of the assortment that we're having. We're getting more involved in some fashion getting more involved with some lower price point fashion products. getting more involved with designers like Vera Wang. We've also talked about how we're continually looking for ways to enhance our selling coverage and how we'd sell to the Jared customer. And the Jared customer, we learned in our segmentation analyses that they are looking for some -- a little bit more promotions. They are looking for some sales every once in a while. So we were testing that also. And Janet, we're also testing radio advertising in certain markets because continuity of radio is a strong thing. And we're selling products in Jared engagement and Jared's 12 months a year, not just in the 12 weeks that we advertise on TV. So we are actually very bullish on our Jared business. We believe that we've got a lot of good things going on Jared's and are in a transition stage where they're changing the inventory up little bit. We're continuing to change the selling tactics that we have -- tactics that we have and still working on testing some new bounce-back programs that we have in coupons and promotion. So again, we feel very bullish about how Jared perform in the fourth quarter, a long as the economy is consistent and operating consistently."

There are 5 key messages I would like you to take away from our presentation today.

There are 5 key messages I would like you to take away from our presentation today. First, in what has been a choppy retail environment, we were able to deliver record EPS at the high end of our guidance. Our operating income, our net income and our earnings per share were all up over 20% year-over-year. This was due in large part to managing our expense structure in disciplined fashion and realizing synergies that position Signet well for the long-term. This prudent expense management included results in credit which Michele will speak about in more detail later. Second, we delivered solid sales for the quarter. Although our sales was slightly below our guidance, they were still strong and deliver on our earnings expectations. Year-to-date, we are gaining profitable market share. The third point I want to take away is that we remain a growth story, a prudent, measured and profitable growth story. We remain on pace and are committed to growing our store square footage. Our disciplined internal rate of return requirement on new stores of 20% remains firm. The growth this year will be led by Kay Jewelers outside the enclosed mall. This is a departure from many other retailers that are having to reduce square footage these days. Fourth, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance. Our first quarter results and sales flow-through keep us position to achieve our year-end goals around EPS, adjusted EPS and synergies, despite a lower sales outlook. And fifth, we are conducting a strategic evaluation of our credit portfolio as we are always looking for ways to optimize our operating business model. Goldman Sachs, who has vast experience in this area, has been engaged as the company's advisor in this process. We will consider a full range of options as we evaluate our in-house and outsourced credit programs. These options include, but are not limited to, optimizing credit offerings; optimizing allocated debt and equity capitalization of the credit portfolio, including potential incremental securitization; bringing all credit function in-house over the long term; in sourcing some credit functions and outsourcing others, and outsourcing all credit functions. This evaluation is a top priority and as we move through this, we will remain focused on executing our operational plans and driving profitable growth in our business. 
Moving on to Slide 4 in the financial highlights. I'll leave the specific numbers and details for Michele, but the main headlines and accomplishments from a financial perspective relates our first quarter as follows. We delivered a good sales gain which included 2.4% comp increase. We delivered operating margin expansion and we leveraged both gross margin and SG&A, coupled with meaningful buyback, which demonstrates our confidence in our business and the value we see in our shares. This led to record first quarter EPS with a double-digit percentage increase, and we have sound cash and liquidity levels and we continue to possess a strong balance sheet with clean inventory and a responsible amount of debt. 
Next, I'd like to discuss the main sales drivers of the first quarter. Like the fourth quarter, results were led by our Ever Us, which is our 2-stoned diamond ring collection. Ever Us is now testing line extension in stores for the holiday season and some are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings, as well as necklace with on-trim looks and innovative fastening systems were also very successful in the first quarter. Branded bridal also grow in Q1. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Brands such as Vera Wang Love and Neil Lane led the way. 
Before I go into what's to come for the back half of our company, I want to take a few moments and make a few comments about our place in the jewelry industry. Our internal research shows definitively that consumers still find jewelry gift-giving as one of the best ways to celebrate life and express love. And the numbers support this. As shown on the left side of Slide 6, with 3 and 5-year compounded annual sale growth rates in the teens and 8% growth for 10 years when figuring the recession, Signet has been gaining and continuously gain market share profitably. We consistently outperformed the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance. Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained competitive advantage. Signet is relatively Amazon-proof, as consumers have consistently shown a desire to touch jewelry and get educated by trusted and train professional before making a highly emotional purchase. We are in a consolidating industry. Jewelry in the U.S. growing in dollars and declining in the number of doors. And we have 3 of the most preeminent brands in the space. We know that there are growth opportunities. And we also know how and where to get them, which makes us even more attractive for investment. 
So why invest in Signet? Firstly, we are the clear jewelry market leader with [indiscernible] than 8% of the total market share in the U.S. and it's a highly fragmented and growing middle market industry. We are a square footage grower and will be for years, and we are consolidating in a growing industry. During calendar 2018, after synergies are done and the Zales business model is ready and operating consistently, we intend to grow Zales outside the mall. We continue to deliver high-quality financial results. Our financial flows through is powerful, with consistent comps and market expansion accelerated by the Zale acquisition. We believe this will lead to long-term EPS growth. Coupled with a solid balance sheet, including prudent inventory management and our financials compared pretty well with most of retail. We continue to have confidence that we'll deliver on our annual earnings guidance. We have many competitive advantages that we're leveraging around our store teams, our marketing and our exciting merchandise programs. But allow me to discuss just a few of our exciting, compelling merchandise line extensions and test that should help us deliver on the year by making the bulk of their contribution in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are successfully testing Ever Us line extensions, such as new diamond ring styles, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. And in our experience, Beacon, or industry's trend that's driving type strategies like this, tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. We are also testing a line of Vera Wang fashion diamond jewelry and pearls and pearl jewelry to capitalize on her strong name and her design expertise. In all of our jewelry stores, we are resetting our Pandora presentation, with beautiful new Pandora store-in-stores. As a part of it, we're selling a broader collection of Pandora products and fashion jewelry and we'll support it with new TV advertising and creative in the fourth quarter. We're rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores which shows the customer each stage of a diamond's journey from a rough diamond to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer segment, who tends to value this type of product and information more so than some of our other store banners. We are also designing brand-new TV created to support the Chosen also for the fourth quarter. And lastly, we have new technology for our store teams in Kay and Jared for the fourth quarter that will enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions. We call it clienteling, [ph] and we're very excited about this potential to drive sales and build relations with our customers and our team members. Okay, now back to Signet's overall investment merits as we continue down Slide 7. Our integration is progressing as planned and delivering the synergies along the way. We are living up to the expectations that we've articulated. Where Signet has pockets of underperformance, we have strategies. For example, at Jared, merchandise, marketing and store operation plans will help us deliver a strong holiday season. And finally, we have a thoughtful and balanced capital allocation policy that accounts for strategic investments, meaningful stock repurchases, dividend increases and the preservation of capital. That concludes my prepared remarks and now I'll turn it over to Michele."

Signet's comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 3.6% comp increase in the prior year first quarter with all 3 of our divisions delivering positive c",2255,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So we'll start with our first quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 3.6% comp increase in the prior year first quarter with all 3 of our divisions delivering positive comp sales. Total sales increased 3.2% and on a constant-exchange basis, total sales increased 3.9% for the quarter. In looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 3.8% to $980 million, which included a comp increase of 2.3% on top of a prior year increase of 2.3%. Sales increases were driven principally by strong sales of select branded bridal jewelry as well as fashion jewelry. The Zale jewelry operating segments total sales increased by 2.3% to $381 million and 3.2% on a constant-currency exchange basis. On a geography basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 3.7% and comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 5.4% comp increase in the prior year. Our Canadian total sales declined 6.2% but increased 0.2% on a constant-currency basis, with comp sales decline of 0.6%. Canada sales continue to be impacted primarily by the Western Region of Canada due to the struggling energy industry. Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and branded bridal. Our Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.5% to $69 million, with comp sales of 5.6% on top of 6.1% last year. Sales increases were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. And in the U.K, our total sales decreased 1.7% to $144 million but increased 4% at constant currency rates. Comp sales grew 3.4% and that's on top of a 6.2% comp increase in the prior year. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases in the U.K. 
So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then we'll turn and we'll look at Signet adjusted results. 
So turning to Slide 9. The table provides the reconciliation of Signet adjusted results to consolidated results. And we're continuing to present this reconciliation in fiscal year 2017 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting, as well as severance and IT implementation expenses associated with our global systems that will drive future synergies. Now the difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. So starting in the lower left portion of the slide, on a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.87 per share and that's up 26.4% over last year. In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution, and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration cost and as I just mentioned, relates to severance that's associated with our organizational design changes and consulting costs related to information technology implementation. Integration costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution. So on an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustments, adjusted EPS was $1.95, an increase about [ph] 24.4% over last year. 
So now looking below our sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $604.4 million or 38.2% of adjusted sales. And that's up 40 basis points due primarily to the Zale division at a variety of synergies such as sourcing, discount controls and vendor terms, as well as some favorability in commodity cost and leverage on store occupancy. Sterling Jewelers gross margin increased by 20 basis points due primarily to commodity cost. The Zale division's adjusted gross margin rate increased 90 basis points as synergies favorably affected many areas, including our merchandise margins, distribution costs and store operating costs. 
Our U.K. gross margin decreased 30 basis points, driven principally by lower sales and merchandise margin deleverage as a result of currency exchange rates. Adjusted SG&A was $456.1 million or 28.8% of adjusted sales, and that compares to $451 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of leverage was due primarily to lower store and corporate payroll expenses associated with our organizational realignment as well as lower advertising expenses. This was offset, in part, by information technology expenses related to Signet's IT global implementation. Other operating income was $74.3 million or 4.7% of sales. This increase of $10.8 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income was $222.6 million, an increase of 14.7% over prior year first quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 14.1% of sales. Now this is a 150 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by the increase in sales, as well as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Adjusted EPS was $1.95, which compares to $1.62 last year, an increase of 20.4%, driven principally by our stronger business performance. 
So now let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll take a look at our inventory. Our strong first quarter and inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 1% compared to our sales growth of 3.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations, but most notably, in branded bridal. We increased Zale inventory turns by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store level inventory closer to Kay averages and improving clearance inventory management. As we moved through Q2, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well positioned. So now we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our first quarter credit sales were $605.1 million compared to $573.1 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.6%, which compare to an increase of 9.2% in the prior year. The higher credit sales was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both would have higher average transaction values. The average monthly payment collection rate for the first quarter fiscal 2017 was 12.3% compared to 12.6% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The change in rate over prior year is due primarily to merchandise mix, as bridal, especially higher-priced branded bridal increases, this creates a higher average initial balance. Now by design, the minimum payment rate declines as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sales, therefore, the repayment period is slightly longer and cash collected as a percentage of the receivables declined slightly. The combination of growth in credit sales and collection rate led to an increase of 11% and our net accounts receivables compared to an increase of 14.7% in net receivables in the prior-year quarter. Our quarter ended net accounts receivable increased to $1.65 billion compared to $1.49 billion last year. Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all the other operating line on our income statement, was $72.8 million compared to $64.4 million last year. The increase of $8.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. Our net bad debt was $33.6 million compared to $28.1 million last year. The increase of $5.5 million was driven by our higher receivable balances. But more specifically, our bad debt provisioning establishes a 3% reserve at origination of the receivables based on historical experience. The higher our credit sales, meaning, the more new volume in accounts receivable, the greater the amount contributes to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Now the net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $39.2 million. And that's compared to $36.3 million in the prior year. 
So looking at some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful accounts metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 6.6% in the first quarter. This was up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. But what's most important is that, as we expected, we made more sequential improvement in Q1 of this year than we did in last year. So why is that? The impact of improved collection execution and credit marketing techniques that we began late last year are making more than just seasonal progress. We improved 40 basis points Q4 to Q1 versus 30 basis points over the same period prior year. Now the same trend was true for our nonperforming portion of our receivables as a percent of the gross receivables. At 3.6%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Again, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was better at 40 basis points down versus 30 basis points down in the prior-year period. Building off the Q4 trends that we had discussed in our year-end earnings call in March, we continue to see the same improvement in trends in Q1 and we anticipate that these trends, broadly speaking, will hold true for the remainder of the year. 
So moving on to our capital allocation. I want to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we had first introduced 14 months ago. We have a strong balance sheet and we have also extended our ABS agreement for an additional year. The strength in our balance sheet and flexibility allows us to invest in our business, execute our strategic priorities and return excess cash to shareholders, all while ensuring adequate liquidity. Our investment grade ratings remains important to us because long term, we may return to the debt markets. Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x and we have ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. As our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity and we are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenant of our capital allocation policy. We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of our annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and/or dividends, assuming no other strategic use of capital. In recent years, we have been able to grow both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now, given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the previous program. At the end of the quarter, we had $761 million authorized after our $125 million of Q1 share repurchases. 
So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. Signet's second quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2%, which factors in our quarter-to-date performance and also assumes that the environment remains somewhat muted. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.49 to $1.54. Now for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 2% to 3.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55. The comp range has been reduced 100 basis points from our March guidance. Now we all see the trends out there and with a softer consumer environment, we believe it is appropriate that we proactively reset our comp guidance. With that said, we continue to believe that the $8.25 to $8.55 EPS range is achievable for the following reasons: First and just as a reminder, March was the first time we had issued full year guidance and we are just out of the gate into our new fiscal year and appropriately so, we had guided to an earnings range that gave us room to achieve earnings under various scenarios. Second, we are planning for the strong earnings flow-through to come about through both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies. And the SG&A leverage will flow due to marketing and organizational design efficiencies, as well as additional expense levers within management's control. We proved this capability in Q1 where we are able to deliver at the high end of the EPS range despite lower sales from the guidance. And as a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our EPS guidance. 
Now as to other aspects of our guidance. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Under the recent U.S. Treasury and IRS proposed regulations, tax treatment of related party debt and the tax deductibility of interest expense are limited to only certain related party transactions. Signet's related party financing arrangements, which stem primarily from the Zale acquisition, are grandfathered under the proposal and there is no impact on our short- to medium-term forecasted effective tax rate. Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million, driven by a combination of new stores, store remodels, information technology and facilities expenditures. Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5%, with most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues, other than in-closed malls. We are also reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance which we increased February 29. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. That means the $60 million we realized last year plus another $98 million to $115 [ph] million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. So in closing, we are pleased with our earnings performance and our relative financial results today. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

We're seeing decline as everybody else is seeing a decline that we saw in the first quarter.

We have some traffic counters in our Jared stores, some in our Kay stores. And we're seeing declines, not as much you're seeing with some of the third-party provider out there. But to your point, bridal is our stable type of business where it is a premeditated purchase, and people are coming in to our stores thinking about bridal and shopping beforehand. So we don't believe we're as affected by retail traffic in jewelry as our retail competitors, but there is an affect obviously if there's less people in the malls, and more so, like you said, for gift-giving. Now gift-giving is also a premeditated purchase, but we're just seeing less traffic in the malls as of right now and just overall retail traffic is down. But we still the consumer is vibrant out there, and we're seeing in -- on our own sales, we're seeing that we had a very respectable comp increase as it relates compared to the rest of the retail industry world."

So let me start with your question in terms of -- so gross margin and SG&A and some of the primary drivers that we're very much focused on. So first, just start at with the synergies of -- and really pushing the synergies through gross margin both with SG&A. I mentioned in the call of, the gross margin, what we're really starting to see if we [indiscernible] and we continue to expect to have opportunities as we move into the year on the synergy front, really relate to our discounting controls that we put in place. There's repairs. Our vendor term. We did actually move from in-sourcing our special events to outsourcing that. That's just had a favorable impact on the gross margin. So there's a lot related to synergies that we see flowing through there. And in addition, there's still a little bit of favorability we're getting out of [indiscernible] cost front. That's flowing through the gross margin. On the SG&A side, on the synergy front, we've seen a lot of work and we talked about this during the fourth quarter where we had accelerated some of the work around our organizational design efficiency. And so we're starting to see those benefits. We'll continue to see the benefits flowing through [indiscernible] to that in terms of payroll savings. We've also really had been looking at optimizing our labor scheduling as it relates to our store payroll. So we continue to expect to see favorability flowing through that in the years leveraging our SG&A. And then more importantly, as i was referencing, there's additional expense levers that management really does have control over. And although we'll want to continue to preserve our more customer-facing expenses, those expenses such as our advertising line item, et cetera, for those that are less direct to customer-facing, whether it's our travels, supplies, our SportsCenter, those are the ones that we're really able to tighten our belt and really taking more disciplined approach to give us the confidence that we'll be able to hit our EPS guidance."

And I want to start off by stating -- and I just need to start off because we said in the announcement that our credit metrics and our credit portfolio are strong. As we said, our credit metrics are improving sequentially and within our expectations and all we thought for and involved in our earnings guidance both on a quarterly basis and on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are strong. To answer your questions, the reason why we're doing this credit project, to your point is, yes, we have had some good experience with ADS. We've had a full quarter now under our belt where ADS has been managing our entire credit portfolio for Zales from January through now. We're having some good experiences, and we're learning more. And at Signet, we're an evolving company. We're always looking for ways to better improve our business, our [indiscernible] business. That being said, we always feel those ways for us to getting smarter understanding more about our business. And we also seen other major retailers out there. And I'm sure a lot of you know of them that have carried internal receivables and have sold their receivables and have done work with receivables of recent. And we just understand, as an evolution, I want to make sure that we're on top of it. We're a business that is constantly looking for ways to improve our sales. Actually, our mission statement is we're always looking to continuously improve. So we look at every facet of our business on a regular basis to make sure that we're continuously improving how we can enhance our business for operations and for our shareholder. And credit is no different. We've done major credit announcements in the past. So as we mentioned -- as I mentioned in my remarks, Oliver, possible outcomes could be outsourcing of all credit functions, possible outcomes could be some in-housing our credit functions, some could be outsourced. Other things that we'll be analyzing as a way of optimizing our debt structures on Accounts Receivable. Can we optimize our credit offerings? We're looking at variations of options to make sure that we're improving our ability to do sales, maximizing our profitability and enhancing our business model. And as far as timing goes, Oliver, it's a top priority for us. We will be thoughtful, though, and we'll be diligent about the work that we're going to be to take time to be very thoughtful. And we are working real-time right now with Goldman Sachs on this with a lot of experience in this world and has done a lot of this type of work with other retailers. So that's why we're comfortable sharing with you today, but we're not going to share time line with you because we want to do this thoughtful and methodically. But we will keep you up to date when appropriate."

And it gives the customers flexibility based on the disciplined criteria that we had outlined for recency aging on what a customer has to be [indiscernible] to stay current. [indiscernible] that customer in good standing if they're having a challenging month where they can remit a full payment. And that psychology and that flexibility of working with that customer puts that customer first. And that, at the end of the day, really drives maximization and optimization of our collection efforts. And then as I said, importantly, the financial results will be the same. That will continue. And when you see the 10-Q that we plan to file within the next week or so, you'll -- in the footnote, you'll see the same type of a breakdown of our aging. So we've continued to provide that, the 30 day, 60 [indiscernible] and the 90 days. In terms of FICO scores, that will be an annual disclosure for us. But what I can tell you is that FICO scores are broadly in the same range of what we saw in Q4, which everybody would expect, that you're not going to have major shift quarter-to-quarter on that."

And what the team has done in Piercing is they've invested more in 14-karat gold, more in diamonds. So what they're doing is -- and we're training our people to be able to be comfortable selling in Piercing Pagoda, 14-karat gold and diamonds, and [indiscernible] about the business, so getting better over there in Piercing Pagoda even there's less traffic in the mall.

And we still feel very strong and build good increase for Zales going forward. There, we continue to see benefits from our cross-selling of brands. We continue to see tremendous benefit. And we think there's going to be a huge benefit for the Zales having our repair business, repair business being internal, not being done by third-party contractors, which will help the top line not only in the business, but ultimately, you take care of a repair customer, you have a new customer for life. And you take care of that customer. So we have a lot of areas of the business that are going to increase the top line, but we're focused in, right now, making sure that we get the model in place and we get the appropriate level of SG&A in line for that business model. So we do see good opportunities to continue to grow Zales going forward. And if you look at the accounts of the Zales business itself, in this past first quarter, it was up over 3.5%, which is better than most of retail. So we're still very, very good about the opportunities for Zales on the sales line. As far as there could be average sales in Pandora, we did see some of these slowing down, but not in our Pandora business. We have a big business. Pandora is just in our Jared stores. And we're very happy and excited about our Pandora partnership. As we said, we have these new stores. It will take us a year to roll them out, but we will have all of our new stores, our new stores, Pandora stores in our Jared stores by the 1st of November. Right now, we just completed about 50 doors and initials -- early but initial sales results are very better -- very good to us. So we see great opportunities with Pandora and increasing our partnership and Pandora. And a big benefit of Pandora partnership that we have, Simeon, is not just selling more beads, but Pandora's done a great job of designing new jewelry products at lower price points that we really haven't done a great job with in the past and have not had a good inventory assortment of the Pandora jewelry products.

And that really, that increase in rate is really driven by the primary lending that ADS is doing. And so what we're seeing and what we expected to see for the benefit with ADS is it's driven by -- of higher application and higher credit lines with ADS. And first, when you think about the change over to ADS, there was a relaunch of the credit cards to customers. So one, you generally get [indiscernible] customers back into the stores. In addition, we did some field training related to the ADS rollout. I'd also say that when we think about the credit value proposition, it relates to ADS. It really is more appealing than traditionally what we've had as it allows for lower minimum purchases that are required. And then also, the application process, it is much more quicker for -- and easier for that applicant. Previously, it was a paper application, where now, we utilize technology and a drivers license function data and then our do [indiscernible] with ADS.

And she's just such credibility in the bridal area, and she has a great eye so she can design some beautiful jewelry, pearl jewelry, pearls and diamond jewelry for us and for our business. And so far, it's testing well. And we don't want to say for certain because they're still in the testing zone, if the test continues to be successful, we may see some major extensions of Vera Wang jewelry roll out potentially in our sales stores for the fourth quarter. But we'll keep you up to speed on that. As far as Ever Us goes, as you said, Dorothy, it is a tremendous success story for us and having an item and a trend that we've created. And we just -- this just continue to grow for us. And the test that we're starting to see in necklaces, we see opportunities potentially other parts of jewelry, different styles are really going well. we don't see a slowdown. As we -- as I said in my prepared remarks, from our experience, these types of trend changing are beacon-type strategies. From our experience, that should gain momentum because as well as it did for us last year and into this year, it's still a small, small portion of customers out there that have -- just really an understanding of what Ever Us is all about.

When you think about the Vera Wang designs and what we're going to do, it's all about fashion. So we have a lot in the works, and we're testing the pipeline. We're just showing some for competitive reasons, that we're always looking to be innovative and look for new ways of continuing to test new things in fashion. Dorothy, given opportunity, to just say something broader. For us to continually gain market share in the jewelry industry over the last 5, 10 and 20 years, and for us to continue going forward, we, as a company, have got to be innovative. We got to consistently have new ideas in the pipeline, not only as it relates to fashion, which is critical, but all facets of our business. So we are continuing -- that's why we opened the design center. That's why our designers are continually looking for new ways and looking at fashion trends to continually test and look for new ways to sell fashion and gift-giving products to our customers. So we believe in the good, healthy pipeline in fashion. As far as the jewelry business goes, Janet, we have said that we believe -- firmly, we believe that, even though Jared's comps were down in the first quarter, total sales were up. And we believe are gaining profitable market share in the jewelry industry. We believe that firmly because Jared is growing at a healthy, profitable way. That being said, we have made some enhancements and refinements to the Jared model. We talked about how we've changed the selling tactics that we use. We talked about how we're changing some of the assortment that we're having. We're getting more involved in some fashion getting more involved with some lower price point fashion products. getting more involved with designers like Vera Wang. We've also talked about how we're continually looking for ways to enhance our selling coverage and how we'd sell to the Jared customer. And the Jared customer, we learned in our segmentation analyses that they are looking for some -- a little bit more promotions. They are looking for some sales every once in a while. So we were testing that also. And Janet, we're also testing radio advertising in certain markets because continuity of radio is a strong thing. And we're selling products in Jared engagement and Jared's 12 months a year, not just in the 12 weeks that we advertise on TV. So we are actually very bullish on our Jared business. We believe that we've got a lot of good things going on Jared's and are in a transition stage where they're changing the inventory up little bit. We're continuing to change the selling tactics that we have -- tactics that we have and still working on testing some new bounce-back programs that we have in coupons and promotion. So again, we feel very bullish about how Jared perform in the fourth quarter, a long as the economy is consistent and operating consistently."

And as you think about now -- I know that this is your initial strategic review with an outside party, but you've been conducting some review internally, and you do have this partnership with ADS now of quarter under your belt, is there a scenario you believe where you could have a third-party run the credit portfolio and not have to change your current lending practices?

There are 5 key messages I would like you to take away from our presentation today. First, in what has been a choppy retail environment, we were able to deliver record EPS at the high end of our guidance. Our operating income, our net income and our earnings per share were all up over 20% year-over-year. This was due in large part to managing our expense structure in disciplined fashion and realizing synergies that position Signet well for the long-term. This prudent expense management included results in credit which Michele will speak about in more detail later. 
Second, we delivered solid sales for the quarter. Although our sales were slightly below our guidance, they were still strong enough to deliver on our earnings expectations. Year-to-date, we are gaining profitable market share. 
The third point I want you to take away is that we remain a growth story, a prudent, measured and profitable growth story. We remain on pace and are committed to growing our store square footage. Our disciplined internal rate of return requirement on new stores of 20% remains firm. The growth this year will be led by Kay Jewelers outside the enclosed mall. This is a departure from many other retailers that are having to reduce square footage these days. 
Fourth, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance. Our first quarter results and sales flow-through keep us positioned to achieve our year-end goals around EPS, adjusted EPS and synergies, despite a lower sales outlook. 
And fifth, we are conducting a strategic evaluation of our credit portfolio as we are always looking for ways to optimize our operating business model. Goldman Sachs, who has vast experience in this area, has been engaged as the company's adviser in this process. We will consider a full range of options as we evaluate our in-house and outsourced credit programs. These options include, but are not limited to, optimizing credit offerings, optimizing allocated debt and equity capitalization of the credit portfolio including potential incremental securitization, bringing all credit function in-house over the long term, in sourcing some credit functions and outsourcing others and outsourcing all credit functions. This evaluation is a top priority, and as we move through this, we will remain focused on executing our operational plans and driving profitable growth in our business. 
Moving on to Slide 4 and the financial highlights. I'll leave the specific numbers and details for Michele, but the main headlines and accomplishments from a financial perspective relate to our first quarter as follows. We delivered a good sales gain, which include a 2.4% comp increase. We delivered operating margin expansion and we leveraged both gross margin and SG&A, coupled with meaningful buyback, which demonstrates our confidence in our business and the value we see in our shares. This led to record first quarter EPS with a double-digit percentage increase. And we have sound cash and liquidity levels, and we continue to possess a strong balance sheet with clean inventory and a responsible amount of debt. 
Next, I'd like to discuss the main sales drivers of the first quarter. Like the fourth quarter, results were led by our Ever Us, which is our 2-stone diamond ring collection. Ever Us is now testing line extension in stores for the holiday season and some are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings as well as necklace with on-trim looks and innovative fastening systems were also very successful in the first quarter. Branded bridal also grew in Q1. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Brands such as Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane led the way. 
Before I go into what's to come for the back half for our company, I want to take a few moments and make a few comments about our place in the jewelry industry. Our internal research shows definitively that consumers still find jewelry gift-giving as one of the best ways to celebrate life and express love. And the numbers support this. As shown on the left side of Slide 6 with 3- and 5-year compounded annual sale growth rates in the teens and 8% growth for 10 years when figuring in the recession, Signet has been gaining and continues to gain market share profitably. We consistently outperform the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance. Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained competitive advantage. Signet is relatively Amazon-proof as consumers have consistently shown a desire to touch jewelry and get educated by a trusted and trained professional before making a highly emotional purchase. 
We are in a consolidating industry. Jewelry in the U.S. is growing in dollars and declining in the number of doors, and we have 3 of the most preeminent brands in the space. 
We know that there are growth opportunities. And we also know how and where to get them, which makes us even more attractive for investment. 
So why invest in Signet? Firstly, we are the clear jewelry market leader with less than 8% of the total market share in the U.S. and it's a highly fragmented and growing middle market industry. We are a square footage grower and will be for years, and we are consolidating in a growing industry. During calendar 2018, after synergies are done and the Zales business model is ready and operating consistently, we intend to grow Zales outside the mall. 
We continue to deliver high-quality financial results. Our financial flow-through is powerful, with consistent comps and market expansion accelerated by the Zale acquisition. We believe this will lead to long-term EPS growth. Coupled with a solid balance sheet including prudent inventory management, and our financials compare pretty well with most of retail. 
We continue to have confidence that we will deliver on our annual earnings guidance. We have many competitive advantages that we're leveraging around our store teams, our marketing and our exciting merchandise programs. 
But allow me to discuss just a few of our exciting, compelling merchandise line extensions and tests that should help us deliver on the year by making the bulk of their contribution in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are successfully testing Ever Us line extensions such as new diamond ring styles, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. And in our experience, beacon, or industry's trend that's driving type strategies like this, tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. 
We are also testing a line of Vera Wang fashion diamond jewelry and pearls and pearl jewelry to capitalize on her strong name and her design expertise. 
In all of our jewelry stores, we are resetting our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores. As a part of it, we are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry and we'll support it with new TV advertising and creative in the fourth quarter. 
We're rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores, which shows the customer each stage of a diamond's journey from a rough diamond to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer segment who tends to value this type of product and information more so than some of our other store banners. We are also designing brand-new TV creative to support the Chosen also for the fourth quarter. 
And lastly, we have new technology for our store teams in Kay and Jared for the fourth quarter that will enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions. We call it clienteling and we are very excited about its potential to drive sales and build relation with our customers and our team members. 
Okay, now back to Signet's overall investment merits as we continue down Slide 7. Our integration is progressing as planned and delivering the synergies along the way. We are living up to the expectations that we've articulated. Where Signet has pockets of underperformance, we have strategies. For example, at Jared, merchandise, marketing and store operation plans will help us deliver a strong holiday season. 
And finally, we have a thoughtful and balanced capital allocation policy that accounts for strategic investments, meaningful stock repurchases, dividend increases and the preservation of capital. 
That concludes my prepared remarks and now I'll turn it over to Michele."

So we'll start with our first quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 3.6% comp increase in the prior year first quarter with all 3 of our divisions delivering positive comp sales. Total sales increased 3.2%, and on a constant-exchange basis, total sales increased 3.9% for the quarter. 
In looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 3.8% to $980 million, which included a comp increase of 2.3% on top of a prior year increase of 2.3%. Sales increases were driven principally by strong sales of select branded bridal jewelry as well as fashion jewelry. 
The Zale jewelry operating segment's total sales increased by 2.3% to $381 million and 3.2% on a constant-currency exchange basis. On a geography basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 3.7% and comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 5.4% comp increase in the prior year. Our Canadian total sales declined 6.2%, but increased 0.2% on a constant-currency basis with comp sales decline of 0.6%. Canada sales continue to be impacted primarily by the Western region of Canada due to the struggling energy industry. 
Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and branded bridal. 
Our Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.5% to $69 million with comp sales of 5.6% on top of 6.1% last year. Sales increases were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. 
And in the U.K., our total sales decreased 1.7% to $144 million, but increased 4% at constant currency rates. Comp sales grew 3.4% and that's on top of a 6.2% comp increase in the prior year. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases in the U.K. 
So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then we'll turn and we'll look at Signet adjusted results. 
So turning to Slide 9. The table provides the reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results and we're continuing to present this reconciliation in fiscal year 2017 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting as well as severance and IT implementation expenses associated with our global systems that will drive future synergies. Now the difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. 
So starting in the lower left portion of the slide. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.87 per share and that's up 26.4% over last year. In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration costs, and as I had just mentioned, relate to severance that's associated with our organizational design changes and consulting costs related to information technology implementation. Integration costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution. 
So on an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustments, adjusted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% over last year. 
So now looking below our sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $604.4 million or 38.2% of adjusted sales and that's up 40 basis points due primarily to the Zale division and a variety of synergies such as sourcing, discount controls and vendor terms as well as some favorability in commodity costs and leverage on store occupancy. Sterling Jewelers gross margin increased by 20 basis points due primarily to commodity costs. The Zale division's adjusted gross margin rate increased 90 basis points as synergies favorably affected many areas including our merchandise margins, distribution costs and store operating costs. 
Our U.K. gross margin decreased 30 basis points, driven principally by lower sales and merchandise margin deleverage as a result of currency exchange rates. 
Adjusted SG&A was $456.1 million or 28.8% of adjusted sales and that compares to $451 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of leverage was due primarily to lower store and corporate payroll expenses associated with our organizational realignment as well as lower advertising expenses. This was offset, in part, by information technology expenses related to Signet's IT global implementation. 
Other operating income was $74.3 million or 4.7% of sales. This increase of $10.8 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. 
Adjusted operating income was $222.6 million and increased 14.7% over prior year first quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 14.1% of sales. Now this 150 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by the increase in sales as well as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.95, which compares to $1.62 last year, an increase of 20.4%, driven principally by our stronger business performance. 
So now let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll take a look at our inventory. Our strong first quarter and inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 1% compared to our sales growth of 3.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations, but most notably in branded bridal. We increased Zale inventory turn by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store-level inventory closer to Kay averages and improving clearance inventory management. As we move through Q2, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well positioned. 
So now we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our first quarter credit sales were $605.1 million compared to $573.1 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.6%, which compare to an increase of 9.2% in the prior year. The higher credit sales was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both, which have higher average transaction values. The average monthly payment collection rate for the first quarter fiscal 2017 was 12.3% compared to 12.6% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The change in rate over prior year is due primarily to merchandise mix, as bridal, especially higher-priced branded bridal, increases, this creates a higher average initial balance. Now by design, the minimum payment rate declines as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sales, therefore, the repayment period is slightly longer and cash collected as a percentage of the receivables declined slightly. 
The combination of growth in credit sales and collection rate led to an increase of 11% and our net accounts receivables compared to an increase of 14.7% in net receivables in the prior year quarter. Our quarter ended net accounts receivable increased to $1.65 billion compared to $1.49 billion last year. 
Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all the other operating line on our income statement, was $72.8 million compared to $64.4 million last year. The increase of $8.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. 
Our net bad debt was $33.6 million compared to $28.1 million last year. The increase of $5.5 million was driven by our higher receivable balances. But more specifically, our bad debt provisioning establishes a 3% reserve at origination of the receivables based on historical experience. The higher our credit sales, meaning the more new volume in accounts receivable, the greater the amount contributes to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Now the net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $39.2 million and that's compared to $36.3 million in the prior year. 
So looking at some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful accounts metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 6.6% in the first quarter. This was up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. But what's most important is that, as we expected, we made more sequential improvement in Q1 of this year than we did in last year. So why is that? The impact of improved collection execution and credit marketing techniques that we began late last year are making more than just seasonal progress. We improved 40 basis points Q4 to Q1 versus 30 basis points over the same period prior year. 
Now the same trend was true for our nonperforming portion of our receivables as a percent of the gross receivables. At 3.6%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Again, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was better at 40 basis points down versus 30 basis points down in the prior year period. Building off the Q4 trends that we had discussed in our year-end earnings call in March, we continue to see the same improvement in trends in Q1 and we anticipate that these trends, broadly speaking, will hold true for the remainder of the year. 
So moving on to our capital allocation. I want to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we had first introduced 14 months ago. We have a strong balance sheet and we have also extended our ABS agreement for an additional year. The strength in our balance sheet and flexibility allows us to invest in our business, execute our strategic priorities and return excess cash to shareholders, all while ensuring adequate liquidity. Our investment grade ratings remain important to us because, long term, we may return to the debt markets. 
Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x and we had ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. As our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity and we are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenet of our capital allocation policy. 
We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of our annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and/or dividends, assuming no other strategic use of capital. In recent years, we have been able to grow both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now, given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the previous program. At the end of the quarter, we had $761 million authorized after our $125 million of Q1 share repurchases. 
So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. Signet's second quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2%, which factors in our quarter-to-date performance and also assumes that the environment remains somewhat muted. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.49 to $1.54. 
Now for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 2% to 3.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55. The comp range has been reduced 100 basis points from our March guidance. Now we all see the trends out there, and with a softer consumer environment, we believe it is appropriate that we proactively reset our comp guidance. 
With that said, we continue to believe that the $8.25 to $8.55 EPS range is achievable for the following reasons. First, and just as a reminder, March was the first time we had issued full year guidance and we are just out of the gate into our new fiscal year, and appropriately so, we had guided to an earnings range that gave us room to achieve earnings under various scenarios. Second, we are planning for the strong earnings flow-through to come about through both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies, and the SG&A leverage will flow due to marketing and organizational design efficiencies as well as additional expense levers within management's control. We proved this capability in Q1 where we are able to deliver at the high end of the EPS range despite lower sales from the guidance, and as a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our EPS guidance. 
Now as to other aspects of our guidance. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Under the recent U.S. Treasury and IRS proposed regulations, tax treatment of related party debt and the tax deductibility of interest expense are limited to only certain related party transactions. Signet's related party financing arrangements, which stem primarily from the Zale acquisition, are grandfathered under the proposal and there is no impact on our short- to medium-term forecasted effective tax rate. 
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million driven by a combination of new stores, store remodels, information technology and facilities expenditures. 
Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5% with most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than in-closed malls. 
We are also reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance, which we increased February 29. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively, that means the $60 million we realized last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. 
So in closing, we're pleased with our earnings performance and our relative financial results to date. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

We do have a third-party company that tracks the traffic in the malls. And it is showing that retail traffic as a whole was down for the first quarter. We have some traffic counters in our Jared stores, some in our Kay stores. And we're seeing declines that not as much as you're seeing with some of the third-party provider out there. But to your point, bridal is our stable type of business, where it is a premeditated purchase and people are coming into our stores thinking about bridal and shopping beforehand. So we don't believe we're as affected by retail traffic in jewelry as our retail competitors. But there is an effect obviously if there's less people in the malls and more so, like you said, for gift-giving. Now gift-giving is also a premeditated purchase, but we're just seeing less traffic in the malls as of right now and just overall retail traffic is down. But we still think the consumer is vibrant out there. And we're seeing -- on our own sales, you're seeing that we had a very respectable comp increase as it relates compared to the rest of the retail industry world."

When you just look at our assortment, whether it be in gift-giving products and fine jewelry or more importantly, in engagement and bridal category, our assortment is far beyond anybody else out there. And in this category, as I stated, the customer engagement is critical. The experience that they have in the stores is critical. And we believe that our team members in all of our stores are better trained and better equipped to educate our customers on this critical, emotional purchase and educate our customers about quality of the diamonds and understanding their needs. So our competitive advantages are, we believe, we have a better assortment, we believe we understand diamond fashion jewelry and diamond engagement much better. And we believe we have much a better trained and experienced salespeople to take care of that specific jewelry customer."

So let me start with your question in terms of the gross margin and SG&A and some of the primary drivers that we're very much focused on. So first thing, it does start back with the synergies and really pushing the synergies through gross margin, also with SG&A. I mentioned on the call on the gross margin, what we're really starting to see flow through and we continue to expect to have opportunities as we move into the year on the synergy front really relate to our discounting controls that we've put in place, there's repairs, our vendor term. We did actually move from insourcing our special events to outsourcing that, that has had a favorable impact on the gross margin. So there's a lot related to synergies that we see flowing through there. And in addition, there's still a little bit of favorability we're getting out of commodity cost front that's flowing through the gross margin. On the SG&A side, on the synergy front, we did a lot of work, and we talked about this during the fourth quarter, where we had accelerated some of the work around our organizational design efficiency. And so we're starting to see those benefits. We'll continue to see the benefits flowing through relating to that in terms of payroll savings. We've also really had been looking in optimizing our labor scheduling as it relates to our store payroll. So we continue to expect to see favorability flowing through that in the year, leveraging our SG&A. And then more importantly, as I was referencing, there's additional expense levers that management really does have control over. And although we'll want to continue to preserve our more customer-facing expenses, those expenses, such as our advertising line item, et cetera, for those that are less directly customer-facing, whether it's our travels, our supplies, our support center, those are the ones that we are really able to tighten our belt and take a more disciplined approach to give us the confidence that we'll be able to hit our EPS guidance."

And Oliver, in reference to your credit question, I'm going to kind of give you kind of a holistic answer and answer to your 3 questions about timing and drawbacks and learnings from Zales. And I want to start off with stating -- and I just need to start off because we've said in the announcement that our credit metrics in our credit portfolio are strong. As we said, our credit metrics are improving sequentially and within our expectations and all were thought for and involved in our earnings guidance both on a quarterly basis and on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are strong. To answer your questions, the reason why we're doing this credit project, to your point is, yes, we have had some good experience with ADS. We've had a full quarter now under our belt where ADS has been managing our entire credit portfolio for Zales from January through now. And we're having some good experiences and we're learning more. And at Signet, we're an evolving company. We're always looking for ways to better improve our business model and our business. That being said, we always feel there's ways for us to getting smarter and understanding more about our business. And we've also seen other major retailers out there, and I'm sure a lot of you know of them, that have carried internal receivables and have sold their receivables and have done work with receivables of recent. And we just understand, as an evolution, we want to make sure that we're on top of it. We're a business that is constantly looking for ways to improve ourself. Actually, our mission statement is that we're always looking to continuously improve. So we look at every facet of our business on a regular basis to make sure that we're continuously improving how we can enhance our business for our operations and for our shareholder. And credit is no different. We've done major credit announcements in the past. So as we mentioned -- as I mentioned in my remarks, Oliver, possible outcomes could be outsourcing of all our credit functions, possible outcomes could be some in-housing of our credit functions, some could be outsourced. Other things that we'll be analyzing, is there ways to optimizing our debt structures on accounts receivables? Can we optimize our credit offerings? We're looking at variations of options to make sure that we're improving our ability to do sales, maximizing our profitability and enhancing our business model. And as far as timing goes, Oliver, it's a top priority for us. We will be thoughtful though and we will be diligent about the work, but we're going to take time to be very thoughtful. And we are working real-time right now with Goldman Sachs on this, who has a lot of experience in this world and has done a lot of this type of work with other retailers. So that's why we're comfortable sharing it with you today. But we're not going to share a time line with you because we want to do this thoughtfully and methodically. But we will keep you up to date when appropriate."

So just real quick on that, we talked at quite length on the last call that, at the end of the day, regardless of recency or contractual, whatever method you're on, the financial results are going to yield the same answer. The provision will be the same. Our bad debt expense will be the same. But to that point, the reason why we use our recency is, one, we have done it since the beginning of time and it really has worked well for us over the years with the type of lending that we do, jewelry lending, that emotional connection. And it does optimize our collection for us. And so with the use of the recency, it does help us to engage with the borrowers, start collecting quicker and it gives the customers some flexibility based on the disciplined criteria that we had outlined of our recency aging on what a customer has to remit to stay current. It leaves that customer in good standing if they're having maybe a challenging month, where they can't remit a full payment. And that psychology and that flexibility of working with that customer puts that customer first. And that, at the end of the day, really drives maximization and optimization of our collection efforts. And then as I said, importantly the financial results will be the same. Now we'll continue, and when you see the 10-Q that we plan to file within the next week or so, in the footnote, you'll see the same type of a breakdown of our aging. So we continue to provide that, the 30 days, 60, et cetera, and the 90 days. In terms of FICO scores, that will be an annual disclosure for us. But what I can tell you is the FICO scores are broadly in the same range as what we saw in Q4, which everybody would expect that you're not going to have major shifts quarter-to-quarter on that."

And we still feel very strong and had built good increase for Zales going forward. And we continue to see benefits from our cross-selling of brands. We continue to see tremendous benefit. And we think there's going to be a huge benefit for the Zales as having our repair business being internal, not being done by third-party contractors, which will help the top line, not only in the repair business but ultimately you take care of a repair customer, you have a new customer for life and you take care of that customer. So we have a lot of areas of the business that are going to increase the top line. But we're focused right now on making sure that we get the model in place and we get the appropriate level of SG&A in line for that business model. So we do see good opportunities to continue to grow Zales going forward. And if you look at accounts for the Zales business itself, in this past first quarter, it was up over 3.5%, which is better than most of retail. So we still feel very good about the opportunities for Zales on the sales line. As far as there could be average sales in PANDORA, we did see some beads slowing down but not in our PANDORA business. We have a big bead business. PANDORA is just in our Jared stores. And we're very happy and excited about our PANDORA partnership. As we said, we have these new store-in-stores. It will take us a year to roll them out, but we will have all of our new stores -- our new stores-in-stores -- PANDORA stores-in-stores in our Jared stores by the 1st of November. Right now, we just completed about 50 doors and initial -- early but initial sales results are very -- look very good to us. So we see great opportunities with PANDORA and increasing our partnership with PANDORA. And a big benefit of PANDORA partnership that we have, Simeon, is not just selling more beads. But PANDORA is doing a great job of designing new jewelry products at lower price points that we really haven't done a great job with in the past and have not had a good inventory assortment of the PANDORA jewelry products.

And that really, that increase in rate is really driven by the primary lending that ADS is doing. And so what we're seeing and what we expected to see as part of the benefit with ADS is it's driven by both a higher application and higher credit lines with ADS. And first, when you think about the changeover to ADS, there was a relaunch of the credit cards to customers. So one, you generally get -- that drives customers back into the stores. In addition, we did some field training related to the ADS rollout. I'd also say that when we think about the credit value proposition related to ADS, it really is more appealing than traditionally what we've had as it allows for lower minimum purchases that are required. And then also the application process, it is much more quicker and easier for that applicant. Previously, it was a paper application, where now we utilize technology and the driver's license function data, and then they're off to the races with ADS.

And then just a follow-up to that. I guess, Mark, when you guys guided, I think, Valentine's Day was already over. I assume it's a big part of the quarter. So I'm just kind of curious.

And we put that guidance out there on March 26, we had Valentine's Day under our belt. That being said, we had April ahead of us, which leads up to obviously some critical shopping for Mothers' Day. And there was a slowdown in April. If you just look at what we've accomplished compared to what our guidance was, at the time we gave the guidance, there was no doubt there's a slowdown on April that we experienced like all of retail. We've all been exposed to all the retail numbers out there for the first quarter. So our numbers slowed down but were better than most. That being said, going into May, we're seeing a similar level to May, not better, not worse, we're seeing a little similar level. So the guidance that we've given you for Q2 is assuming that things don't get better and things don't get worse from an economic environment basis. But even though you didn't ask, I want to say to you that we still feel very strongly about our earnings guidance for the year. And we believe that we have great opportunities in the second half as I stated. And we have a lot of initiatives, Ike. We have more initiative this year than we even had last year. As I mentioned with the extension of Ever Us, as I mentioned with the Chosen Diamond for Jared that tested wonderfully, we're very excited about the PANDORA store-in-stores. We're very excited about the Vera Wang extension that's going into diamond jewelry and pearl jewelry. And we're very, very excited about this new technology that we're enabling our people in our stores to really be more sophisticated and more knowledgeable about their customers' past experience and what they bought and what they can go buy in the future to help them communicate better with our customers. So yes, we saw a slowdown in April. But we're still outperforming most of retail and we still feel very bullish. Assuming the economy stays stable that we're going to have a very good second half and fourth quarter."

There's a little bit more color on the technology I was referring to. So we have a great partnerships that we're working with, some of the software companies, like Salesforce and Rosetta, that's working with us on this project we're calling clienteling. And briefly, just to give you as thought is that a good jewelry sales consultant has a book, and then we'll talk -- and they'll have it and they'll keep it manually now to understand all their customers what they bought in the past, what are the key special occasions in their lifetime moments, whether it be birthdays or their loved ones or anniversaries or just graduation gifts and that type of things. And all that it is done -- been done manually in the past. We are going to be able now to have and give our associates real-time information through their iPads, so they could understand what their customers have bought in the past, what birthdays are coming up, how to communicate with them more intelligently. We'll also be able to use this technology for CRM. So we think there's just vast opportunities of what we can get incremental benefits and sales from this new technology. To your point, we're training up our people at our Jared and our Kay stores. And we'll start in August, we'll have a big training conference at our leadership conference on October. And for Jared and for Kay, they'll be fully ready for this aspect of this new technology for the fourth quarter. And we think there's a good opportunity to increase our sales and get incremental sales with just communicating more effectively with our customers. As far as Vera Wang and the extension of jewelry, we just think it's a great opportunity. Vera, as I said, is a tremendous designer. And she's got such credibility in the bridal area and she has a great eye, so she's been designing some beautiful jewelry, pearl jewelry, pearls and diamond jewelry for our business. And so far, it's testing well. And we don't want to say for certain because they're still in the testing zone. But if the tests continue to be successful, we may see some major extensions of Vera Wang jewelry roll out potentially in our Zales stores for the fourth quarter. But we'll keep you up to speed on that. As far as Ever Us goes, as you said, Dorothy, it is a tremendous success story for us and having an item and a trend that we have created. And we just -- this has just continued to grow for us. In the tests that we're starting to see in necklaces, we see opportunities potentially in other parts of jewelry, different ring styles are really going well. And we don't see a slowdown. As I said in my prepared remarks, from our experience, these types of trend-changing or beacon-type strategies, from our experience, that should gain momentum because as well as it did for us last year and into this year, it's still a small, small portion of customers out there that have just really have an understanding what Ever Us is all about. So we believe there's still tremendous upside for the Ever Us collection going into the fourth quarter and into the future."

And it's not -- you've got to continually investigate and innovate with new opportunities and new styles like we did with Ever Us. And we have a lot of exciting things in the pipeline. I touched on several of them. One is PANDORA is all about fashion. PANDORA jewelry is all about fashion. When you think about the Vera Wang designs and what we're going to do, it's all about fashion. So we have a lot in the works, and we're testing the pipeline. We're just share some, for competitive reasons, that we're always looking to be innovative and look for new ways of continually to test new things in fashion. Dorothy, give me an opportunity to say something broader. For us to continually gain market share in the jewelry industry over the last 5, 10 and 20 years, and for us to continue going forward, we, as a company, have got to constantly be innovative. We've got to consistently have new ideas in our pipeline, not only as it relates to fashion, which is critical, but all facets of our business. So we are continually -- that's why we opened a design center. That's why our design center is continually looking for new ways and looking at fashion trends to continually test and look for new ways of innovative ways to sell fashion and gift-giving products to our customers. So we believe we have a good, healthy pipeline in fashion. As far as the Jared business goes, Janet, we have said that we believe -- firmly, we believe that, even though Jared's comps were down in the first quarter, their total sales were up. And we believe we're gaining profitable market share in the jewelry industry. We believe that firmly because Jared is growing at a healthy, profitable way. That being said, we have made some enhancements and refinements to the Jared model. We talked about how we've changed some of the selling tactics that we use. We talked about how we are changing some of the assortment that we're having. We're getting more involved in some fashion areas. We're getting more involved with some lower price point fashion products. We're getting more involved with designers like Vera Wang. We've also talked about how we're continually looking for ways to enhance our selling coverage and how we'd sell to the Jared customer. And that Jared customer, we've learned in our segmentation analyses that they are looking for some -- a little bit more promotions. They are looking for some sales every once in a while. So we're testing that also. And Janet, we're also testing radio advertising in certain markets because continuity of radio is a strong thing. And we're selling products in Jared, [indiscernible] Jared's 12 months a year, not just in the 12 weeks that we advertise on TV. So we are actually very bullish on our Jared business. We believe that we've got a lot of good things going on at Jared's. And they're in a transition stage where we're changing the inventory up little bit. We're continuing to change the selling tactics that we have. And we're still working on testing some new bounce-back programs and coupons and promotions. So again, we feel very bullish about how Jared is going to perform in the fourth quarter as long as the economy is consistent and operating consistently."

There are 5 key messages I would like you to take away from our presentation today. First, in what has been a choppy retail environment, we were able to deliver record EPS at the high end of our guidance. Our ope",1426,"Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. There are 5 key messages I would like you to take away from our presentation today. First, in what has been a choppy retail environment, we were able to deliver record EPS at the high end of our guidance. Our operating income, our net income and our earnings per share were all up over 20% year-over-year. This was due in large part to managing our expense structure in a disciplined fashion and realizing synergies that position Signet well for the long term. This prudent expense management included good results in credit, which Michele will speak about in more detail later. 
Second, we delivered solid sales for the quarter. Although our sales were slightly below our guidance, they were still strong enough to deliver on our earnings expectations. Year-to-date, we are gaining profitable market share. 
The third point I want you to take away is that we remain a growth story, a prudent, measured and profitable growth story. We remain on pace and are committed to growing our store square footage. Our disciplined internal rate of return requirement on new stores of 20% remains firm. The growth this year will be led by Kay Jewelers outside the enclosed mall. This is a departure from many other retailers that are having to reduce square footage these days. 
Fourth, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance. Our first quarter results and sales flow-through keep us positioned to achieve our year-end goals around EPS, adjusted EPS and synergies, despite a lower sales outlook. 
And fifth, we are conducting a strategic evaluation of our credit portfolio as we are always looking for ways to optimize our operating business model. Goldman Sachs, who has vast experience in this area, has been engaged as the company's adviser in this process. We will consider a full range of options as we evaluate our in-house and outsourced credit programs. These options include, but are not limited to: optimizing credit offerings; optimizing allocated debt and equity capitalization of the credit portfolio, including potential incremental securitization; bringing all credit function in-house over the long term; in-sourcing some credit functions and outsourcing others; and outsourcing all credit functions. This evaluation is a top priority, and as we move through this, we will remain focused on executing our operational plans and driving profitable growth in our business. 
Moving on to Slide 4 and the financial highlights. I'll leave the specific numbers and details for Michele, but the main headlines and accomplishments from a financial perspective relate to our first quarter as follows. We delivered a good sales gain, which include a 2.4% comp increase. We delivered operating margin expansion and we leveraged both gross margin and SG&A, coupled with meaningful buyback, which demonstrates our confidence in our business and the value we see in our shares. This led to record first quarter EPS with a double-digit percentage increase. And we have sound cash and liquidity levels, and we continue to possess a strong balance sheet with clean inventory and a responsible amount of debt. 
Next, I'd like to discuss the main sales drivers of the first quarter. Like the fourth quarter, results were led by our Ever Us, which is our 2-stone diamond ring collection. Ever Us is now testing line extensions in stores for the holiday season and some are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings as well as necklace with on-trim looks and innovative fastening systems were also very successful in the first quarter. Branded bridal also grew in Q1. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Brands such as Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane led the way. 
Before I go into what's to come for the back half for our company, I want to take a few moments and make a few comments about our place in the jewelry industry. Our internal research shows definitively that consumers still find jewelry gift-giving as one of the best ways to celebrate life and express love. And the numbers support this. As shown on the left side of Slide 6, with 3- and 5-year compounded annual sale growth rates in the teens and 8% growth for 10 years when figuring in the recession, Signet has been gaining and continues to gain market share profitably. We consistently outperform the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance. Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained competitive advantage. Signet is relatively Amazon-proof as consumers have consistently shown a desire to touch jewelry and get educated by a trusted and trained professional before making a highly emotional purchase. 
We are in a consolidating industry. Jewelry in the U.S. is growing in dollars and declining in the number of doors, and we have 3 of the most preeminent brands in the space. 
We know that there are growth opportunities. And we also know how and where to get them, which makes us even more attractive for investment. 
So why invest in Signet? Firstly, we are the clear jewelry market leader with less than 8% of the total market share in the U.S., and it's a highly fragmented and growing middle-market industry. We are a square-footage grower and will be for years, and we are consolidating in a growing industry. During calendar 2018, after synergies are done and the Zales business model is ready and operating consistently, we intend to grow Zales outside the mall. 
We continue to deliver high-quality financial results. Our financial flow-through is powerful, with consistent comps and market expansion accelerated by the Zale acquisition. We believe this will lead to long-term EPS growth, coupled with a solid balance sheet, including prudent inventory management, and our financials compare pretty well with most of retail. 
We continue to have confidence that we will deliver on our annual earnings guidance. We have many competitive advantages that we're leveraging around our store teams, our marketing and our exciting merchandise programs. 
But allow me to discuss just a few of our exciting, compelling merchandise line extensions and tests that should help us deliver on the year by making the bulk of their contribution in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are successfully testing Ever Us line extensions such as new diamond ring styles, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. And in our experience, beacon, or industry's trend that's driving type strategies like this, tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. 
We are also testing a line of Vera Wang fashion diamond jewelry and pearls and pearl jewelry to capitalize on her strong name and her design expertise. 
In all of our jewelry stores, we are resetting our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores. As a part of it, we are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry and we'll support it with new TV advertising and creative in the fourth quarter. 
We're rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores, which shows the customer each stage of a diamond's journey from a rough diamond to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer segment who tends to value this type of product and information more so than some of our other store banners. We are also designing brand-new TV creative to support the Chosen also for the fourth quarter. 
And lastly, we have new technology for our store teams in Kay and Jared for the fourth quarter that will enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions. We call it clienteling and we are very excited about its potential to drive sales and build relations with our customers and our team members. 
Okay, now back to Signet's overall investment merits as we continue down Slide 7. Our integration is progressing as planned and delivering the synergies along the way. We are living up to the expectations that we've articulated. Where Signet has pockets of underperformance, we have strategies. For example, at Jared, merchandise, marketing and store operation plans will help us deliver a strong holiday season. 
And finally, we have a thoughtful and balanced capital allocation policy that accounts for strategic investments, meaningful stock repurchases, dividend increases and the preservation of capital. 
That concludes my prepared remarks and now I'll turn it over to Michele."

So we'll start with our first quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 3.6% comp increase in the prior year first quarter, with all 3 of our divisions delivering positive",2245,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. So we'll start with our first quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 3.6% comp increase in the prior year first quarter, with all 3 of our divisions delivering positive comp sales. Total sales increased 3.2%, and on a constant-exchange basis, total sales increased 3.9% for the quarter. 
In looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 3.8% to $980 million, which included a comp increase of 2.3% on top of a prior year increase of 2.3%. Sales increases were driven principally by strong sales of select branded bridal jewelry as well as fashion jewelry. 
The Zale jewelry operating segment's total sales increased by 2.3% to $381 million and 3.2% on a constant-currency exchange basis. On a geography basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 3.7% and comps increased 2.4%, and that's on top of a 5.4% comp increase in the prior year. Our Canadian total sales declined 6.2%, but increased 0.2% on a constant-currency basis with comp sales decline of 0.6%. Canada sales continue to be impacted primarily by the Western region of Canada due to the struggling energy industry. 
Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and branded bridal. 
Our Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.5% to $69 million with comp sales of 5.6% on top of 6.1% last year. Sales increases were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. 
And in the U.K., our total sales decreased 1.7% to $144 million, but increased 4% at constant currency rates. Comp sales grew 3.4% and that's on top of a 6.2% comp increase in the prior year. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases in the U.K. 
So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then we'll turn and we'll look at Signet's adjusted results. 
So turning to Slide 9. The table provides the reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results, and we're continuing to present this reconciliation in fiscal year 2017 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting as well as severance and IT implementation expenses associated with our global systems that will drive future synergies. Now the difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. 
So starting in the lower-left portion of the slide. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.87 per share and that's up 26.4% over last year. In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration costs, and as I had just mentioned, relate to severance that's associated with our organizational design changes and consulting costs related to information technology implementation. Integration costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution. 
So on an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustments, adjusted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% over last year. 
So now looking below our sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $604.4 million or 38.2% of adjusted sales, and that's up 40 basis points due primarily to the Zale division and a variety of synergies such as sourcing, discount controls and vendor terms as well as some favorability in commodity costs and leverage on store occupancy. Sterling Jewelers gross margin increased by 20 basis points due primarily to commodity costs. The Zale division's adjusted gross margin rate increased 90 basis points as synergies favorably affected many areas including our merchandise margins, distribution costs and store operating costs. 
Our U.K. gross margin decreased 30 basis points, driven principally by lower sales and merchandise margin deleverage as a result of currency exchange rates. 
Adjusted SG&A was $456.1 million or 28.8% of adjusted sales and that compares to $451 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of leverage was due primarily to lower store and corporate payroll expenses associated with our organizational realignment as well as lower advertising expenses. This was offset, in part, by information technology expenses related to Signet's IT global implementation. 
Other operating income was $74.3 million or 4.7% of sales. This increase of $10.8 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. 
Adjusted operating income was $222.6 million and increased 14.7% over prior year first quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 14.1% of sales. Now this 150 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by the increase in sales as well as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.95, which compares to $1.62 last year, an increase of 20.4%, driven principally by our stronger business performance. 
So now let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll take a look at our inventory. Our strong first quarter-end inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 1% compared to our sales growth of 3.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations, but most notably in branded bridal. We increased Zale inventory turns by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store-level inventory closer to Kay averages and improving clearance inventory management. As we move through Q2, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well positioned. 
So now we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our first quarter credit sales were $605.1 million compared to $573.1 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.6%, which compares to an increase of 9.2% in the prior year. The higher credit sales was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both which have higher average transaction values. The average monthly payment collection rate for the first quarter fiscal 2017 was 12.3% compared to 12.6% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The change in rate over prior year is due primarily to merchandise mix, as bridal, especially higher-priced branded bridal, increases, this creates a higher average initial balance. Now by design, the minimum payment rate declines as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sales, therefore, the repayment period is slightly longer and cash collected as a percentage of the receivables declined slightly. 
The combination of growth in credit sales and collection rate led to an increase of 11% in our net accounts receivables compared to an increase of 14.7% in net receivables in the prior year quarter. Our quarter-ended net accounts receivable increased to $1.65 billion compared to $1.49 billion last year. 
Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all the other operating line on our income statement, was $72.8 million compared to $64.4 million last year. The increase of $8.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. 
Our net bad debt was $33.6 million compared to $28.1 million last year. The increase of $5.5 million was driven by our higher receivable balances. But more specifically, our bad debt provisioning establishes a 3% reserve at origination of the receivables based on historical experience. The higher our credit sales, meaning the more new volume in accounts receivable, the greater the amount contributes to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Now the net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $39.2 million and that's compared to $36.3 million in the prior year. 
So looking at some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful accounts metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 6.6% in the first quarter. This was up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. But what's most important is that, as we expected, we made more sequential improvement in Q1 of this year than we did in last year. So why is that? The impact of improved collection execution and credit marketing techniques that we began late last year are making more than just seasonal progress. We improved 40 basis points Q4 to Q1 versus 30 basis points over the same period prior year. 
Now the same trend was true for our nonperforming portion of our receivables as a percent of the gross receivables. At 3.6%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Again, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was better at 40 basis points down versus 30 basis points down in the prior year period. Building off the Q4 trends that we had discussed in our year-end earnings call in March, we continue to see the same improvement in trends in Q1 and we anticipate that these trends, broadly speaking, will hold true for the remainder of the year. 
So moving on to our capital allocation. I want to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we had first introduced 14 months ago. We have a strong balance sheet and we have also extended our ABS agreement for an additional year. The strength in our balance sheet and flexibility allows us to invest in our business, execute our strategic priorities and return excess cash to shareholders, all while ensuring adequate liquidity. Our investment-grade ratings remain important to us because, long term, we may return to the debt markets. 
Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x and we had ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. As our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity and we are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenets of our capital allocation policy. 
We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of our annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and/or dividends, assuming no other strategic use of capital. In recent years, we have been able to grow both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now, given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the previous program. At the end of the quarter, we had $761 million authorized after our $125 million of Q1 share repurchases. 
So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. Signet's second quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2%, which factors in our quarter-to-date performance and also assumes that the environment remains somewhat muted. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.49 to $1.54. 
Now for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 2% to 3.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55. The comp range has been reduced 100 basis points from our March guidance. Now we all see the trends out there, and with a softer consumer environment, we believe it is appropriate that we proactively reset our comp guidance. 
With that said, we continue to believe that the $8.25 to $8.55 EPS range is achievable for the following reasons. First, and just as a reminder, March was the first time we had issued full year guidance and we are just out of the gate into our new fiscal year, and appropriately so, we had guided to an earnings range that gave us room to achieve earnings under various scenarios. Second, we are planning for the strong earnings flow-through to come about through both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies, and the SG&A leverage will flow due to marketing and organizational design efficiencies as well as additional expense levers within management's control. We proved this capability in Q1, where we were able to deliver at the high end of the EPS range despite lower sales from the guidance, and as a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our EPS guidance. 
Now as to other aspects of our guidance. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Under the recent U.S. Treasury and IRS proposed regulations, tax treatment of related-party debt and the tax deductibility of interest expense are limited to only certain related-party transactions. Signet's related-party financing arrangements, which stem primarily from the Zale acquisition, are grandfathered under the proposal and there is no impact on our short- to medium-term forecasted effective tax rate. 
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million driven by a combination of new stores, store remodels, information technology and facilities expenditures. 
Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5%, with most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than enclosed malls. 
We are also reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance, which we increased February 29. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively, that means the $60 million we realized last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. 
So in closing, we're pleased with our earnings performance and our relative financial results to date. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

We have some traffic counters in our Jared stores, some in our Kay stores. And we're seeing declines that -- not as much as you're seeing with some of the third-party provider out there. But to your point, bridal is our stable type of business, where it is a premeditated purchase and people are coming into our stores thinking about bridal and shopping beforehand. So we don't believe we're as affected by retail traffic in jewelry as our retail competitors. But there is an effect obviously if there's less people in the malls and more so, like you said, for gift-giving. Now gift-giving is also a premeditated purchase, but we're just seeing less traffic in the malls as of right now and just overall retail traffic is down. But we still think the consumer is vibrant out there. And we're seeing -- on our own sales, you're seeing that we had a very respectable comp increase as it relates compared to the rest of the retail industry world."

So let me start with your question in terms of the gross margin and SG&A and some of the primary drivers that we're very much focused on. So first thing, it does start back with the synergies and really pushing the synergies through gross margin, also with [ph] SG&A. I mentioned on the call on the gross margin, what we're really starting to see flow through, and we continue to expect to have opportunities as we move into the year on the synergy front, really relate to our discounting controls that we've put in place, there's repairs, our vendor terms. We did actually move from in-sourcing our special events to outsourcing that. That has had a favorable impact on our gross margin. So there's a lot related to synergies that we see flowing through there. And in addition, there's still a little bit of favorability we're getting on the commodity cost front that's flowing through the gross margin. On the SG&A side, on the synergy front, we did a lot of work, and we talked about this during the fourth quarter, where we had accelerated some of the work around our organizational design efficiency. And so we're starting to see those benefits. We'll continue to see the benefits flowing through relating to that in terms of payroll savings. We've also really had been looking in optimizing our labor scheduling as it relates to our store payroll. So we continue to expect to see favorability flowing through that in the year, leveraging our SG&A. And then more importantly, as I was referencing, there's additional expense levers that management really does have control over. And although we'll want to continue to preserve our more customer-facing expenses, those expenses such as our advertising line item, et cetera, for those that are less directly customer-facing, whether it's our travels, our supplies, our support center, those are the ones that we are really able to tighten our belt and take a more disciplined approach to give us the confidence that we'll be able to hit our EPS guidance."

And Oliver, in reference to your credit question, I'm going to kind of give you kind of a holistic answer and answer your 3 questions about timing and drawbacks and learnings from Zales. And I want to start off with stating -- and I just need to start off because we've said in the announcement that our credit metrics in our credit portfolio are strong. As we said, our credit metrics are improving sequentially and within our expectations and all were thought for and involved in our earnings guidance both on a quarterly basis and on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are strong. To answer your questions, the reason why we're doing this credit project, to your point is, yes, we have had some good experience with ADS. We've had a full quarter now under our belt where ADS has been managing our entire credit portfolio for Zales from January through now. And we're having some good experiences and we're learning more. And at Signet, we're an evolving company. We're always looking for ways to better improve our business model and our business. That being said, we always feel there's ways for us to getting smarter and understanding more about our business. And we've also seen other major retailers out there, and I'm sure a lot of you know of them, that have carried internal receivables and have sold their receivables and have done work with receivables of recent. And we just understand, as an evolution, we want to make sure that we're on top of it. We're a business that is constantly looking for ways to improve ourself. Actually, one of our mission statements is that we're always looking to continuously improve. So we look at every facet of our business on a regular basis to make sure that we're continuously improving how we can enhance our business for our operations and for our shareholder. And credit is no different. We've done major credit announcements in the past. So as we mentioned -- as I mentioned in my remarks, Oliver, possible outcomes could be outsourcing of all our credit functions, possible outcomes could be some in-housing of our credit functions, some could be outsourced. Other things that we'll be analyzing, is there ways to optimizing our debt structures on accounts receivables? Can we optimize our credit offerings? We're looking at variations of options to make sure that we're improving our ability to do sales, maximizing our profitability and enhancing our business model. And as far as timing goes, Oliver, it's a top priority for us. We will be thoughtful though, and we will be diligent about the work, but we're going to take time to be very thoughtful. And we are working real-time right now with Goldman Sachs on this, who has a lot of experience in this world and has done a lot of this type of work with other retailers. So that's why we're comfortable sharing it with you today. But we're not going to share a time line with you because we want to do this thoughtfully and methodically. But we will keep you up to date when appropriate."

The provisi",328,"Yes. Thanks, Oliver. So just real quick on that, we talked at quite length on the last call that, at the end of the day, regardless of recency or contractual, whatever method you're on, the financial results are going to yield the same answer. The provision will be the same. Our bad debt expense will be the same. But to that point, the reason why we use our recency is, one, we have done it since the beginning of time and it really has worked well for us over the years with the type of lending that we do, jewelry lending, that emotional connection. And it does optimize our collections for us. And so with the use of the recency, it does help us to engage with the borrowers, start collecting quicker and it gives the customers some flexibility based on the disciplined criteria that we had outlined of our recency aging on what a customer has to remit to stay current. It leaves that customer in good standing if they're having maybe a challenging month, where they can't remit a full payment. And that psychology and that flexibility of working with that customer puts that customer first. And that, at the end of the day, really drives maximization and optimization of our collection efforts. And then as I said, importantly, the financial results will be the same. Now we'll continue, and when you see the 10-Q that we plan to file within the next week or so, in the footnote, you'll see the same type of a breakdown of our aging. So we continue to provide that, the 30 days, 60, et cetera, and the 90 days. In terms of FICO scores, that will be an annual disclosure for us. But what I can tell you is the FICO scores are broadly in the same range as what we saw in Q4, which everybody would expect that you're not going to have major shifts quarter-to-quarter on that."

And we still feel very strong and have built good increase for Zales going forward. And we continue to see benefits from our cross-selling of brands. We continue to see tremendous benefit. And we think there's going to be a huge benefit to Zales as having our repair business being internal, not being done by third-party contractors, which will help the top line not only in the repair business, but ultimately you take care of a repair customer, you have a new customer for life and you take care of that customer. So we have a lot of areas of the business that are going to increase the top line. But we're focused right now on making sure that we get the model in place and we get the appropriate level of SG&A in line for that business model. So we do see good opportunities to continue to grow Zales going forward. And if you look at the counts for the Zales business itself, in this past first quarter, it was up over 3.5%, which is better than most of retail. So we still feel very good about the opportunities for Zales on the sales line. As far as there could be average sales in PANDORA, we did see some beads slowing down but not in our PANDORA business. We have a big bead business. PANDORA is just in our Jared stores. And we're very happy and excited about our PANDORA partnership. As we said, we have these new store-in-stores. It will take us a year to roll them out, but we will have all of our new stores -- our new stores-in-stores -- PANDORA stores-in-stores in our Jared stores by the 1st of November. Right now, we just completed about 50 doors and initial -- it's early, but initial sales results are very -- look very good to us. So we see great opportunities with PANDORA and increasing our partnership with PANDORA. And a big benefit of PANDORA partnership that we have, Simeon, is not just selling more beads. But PANDORA is doing a great job of designing new jewelry products at lower price points that we really haven't done a great job with in the past and have not had a good inventory assortment of the PANDORA jewelry products. And we're very excited about that opportunity for new business in our Jared stores this fourth quarter."

And this is really the first full quarter that we've had them in play. Overall, what we've seen with our Zale credit penetration rate for Q1 is it's about 48%. Now that's inclusive with primary, with ADS as well as our in-house second look that we're doing. But that 48% penetration rate compares about 41% last year. And that really, that increase in rate is really driven by the primary lending that ADS is doing. And so what we're seeing and what we expected to see as part of the benefit with ADS is it's driven by both a higher application and higher credit lines with ADS. And first, when you think about the changeover to ADS, there was a relaunch of the credit cards to customers. So one, you generally get -- that drives customers back into the stores. In addition, we did some field training related to the ADS rollout. I'd also say that when we think about the credit value proposition related to ADS, it really is more appealing than traditionally what we've had as it allows for lower minimum purchases that are required. And then also the application process, it is much more quicker and easier for that applicant. Previously, it was a paper application, where now we utilize technology and the driver's license, punch in data, and then they're off to the races with ADS. And then I would also add to that, when we think about benefit of ADS and that relationship is the reduced or the lower expenses associated with that, which is flowing through our P&L."

And there was a slowdown in April. If you just look at what we've accomplished compared to what our guidance was, at the time we gave the guidance, there was no doubt there's a slowdown in April that we experienced like all of retail. We've all been exposed to all the retail numbers out there for the first quarter. So our numbers slowed down but were better than most. That being said, going into May, we're seeing a similar level to May, not better, not worse, we're seeing a little -- similar level. So the guidance that we've given you for Q2 is assuming that things don't get better and things don't get worse from an economic environment basis.

And briefly, just to give you as a thought is that a good jewelry sales consultant has a book, and then we'll talk -- and they'll have it and they'll keep it manually now to understand all their customers, what they bought in the past, what are their key special occasions and their lifetime moments, whether it be birthdays or their loved ones or anniversaries or just graduation gifts and that type of things. And all that it is done -- been done manually in the past. We are going to be able now to have and give our associates real-time information through their iPads, so they could understand what their customers have bought in the past, what birthdays are coming up, how to communicate with them more intelligently. We'll also be able to use this technology for CRM. So we think there's just vast opportunities of what we can get incremental benefits and sales from this new technology. To your point, we're training up our people at our Jared and our Kay stores. And we'll start in August. We'll have a big training conference at our leadership conference in October. And for Jared and for Kay, they'll be fully ready for this aspect of this new technology for the fourth quarter. And we think there's a good opportunity to increase our sales and get incremental sales with just communicating more effectively with our customers. As far as Vera Wang and the extension of jewelry, we just think it's a great opportunity. Vera, as I said, is a tremendous designer. And she's got such credibility in the bridal area and she has a great eye, so she's been designing some beautiful jewelry, pearl jewelry, pearls and diamond jewelry for our business. And so far, it's testing well. And we don't want to say for certain because they're still in the testing zone. But if the tests continue to be successful, we may see some major extensions of Vera Wang jewelry roll out potentially in our Zales stores for the fourth quarter. But we'll keep you up to speed on that. As far as Ever Us goes, as you said, Dorothy, it is a tremendous success story for us and having an item and a trend that we have created. And we just -- this has just continued to grow for us. In the tests that we're starting to see in necklaces, we see opportunities potentially in other parts of jewelry, different ring styles are really going well. And we don't see a slowdown. As I said in my prepared remarks, from our experience, these types of trend-changing or beacon-type strategies, from our experience, that should gain momentum because as well as it did for us last year and into this year, it's still a small, small portion of customers out there that have just really have an understanding what Ever Us is all about. So we believe there's still tremendous upside for the Ever Us collection going into the fourth quarter and into the future."

And we believe we're gaining profitable market share in the jewelry industry. We believe that firmly because Jared is growing in a healthy, profitable way. That being said, we have made some enhancements and refinements to the Jared model. We talked about how we've changed some of the selling tactics that we use. We talked about how we are changing some of the assortment that we're having. We're getting more involved in some fashion areas. We're getting more involved with some lower price point fashion products. We're getting more involved with designers like Vera Wang. We've also talked about how we're continually looking for ways to enhance our selling coverage and how we sell to the Jared customer. And that Jared customer, we've learned in our segmentation analyses that they are looking for some -- a little bit more promotions. They are looking for some sales every once in a while. So we're testing that also. And Janet, we're also testing radio advertising in certain markets because continuity of radio is a strong thing. And we're selling products in Jared, engagement rings in Jared 12 months a year, not just in the 12 weeks that we advertise on TV. So we are actually very bullish on our Jared business. We believe that we've got a lot of good things going on at Jared's. And they're in a transition stage where we're changing the inventory up little bit. We're continuing to change the selling tactics that we have. And we're still working on testing some new bounce-back programs and coupons and promotions. So again, we feel very bullish about how Jared is going to perform in the fourth quarter as long as the economy is consistent and operating consistently."

There are 5 key messages I would like you to take away from our presentation today.

There are 5 key messages I would like you to take away from our presentation today. First, in what has been a choppy retail environment, we were able to deliver record EPS at the high end of our guidance. Our operating income, our net income and our earnings per share were all up over 20% year-over-year. This was due in large part to managing our expense structure in a disciplined fashion and realizing synergies that position Signet well for the long term. This prudent expense management included good results in credit, which Michele will speak about in more detail later. 
Second, we delivered solid sales for the quarter. Although our sales were slightly below our guidance, they were still strong enough to deliver on our earnings expectations. Year-to-date, we are gaining profitable market share. 
The third point I want you to take away is that we remain a growth story, a prudent, measured and profitable growth story. We remain on pace and are committed to growing our store square footage. Our disciplined internal rate of return requirement on new stores of 20% remains firm. The growth this year will be led by Kay Jewelers outside the enclosed mall. This is a departure from many other retailers that are having to reduce square footage these days. 
Fourth, we are reaffirming our annual earnings guidance. Our first quarter results and sales flow-through keep us positioned to achieve our year-end goals around EPS, adjusted EPS and synergies, despite a lower sales outlook. 
And fifth, we are conducting a strategic evaluation of our credit portfolio as we are always looking for ways to optimize our operating business model. Goldman Sachs, who has vast experience in this area, has been engaged as the company's adviser in this process. We will consider a full range of options as we evaluate our in-house and outsourced credit programs. These options include, but are not limited to: optimizing credit offerings; optimizing allocated debt and equity capitalization of the credit portfolio, including potential incremental securitization; bringing all credit function in-house over the long term; in-sourcing some credit functions and outsourcing others; and outsourcing all credit functions. This evaluation is a top priority, and as we move through this, we will remain focused on executing our operational plans and driving profitable growth in our business. 
Moving on to Slide 4 and the financial highlights. I'll leave the specific numbers and details for Michele, but the main headlines and accomplishments from a financial perspective relate to our first quarter as follows. We delivered a good sales gain, which include a 2.4% comp increase. We delivered operating margin expansion and we leveraged both gross margin and SG&A, coupled with meaningful buyback, which demonstrates our confidence in our business and the value we see in our shares. This led to record first quarter EPS with a double-digit percentage increase. And we have sound cash and liquidity levels, and we continue to possess a strong balance sheet with clean inventory and a responsible amount of debt. 
Next, I'd like to discuss the main sales drivers of the first quarter. Like the fourth quarter, results were led by our Ever Us, which is our 2-stone diamond ring collection. Ever Us is now testing line extensions in stores for the holiday season and some are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings as well as necklace with on-trim looks and innovative fastening systems were also very successful in the first quarter. Branded bridal also grew in Q1. The bridal business is a stable grower and insulates us from some of the volatility that traditional retailers face. Brands such as Vera Wang LOVE and Neil Lane led the way. 
Before I go into what's to come for the back half for our company, I want to take a few moments and make a few comments about our place in the jewelry industry. Our internal research shows definitively that consumers still find jewelry gift-giving as one of the best ways to celebrate life and express love. And the numbers support this. As shown on the left side of Slide 6, with 3- and 5-year compounded annual sale growth rates in the teens and 8% growth for 10 years when figuring in the recession, Signet has been gaining and continues to gain market share profitably. We consistently outperform the jewelry market and the total retail market. And based on results to date, we appear poised to deliver another year of industry outperformance. Given the fragmented jewelry industry, we believe we have many years of profitable market share gains ahead of us. Our brands, our scale and our people give us a sustained competitive advantage. Signet is relatively Amazon-proof as consumers have consistently shown a desire to touch jewelry and get educated by a trusted and trained professional before making a highly emotional purchase. 
We are in a consolidating industry. Jewelry in the U.S. is growing in dollars and declining in the number of doors, and we have 3 of the most preeminent brands in the space. 
We know that there are growth opportunities. And we also know how and where to get them, which makes us even more attractive for investment. 
So why invest in Signet? Firstly, we are the clear jewelry market leader with less than 8% of the total market share in the U.S., and it's a highly fragmented and growing middle-market industry. We are a square-footage grower and will be for years, and we are consolidating in a growing industry. During calendar 2018, after synergies are done and the Zales business model is ready and operating consistently, we intend to grow Zales outside the mall. 
We continue to deliver high-quality financial results. Our financial flow-through is powerful, with consistent comps and market expansion accelerated by the Zale acquisition. We believe this will lead to long-term EPS growth, coupled with a solid balance sheet, including prudent inventory management, and our financials compare pretty well with most of retail. 
We continue to have confidence that we will deliver on our annual earnings guidance. We have many competitive advantages that we're leveraging around our store teams, our marketing and our exciting merchandise programs. 
But allow me to discuss just a few of our exciting, compelling merchandise line extensions and tests that should help us deliver on the year by making the bulk of their contribution in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are successfully testing Ever Us line extensions such as new diamond ring styles, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. And in our experience, beacon, or industry's trend that's driving type strategies like this, tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. 
We are also testing a line of Vera Wang fashion diamond jewelry and pearls and pearl jewelry to capitalize on her strong name and her design expertise. 
In all of our jewelry stores, we are resetting our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores. As a part of it, we are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry and we'll support it with new TV advertising and creative in the fourth quarter. 
We're rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores, which shows the customer each stage of a diamond's journey from a rough diamond to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer segment who tends to value this type of product and information more so than some of our other store banners. We are also designing brand-new TV creative to support the Chosen also for the fourth quarter. 
And lastly, we have new technology for our store teams in Kay and Jared for the fourth quarter that will enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions. We call it clienteling and we are very excited about its potential to drive sales and build relations with our customers and our team members. 
Okay, now back to Signet's overall investment merits as we continue down Slide 7. Our integration is progressing as planned and delivering the synergies along the way. We are living up to the expectations that we've articulated. Where Signet has pockets of underperformance, we have strategies. For example, at Jared, merchandise, marketing and store operation plans will help us deliver a strong holiday season. 
And finally, we have a thoughtful and balanced capital allocation policy that accounts for strategic investments, meaningful stock repurchases, dividend increases and the preservation of capital. 
That concludes my prepared remarks and now I'll turn it over to Michele."
693964,330252171,993374,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

So we'll start with our first quarter sales performance. Signet's comps increased 2.4% and that's on top of a 3.6% comp increase in the prior year first quarter, with all 3 of our divisions delivering positive comp sales. Total sales increased 3.2%, and on a constant-exchange basis, total sales increased 3.9% for the quarter. 
In looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, let me share some additional color. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales increased 3.8% to $980 million, which included a comp increase of 2.3% on top of a prior year increase of 2.3%. Sales increases were driven principally by strong sales of select branded bridal jewelry as well as fashion jewelry. 
The Zale jewelry operating segment's total sales increased by 2.3% to $381 million and 3.2% on a constant-currency exchange basis. On a geography basis, our Zale U.S. sales increased 3.7% and comps increased 2.4%, and that's on top of a 5.4% comp increase in the prior year. Our Canadian total sales declined 6.2%, but increased 0.2% on a constant-currency basis with comp sales decline of 0.6%. Canada sales continue to be impacted primarily by the Western region of Canada due to the struggling energy industry. 
Across stores, sales were driven primarily by diamond fashion jewelry and branded bridal. 
Our Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.5% to $69 million with comp sales of 5.6% on top of 6.1% last year. Sales increases were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. 
And in the U.K., our total sales decreased 1.7% to $144 million, but increased 4% at constant currency rates. Comp sales grew 3.4% and that's on top of a 6.2% comp increase in the prior year. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of sales increases in the U.K. 
So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated Q1 performance and then we'll turn and we'll look at Signet's adjusted results. 
So turning to Slide 9. The table provides the reconciliation of Signet's adjusted results to consolidated results, and we're continuing to present this reconciliation in fiscal year 2017 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting as well as severance and IT implementation expenses associated with our global systems that will drive future synergies. Now the difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. 
So starting in the lower-left portion of the slide. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.87 per share and that's up 26.4% over last year. In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration costs, and as I had just mentioned, relate to severance that's associated with our organizational design changes and consulting costs related to information technology implementation. Integration costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution. 
So on an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustments, adjusted EPS was $1.95, an increase of 20.4% over last year. 
So now looking below our sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $604.4 million or 38.2% of adjusted sales, and that's up 40 basis points due primarily to the Zale division and a variety of synergies such as sourcing, discount controls and vendor terms as well as some favorability in commodity costs and leverage on store occupancy. Sterling Jewelers gross margin increased by 20 basis points due primarily to commodity costs. The Zale division's adjusted gross margin rate increased 90 basis points as synergies favorably affected many areas including our merchandise margins, distribution costs and store operating costs. 
Our U.K. gross margin decreased 30 basis points, driven principally by lower sales and merchandise margin deleverage as a result of currency exchange rates. 
Adjusted SG&A was $456.1 million or 28.8% of adjusted sales and that compares to $451 million or 29.3% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of leverage was due primarily to lower store and corporate payroll expenses associated with our organizational realignment as well as lower advertising expenses. This was offset, in part, by information technology expenses related to Signet's IT global implementation. 
Other operating income was $74.3 million or 4.7% of sales. This increase of $10.8 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. 
Adjusted operating income was $222.6 million and increased 14.7% over prior year first quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 14.1% of sales. Now this 150 basis point expansion over prior year was driven primarily by the increase in sales as well as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. 
Adjusted EPS was $1.95, which compares to $1.62 last year, an increase of 20.4%, driven principally by our stronger business performance. 
So now let's move on to the balance sheet and we'll take a look at our inventory. Our strong first quarter-end inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at about $2.5 billion, an increase of just 1% compared to our sales growth of 3.2%. This relationship to sales was driven by solid inventory management across virtually all of our product categories, divisions and locations, but most notably in branded bridal. We increased Zale inventory turns by reducing unproductive inventory, rightsizing store-level inventory closer to Kay averages and improving clearance inventory management. As we move through Q2, our inventory levels and merchandise assortment for fiscal 2017 are very well positioned. 
So now we'll turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our first quarter credit sales were $605.1 million compared to $573.1 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting an increase of 5.6%, which compares to an increase of 9.2% in the prior year. The higher credit sales was driven primarily by growth in bridal and Ever Us, both which have higher average transaction values. The average monthly payment collection rate for the first quarter fiscal 2017 was 12.3% compared to 12.6% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The change in rate over prior year is due primarily to merchandise mix, as bridal, especially higher-priced branded bridal, increases, this creates a higher average initial balance. Now by design, the minimum payment rate declines as the price point of the merchandise increases. Bridal has a higher average credit sales, therefore, the repayment period is slightly longer and cash collected as a percentage of the receivables declined slightly. 
The combination of growth in credit sales and collection rate led to an increase of 11% in our net accounts receivables compared to an increase of 14.7% in net receivables in the prior year quarter. Our quarter-ended net accounts receivable increased to $1.65 billion compared to $1.49 billion last year. 
Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all the other operating line on our income statement, was $72.8 million compared to $64.4 million last year. The increase of $8.4 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. 
Our net bad debt was $33.6 million compared to $28.1 million last year. The increase of $5.5 million was driven by our higher receivable balances. But more specifically, our bad debt provisioning establishes a 3% reserve at origination of the receivables based on historical experience. The higher our credit sales, meaning the more new volume in accounts receivable, the greater the amount contributes to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Now the net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $39.2 million and that's compared to $36.3 million in the prior year. 
So looking at some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful accounts metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 6.6% in the first quarter. This was up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. But what's most important is that, as we expected, we made more sequential improvement in Q1 of this year than we did in last year. So why is that? The impact of improved collection execution and credit marketing techniques that we began late last year are making more than just seasonal progress. We improved 40 basis points Q4 to Q1 versus 30 basis points over the same period prior year. 
Now the same trend was true for our nonperforming portion of our receivables as a percent of the gross receivables. At 3.6%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and down 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Again, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was better at 40 basis points down versus 30 basis points down in the prior year period. Building off the Q4 trends that we had discussed in our year-end earnings call in March, we continue to see the same improvement in trends in Q1 and we anticipate that these trends, broadly speaking, will hold true for the remainder of the year. 
So moving on to our capital allocation. I want to reiterate our priorities for capital structure and our capital allocation strategy that we had first introduced 14 months ago. We have a strong balance sheet and we have also extended our ABS agreement for an additional year. The strength in our balance sheet and flexibility allows us to invest in our business, execute our strategic priorities and return excess cash to shareholders, all while ensuring adequate liquidity. Our investment-grade ratings remain important to us because, long term, we may return to the debt markets. 
Our adjusted leverage ratio target is to be at or below 3.5x and we had ended fiscal 2016 at 3.7x. As our EBITDA grows in fiscal 2017, we anticipate that we will have additional leverage capacity and we are actively evaluating use of this capacity under the tenets of our capital allocation policy. 
We plan to distribute 70% to 80% of our annual free cash flow in the form of stock repurchases and/or dividends, assuming no other strategic use of capital. In recent years, we have been able to grow both dividends and share repurchases. Our share repurchase authorization is considerably higher now, given the recently announced $750 million buyback authorization to go along with what was already left on the previous program. At the end of the quarter, we had $761 million authorized after our $125 million of Q1 share repurchases. 
So now we'll move on to our financial guidance. Signet's second quarter comparable store sales are expected to increase 1% to 2%, which factors in our quarter-to-date performance and also assumes that the environment remains somewhat muted. Second quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.49 to $1.54. 
Now for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps of 2% to 3.5% and adjusted EPS of $8.25 to $8.55. The comp range has been reduced 100 basis points from our March guidance. Now we all see the trends out there, and with a softer consumer environment, we believe it is appropriate that we proactively reset our comp guidance. 
With that said, we continue to believe that the $8.25 to $8.55 EPS range is achievable for the following reasons. First, and just as a reminder, March was the first time we had issued full year guidance and we are just out of the gate into our new fiscal year, and appropriately so, we had guided to an earnings range that gave us room to achieve earnings under various scenarios. Second, we are planning for the strong earnings flow-through to come about through both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. We anticipate expanding our gross margin rate through higher sales and realization of synergies, and the SG&A leverage will flow due to marketing and organizational design efficiencies as well as additional expense levers within management's control. We proved this capability in Q1, where we were able to deliver at the high end of the EPS range despite lower sales from the guidance, and as a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our EPS guidance. 
Now as to other aspects of our guidance. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Under the recent U.S. Treasury and IRS proposed regulations, tax treatment of related-party debt and the tax deductibility of interest expense are limited to only certain related-party transactions. Signet's related-party financing arrangements, which stem primarily from the Zale acquisition, are grandfathered under the proposal and there is no impact on our short- to medium-term forecasted effective tax rate. 
Capital expenditure guidance for the full year is $315 million to $365 million driven by a combination of new stores, store remodels, information technology and facilities expenditures. 
Net selling square footage is projected to grow 3% to 3.5%, with most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than enclosed malls. 
We are also reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance, which we increased February 29. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively, that means the $60 million we realized last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. 
So in closing, we're pleased with our earnings performance and our relative financial results to date. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

We do have a third-party company that tracks the traffic in the malls. And it is showing that retail traffic as a whole was down for the first quarter. We have some traffic counters in our Jared stores, some in our Kay stores. And we're seeing declines that -- not as much as you're seeing with some of the third-party provider out there. But to your point, bridal is our stable type of business, where it is a premeditated purchase and people are coming into our stores thinking about bridal and shopping beforehand. So we don't believe we're as affected by retail traffic in jewelry as our retail competitors. But there is an effect obviously if there's less people in the malls and more so, like you said, for gift-giving. Now gift-giving is also a premeditated purchase, but we're just seeing less traffic in the malls as of right now and just overall retail traffic is down. But we still think the consumer is vibrant out there. And we're seeing -- on our own sales, you're seeing that we had a very respectable comp increase as it relates compared to the rest of the retail industry world."

And we believe that our team members in all of our stores are better trained and better equipped to educate our customers on this critical, emotional purchase and educate our customers about quality of the diamonds and understanding their needs.

So let me start with your question in terms of the gross margin and SG&A and some of the primary drivers that we're very much focused on. So first thing, it does start back with the synergies and really pushing the synergies through gross margin, also with [ph] SG&A. I mentioned on the call on the gross margin, what we're really starting to see flow through, and we continue to expect to have opportunities as we move into the year on the synergy front, really relate to our discounting controls that we've put in place, there's repairs, our vendor terms. We did actually move from in-sourcing our special events to outsourcing that. That has had a favorable impact on our gross margin. So there's a lot related to synergies that we see flowing through there. And in addition, there's still a little bit of favorability we're getting on the commodity cost front that's flowing through the gross margin. On the SG&A side, on the synergy front, we did a lot of work, and we talked about this during the fourth quarter, where we had accelerated some of the work around our organizational design efficiency. And so we're starting to see those benefits. We'll continue to see the benefits flowing through relating to that in terms of payroll savings. We've also really had been looking in optimizing our labor scheduling as it relates to our store payroll. So we continue to expect to see favorability flowing through that in the year, leveraging our SG&A. And then more importantly, as I was referencing, there's additional expense levers that management really does have control over. And although we'll want to continue to preserve our more customer-facing expenses, those expenses such as our advertising line item, et cetera, for those that are less directly customer-facing, whether it's our travels, our supplies, our support center, those are the ones that we are really able to tighten our belt and take a more disciplined approach to give us the confidence that we'll be able to hit our EPS guidance."

And Oliver, in reference to your credit question, I'm going to kind of give you kind of a holistic answer and answer your 3 questions about timing and drawbacks and learnings from Zales.

And Oliver, in reference to your credit question, I'm going to kind of give you kind of a holistic answer and answer your 3 questions about timing and drawbacks and learnings from Zales. And I want to start off with stating -- and I just need to start off because we've said in the announcement that our credit metrics in our credit portfolio are strong. As we said, our credit metrics are improving sequentially and within our expectations and all were thought for and involved in our earnings guidance both on a quarterly basis and on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are strong. To answer your questions, the reason why we're doing this credit project, to your point is, yes, we have had some good experience with ADS. We've had a full quarter now under our belt where ADS has been managing our entire credit portfolio for Zales from January through now. And we're having some good experiences and we're learning more. And at Signet, we're an evolving company. We're always looking for ways to better improve our business model and our business. That being said, we always feel there's ways for us to getting smarter and understanding more about our business. And we've also seen other major retailers out there, and I'm sure a lot of you know of them, that have carried internal receivables and have sold their receivables and have done work with receivables of recent. And we just understand, as an evolution, we want to make sure that we're on top of it. We're a business that is constantly looking for ways to improve ourself. Actually, one of our mission statements is that we're always looking to continuously improve. So we look at every facet of our business on a regular basis to make sure that we're continuously improving how we can enhance our business for our operations and for our shareholder. And credit is no different. We've done major credit announcements in the past. So as we mentioned -- as I mentioned in my remarks, Oliver, possible outcomes could be outsourcing of all our credit functions, possible outcomes could be some in-housing of our credit functions, some could be outsourced. Other things that we'll be analyzing, is there ways to optimizing our debt structures on accounts receivables? Can we optimize our credit offerings? We're looking at variations of options to make sure that we're improving our ability to do sales, maximizing our profitability and enhancing our business model. And as far as timing goes, Oliver, it's a top priority for us. We will be thoughtful though, and we will be diligent about the work, but we're going to take time to be very thoughtful. And we are working real-time right now with Goldman Sachs on this, who has a lot of experience in this world and has done a lot of this type of work with other retailers. So that's why we're comfortable sharing it with you today. But we're not going to share a time line with you because we want to do this thoughtfully and methodically. But we will keep you up to date when appropriate."

So just real quick on that, we talked at quite length on the last call that, at the end of the day, regardless of recency or contractual, whatever method you're on, the financial results are going to yield the same answer. The provision will be the same. Our bad debt expense will be the same. But to that point, the reason why we use our recency is, one, we have done it since the beginning of time and it really has worked well for us over the years with the type of lending that we do, jewelry lending, that emotional connection. And it does optimize our collections for us. And so with the use of the recency, it does help us to engage with the borrowers, start collecting quicker and it gives the customers some flexibility based on the disciplined criteria that we had outlined of our recency aging on what a customer has to remit to stay current. It leaves that customer in good standing if they're having maybe a challenging month, where they can't remit a full payment. And that psychology and that flexibility of working with that customer puts that customer first. And that, at the end of the day, really drives maximization and optimization of our collection efforts. And then as I said, importantly, the financial results will be the same. Now we'll continue, and when you see the 10-Q that we plan to file within the next week or so, in the footnote, you'll see the same type of a breakdown of our aging. So we continue to provide that, the 30 days, 60, et cetera, and the 90 days. In terms of FICO scores, that will be an annual disclosure for us. But what I can tell you is the FICO scores are broadly in the same range as what we saw in Q4, which everybody would expect that you're not going to have major shifts quarter-to-quarter on that."

And we still feel very strong and have built good increase for Zales going forward. And we continue to see benefits from our cross-selling of brands. We continue to see tremendous benefit. And we think there's going to be a huge benefit to Zales as having our repair business being internal, not being done by third-party contractors, which will help the top line not only in the repair business, but ultimately you take care of a repair customer, you have a new customer for life and you take care of that customer. So we have a lot of areas of the business that are going to increase the top line. But we're focused right now on making sure that we get the model in place and we get the appropriate level of SG&A in line for that business model. So we do see good opportunities to continue to grow Zales going forward. And if you look at the counts for the Zales business itself, in this past first quarter, it was up over 3.5%, which is better than most of retail. So we still feel very good about the opportunities for Zales on the sales line. As far as there could be average sales in PANDORA, we did see some beads slowing down but not in our PANDORA business. We have a big bead business. PANDORA is just in our Jared stores. And we're very happy and excited about our PANDORA partnership. As we said, we have these new store-in-stores. It will take us a year to roll them out, but we will have all of our new stores -- our new stores-in-stores -- PANDORA stores-in-stores in our Jared stores by the 1st of November. Right now, we just completed about 50 doors and initial -- it's early, but initial sales results are very -- look very good to us. So we see great opportunities with PANDORA and increasing our partnership with PANDORA. And a big benefit of PANDORA partnership that we have, Simeon, is not just selling more beads. But PANDORA is doing a great job of designing new jewelry products at lower price points that we really haven't done a great job with in the past and have not had a good inventory assortment of the PANDORA jewelry products.

And this is really the first full quarter that we've had them in play. Overall, what we've seen with our Zale credit penetration rate for Q1 is it's about 48%. Now that's inclusive with primary, with ADS as well as our in-house second look that we're doing. But that 48% penetration rate compares about 41% last year. And that really, that increase in rate is really driven by the primary lending that ADS is doing. And so what we're seeing and what we expected to see as part of the benefit with ADS is it's driven by both a higher application and higher credit lines with ADS. And first, when you think about the changeover to ADS, there was a relaunch of the credit cards to customers. So one, you generally get -- that drives customers back into the stores. In addition, we did some field training related to the ADS rollout. I'd also say that when we think about the credit value proposition related to ADS, it really is more appealing than traditionally what we've had as it allows for lower minimum purchases that are required. And then also the application process, it is much more quicker and easier for that applicant. Previously, it was a paper application, where now we utilize technology and the driver's license, punch in data, and then they're off to the races with ADS. And then I would also add to that, when we think about benefit of ADS and that relationship is the reduced or the lower expenses associated with that, which is flowing through our P&L."

And then just a follow-up to that. I guess, Mark, when you guys guided, I think, Valentine's Day was already over. I assume it's a big part of the quarter. So I'm just kind of curious. Can you comment on April? I mean, it was tough for most of retail. It seems like it was probably tough for you guys. I'm just kind of curious about the -- how the quarter maybe played out."

And we put that guidance out there on March 26, we had Valentine's Day under our belt. That being said, we had April ahead of us, which leads up to obviously some critical shopping for Mothers' Day. And there was a slowdown in April. If you just look at what we've accomplished compared to what our guidance was, at the time we gave the guidance, there was no doubt there's a slowdown in April that we experienced like all of retail. We've all been exposed to all the retail numbers out there for the first quarter. So our numbers slowed down but were better than most. That being said, going into May, we're seeing a similar level to May, not better, not worse, we're seeing a little -- similar level. So the guidance that we've given you for Q2 is assuming that things don't get better and things don't get worse from an economic environment basis. But even though you didn't ask, I want to say to you that we still feel very strongly about our earnings guidance for the year. And we believe that we have great opportunities in the second half, as I stated. And we have a lot of initiatives, Ike. We have more initiative this year than we even had last year. As I mentioned with the extension of Ever Us, as I mentioned with the Chosen Diamond for Jared that tested wonderfully. We're very excited about the PANDORA store-in-stores. We're very excited about the Vera Wang extension that's going into diamond jewelry and pearl jewelry. And we're very, very excited about this new technology that we're enabling our people in our stores to really be more sophisticated and more knowledgeable about their customers' past experience and what they bought and what they can go buy in the future to help them communicate better with our customers. So yes, we saw a slowdown in April. But we're still outperforming most of retail and we still feel very bullish, assuming the economy stays stable, that we're going to have a very good second half and fourth quarter."

So a little bit more color on the technology I was referring to. So we have some great partnerships that we're working with, some of the software technology companies, like Salesforce and Rosetta, that's working with us on this project we're calling clienteling. And briefly, just to give you as a thought is that a good jewelry sales consultant has a book, and then we'll talk -- and they'll have it and they'll keep it manually now to understand all their customers, what they bought in the past, what are their key special occasions and their lifetime moments, whether it be birthdays or their loved ones or anniversaries or just graduation gifts and that type of things. And all that it is done -- been done manually in the past. We are going to be able now to have and give our associates real-time information through their iPads, so they could understand what their customers have bought in the past, what birthdays are coming up, how to communicate with them more intelligently. We'll also be able to use this technology for CRM. So we think there's just vast opportunities of what we can get incremental benefits and sales from this new technology. To your point, we're training up our people at our Jared and our Kay stores. And we'll start in August. We'll have a big training conference at our leadership conference in October. And for Jared and for Kay, they'll be fully ready for this aspect of this new technology for the fourth quarter. And we think there's a good opportunity to increase our sales and get incremental sales with just communicating more effectively with our customers. As far as Vera Wang and the extension of jewelry, we just think it's a great opportunity. Vera, as I said, is a tremendous designer. And she's got such credibility in the bridal area and she has a great eye, so she's been designing some beautiful jewelry, pearl jewelry, pearls and diamond jewelry for our business. And so far, it's testing well. And we don't want to say for certain because they're still in the testing zone. But if the tests continue to be successful, we may see some major extensions of Vera Wang jewelry roll out potentially in our Zales stores for the fourth quarter. But we'll keep you up to speed on that. As far as Ever Us goes, as you said, Dorothy, it is a tremendous success story for us and having an item and a trend that we have created. And we just -- this has just continued to grow for us. In the tests that we're starting to see in necklaces, we see opportunities potentially in other parts of jewelry, different ring styles are really going well. And we don't see a slowdown. As I said in my prepared remarks, from our experience, these types of trend-changing or beacon-type strategies, from our experience, that should gain momentum because as well as it did for us last year and into this year, it's still a small, small portion of customers out there that have just really have an understanding what Ever Us is all about. So we believe there's still tremendous upside for the Ever Us collection going into the fourth quarter and into the future."

The fashion outlook, look, the fashion business is a business that we have to stay on top of. And it's not -- you've got to continually investigate and innovate with new opportunities and new styles like we did with Ever Us. And we have a lot of exciting things in the pipeline. I touched on several of them. One is PANDORA is all about fashion. PANDORA jewelry is all about fashion. When you think about the Vera Wang designs and what we're going to do, it's all about fashion. So we have a lot in the works, and we're testing the pipeline. We're just share some, for competitive reasons, that we're always looking to be innovative and look for new ways of continuing to test new things in fashion. Dorothy, give me an opportunity to say something broader. For us to continually gain market share in the jewelry industry over the last 5, 10 and 20 years, and for us to continue going forward, we, as a company, have got to constantly be innovative. We've got to consistently have new ideas in our pipeline, not only as it relates to fashion, which is critical, but all facets of our business. So we are continually -- that's why we opened a design center. That's why our design center is continually looking for new ways and looking at fashion trends to continually test and look for new ways of innovative ways to sell fashion and gift-giving products to our customers. So we believe we have a good, healthy pipeline in fashion. As far as the Jared business goes, Janet, we have said that we believe -- firmly, we believe that, even though Jared's comps were down in the first quarter, their total sales were up. And we believe we're gaining profitable market share in the jewelry industry. We believe that firmly because Jared is growing in a healthy, profitable way. That being said, we have made some enhancements and refinements to the Jared model. We talked about how we've changed some of the selling tactics that we use. We talked about how we are changing some of the assortment that we're having. We're getting more involved in some fashion areas. We're getting more involved with some lower price point fashion products. We're getting more involved with designers like Vera Wang. We've also talked about how we're continually looking for ways to enhance our selling coverage and how we sell to the Jared customer. And that Jared customer, we've learned in our segmentation analyses that they are looking for some -- a little bit more promotions. They are looking for some sales every once in a while. So we're testing that also. And Janet, we're also testing radio advertising in certain markets because continuity of radio is a strong thing. And we're selling products in Jared, engagement rings in Jared 12 months a year, not just in the 12 weeks that we advertise on TV. So we are actually very bullish on our Jared business. We believe that we've got a lot of good things going on at Jared's. And they're in a transition stage where we're changing the inventory up little bit. We're continuing to change the selling tactics that we have. And we're still working on testing some new bounce-back programs and coupons and promotions. So again, we feel very bullish about how Jared is going to perform in the fourth quarter as long as the economy is consistent and operating consistently."

I'd like to start by discussing the key point to one you'd takeaway from our second quarter financial results presentations. 
First, Signet's sales and earnings were disappointing in the second quarter, given no sign yet of a rebounding trend. This negatively impacts our annual guidance. We'll elaborate on what has happened and the impact to guidance later in this presentation. 
Second, our synergy were extremes remains solid and their financial impact is still impact. We have a long list of synergy activities, which I'll discuss in a few moments. Although some initiatives are unfavorably impacted in the lower sales environment, most are not, so we still expect to deliver on our synergies. 
The third point I want to you to takeaway is that we bought back 4% of the company during the second quarter and some of our directors and officers made open market purchases as well. We did this in response to our valuation and to demonstrate our confidence in Signet. 
Fourth, our credit strategic evaluation is moving forward. As you know, we are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our portfolio while continuing to do business with our customers. 
On a few comments later but the bottom line is this, either way, we expect shareholder value to be accretive. 
Fifth, we are pleased to announce that Signet and Leonard Green Partners have entered into a strategic partnership and with a private equity firm [indiscernible] about $625 million in Signet to a convertible preferred security. Details describe in a separate release. 
And lastly, and most importantly, our holiday season initiatives are numerous, well tested and ready. So let's get into some more details. 
So why the disappointing results in the second quarter? What happened? Well it's a combination of several things, some macro and some micro. We've got an economic factors, our stores and states and provinces closely tied to the energy industry, dramatically underperformed the division averages. It didn't matter the store banner, the price point or the merchandise brand, it was an obvious across-the-board trend. Sales especially has a large presence in Texas. Signet's overall performance was clear in -- underperformance was clear in other places like Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alberta, Canada. 
Net-net, energy regions accounted for approximately half of our comp decline within North America. The latest U.S. government jewelry report recently advised 2015's year-end energy growth to down to just -- down to just up 2/10 of 1%. The BDA's latest estimate for the year, which are frequently revised, are still below historic norms. 
Mastercard spending polls also notes quarter 2 slowdown in jewelry sales. The slower industry trend and outlook is further corroborated by the jewelry board trades recently report on independent jewelry foreclosures, and we have informal industry feedback. 
Jared's underperformance account for material part of our miss. Texas-located Jared accounting for less than 15% of the Jared store count. However, these stores accounted for nearly half of Jared's comp decline in the second quarter. We believe Jared has a number of fundamental issues that have not been quick and easy fixes. We now better understand the unique characteristics of the Jared customer through our segmentation work, and we are taking the following actions. We are enhancing our selling capabilities to be able to better sell the entire store while minimizing or eliminating customer handouts. We are through improving marketing creative, along with targeting our media ways to more effectively communicate with the segmented Jared customers. We are distinguishing merchandise assortment to be more unique to Jared, such as the Chosen Diamond and our PANDORA boutiques. And we are testing a variety of pricing tactics to ensure our team members have the tools they need to compete and win. 
Now moving to Slide 5. I'd like to discuss some of the Zales wins during the second quarter. Results were led by Ever Us, our 2-stone diamond jewelry collection. Ever Us is now testing line extension in stores for the holiday season and many are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings as well as necklaces with on-trim looks and innovative systems were also successful in the quarter. 
We released some significant improvements to our Kay and Jared online experience, the design, navigation, imagery, speed and ease-of-use are all significantly upgraded. 
And finally, our real estate portfolio diversity served us well as our leading results came from our outlets and mall-based kiosks. 
Now shifting from sales initiatives to synergies. And to review synergy, as we define it, is a net contribution to operating profit. Most of the synergies we are recognizing this year relates to gross margin enhancements and operating expense decreases as opposed to sales increases. 
I won't go to depth on each of the 14 examples listed on Slide 6 and works in detail beyond each one. But as you can see, we've got a tremendous amount of activity going onto fully optimize the integration. In spite of decelerating sales, we are still confident we'll hit our synergy targets because most of the synergies are not dependent upon sales. For example, insourcing repair, the complete overhaul of the Zale repair model saves expense on each repair. 
Nonmerchandise sourcing. Our greatest scale allows us to reduce cost and products and services we buy on a per unit basis. Distribution center operations. We are going to save on the consolidation of 2 distribution centers into 1. Each of these and many, many other projects will make us leaner and position us even better for long-term growth. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where we have historically, made half of our annual profits. And so our attention and focus is now intensely directed to our holiday season business drivers. 
I'll elaborate on some of them here. Again, one of our biggest initiatives is Ever Us. And in our experience, [ph] or industry trend driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. This year we will offer additional jewelry categories and styles, [ph], more inventory, greater prints, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. We have continued our collaboration with Forever Mark, which is a diamond brand of the De Beers group of companies, and we are pleased they will be supporting the Ever Us program in their stores that carry Forever Mark, by the way, which includes Jared, with a TV campaign of their own in the fourth quarter. This will undoubtedly further increase the rach of the campaign and consumer desire for Ever Us nationwide. 
Finally, Ever Us will have a greater merchandising and marketing presence in our stores in Canada and the U.K. this year. We're expanding the iconic Vera Wang LOVE bridal jewelry collection into fashion jewelry in nearly all of our Zales stores. The collection include diamond jewelry as well as pearls supported with new in-store displays. 
Marketing will support the new merchandise collection through television and PR events. This holiday season all eyes are on the ear and we continue to drive trend in earnings, earing climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our [ph] reflections and analyst collection with create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings. 
In our Jared stores, we are resetting our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores or boutiques. As a part of it, we are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry and will support with new TV advertising creative. We are rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores, which show the customer each stage of the diamond journey from rough to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment to Jared customer who tend to  [indiscernible] this type of product and information more so than our other store banners. We are also designing a brand new TV creative to support the Chosen. 
In Kay and Jared, we are rolling out a new software that we called clienteling to enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions. 
One of our omnichannel strategy is to strengthen personalization. In the fourth quarter, online consumers will see more personalized content based upon previous interactions of our brands. They will benefit for more personalized store locator experience. 
And lastly, in addition to new creative marketing, that will support each of our initiatives I just mentioned, we have many targeted marketing plans tying into the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. 
We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media. 
Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I'll share with you a few very high level updates and comments. As I noted at the outset, we are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio while continuing to add the capability to do business with our customers. 
On the optimization front, we are examining how we can change our credit business model to maximize value and disclosure and minimize accounting complexity. 
On the monetization front, we've launched a request for proposal process and, thus far, we are very pleased with the interest in our credit and there are multiple interested party that we are in discussions with. 
We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. One critical point that I want to make sure you are all fully aware and appreciate is that we expect shareholder value will be created under either scenario. 
If we optimize the portfolio, we'll likely increase the leverage against it and use the proceeds on growth initiatives, buybacks and/or dividends. Furthermore, we will likely revamp and expand our reporting and disclosure of credit profitability, contractual aging and the other metrics. 
If we monetize the portfolio, it means we have preserved satisfactory near-term and long-term economics for Signet and reduce risk to our balance sheet. Again, we hope to include this whole process as soon as possible. 
We are very pleased to announce that Leonard Green Partners has agreed to invest $625 million in Signet. The transaction is a significant vote of confidence in the Signet operating model and our long-term prospects for growth. 
We open our books and shared significant amount of information as a part of this process, and with the benefit of full due diligence on the company, Leonard Green decides to make a sizable investment, and we are very excited to have Managing Director, Jonathan Sokolov, assume as seat on the Signet board. The goal is to find the party with significant resources and broad financial and retail expertise who could become a large owner and partner with us for long-term as our business evolves. 
The timing in this deal is perfect and that our business is going through a transformation, including the credit portfolio review, and we look forward to having the benefit of Leonard Green's perspectives as we complete the process. 
The successful investment here should also serve as a validating signal to the public markets about the long-term strength of our business model and our practices as a whole. 
In return for its cash investment, Leonard Green will own convertible preferred stock in Signet. The transaction sale was designed to be financially neutral as Leonard Green's investment will be based off the market price of our shares and we will be recycling the capital into share repurchases as similar prices. Thereby making a watch from a financial perspective. 
What we therefore get from the transaction is not capital but the experience, resources, financial acumen and retail expertise that Leonard Green's Leonard Green brings to the table. Having a large [indiscernible] with in the game and their skill set will strengthen our board and add a tremendously valuable perspective as our business model continues to evolve. 
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter this year and is subject to getting customary regulatory approvals. 
We believe the long-term secular and company-specific picture looks promising. We think our competitive strength, our long-term opportunity for growth and our president of success make us a worthy long-term investment, certainly Leonard Green did. Signet plays an industry with a long history of growth. And although the latest share grew minimally, we have seen this before and bounced back with a higher market share. 
People still fall in love and [indiscernible] themselves in jewelry as they have done for literally thousands of years. Signet has some of the best-known and most trusted jewelry retail brand names in the world. Knowing that customers interact with us first online and then potentially long after the sales power services, we are developing an omnichannel experience that will be best-in-class. Customers can now become better educated and see a wide range of options regardless of where they engaged with us and what they are engaging us for. 
Few in retail [indiscernible] can match the depth and breadth experiences that Signet offers. Given our scale and our experience, we can create and drive jewelry trends better than anyone in the industry. Innovation and the power of brands are in their infancy stages in the jewelry industry, and we are best positioned to take advantage of this. 
Our numbers clearly show that a strong presence on television not only drive sales but also market share gains. Our strategy is to have a strong presence in national TV at the right times while others who sale jewelry don't, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We have a diverse real estate portfolio and locations that provide solid returns. We are profitable in the mall and outside of it and high-volume properties and in low-volume properties, in kiosks and outlets and in our power centers. Our diversity in terms of retail channel and retail location is serving us very well. We continue to maintain a disciplined internal rate of return requirement of 20% on new stores, and we see our best opportunity these days in Kay Jewelers stores outside the mall. 
As a major industry player, scale obviously helps in the dealings throughout our supply chain. But it's much, much more than just scale. We have the experience, we have the know-how, we have the relationships and we have the process that are difficult for others to match and do business in the diamond jewelry industry. 
Most outside companies had sell valuable things like cars and computers, we had Signet sell products, we finance them and we insure them. It's a complete end-to-end solutions that our customers embrace and makes a great business sense for us. 
And lastly, we have the financial wherewithal to compete and win at all types of business environments. We have weather difficult times before. We've invested when others couldn't. We know how to strike an appropriate balance between growth and savings, and we believe we'll come this -- through all of these stronger than ever. That concludes my remarks. 
And now I'll turn over to Michele."
693964,372307437,1038859,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's comps decreased 2.3% against an increase of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of",2235,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's comps decreased 2.3% against an increase of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of 9%. 
Now as Mark indicated, although our comp sales decline, about half of the decline was driven by oil and gas reliant regions. Total sales decreased 2.6% and on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 1.3% for the quarter. So in looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, I'll share some additional color. 
In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 2.2% to $839 million. Comps decreased 3.1% compared to an increase of 3.3% last year and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of 10%. Sales weakness was most pronounced by store banner and geography, notably Jared stores and energy-dependent regional economy. 
Now these declines were partially offset by higher sales of select diamond collection as well as fashion category. The sales jewelry operating segment total sales decreased 1.6% to $331 million and 1% on a constant currency exchange basis. 
Comps were down 3% and that's against a 2-year hurdle rate of 4.8%. So looking on a geography basis, our value at total sales were flat. Comps decreased 2.2% and that's against a 2-year stack rate of 4%. In Canada, total sales declined 9.5% or 5.9% on a constant currency basis. 
Canadian comp sales declined 6.8% and that's against a 2-year hurdle rate of 8.2%. The Zale Jewelry operating segment declined throughout North America was also driven by weakness in energy-dependent economies and again, this was partially offset by sales of select diamond jewelry collection. 
Now [indiscernible] piercings [indiscernible] total sales increase of 7.8% to $57 million with comp sales of 6.4% and that is on top of 8.4% last year and a 2-year rate of 5.6%. Sales increases were driven predominantly by gold chains and diamond jewelry. 
Looking in the U.K., our U.K. total sales decreased 8.7% to $145 million but increased 2% at constant currency rates. Comps were 0.8% on top of 5.1% in prior year and compared to 2-year rate of 9.5%. 
Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the sales increases that we saw in the U.K. So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated and adjusted results. 
So again, we're continuing to present the reconciliation that you see on Slide 12 to reflect the impact of purchase accounting as well as severance and I/T implementation expenses associated with global systems that will drive future synergies. 
The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. So if we start in the lower left portion of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.06 per share. 
So moving to the next our mover, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS solution and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. 
Again, moving over the next column reflects our integration costs, which relates to consulting costs related to IT implementation as well as severance. Integration and severance costs was also possible $0.04 of EPS dilution. 
On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustment, our adjusted EPS was $1.14 per share. 
All right so we're going to look below sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $468 million or 34% of adjusted sales and that's down 130 basis points due primarily to lower sales that resulted in deleverage on fixed cost such as store occupancy as well as higher bad debt expense, primarily due to higher receivables. 
Now this was partially offset by the realization of synergies. Adjusted SG&A was $409.1 million or 29.7% of adjusted sales compared to $413.4 million or 29.2% of adjusted sales in the prior year. 
The 50 basis points of deleveraging rate was also due principally to lower sales, so I will go into more details on SG&A on the following slide. So continuing down. Other operating income was $70.7 million or 5.1% of sales. The increase was $7.9 million due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. 
Adjusted operating income was $129.6 million and that decreased 13.3% over prior year second quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 9.4% of sales, with the decline in the rate due to the lower top line. Adjusted EPS was $1.14 per share compared to $1.28 last year, a decrease of $0.14 or 10.9%. 
All right. So let's take a closer look at our SG&A. Our teams really did a great job on focusing on top controls and savings. Our SG&A expense in dollars, as you see, declined by $4 million or 1% year-over-year despite unplanned expenses that we experienced in our quarter. 
Although the dollar reduction in the SG&A wasn't enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volumes, it does reflect solid management of expenses, nonetheless. 
Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll and that is both at the store and corporate level. So as shown on the slide, stores and corporate payroll declined and that's a driven by combination of less variable compensation that [ph] with sales, including corporate incentive compensation, synergies associated with both store and corporate payroll and lower expenses due to favorable exchange -- foreign exchange. 
Advertising was prudently managed to just $1 million increase. We also incurred unplanned costs of $5 million on consulting and related expenses due to the unsubstantiated claims against Signet's business integrity. Other expenses increased, driven predominantly by our I/T road map, including higher depreciation and amortization. So all of that led to a small decrease in our SG&A expense. 
So moving on to P&L, I want to hit a few balance sheet highlights 1and we'll start with inventory. Our strong second quarter and inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. 
Net inventory ended the period virtually flat at $2.4 billion. Our teams, again, did a great job at managing in a slow environment, while at the same time not start in the business growth opportunities. The impact from stores for more stores was virtually of spread the impact to sell merchandise management and foreign exchange on inventory procured in currencies other than the strong U.S. dollar. 
So we'll move on, and we're going to focus on our info our credit metrics and statistics. Our second quarter in-house credit price sales in the Sterling division were $529 million, that's a down 1.7%. And although lower, the in-house credit sales were slightly more favorable than the's division total sales decline and therefore, the relative share in the mix of tender. 
In-house credit participation was 63.1% and that is up 50 basis points due to more effective credit marketing, a greater receptivity among our highest-quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in credit sales mix within our credit to respect the average monthly payment collection rate for the second quarter fiscal 2017 was 10.8% compared to 11.3% last year. 
Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received, divided by beginning accounts receivable. The decline in [indiscernible] rate is principally to credit line makes. We are now operating a 3 6-month0 plan for select eligible borrowers in our mall stores. 
So as participation in this planned growth, the monthly payment collection rate will slightly decline. Importantly, the 36-month plan enhances the quality of our receivables portfolio. So this has been tested for 3 years and fully rolled out this year. The plan requires $3,000 minimum purchase on bridal jewelry. 
That means it is only open to borrowers who qualify for a $3,000 line or more or lower rate customers and because it is available for bridal jewelry, there is a stronger emotional connection and the implicit commitment to repay. The combination of collection rate decline and growth in credit participation lead to an increase in our net accounts receivable of $146 million or 9.1% to $1.75 billion. 
Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other corporate income line on our P&L was $70.1 million compared to $62.9 million last year. The increase of $7.2 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. 
Our net bad debt expense was $55.3 million and that's compares to $49.4 million last year. The increase of $5.9 million in expense which driven primarily by our higher receivable balances and a slight impact from an increase in nonperforming loans, which I'll drive momentarily. 
The net impact of bad debt and finance charge income generated operating profit of $14.8 million and that is up $1.3 million from last year. 
So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for capital accounts metrics. Our total valuation allowance as we reset gross receivables was 7.4% in the second quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points from prior year was driven by an IT glitch, relating to customer reminders during the second quarter, which resulted in slightly higher [ph] rates in the over 90-day aging category combined with overall receivable. On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 80 basis points, same as prior year, reflecting our seasonality changes. 
The same trend which is true for the nonperforming portion of our receivables as we presented gross receivables. At 4.4%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year end up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter for the same reasons that I just discussed. I guess, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was the same versus the prior year period. 
In summary, we remain absolutely confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance-based on the visibility that we have into our daily collection, our weekly role rates and other key performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings.
So I'd like to move now and to spend a few minutes relating to our capital allocation. As mentioned in the release, in earlier in this presentation, we made a concerted move to repurchase and unprecedented amount of stock in a single quarter. We've bought back 4% of shares in Q2. Now I want to limit my remarks on stock valuation, recognizing that this is quite frankly more of your job than mine. But when a market leader and a growing industry with a solid balance sheet reports record Q1 earnings in May and then goes on to get rewarded with the lowest valuation on the S&P 500 specialty retail, in-depth while time for unprecedented Bibles to cover lender is presently give us a vote of confidence by agreeing to 1 amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility. Signet had $400 million line for many years but with the acquisition of Zale, we are now a much bigger company with more seasonal needs and generally more growing up. This new $700 million, and is now commensurate with the size and the activity of our company. So approximately $200 million of that revolver was tapped in Q2 to help finance the share repurchase. 
So with that, we're going to turn to financial guidance. Signet's third quarter comparable store sales are expected to decrease between 3% and 3.5%. We have seen challenging trends in the summer and with notices taxes now that the list, grant expecting these change in the most of the fall. 
Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.17 to $0.25. Now, by the way, that guidance includes an expected 1x $0.07 benefit from the effect of harmonizing Signet's compensated absent policy. Not until the holiday season kicks in the we expect to see a trend inflection point for all the reasons that Mark had just previously stated. And that's why for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps to decline a more modest 1% to 2.5% and adjusted EPS of sent $7.25 to $7.55. 
The is annual adjusted EPS guidance does adjust a growth rate of about 8% and that is  driven primarily by synergies, cost control, higher finance charging, as well as a lower effective tax rate and accretion from for share repurchases. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Our capital expenditure guidance for the full year has been reduced to $280 million to $320 million. As As you may have noticed in our earnings release without this morning, we did not change our projected store count range of special the reduction in CapEx moves us closer to the lower end of the ranges and the reduction in primarily relates to the deferral of select I/T projects. Projected net selling square footage also remain constant. As we continue to expect growth of 3% to 3.5%. Most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other at and in most malls the gate banner. Again, we are reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. So that means the $60 million from the last year of another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we should deliver it $225  million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. 
So with that, that concludes my prepared remarks, and I'm happy to turn the call back over to Mark."

Jared fundamental issues, as I stated in my prepared comments, after reviewing the intense research on our Jared customer and understanding how that customer is segment differently than our Kay or Zales stores, we are focused on making sure to understand the customer better and putting in the right products, having the right advertising communication vehicle, talking to those customers specifically and making sure that we do what they believe is the best for the Jared customer experience. So we think starting with the Chosen Diamond, which we know is perfectly targeted to the Jared sentimentalist costumer that track their journey we. Think it's going to be a tremendous enhancements to the Jared business in the fourth quarter. It's been testing very well, Oliver, and we continue to see in bands enhancements at every story that continues the test of the Chosen Diamond. So we believe once we have that in all of our Jared stores for the fourth quarter, supported by a wonderful advertising television creative to really explain the journey of the diamond will come is going to be a huge enhancement to the Jared stores in the fourth quarter and postdocs specifically to the customer segmentation of that Jared customer. We also have some initiatives that we have in place on enhancing our selling tactics. Making sure that our customer is taking care from the me if they come into the door and not just around the different departments while they're in the selling area. We're also testing certain, I mentioned, this certain package I 1 go to a lot of data for competitive reasons. we are have pricing tactics we are getting right now we think and be an announcement for Jared in the fourth quarter. We're also very excited to my mentioned this in my comments, we're very excited about the Jared stores story the Jared and the ribald expect we have about 180 stores that have them up at a rate now we have expanded assortment in Pandora jewelry. We have targeted training and a targeted sales associate as working just in the Pandora counter, and we believe with that expansion of PANDORA and our Jared stores and will be creating a specific grade for advertising to communicate to customers about the broad assortment that we have in our Jared Pandora. We'll increase our foot traffic in the fourth quarter coming to the stores also. So we see that we had some very good initiatives to Jared store banners that ties, to some degree, to the segment customers that quite frankly we were in doing a good job over the last couple of years on, and we believe we have done a good job on that. As far as the partnership with Leonard Green. We -- Leonard Green is one of the foremost experts in the private equity world in investing in retail companies. They have a wealth of knowledge not only from the financial side but also from the retail experience of being on board and working with other companies. And we, at Signet, are very much looking forward to having their guidance in getting their partnership with Austin helping us determine always with can pick this company going forward. We're looking forward to getting their insight in working through some of your partners and giving us some best practice we can't take on at Jared, at Signet the and has the business. And the reason is timing is perfect now is because, as I said, in my prepared comments, our evaluation is now and the idea of getting a company like Leonard Green, who did a thorough due diligence of our business, of our processes, of our processes, just validates that Signet has a great business model and that Signet has some an great growth prospects going forward, and we believe that Leonard Green on our board, Mr. Sokoloff on our board, just will continue to help us out going forward, and we really are excited, quite frankly, of having Leonard Green's input and insight on the important importance it's going to make as it relates to our quick strategy review. So that's just a few of the reasons why we believe Leonard Green greens would be a really exciting partner for Signet going forward."

There's a since obviously there is a presidential election, which is unique this year, and I think has some very unique characteristics that can be affecting the mindset of Middle America consumers until we get through this.

We just have to be focused on making sure we are doing what we know how to do this taking care of customers and continued to innovate and bringing exciting new products to the consumers out there in our markets.

I'd like to start by discussing the key point to one you'd take away from our second quarter financial results presentations.First, Signet's sales and earnings were disappointing in the second quarter, given no",2535,"Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by discussing the key point to one you'd take away from our second quarter financial results presentations.
First, Signet's sales and earnings were disappointing in the second quarter, given no sign yet of a rebounding trend. This negatively impacts our annual guidance. We'll elaborate on what has happened and the impact to guidance later in this presentation.
Second, our synergy work streams remain solid and their financial impact is still intact. We have a long list of synergy activities, which I'll discuss in a few moments. Although some initiatives are unfavorably impacted in a lower sales environment, most are not, so we still expect to deliver on our synergies.
The third point I want you to takeaway is that we bought back 4% of the company during the second quarter and some of our directors and officers made open market purchases as well. We did this in response to our valuation and to demonstrate our confidence in Signet.
Fourth, our credit strategic evaluation is moving forward. As you know, we are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our portfolio while continuing to do business with our customers. I will have a few comments later but the bottom line is this, either way, we expect shareholder value to be created.
Fifth, we are pleased to announce that Signet and Leonard Green Partners (sic) [ Leonard Green & Partners ] have entered into a strategic partnership and with the private equity firm, will invest $625 million in Signet to a convertible preferred security. Details are described in a separate release.
And lastly, and most importantly, our holiday season initiatives are numerous, well tested and ready. So let's get into some more details.
So why the disappointing results in the second quarter? What happened? Well, it's a combination of several things, some macro and some micro. Regarding economic factors, our stores in states and provinces closely tied to the energy industry, dramatically underperformed the division averages. It didn't matter the store banner, the price point or the merchandise brand, it was an obvious across-the-board trend. Sales especially has a large presence in Texas. Signet's overall performance was clear in -- underperformance was clear in other places like Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alberta, Canada.
Net-net, energy regions accounted for approximately half of our comp decline within North America. The latest U.S. government jewelry report recently advised 2015's year-end energy growth to down to just -- down to just up 0.2%. The BDA's [ph] latest estimate for the year, which are frequently revised, are still below historic norms.
MasterCard SpendingPulse also notes a quarter 2 slowdown in jewelry sales. The slower industry trend and outlook is further corroborated by the Jewelry Board of Trade's recent report on independent jewelry foreclosures, and we have informal industry feedback.
Jared's underperformance accounted for material part of our miss. Texas-located Jared stores account for less than 15% of the Jared store count. However, these stores accounted for nearly half of Jared's comp decline in the second quarter. We believe Jared has a number of fundamental issues that have not been quick and easy fixes. We now better understand the unique characteristics of the Jared customer through our segmentation work, and we are taking the following actions. We are enhancing our selling capabilities to be able to better sell the entire store while minimizing or eliminating customer handouts. We are improving upon our marketing creative, along with targeting our media bias to more effectively communicate with the segmented Jared customers. We are distinguishing merchandise assortments to be more unique to Jared, such as the Chosen Diamond and our PANDORA boutiques. And we are testing a variety of pricing tactics to ensure our team members have the tools they need to compete and win.
Now moving to Slide 5. I'd like to discuss some of the sales wins during the second quarter. Results were led by Ever Us, our 2-stone diamond jewelry collection. Ever Us is now testing line extension in stores for the holiday season and many are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings as well as necklaces with on-trim looks and innovative fastening systems were also successful in the quarter.
We released some significant improvements to our Kay and Jared online experience. The design, navigation, imagery, speed and ease-of-use are all significantly upgraded.
And finally, our real estate portfolio diversity served us well as our leading results came from our outlets and mall-based kiosks.
Now shifting from sales initiatives to synergies. And to review a synergy, as we define it, is a net contribution to operating profit. Most of the synergies we have recognized in this year relates to gross margin enhancements and operating expense decreases as opposed to sales increases.
I won't go to depth on each of the 14 examples listed on Slide 6 and the works in detail behind each one. But as you can see, we've got a tremendous amount of activity going onto fully optimize the integration. In spite of decelerating sales, we are still confident we'll hit our synergy targets because most of the synergies are not dependent upon sales. For example, insourcing repair, the complete overhaul of the Zale repair model saves expense on each repair. Nonmerchandise sourcing, our greatest scale allows us to reduce cost on products and services we buy on a per-unit basis. Distribution center operations, we are going to save on the consolidation of 2 distribution centers into 1. Each of these and many, many other projects will make us leaner and position us even better for long-term growth.
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where we have historically made a half of our annual profits. And so our attention and focus is now intensely directed to our holiday season business drivers.
I'll elaborate on some of them here. Again, one of our biggest initiatives is Ever Us. And in our experience, weakened [ph] or industry trend driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. This year we will offer additional jewelry categories and styles, higher carat weights, more inventory, greater prints, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. We have continued our collaboration with Forevermark, which is a diamond brand of the De Beers Group of Companies, and we are pleased that they will be supporting the Ever Us program in their stores that carry Forevermark, by the way, which includes Jared, with a TV campaign of their own in the fourth quarter. This will undoubtedly further increase the reach of the campaign and consumer desire for Ever Us nationwide. Finally, Ever Us will have a greater merchandising and marketing presence in our stores in Canada and the U.K. this year.
We're expanding the iconic Vera Wang LOVE bridal jewelry collection into fashion jewelry in nearly all of our Zales stores. The collection include diamond jewelry as well as pearls supported with new in-store displays.
Marketing will support the new merchandise collection through television and PR events. This holiday season all eyes are on the ear, and we continue to drive trend in earrings, earring climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our Radiant Reflections and Endless Brilliance collection, which create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings.
In our Jared stores, we are resetting our PANDORA presentation with a beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores or boutiques. As a part of it, we are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry, and we'll support it with new TV advertising creative.
We are rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores, which show the customer each stage of the diamond's journey from rough to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer, who tend to value this type of product and information more so than our other store banners. We are also designing a brand-new TV creative to support the Chosen.
In Kay and Jared, we are rolling out a new software that we call Clienteling to enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions.
One of our omnichannel strategy is to strengthen personalization. In the fourth quarter, online consumers will see more personalized content based upon previous interactions of our brands. They will also benefit from more personalized store locator experience.
And lastly, in addition to new creative marketing, that will support each of our initiatives I just mentioned, we have many targeted marketing plans tying into the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. 
We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media.
Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I'll share with you a few very high level updates and comments. As I noted at the onset, we are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio while continuing to add the capability to do business with our customers.
On the optimization front, we are examining how we can change our credit business model to maximize value and disclosure and minimize accounting complexity.
On the monetization front, we've launched a request for proposal process and thus far, we are very pleased with the interest in our credit book and there are multiple interested party that we are in discussions with.
We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. One critical point that I want to make sure you are all fully aware of and appreciate is that we expect shareholder value will be created under either scenario.
If we optimize the portfolio, we'll likely increase the leverage against it and use the proceeds on growth initiatives, buybacks and/or dividends. Furthermore, we will likely revamp and expand our reporting and disclosure of credit profitability, contractual aging and other metrics.
If we monetize the portfolio, it means we have preserved satisfactory near-term and long-term economics for Signet and reduce risk to our balance sheet. Again, we hope to conclude this whole process as soon as possible.
We are very pleased to announce that Leonard Green Partners (sic) [ Leonard Green & Partners ] has agreed to invest $625 million in Signet. The transaction is a significant vote of confidence in the Signet operating model and our long-term prospects for growth.
We open our books and share significant amount of information as a part of this process, and with the benefit of full due diligence on the company, Leonard Green decides to make a sizable investment, and we are very excited to have Managing Director, Jonathan Sokoloff, assume a seat on the Signet board. The goal is to find a party with significant resources and broad financial and retail expertise, who could become a large owner and partner with us for long term as our business evolves.
The timing in this deal is perfect, in that our business is going through a transformation, including the credit portfolio review, and we look forward to having the benefit of Leonard Green's perspectives as we complete the process.
The successful investment here should also serve as a validating signal to the public markets about the long-term strength of our business model and our practices as a whole.
In return for its cash investment, Leonard Green will own convertible preferred stock in Signet. The transaction itself was designed to be financially neutral as Leonard Green's investment will be based on the market price of our shares, and we will be recycling the capital into share repurchases at similar prices, thereby making a watch from a financial perspective.
What we, therefore, get from the transaction is not capital but the experience, resources, financial acumen and retail expertise that Leonard Green's -- Leonard Green brings to the table. Having a large owner with skin in the game and their skill set will strengthen our board and add a tremendously valuable perspective as our business model continues to evolve.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter this year and is subject to getting customary regulatory approvals.
We believe the long-term secular and company-specific picture looks promising. We think our competitive strength, our long-term opportunity for growth and our precedent of success make us a worthy long-term investment, certainly Leonard Green did. Signet plays an investment with a long history of growth. And although the latest share grew minimally, we have seen this before and bounced back with a higher market share.
People still fall in love and adore themselves in jewelry as they have done for literally thousands of years. Signet has some of the best-known and most trusted jewelry retail brand names in the world. Knowing that customers interact with us first online and then potentially long after the sales through our services, we are developing an omnichannel experience that will be best in class. Customers can now become better educated and see a wide range of options regardless of where they engage with us and what they are engaging us for. Few in retail jewelry can match the depth and breadth of experiences that Signet offers. Given our scale and our experience, we can create and drive jewelry trends better than anyone in the industry. Innovation and the power of brands are in their infancy stages in the jewelry industry, and we are best positioned to take advantage of this.
Our numbers clearly show that a strong presence on television not only drive sales but also market share gains. Our strategy is to have a strong presence on national TV at the right times while others who sale jewelry don't; gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We have a diverse real estate portfolio and locations that provide solid returns. We are profitable in the mall and outside of it and high-volume properties and low-volume properties, in kiosks and outlets and in our power centers. Our diversity in terms of retail channel and retail location is serving us very well. We continue to maintain a disciplined internal rate of return requirement of 20% on new stores, and we see our best opportunity these days in Kay Jewelers stores outside the mall.
As a major industry player, scale obviously helps in the dealings throughout our supply chain. But it's above much, much more than just scale. We have the experience, we have the know-how, we have the relationships, and we have the processes that are difficult for others to match and do business in the diamond jewelry industry. Much like other companies that sell valuable things like cars and computers, we at Signet sell products, we finance them and we insure them. It's a complete end-to-end solutions that our customers embrace and makes a great business sense for us.
And lastly, we have the financial wherewithal to compete and win in all types of business environments. We have weathered difficult time before. We've invested when others couldn't. We know how to strike an appropriate balance between growth and savings, and we believe we'll come this -- through all of this stronger than ever.
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn over to Michele."
693964,372307437,1039055,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's comps decreased 2.3% against an increase of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of",2239,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's comps decreased 2.3% against an increase of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of 9%.
Now as Mark indicated, although our comp sales declined, about half of the decline was driven by oil and gas reliant regions. Total sales decreased 2.6% and on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 1.3% for the quarter. So in looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, I'll share some additional color.
In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 2.2% to $839 million. Comps decreased 3.1% compared to an increase of 3.3% last year and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of 10%. Sales weakness was most pronounced by store banner and geography, notably Jared stores and energy-dependent regional economies.
Now these declines were partially offset by higher sales of select diamond collection as well as fashion category. The Zale Jewelry's operating segment total sales decreased 1.6% to $331 million and 1% on a constant currency exchange basis. Comps were down 3% and that's against a 2-year hurdle rate of 4.8%. So looking on a geography basis, our Zale U.S. total sales were flat. Comps decreased 2.2% and that's against a 2-year stack rate of 4%. In Canada, total sales declined 9.5% or 5.9% on a constant currency basis. Canadian comp sales declined 6.8% and that's against a 2-year hurdle rate of 8.2%. The Zale Jewelry's operating segment decline throughout North America was also driven by weakness in energy-dependent economies and again, this was partially offset by sales of select diamond jewelry collection.
Now Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.8% to $57 million with comp sales of 6.4% and that is on top of 8.4% last year and a 2-year rate of 5.6%. Sales increases were driven predominantly by gold chains and diamond jewelry.
Looking in the U.K., our U.K. total sales decreased 8.7% to $145 million but increased 2% at constant currency rates. Comps were 0.8% on top of a 5.1% in prior year and compared to a 2-year rate of 9.5%.
Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the sales increases that we saw in the U.K.
So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated and adjusted results.
So again, we're continuing to present the reconciliation that you see on Slide 12 to reflect the impact of purchase accounting as well as severance and IT implementation expenses associated with global systems that will drive future synergies. The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. So if we start in the lower left portion of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.06 per share.
So moving to the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting.
Again, moving over the next column, reflects our integration costs, which relates to consulting costs related to IT implementation as well as severance. Integration and severance costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution.
On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustment, our adjusted EPS was $1.14 per share.
All right. So we're going to look below sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $468 million or 34% of adjusted sales and that's down 130 basis points due primarily to lower sales that resulted in deleverage on fixed costs, such as store occupancy as well as higher bad debt expense, primarily due to higher receivables.
Now this was partially offset by the realization of synergies. Adjusted SG&A was $409.1 million or 29.7% of adjusted sales compared to $413.4 million or 29.2% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of deleverage in rate was also due principally to lower sales.
So I'll go into more details on SG&A in the following slide. So continuing down. Other operating income was $70.7 million or 5.1% of sales. The increase of $7.9 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivables balances.
Adjusted operating income was $129.6 million and that decreased 13.3% over prior year second quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 9.4% of sales, with the decline in the rate due to the lower top line. Adjusted EPS was $1.14 per share compared to $1.28 last year, a decrease of $0.14 or 10.9%.
All right. So let's take a closer look at our SG&A. Our teams really did a great job on focusing on top controls and savings. Our SG&A expense in dollars, as you see, declined by $4 million or 1% year-over-year despite unplanned expenses that we experienced in our quarter. Although the dollar reduction in SG&A wasn't enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volumes, it does reflect solid management of expenses, nonetheless.
Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll and that is both at the store and the corporate levels. So as shown on the slide, stores and corporate payroll declined and that's driven by a combination of less variable compensations that flexed with sales, including corporate incentive compensation, synergies associated with both store and corporate payroll, and lower expenses due to favorable exchange -- foreign exchange.
Advertising was prudently managed to just $1 million increase. We also incurred unplanned costs of $5 million on consulting and related expenses due to the unsubstantiated claims against Signet's business integrity. Other expenses increased, driven predominantly by our IT roadmap, including higher depreciation and amortization. So all of that led to a small decrease in our SG&A expense.
So moving on to P&L, I want to hit a few balance sheet highlights, then we'll start with inventory. Our strong second quarter and inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period virtually flat at $2.4 billion. Our teams, again, did a great job at managing in a slow environment, while at the same time not starting the business of growth opportunities. The impact from stores -- from more stores was virtually offset by the impact of sound merchandise management and foreign exchange on inventory procured in currencies other than the strong U.S. dollar.
So we'll move on, and we're going to focus on our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our second quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $529 million, that's down 1.7%. And although lower, the in-house credit sales were slightly more favorable than the division's total sales decline and therefore, being relative share in the mix of tender.
In-house credit participation was 63.1% and that is up 50 basis points due to more effective credit marketing, a greater receptivity among our highest-quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in credit sales mix within our past credit tiers. The average monthly payment collection rate for the second quarter fiscal 2017 was 10.8% compared to 11.3% last year.
Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received, divided by beginning accounts receivables. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix. We are now operating a 36-month plan for select eligible borrowers in our mall stores. So as participation in this plan grows, the monthly payment collection rates will slightly decline. Importantly, the 36-month plan enhances the quality of our receivables portfolio. So this has been tested for 3 years and fully rolled out this year. The plan requires a $3,000 minimum purchase on bridal jewelry. That means it is only open to borrowers who qualify for a $3,000 line or more or lower rate customers and because it is available for bridal jewelry, there is a stronger emotional connection and implicit commitment to repay. The combination of collection rate decline and growth in credit participation lead to an increase in our net accounts receivables of $146 million or 9.1% to $1.75 billion.
Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other corporate income line on our P&L was $70.1 million compared to $62.9 million last year. The increase of $7.2 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base.
Our net bad debt expense was $55.3 million and that compares to $49.4 million last year. The increase of $5.9 million in expense was driven primarily by our higher receivables balances and a slight impact from an increase in nonperforming loans, which all drives momentarily.
The net impact of bad debt and finance charge income generated operating profit of $14.8 million and that is up $1.3 million from last year.
So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for capital account metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 7.4% in the second quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points from prior year was driven by an IT glitch, relating to customer reminders during the second quarter, which resulted in slightly higher roller -- roll rates in the over 90-day aging category combined with overall receivable growth. On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 80 basis points, the same as prior year, reflecting our seasonality changes.
The same trend was true for the nonperforming portion of our receivables as a percent of gross receivables. At 4.4%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter for the same reasons that I just discussed. Again, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was the same versus the prior year period.
In summary, we remain absolutely confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance based on the visibility that we have into our daily collections, our weekly roll rates and other key-performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings.
So I'd like to move now and just spend a few minutes relating to our capital allocation. As mentioned in the release and earlier in this presentation, we made a concerted move to repurchase an unprecedented amount of stock in a single quarter. We've bought back 4% of shares in Q2. Now I want to limit my remarks on stock valuation, recognizing that this is quite frankly more of your job than mine. But when a market leader in a growing industry with a solid balance sheet reports record Q1 earnings in May and then goes on to get rewarded with the lowest valuation on the S&P 500 specialty retail index while it's time for unprecedented buybacks. Our lenders recently gave us a vote of confidence by agreeing to an amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility. Signet had a $400 million line for many years, but with the acquisition of Zale, we are now a much bigger company with more seasonal needs and generally more going on. This new $700 million line is now commensurate with the size and the activity of our company. So approximately $200 million of that revolver was tapped in Q2 to help finance this share repurchase.
So with that, we're going to turn to financial guidance. Signet's third quarter comparable store sales are expected to decrease between 3% and 5%. We have seen challenging trends in the summer and with no seasonal catalysts, we are not expecting a change in these trends for most of the fall.
Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.17 to $0.25. Now, by the way, that guidance includes an expected 1x $0.07 benefit from the effect of harmonizing Signet's compensated absent policy. Not until the holiday season kicks in do we expect to see a trend inflection point for all the reasons that Mark had just previously stated. And that's why for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps to decline a more modest 1% to 2.5% and adjusted EPS of sent $7.25 to $7.55.
The annual adjusted EPS guidance does adjust a growth rate of about 8% and that is driven primarily by synergies, cost control, higher finance charge income, as well as a lower effective tax rate and accretion from for share repurchases. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Our capital expenditure guidance for the full year has been reduced to $280 million to $320 million. As you may have noticed in our earnings release put out this morning, we did not change our projected store count ranges. So the reduction in CapEx moves us closer to the lower end of the ranges and the reduction primarily relates to  deferral of select IT projects. Projected net selling square footage also remain constant as we continue to expect growth of 3% to 3.5%. Most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than in closed malls and focused on the kiosk mall banner. Again, we are reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. So that means the $60 million from the last year of another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we should deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies.
So with that, that concludes my prepared remarks, and I'm happy to turn the call back over to Mark."

So overwhelmingly, we feel that we have a great process in place to ensure that our customers are getting what they expect to get. That being said, we're taking the opportunity to test in the fourth quarter some new technology that relates to specific gem scopes that we are putting in place to some of our Kay stores and will not only have a view of these -- the product that's being -- sorry, have a view of the product that is under magnification, but will also have a digital screen on top of the gem scope that will highlight the unique marks of everybody's diamond, every customer's diamond is like a thumbprint, they have all unique marks with, and we will mark those on a digital screen and then we will have the ability to digitally send over that picture to our customers via e-mail and keep it in our own files.

Jared fundamental issues, as I stated in my prepared comments, after reviewing intense research on our Jared customer and understanding how that customer is segmented differently than our Kay or Zales stores, we focused on making sure that we understand that customer better and putting in the right products, having the right advertising communication vehicle, talking to those customers specifically and making sure that we do what they believe is the best for the Jared customer experience. So we think starting with the Chosen Diamond, which we know is perfectly targeted to the Jared sentimentalist costumer that track their [indiscernible] journey, we think it's going to be a tremendous enhancement to the Jared business in the fourth quarter. It's been testing very well, Oliver, and we continue to see enhancing -- enhancements at every store that continues to test the Chosen Diamond. So we believe once we have that in all of our Jared stores for the fourth quarter, supported by a wonderful advertising television creative to really explain the journey of a diamond, is going to be a huge enhancement to the Jared stores in the fourth quarter and it talks specifically to the customer segmentation of that Jared customer. We also have some initiatives that we have in place on enhancing our selling tactics and making sure that our customer is taking care from the minute they come in the door and not passed around to different departments while they're in the selling area. We're also testing certain, I mentioned this, pricing tactics, I won't go into a lot of detail for competitive reasons, we have pricing tactics that we are testing right now that we think can be an enhancement for Jared for the fourth quarter. And we're also very excited -- and I mentioned this in my comments, we're very excited about the Jared stores, the Jared PANDORA boutiques, we have those -- we have about 180 stores that have upgrade now, they have expanded assortment in PANDORA jewelry. We have targeted training and a targeted sales associate as working just in the PANDORA counter, and we believe with that expansion of PANDORA in our Jared stores, and we'll be creating a specific creative for advertising to communicate to customers about the broadened assortment that we have in our Jared stores and PANDORA, will increase our foot traffic in the fourth quarter coming to those stores also. So we believe that we have some very good initiatives in the Jared store banners that tie specifically to the segmented customers that quite frankly we weren't doing a good job over the last couple of years on, and we believe we have done a good job on that. As far as the partnership with Leonard Green. We -- Leonard Green is one of the foremost experts in the private equity world in investing in retail companies. They have a wealth of knowledge not only from the financial side but also from the retail experience of being on board and working with other companies. And we, at Signet, are looking very much forward to having their guidance and in getting their partnership with us in helping us determine ways that they can take this company going forward. We're looking forward to getting their insight in working through some of their partners and giving us some best practice that we can take on at Jared, at Signet and enhance our business. And the reason that the timing is perfect now is because, as I said in my prepared comments, our valuation is low and the idea of getting a company like Leonard Green, who did a thorough due diligence of our business, of our practices, of our processes, just validates that Signet has a great business model and that Signet has some great growth prospects going forward, and we believe that having Leonard Green on our board -- I mean Mr. Sokoloff on our board, just will continue to help us out going forward. And we really are excited quite frankly of having Leonard Green's input and insight on the important decisions we're going to make as it relates to our credit strategy review. So that's just a few of the reasons why we believe Leonard Green is going to be a really exciting partner for Signet going forward."

And it's impossible for us to really know for sure if it's affected our sales or not, but we do know is that the surveys that we have taken and there are some independent surveys done by some sell-side analysts, all confirm that the Kay brand is still very well perceived by consumers as is the Zales and Jared brand. But overall the Kay brand is still in very good -- the Kay brand's equity is very strong as it ever has been.

I'd like to start by discussing the key point to one you'd take away from our second quarter financial results presentations.
First, Signet's sales and earnings were disappointing in the second quarter, given no sign yet of a rebounding trend. This negatively impacts our annual guidance. We'll elaborate on what has happened and the impact to guidance later in this presentation.
Second, our synergy work streams remain solid and their financial impact is still intact. We have a long list of synergy activities, which I'll discuss in a few moments. Although some initiatives are unfavorably impacted in a lower sales environment, most are not, so we still expect to deliver on our synergies.
The third point I want you to take away is that we bought back 4% of the company during the second quarter and several directors and officers made open market purchases as well. We did this in response to our valuation and to demonstrate our confidence in Signet.
Fourth, our credit strategic evaluation is moving forward. As you know, we are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our portfolio while continuing to do business with our customers. I will have a few comments later but the bottom line is this, either way, we expect shareholder value to be created.
Fifth, we are pleased to announce that Signet and Leonard Green Partners (sic) [ Leonard Green & Partners ] have entered into a strategic partnership and with the private equity firm, will invest $625 million in Signet to a convertible preferred security. Details are described in a separate release.
And lastly, and most importantly, our holiday season initiatives are numerous, well tested and ready. So let's get into some more details.
So why the disappointing results in the second quarter? What happened? Well, it was a combination of several things, some macro and some micro. Regarding economic factors, our stores in states and provinces closely tied to the energy industry dramatically underperformed the division averages. It didn't matter the store banner, the price point or the merchandise brand, it was an obvious across-the-board trend. Sales especially has a large presence in Texas. Signet's overall performance was clear in -- underperformance was clear in other places like Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alberta, Canada.
Net-net, energy regions accounted for approximately half of our comp decline within North America. The latest U.S. government jewelry report recently advised 2015's year-end energy growth to down to just -- down to just up 0.2%. The BDA's [ph] latest estimate for the year, which are frequently revised, are still below historic norms.
MasterCard SpendingPulse also notes a quarter 2 slowdown in jewelry sales. The slower industry trend and outlook is further corroborated by the Jewelry Board of Trade's recent report on independent jewelry foreclosures, and we have informal industry feedback.
Jared's underperformance accounted for a material part of our miss. Texas-located Jared stores account for less than 15% of the Jared store count. However, these stores accounted for nearly half of Jared's comp decline in the second quarter. We believe Jared has a number of fundamental issues that have not been quick and easy fixes. We now better understand the unique characteristics of the Jared customer through our segmentation work, and we are taking the following actions. We are enhancing our selling capabilities to be able to better sell the entire store while minimizing or eliminating customer handouts. We are improving upon our marketing creative, along with targeting our media buys to more effectively communicate with the segmented Jared customers. We are distinguishing merchandise assortments to be more unique to Jared, such as the Chosen Diamond and our PANDORA boutiques. And we are testing a variety of pricing tactics to ensure our team members have the tools they need to compete and win.
Now moving to Slide 5. I'd like to discuss some of the sales wins during the second quarter. Results were led by Ever Us, our 2-stone diamond jewelry collection. Ever Us is now testing line extension in stores for the holiday season and many are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings as well as necklaces with on-trim looks and innovative fastening systems were also successful in the quarter.
We released some significant improvements to our Kay and Jared online experience. The design, navigation, imagery, speed and ease-of-use are all significantly upgraded.
And finally, our real estate portfolio diversity served us well as our leading results came from our outlets and mall-based kiosks.
Now shifting from sales initiatives to synergies. And to review a synergy, as we define it, is a net contribution to operating profit. Most of the synergies we are recognizing this year relates to gross margin enhancements and operating expense decreases as opposed to sales increases.
I won't go into depth on each of the 14 examples listed on Slide 6 and the worksheet detail behind each one. But as you can see, we've got a tremendous amount of activity going on to fully optimize the integration. In spite of decelerating sales, we are still confident we'll hit our synergy targets because most of the synergies are not dependent upon sales. For example, insourcing repair. The complete overhaul of the Zale repair model saves expense on each repair. Nonmerchandise sourcing, our greatest scale allows us to reduce cost on products and services we buy on a per-unit basis. Distribution center operations, we are going to save on the consolidation of 2 distribution centers into 1. Each of these and many, many other projects will make us leaner and position us even better for long-term growth.
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where we have historically made about 1/2 of our annual profits. And so our attention and focus is now intensely directed to our holiday season business drivers.
I'll elaborate on some of them here. Again, one of our biggest initiatives is Ever Us. And in our experience, beacon or industry trend driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. This year we will offer additional jewelry categories and styles, higher carat weights, more inventory, greater prints, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. We have continued our collaboration with Forevermark, which is a diamond brand of the De Beers Group of Companies, and we are pleased that they will be supporting the Ever Us program in their stores that carry Forevermark, by the way, which includes Jared, with a TV campaign of their own in the fourth quarter. This will undoubtedly further increase the reach of the campaign and consumer's desire for Ever Us nationwide. Finally, Ever Us will have a greater merchandising and marketing presence in our stores in Canada and the U.K. this year.
We're expanding the iconic Vera Wang LOVE bridal jewelry collection into fashion jewelry in nearly all of our Zales stores. The collection include diamond jewelry as well as pearls supported with new in-store displays.
Marketing will support the new merchandise collection through television and PR events. This holiday season all eyes are on the ear, and we continue to drive trend in earrings, earring climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our Radiant Reflections and Endless Brilliance collection, which create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings.
In our Jared stores, we are resetting our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores or boutiques. As a part of it, we are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry, and we'll support it with new TV advertising creative.
We are rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores, which show the customer each stage of a diamond's journey from rough to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer, who tend to value this type of product and information more so than our other store banners. We are also designing a brand-new TV creative to support the Chosen.
In Kay and Jared, we are rolling out a new software that we call Clienteling to enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions.
One of our omnichannel strategy is to strengthen personalization. In the fourth quarter, online consumers will see more personalized content based upon previous interactions of our brands. They will also benefit from more personalized store locator experience.
And lastly, in addition to new creative marketing, that will support each of our initiatives I just mentioned, we have many targeted marketing plans tying into the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. 
We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media.
Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I'll share with you a few very high level updates and comments. As I noted at the onset, we are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio while continuing to add the capability to do business with our customers.
On the optimization front, we are examining how we can change our credit business model to maximize value and disclosure and minimize accounting complexity.
On the monetization front, we've launched a request for proposal process and thus far, we are very pleased with the interest in our credit book and there are multiple interested party that we are in discussions with.
We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. One critical point that I want to make sure you are all fully aware of and appreciate is that we expect shareholder value will be created under either scenario.
If we optimize the portfolio, we'll likely increase the leverage against it and use the proceeds on growth initiatives, buybacks and/or dividends. Furthermore, we will likely revamp and expand our reporting and disclosure of credit profitability, contractual aging and other metrics.
If we monetize the portfolio, it means we have preserved satisfactory near-term and long-term economics for Signet and reduce risk to our balance sheet. Again, we hope to conclude this whole process as soon as possible.
We are very pleased to announce that Leonard Green Partners (sic) [ Leonard Green & Partners ] has agreed to invest $625 million in Signet. The transaction is a significant vote of confidence in the Signet operating model and our long-term prospects for growth.
We opened our books and shared significant amount of information as a part of this process, and with the benefit of full due diligence on the company, Leonard Green decided to make a sizable investment, and we are very excited to have Managing Director, Jonathan Sokoloff, assume a seat on the Signet board. The goal is to find a party with significant resources and broad financial and retail expertise, who could become a large owner and partner with us for long term as our business evolves.
The timing in this deal is perfect, in that our business is going through a transformation, including the credit portfolio review, and we look forward to having the benefit of Leonard Green's perspectives as we complete the process.
The successful investment here should also serve as a validating signal to the public markets about the long-term strength of our business model and our practices as a whole.
In return for its cash investment, Leonard Green will own convertible preferred stock in Signet. The transaction itself was designed to be financially neutral as Leonard Green's investment will be based off the market price of our shares, and we will be recycling the capital into share repurchases at similar prices, thereby making a wash from a financial perspective.
What we, therefore, get from the transaction is not capital but the experience, resources, financial acumen and retail expertise that Leonard Green's -- Leonard Green brings to the table. Having a large owner with skin in the game and their skill set will strengthen our board and add a tremendously valuable perspective as our business model continues to evolve.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year and is subject to getting customary regulatory approvals.
We believe the long-term secular and company-specific picture looks promising. We think our competitive strength, our long-term opportunity for growth and our precedent of success make us a worthy long-term investment. Certainly Leonard Green did. Signet plays in an industry with a long history of growth. And although the latest share grew minimally, we have seen this before and bounced back with higher market share.
People still fall in love and adorn themselves in jewelry as they have done for literally thousands of years. Signet has some of the best-known and most trusted jewelry retail brand names in the world. Knowing that customers interact with us first online and then potentially long after the sales through our services, we are developing an omnichannel experience that will be best in class. Customers can now become better educated and see a wide range of options regardless of where they engage with us and what they are engaging us for. Few in retail jewelry can match the depth and breadth of experiences that Signet offers. Given our scale and our experience, we can create and drive jewelry trends better than anyone in the industry. Innovation and the power of our brands are in their infancy stages in the jewelry industry, and we are best positioned to take advantage of this.
Our numbers clearly show that a strong presence on television not only drives sales but also market share gains. Our strategy is to have a strong presence on national TV at the right times while others who sell jewelry don't; gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We have a diverse real estate portfolio and locations that provide solid returns. We are profitable in the mall and outside of it, in high-volume properties and low-volume properties, in kiosks and outlets and in our power centers. Our diversity in terms of retail channel and retail location is serving us very well. We continue to maintain a disciplined internal rate of return requirement of 20% on new stores, and we see our best opportunities these days in Kay Jewelers stores outside the mall.
As a major industry player, scale obviously helps in the dealings throughout our supply chain. But it's above much, much more than just scale. We have the experience, we have the know-how, we have the relationships, and we have the processes that are difficult for others to match and do business in the diamond jewelry industry. Much like other companies that sell valuable things like cars and computers, we at Signet sell products, we finance them and we insure them. It's a complete end-to-end solution that our customers embrace and makes a great business sense for us.
And lastly, we have the financial wherewithal to compete and win in all types of business environments. We have weathered difficult time before. We've invested when others couldn't. We know how to strike an appropriate balance between growth and savings, and we believe we'll come this -- through all of this stronger than ever.
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn over to Michele."
693964,372307437,1039121,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's comps decreased 2.3% against an increase of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of",2238,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's comps decreased 2.3% against an increase of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of 9%.
Now as Mark indicated, although our comp sales declined, about half of the decline was driven by oil and gas reliant regions. Total sales decreased 2.6% and on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 1.3% for the quarter. So in looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, I'll share some additional color.
In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 2.2% to $839 million. Comps decreased 3.1% compared to an increase of 3.3% last year and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of 10%. Sales weakness was most pronounced by store banner and geography, notably Jared stores and energy-dependent regional economies.
Now these declines were partially offset by higher sales of select diamond collection as well as fashion category. The Zale Jewelry's operating segment total sales decreased 1.6% to $331 million and 1% on a constant currency exchange basis. Comps were down 3% and that's against a 2-year hurdle rate of 4.8%. So looking on a geography basis, our Zale U.S. total sales were flat. Comps decreased 2.2% and that's against a 2-year stack rate of 4%. In Canada, total sales declined 9.5% or 5.9% on a constant currency basis. Canadian comp sales declined 6.8% and that's against a 2-year hurdle rate of 8.2%. The Zale Jewelry operating segment's decline throughout North America was also driven by weakness in energy-dependent economies and again, this was partially offset by sales of select diamond jewelry collection.
Now our Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.8% to $57 million with comp sales of 6.4% and that is on top of 8.4% last year and a 2-year rate of 5.6%. Sales increases were driven predominantly by gold chains and diamond jewelry.
Looking in the U.K., our U.K. total sales decreased 8.7% to $145 million but increased 2% at constant currency rates. Comps were at 0.8% on top of a 5.1% in prior year and compared to a 2-year rate of 9.5%.
Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the sales increases that we saw in the U.K.
So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated and adjusted results.
So again, we're continuing to present the reconciliation that you see on Slide 12 to reflect the impact of purchase accounting as well as severance and IT implementation expense associated with global systems that will drive future synergies. The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. So if we start in the lower left portion of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.06 per share.
So moving to the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting.
Again, moving over the next column, reflects our integration costs, which relates to consulting costs related to IT implementation as well as severance. Integration and severance costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution.
On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustment, our adjusted EPS was $1.14 per share.
All right. So we're going to look below sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $468 million or 34% of adjusted sales and that's down 130 basis points due primarily to lower sales that resulted in deleverage on fixed costs, such as store occupancy as well as higher bad debt expense, primarily due to higher receivables.
Now this was partially offset by the realization of synergies. Adjusted SG&A was $409.1 million or 29.7% of adjusted sales compared to $413.4 million or 29.2% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of deleverage in rate was also due principally to lower sales.
So I'll go into more details on SG&A in the following slide. So continuing down. Other operating income was $70.7 million or 5.1% of sales. The increase of $7.9 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.
Adjusted operating income was $129.6 million and that decreased 13.3% over prior year second quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 9.4% of sales, with the decline in rate due to the lower top line. Adjusted EPS was $1.14 per share compared to $1.28 last year, a decrease of $0.14 or 10.9%.
All right. So let's take a closer look at our SG&A. Our teams really did a great job on focusing on cost controls and savings. Our SG&A expense in dollars, as you see, declined by $4 million or 1% year-over-year despite unplanned expenses that we experienced in our quarter. Although the dollar reduction in SG&A wasn't enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volume, it does reflect solid management of expenses, nonetheless.
Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll and that is both at the store and the corporate levels. So as shown on the slide, stores and corporate payroll declined and that's driven by a combination of less variable compensations that flexes with sales, including corporate incentive compensation, synergies associated with both store and corporate payroll, and lower expenses due to favorable exchange -- foreign exchange.
Advertising was prudently managed to just $1 million increase. We also incurred unplanned costs of $5 million on consulting and related expenses due to the unsubstantiated claims against Signet's business integrity. Other expenses increased, driven predominantly by our IT roadmap, including higher depreciation and amortization. So all of that led to a small decrease in our SG&A expense.
So moving off the P&L, I want to hit a few balance sheet highlights, and we'll start with inventory. Our strong second quarter and inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period virtually flat at $2.4 billion. Our teams, again, did a great job at managing in a slow environment, while at the same time not starting the business of growth opportunities. The impact from stores -- from more stores was virtually offset by the impact of sound merchandise management and foreign exchange on inventory procured in currencies other than the strong U.S. dollar.
So we'll move on, and we're going to focus on our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our second quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $529 million, that's down 1.7%. And although lower, the in-house credit sales were slightly more favorable than the division's total sales decline and therefore, being relative share in the mix of tender.
In-house credit participation was 63.1% and that is up 50 basis points due to more effective credit marketing, a greater receptivity among our highest-quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in credit sales mix within our vast credit tiers. The average monthly payment collection rate for the second quarter fiscal 2017 was 10.8% compared to 11.3% last year.
Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received, divided by beginning accounts receivable. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix. We are now operating a 36-month plan for select eligible borrowers in our mall stores. So as participation in this plan grows, the monthly payment collection rates will slightly decline. Importantly, the 36-month plan enhances the quality of our receivables portfolio. So this has been tested for 3 years and fully rolled out this year. The plan requires a $3,000 minimum purchase on bridal jewelry. That means it is only open to borrowers who qualify for a $3,000 line or more, our lower risk customers and because it is available for bridal jewelry, there is a stronger emotional connection and implicit commitment to repay. The combination of collection rate decline and growth in credit participation lead to an increase in our net accounts receivable of $146 million or 9.1% to $1.75 billion.
Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other operating income line on our P&L was $70.1 million compared to $62.9 million last year. The increase of $7.2 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivable base.
Our net bad debt expense was $55.3 million and that compares to $49.4 million last year. The increase of $5.9 million in expense was driven primarily by our higher receivable balances and a slight impact from an increase in nonperforming loans, which I'll address momentarily.
The net impact of bad debt and finance charge income generated operating profit of $14.8 million and that is up $1.3 million from last year.
So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for capital account metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 7.4% in the second quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points from prior year was driven by an IT glitch relating to customer reminders during the second quarter, which resulted in slightly higher roller -- roll rates in the over 90-day aging category combined with overall receivable growth. On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 80 basis points, the same as prior year, reflecting our seasonality changes.
The same trend was true for the nonperforming portion of our receivables as a percent of gross receivables. At 4.4%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter for the same reasons that I just discussed. Again, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was the same versus the prior year period.
In summary, we remain absolutely confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance based on the visibility that we have into our daily collections, our weekly roll rates and other key-performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings.
So I'd like to move now and just spend a few minutes relating to our capital allocation. As mentioned in the release and earlier in this presentation, we made a concerted move to repurchase an unprecedented amount of stock in a single quarter. We bought back 4% of shares in Q2. Now I want to limit my remarks on stock valuation, recognizing that this is quite frankly more of your job than mine. But when a market leader in a growing industry with a solid balance sheet reports record Q1 earnings in May and then goes on to get rewarded with the lowest valuation on the S&P 500 specialty retail index, well, then it's time for unprecedented buybacks. Our lenders recently gave us a vote of confidence by agreeing to an amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility. Signet had a $400 million line for many years, but with the acquisition of Zale, we are now a much bigger company with more seasonal needs and generally more going on. This new $700 million line is now commensurate with the size and the activity of our company. So approximately $200 million of that revolver was tapped in Q2 to help finance this share repurchase.
So with that, we're going to turn to financial guidance. Signet's third quarter comparable store sales are expected to decrease between 3% and 5%. We have seen challenging trends in the summer and with no seasonal catalysts, we are not expecting a change in these trends for most of fall.
Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.17 to $0.25. Now, by the way, that guidance includes an expected onetime $0.07 benefit from the effect of harmonizing Signet's compensated absent policy. Not until the holiday season kicks in do we expect to see a trend inflection point for all the reasons that Mark had just previously stated. And that's why for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps to decline a more modest 1% to 2.5% and adjusted EPS of $7.25 to $7.55.
This annual adjusted EPS guidance does suggest a growth rate of about 8% and that is driven primarily by synergies, cost control, higher finance charge income, as well as a lower effective tax rate and accretion from share repurchases. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Our capital expenditure guidance for the full year has been reduced to $280 million to $320 million. As you may have noticed in our earnings release put out this morning, we did not change our projected store count ranges. So the reduction in CapEx moves us closer to the lower end of the ranges and the reduction primarily relates to deferral of select IT projects. Projected net selling square footage also remain constant as we continue to expect growth of 3% to 3.5%. Most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than in closed malls and focused on the kiosk mall banner. Again, we are reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. So that means the $60 million from the last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we should deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies.
So with that, that concludes my prepared remarks, and I'm happy to turn the call back over to Mark."

So overwhelmingly, we feel that we have a great process in place to ensure that our customers are getting what they expect to get. That being said, we're taking the opportunity to test in the fourth quarter some new technology that relates to specific gem scopes that we are putting in place in some of our Kay stores that will not only have a view of these -- the product that's being -- sorry, have a view of the product under magnification, but will also have a digital screen on top of the gem scope that will highlight the unique marks of everybody's diamond.

The Jared fundamental issues, as I stated in my prepared comments, after reviewing intense research on our Jared customer and understanding how that customer is segmented differently than our Kay or Zales stores, we focused on making sure that we understand that customer better and putting in the right products, having the right advertising communication vehicle, talking to those customers specifically and making sure that we do what they believe is the best for the Jared customer experience. So we think starting with the Chosen Diamond, which we know is perfectly targeted to the Jared sentimentalist customer that track their oath entirely through the journey, we think it's going to be a tremendous enhancement to the Jared business in the fourth quarter. It's been testing very well, Oliver, and we continue to see enhancing -- enhancements at every store that continues to test the Chosen Diamond. So we believe once we have that in all of our Jared stores for the fourth quarter, supported by a wonderful advertising television creative to really explain the journey of a diamond, is going to be a huge enhancement to the Jared stores in the fourth quarter and it talks specifically to the customer segmentation of that Jared customer. We also have some initiatives that we have in place on enhancing our selling tactics, making sure that a customer is taken care of from the minute they come in the door and not passed around to different departments while they're in the selling area. We're also testing certain, I mentioned this, pricing tactics, and I won't go into a lot of detail for competitive reasons, we have pricing tactics that we are testing right now that we think can be an enhancement for Jared for the fourth quarter. And we're also very excited -- and I mentioned this in my comments, we're very excited about the Jared stores, the Jared PANDORA boutiques, we have -- we have about 180 stores that have them up right now, they have expanded assortment in PANDORA jewelry. We have targeted training and a targeted sales associate as working just in the PANDORA counter, and we believe with that expansion of PANDORA in our Jared stores, and we'll be creating a specific creative for advertising to communicate to customers about the broadened assortment that we have in our Jared stores and PANDORA, will increase our foot traffic in the fourth quarter coming to those stores also. So we believe that we have some very good initiatives in the Jared store banners that tie specifically to the segmented customers that quite frankly we weren't doing a good job over the last couple of years on, and we believe we have done a good job on that. As far as the partnership with Leonard Green. We -- Leonard Green is one of the foremost experts in the private equity world in investing in retail companies. They have a wealth of knowledge not only from the financial side but also from the retail experience of being on boards and working with other companies. And we at Signet are looking very much forward to having their guidance and in getting their partnership with us in helping us determine ways that they can take this company going forward. We're looking forward to getting their insight in working through some of their partners and giving us some best practice that we can take on at Jared, at Signet and enhance our business. And the reason that the timing is perfect now is because, as I said in my prepared comments, our valuation is low and the idea of getting a company like Leonard Green, who did a thorough due diligence of our business, of our practices, of our processes, just validates that Signet has a great business model and that Signet has some great growth prospects going forward, and we believe that having Leonard Green on our board -- I mean Mr. Sokoloff on our board, just will continue to help us out going forward. And we really are excited quite frankly of having Leonard Green's input and insight on the important decisions we're going to make as it relates to our credit strategy review. So that's just a few of the reasons why we believe Leonard Green is going to be a really exciting partner for Signet going forward."

And it's impossible to really know for sure if it's affected our sales or not, but we do know is that the surveys that we have taken and there are some independent surveys done by some sell-side analysts, all confirm that the Kay brand is still very well perceived by consumers as is the Zales and Jared brand. But overall the Kay brand is still in very good -- the Kay brand's equity is very strong as it ever has been.

In Q4, we started to see a little bit more of a pronounced impact, started to see a little bit happening more in the Texas region. In Q1, again, that trend continued, and we started to see a couple of these spread into a few more states on how we define that energy-reliant region. But I would say most notably, as we move, shifted from Q1 into Q2, you really did see an acceleration in terms of those states or those oil-reliant regions having an impact on our comp sales.

I'd like to start by discussing the key point to one you'd take away from our second quarter financial results presentations.First, Signet's sales and earnings were disappointing in the second quarter, given no",2535,"Thanks, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by discussing the key point to one you'd take away from our second quarter financial results presentations.
First, Signet's sales and earnings were disappointing in the second quarter, given no sign yet of a rebounding trend. This negatively impacts our annual guidance. We'll elaborate on what has happened and the impact to guidance later in this presentation.
Second, our synergy work streams remain solid and their financial impact is still intact. We have a long list of synergy activities, which I'll discuss in a few moments. Although some initiatives are unfavorably impacted in a lower sales environment, most are not, so we still expect to deliver on our synergies.
The third point I want you to take away is that we bought back 4% of the company during the second quarter and several directors and officers made open market purchases as well. We did this in response to our valuation and to demonstrate our confidence in Signet.
Fourth, our credit strategic evaluation is moving forward. As you know, we are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our portfolio while continuing to do business with our customers. I will have a few comments later but the bottom line is this, either way, we expect shareholder value to be created.
Fifth, we are pleased to announce that Signet and Leonard Green Partners (sic) [ Leonard Green & Partners ] have entered into a strategic partnership and with the private equity firm, will invest $625 million in Signet to a convertible preferred security. Details are described in a separate release.
And lastly, and most importantly, our holiday season initiatives are numerous, well tested and ready. So let's get into some more details.
So why the disappointing results in the second quarter? What happened? Well, it was a combination of several things, some macro and some micro. Regarding economic factors, our stores in states and provinces closely tied to the energy industry dramatically underperformed the division averages. It didn't matter the store banner, the price point or the merchandise brand, it was an obvious across-the-board trend. Sales especially has a large presence in Texas. Signet's overall performance was clear in -- underperformance was clear in other places like Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alberta, Canada.
Net-net, energy regions accounted for approximately half of our comp decline within North America. The latest U.S. government jewelry report recently advised 2015's year-end energy growth to down to just -- down to just up 0.2%. The BDA's [ph] latest estimate for the year, which are frequently revised, are still below historic norms.
MasterCard SpendingPulse also notes a quarter 2 slowdown in jewelry sales. The slower industry trend and outlook is further corroborated by the Jewelry Board of Trade's recent report on independent jewelry foreclosures, and we have informal industry feedback.
Jared's underperformance accounted for a material part of our miss. Texas-located Jared stores account for less than 15% of the Jared store count. However, these stores accounted for nearly half of Jared's comp decline in the second quarter. We believe Jared has a number of fundamental issues that have not been quick and easy fixes. We now better understand the unique characteristics of the Jared customer through our segmentation work, and we are taking the following actions. We are enhancing our selling capabilities to be able to better sell the entire store while minimizing or eliminating customer handouts. We are improving upon our marketing creative, along with targeting our media buys to more effectively communicate with the segmented Jared customers. We are distinguishing merchandise assortments to be more unique to Jared, such as the Chosen Diamond and our PANDORA boutiques. And we are testing a variety of pricing tactics to ensure our team members have the tools they need to compete and win.
Now moving to Slide 5. I'd like to discuss some of the sales wins during the second quarter. Results were led by Ever Us, our 2-stone diamond jewelry collection. Ever Us is now testing line extension in stores for the holiday season and many are already showing significant promise. Bracelets and earrings as well as necklaces with on-trim looks and innovative fastening systems were also successful in the quarter.
We released some significant improvements to our Kay and Jared online experience. The design, navigation, imagery, speed and ease-of-use are all significantly upgraded.
And finally, our real estate portfolio diversity served us well as our leading results came from our outlets and mall-based kiosks.
Now shifting from sales initiatives to synergies. And to review a synergy, as we define it, is a net contribution to operating profit. Most of the synergies we are recognizing this year relates to gross margin enhancements and operating expense decreases as opposed to sales increases.
I won't go into depth on each of the 14 examples listed on Slide 6 and the worksheet detail behind each one. But as you can see, we've got a tremendous amount of activity going on to fully optimize the integration. In spite of decelerating sales, we are still confident we'll hit our synergy targets because most of the synergies are not dependent upon sales. For example, insourcing repair. The complete overhaul of the Zale repair model saves expense on each repair. Nonmerchandise sourcing, our greatest scale allows us to reduce cost on products and services we buy on a per-unit basis. Distribution center operations, we are going to save on the consolidation of 2 distribution centers into 1. Each of these and many, many other projects will make us leaner and position us even better for long-term growth.
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where we have historically made about 1/2 of our annual profits. And so our attention and focus is now intensely directed to our holiday season business drivers.
I'll elaborate on some of them here. Again, one of our biggest initiatives is Ever Us. And in our experience, beacon or industry trend driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in year 2 versus year 1. This year we will offer additional jewelry categories and styles, higher carat weights, more inventory, greater prints, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. We have continued our collaboration with Forevermark, which is a diamond brand of the De Beers Group of Companies, and we are pleased that they will be supporting the Ever Us program in their stores that carry Forevermark, by the way, which includes Jared, with a TV campaign of their own in the fourth quarter. This will undoubtedly further increase the reach of the campaign and consumers' desire for Ever Us nationwide. Finally, Ever Us will have a greater merchandising and marketing presence in our stores in Canada and the U.K. this year.
We're expanding the iconic Vera Wang LOVE bridal jewelry collection into fashion jewelry in nearly all of our Zales stores. The collection include diamond jewelry as well as pearls supported with new in-store displays.
Marketing will support the new merchandise collection through television and PR events. This holiday season all eyes are on the ear, and we continue to drive trend in earrings, earring climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our Radiant Reflections and Endless Brilliance collection, which create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings.
In our Jared stores, we are resetting our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores or boutiques. As a part of it, we are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry, and we'll support it with new TV advertising creative.
We are rolling out the Chosen Diamond program to all Jared stores, which show the customer each stage of a diamond's journey from rough to finished jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer, who tend to value this type of product and information more so than our other store banners. We are also designing a brand-new TV creative to support the Chosen.
In Kay and Jared, we are rolling out a new software that we call Clienteling to enable our teams to interact with customers more intelligently based on their previous purchases and special life occasions.
One of our omnichannel strategy is to strengthen personalization. In the fourth quarter, online consumers will see more personalized content based upon previous interactions of our brands. They will also benefit from more personalized store locator experience.
And lastly, in addition to new creative marketing, that will support each of our initiatives I just mentioned, we have many targeted marketing plans tying into the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. 
We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media.
Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I'll share with you a few very high level updates and comments. As I noted at the onset, we are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio while continuing to add the capability to do business with our customers.
On the optimization front, we are examining how we can change our credit business model to maximize value and disclosure and minimize accounting complexity.
On the monetization front, we've launched a request for proposal process and thus far, we are very pleased with the interest in our credit book and there are multiple interested party that we are in discussions with.
We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. One critical point that I want to make sure you are all fully aware of and appreciate is that we expect shareholder value will be created under either scenario.
If we optimize the portfolio, we'll likely increase the leverage against it and use the proceeds on growth initiatives, buybacks and/or dividends. Furthermore, we will likely revamp and expand our reporting and disclosure of credit profitability, contractual aging and other metrics.
If we monetize the portfolio, it means we have preserved satisfactory near-term and long-term economics for Signet and reduce risk to our balance sheet. Again, we hope to conclude this whole process as soon as possible.
We are very pleased to announce that Leonard Green Partners (sic) [ Leonard Green & Partners ] has agreed to invest $625 million in Signet. The transaction is a significant vote of confidence in the Signet operating model and our long-term prospects for growth.
We opened our books and shared significant amount of information as a part of this process, and with the benefit of full due diligence on the company, Leonard Green decided to make a sizable investment, and we are very excited to have Managing Director, Jonathan Sokoloff, assume a seat on the Signet board. The goal is to find a party with significant resources and broad financial and retail expertise, who could become a large owner and partner with us for long term as our business evolves.
The timing in this deal is perfect, in that our business is going through a transformation, including the credit portfolio review, and we look forward to having the benefit of Leonard Green's perspectives as we complete the process.
The successful investment here should also serve as a validating signal to the public markets about the long-term strength of our business model and our practices as a whole.
In return for its cash investment, Leonard Green will own convertible preferred stock in Signet. The transaction itself was designed to be financially neutral as Leonard Green's investment will be based off the market price of our shares, and we will be recycling the capital into share repurchases at similar prices, thereby making a wash from a financial perspective.
What we, therefore, get from the transaction is not capital but the experience, resources, financial acumen and retail expertise that Leonard Green's -- Leonard Green brings to the table. Having a large owner with skin in the game and their skill set will strengthen our board and add a tremendously valuable perspective as our business model continues to evolve.
The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year and is subject to getting customary regulatory approvals.
We believe the long-term secular and company-specific picture looks promising. We think our competitive strength, our long-term opportunity for growth and our precedent of success make us a worthy long-term investment. Certainly Leonard Green did. Signet plays in an industry with a long history of growth. And although the latest share grew minimally, we have seen this before and bounced back with higher market share.
People still fall in love and adorn themselves in jewelry as they have done for literally thousands of years. Signet has some of the best-known and most trusted jewelry retail brand names in the world. Knowing that customers interact with us first online and then potentially long after the sales through our services, we are developing an omnichannel experience that will be best in class. Customers can now become better educated and see a wide range of options regardless of where they engage with us and what they are engaging us for. Few in retail jewelry can match the depth and breadth of experiences that Signet offers. Given our scale and our experience, we can create and drive jewelry trends better than anyone in the industry. Innovation and the power of our brands are in their infancy stages in the jewelry industry, and we are best positioned to take advantage of this.
Our numbers clearly show that a strong presence on television not only drives sales but also market share gains. Our strategy is to have a strong presence on national TV at the right times while others who sell jewelry don't; gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We have a diverse real estate portfolio and locations that provide solid returns. We are profitable in the mall and outside of it, in high-volume properties and low-volume properties, in kiosks and outlets and in our power centers. Our diversity in terms of retail channel and retail location is serving us very well. We continue to maintain a disciplined internal rate of return requirement of 20% on new stores, and we see our best opportunities these days in Kay Jewelers stores outside the mall.
As a major industry player, scale obviously helps in the dealings throughout our supply chain. But it's above much, much more than just scale. We have the experience, we have the know-how, we have the relationships, and we have the processes that are difficult for others to match and do business in the diamond jewelry industry. Much like other companies that sell valuable things like cars and computers, we at Signet sell products, we finance them and we insure them. It's a complete end-to-end solution that our customers embrace and makes a great business sense for us.
And lastly, we have the financial wherewithal to compete and win in all types of business environments. We have weathered difficult time before. We've invested when others couldn't. We know how to strike an appropriate balance between growth and savings, and we believe we'll come this -- through all of this stronger than ever.
That concludes my remarks, and now I'll turn over to Michele."
693964,372307437,1039331,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's comps decreased 2.3% against an increase of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of",2238,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right. So let's start with our second quarter sales performance. Signet's comps decreased 2.3% against an increase of 4.2% in the prior year second quarter and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of 9%.
Now as Mark indicated, although our comp sales declined, about half of the decline was driven by oil and gas reliant regions. Total sales decreased 2.6% and on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 1.3% for the quarter. So in looking at total sales and comp performance by operating segment, I'll share some additional color.
In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 2.2% to $839 million. Comps decreased 3.1% compared to an increase of 3.3% last year and that also compares to a 2-year hurdle rate of 10%. Sales weakness was most pronounced by store banner and geography, notably Jared stores and energy-dependent regional economies.
Now these declines were partially offset by higher sales of select diamond collection as well as fashion category. The Zale Jewelry's operating segment total sales decreased 1.6% to $331 million and 1% on a constant currency exchange basis. Comps were down 3% and that's against a 2-year hurdle rate of 4.8%. So looking on a geography basis, our Zale U.S. total sales were flat. Comps decreased 2.2% and that's against a 2-year stack rate of 4%. In Canada, total sales declined 9.5% or 5.9% on a constant currency basis. Canadian comp sales declined 6.8% and that's against a 2-year hurdle rate of 8.2%. The Zale Jewelry operating segment's decline throughout North America was also driven by weakness in energy-dependent economies and again, this was partially offset by sales of select diamond jewelry collection.
Now our Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 7.8% to $57 million with comp sales of 6.4% and that is on top of 8.4% last year and a 2-year rate of 5.6%. Sales increases were driven predominantly by gold chains and diamond jewelry.
Looking in the U.K., our U.K. total sales decreased 8.7% to $145 million but increased 2% at constant currency rates. Comps were at 0.8% on top of a 5.1% in prior year and compared to a 2-year rate of 9.5%.
Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the sales increases that we saw in the U.K.
So moving on from sales, we'll look at Signet's consolidated and adjusted results.
So again, we're continuing to present the reconciliation that you see on Slide 12 to reflect the impact of purchase accounting as well as severance and IT implementation expense associated with global systems that will drive future synergies. The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. So if we start in the lower left portion of the slide on a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.06 per share.
So moving to the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.04 of EPS dilution and this was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting.
Again, moving over the next column, reflects our integration costs, which relates to consulting costs related to IT implementation as well as severance. Integration and severance costs were also responsible for $0.04 of EPS dilution.
On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.08 worth of adjustment, our adjusted EPS was $1.14 per share.
All right. So we're going to look below sales line at Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $468 million or 34% of adjusted sales and that's down 130 basis points due primarily to lower sales that resulted in deleverage on fixed costs, such as store occupancy as well as higher bad debt expense, primarily due to higher receivables.
Now this was partially offset by the realization of synergies. Adjusted SG&A was $409.1 million or 29.7% of adjusted sales compared to $413.4 million or 29.2% of adjusted sales in the prior year. The 50 basis points of deleverage in rate was also due principally to lower sales.
So I'll go into more details on SG&A in the following slide. So continuing down. Other operating income was $70.7 million or 5.1% of sales. The increase of $7.9 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances.
Adjusted operating income was $129.6 million and that decreased 13.3% over prior year second quarter. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 9.4% of sales, with the decline in rate due to the lower top line. Adjusted EPS was $1.14 per share compared to $1.28 last year, a decrease of $0.14 or 10.9%.
All right. So let's take a closer look at our SG&A. Our teams really did a great job on focusing on cost controls and savings. Our SG&A expense in dollars, as you see, declined by $4 million or 1% year-over-year despite unplanned expenses that we experienced in our quarter. Although the dollar reduction in SG&A wasn't enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volume, it does reflect solid management of expenses, nonetheless.
Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll and that is both at the store and the corporate levels. So as shown on the slide, stores and corporate payroll declined and that's driven by a combination of less variable compensations that flexes with sales, including corporate incentive compensation, synergies associated with both store and corporate payroll, and lower expenses due to favorable exchange -- foreign exchange.
Advertising was prudently managed to just $1 million increase. We also incurred unplanned costs of $5 million on consulting and related expenses due to the unsubstantiated claims against Signet's business integrity. Other expenses increased, driven predominantly by our IT roadmap, including higher depreciation and amortization. So all of that led to a small decrease in our SG&A expense.
So moving off the P&L, I want to hit a few balance sheet highlights, and we'll start with inventory. Our strong second quarter and inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period virtually flat at $2.4 billion. Our teams, again, did a great job at managing in a slow environment, while at the same time not starting the business of growth opportunities. The impact from stores -- from more stores was virtually offset by the impact of sound merchandise management and foreign exchange on inventory procured in currencies other than the strong U.S. dollar.
So we'll move on, and we're going to focus on our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our second quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $529 million, that's down 1.7%. And although lower, the in-house credit sales were slightly more favorable than the division's total sales decline and therefore, being relative share in the mix of tender.
In-house credit participation was 63.1% and that is up 50 basis points due to more effective credit marketing, a greater receptivity among our highest-quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in credit sales mix within our vast credit tiers. The average monthly payment collection rate for the second quarter fiscal 2017 was 10.8% compared to 11.3% last year.
Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received, divided by beginning accounts receivable. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix. We are now operating a 36-month plan for select eligible borrowers in our mall stores. So as participation in this plan grows, the monthly payment collection rates will slightly decline. Importantly, the 36-month plan enhances the quality of our receivables portfolio. So this has been tested for 3 years and fully rolled out this year. The plan requires a $3,000 minimum purchase on bridal jewelry. That means it is only open to borrowers who qualify for a $3,000 line or more, our lower risk customers and because it is available for bridal jewelry, there is a stronger emotional connection and implicit commitment to repay. The combination of collection rate decline and growth in credit participation lead to an increase in our net accounts receivable of $146 million or 9.1% to $1.75 billion.
Interest income from finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other operating income line on our P&L was $70.1 million compared to $62.9 million last year. The increase of $7.2 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivable base.
Our net bad debt expense was $55.3 million and that compares to $49.4 million last year. The increase of $5.9 million in expense was driven primarily by our higher receivable balances and a slight impact from an increase in nonperforming loans, which I'll address momentarily.
The net impact of bad debt and finance charge income generated operating profit of $14.8 million and that is up $1.3 million from last year.
So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for capital account metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 7.4% in the second quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points from prior year was driven by an IT glitch relating to customer reminders during the second quarter, which resulted in slightly higher roller -- roll rates in the over 90-day aging category combined with overall receivable growth. On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 80 basis points, the same as prior year, reflecting our seasonality changes.
The same trend was true for the nonperforming portion of our receivables as a percent of gross receivables. At 4.4%, this was also up 10 basis points from prior year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter for the same reasons that I just discussed. Again, the sequential trend of nonperforming loans was the same versus the prior year period.
In summary, we remain absolutely confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance based on the visibility that we have into our daily collections, our weekly roll rates and other key-performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings.
So I'd like to move now and just spend a few minutes relating to our capital allocation. As mentioned in the release and earlier in this presentation, we made a concerted move to repurchase an unprecedented amount of stock in a single quarter. We bought back 4% of shares in Q2. Now I want to limit my remarks on stock valuation, recognizing that this is quite frankly more of your job than mine. But when a market leader in a growing industry with a solid balance sheet reports record Q1 earnings in May and then goes on to get rewarded with the lowest valuation on the S&P 500 specialty retail index, well, then it's time for unprecedented buybacks. Our lenders recently gave us a vote of confidence by agreeing to an amendment and extension of our revolving credit facility. Signet had a $400 million line for many years, but with the acquisition of Zale, we are now a much bigger company with more seasonal needs and generally more going on. This new $700 million line is now commensurate with the size and the activity of our company. So approximately $200 million of that revolver was tapped in Q2 to help finance this share repurchase.
So with that, we're going to turn to financial guidance. Signet's third quarter comparable store sales are expected to decrease between 3% and 5%. We have seen challenging trends in the summer and with no seasonal catalysts, we are not expecting a change in these trends for most of fall.
Third quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.17 to $0.25. Now, by the way, that guidance includes an expected onetime $0.07 benefit from the effect of harmonizing Signet's compensated absent policy. Not until the holiday season kicks in do we expect to see a trend inflection point for all the reasons that Mark had just previously stated. And that's why for fiscal 2017, we anticipate comps to decline a more modest 1% to 2.5% and adjusted EPS of $7.25 to $7.55.
This annual adjusted EPS guidance does suggest a growth rate of about 8% and that is driven primarily by synergies, cost control, higher finance charge income, as well as a lower effective tax rate and accretion from share repurchases. Our annual effective tax rate is anticipated to be 27% to 28%. Our capital expenditure guidance for the full year has been reduced to $280 million to $320 million. As you may have noticed in our earnings release put out this morning, we did not change our projected store count ranges. So the reduction in CapEx moves us closer to the lower end of the ranges and the reduction primarily relates to deferral of select IT projects. Projected net selling square footage also remain constant as we continue to expect growth of 3% to 3.5%. Most of Signet's new square footage growth is slated for real estate venues other than in closed malls and focused on the kiosk mall banner. Again, we are reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. So that means the $60 million from the last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we should deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies.
So with that, that concludes my prepared remarks, and I'm happy to turn the call back over to Mark."

The Jared fundamental issues, as I stated in my prepared comments, after reviewing intense research on our Jared customer and understanding how that customer is segmented differently than our Kay or Zales stores, we focused on making sure that we understand that customer better and putting in the right products, having the right advertising communication vehicle, talking to those customers specifically and making sure that we do what they believe is the best for the Jared customer experience. So we think starting with the Chosen Diamond, which we know is perfectly targeted to the Jared sentimentalist customer that track their oath entirely through the journey, we think it's going to be a tremendous enhancement to the Jared business in the fourth quarter. It's been testing very well, Oliver, and we continue to see enhancing -- enhancements at every store that continues to test the Chosen Diamond. So we believe once we have that in all of our Jared stores for the fourth quarter, supported by a wonderful advertising television creative to really explain the journey of a diamond, is going to be a huge enhancement to the Jared stores in the fourth quarter and it talks specifically to the customer segmentation of that Jared customer. We also have some initiatives that we have in place on enhancing our selling tactics, making sure that a customer is taken care of from the minute they come in the door and not passed around to different departments while they're in the selling area. We're also testing certain, I mentioned this, pricing tactics, and I won't go into a lot of detail for competitive reasons, we have pricing tactics that we are testing right now that we think can be an enhancement for Jared for the fourth quarter. And we're also very excited -- and I mentioned this in my comments, we're very excited about the Jared stores, the Jared PANDORA boutiques, we have -- we have about 180 stores that have them up right now, they have expanded assortment in PANDORA jewelry. We have targeted training and a targeted sales associate as working just in the PANDORA counter, and we believe with that expansion of PANDORA in our Jared stores, and we'll be creating a specific creative for advertising to communicate to customers about the broadened assortment that we have in our Jared stores and PANDORA, will increase our foot traffic in the fourth quarter coming to those stores also. So we believe that we have some very good initiatives in the Jared store banners that tie specifically to the segmented customers that quite frankly we weren't doing a good job over the last couple of years on, and we believe we have done a good job on that. As far as the partnership with Leonard Green. We -- Leonard Green is one of the foremost experts in the private equity world in investing in retail companies. They have a wealth of knowledge not only from the financial side but also from the retail experience of being on boards and working with other companies. And we at Signet are looking very much forward to having their guidance and in getting their partnership with us in helping us determine ways that they can take this company going forward. We're looking forward to getting their insight in working through some of their partners and giving us some best practice that we can take on at Jared, at Signet and enhance our business. And the reason that the timing is perfect now is because, as I said in my prepared comments, our valuation is low and the idea of getting a company like Leonard Green, who did a thorough due diligence of our business, of our practices, of our processes, just validates that Signet has a great business model and that Signet has some great growth prospects going forward, and we believe that having Leonard Green on our board -- I mean Mr. Sokoloff on our board, just will continue to help us out going forward. And we really are excited quite frankly of having Leonard Green's input and insight on the important decisions we're going to make as it relates to our credit strategy review. So that's just a few of the reasons why we believe Leonard Green is going to be a really exciting partner for Signet going forward."

If you go back and you look at our past 5 years, historical trend moving from Q3 to Q4, on average, it's about 120 basis points acceleration between Q3 and Q4, which completely makes sense given it's a key holiday, gift-giving period. We are on TV at that time at least 8 weeks out of the year. So we would anticipate with all the initiative to have some level of acceleration moving from Q3 to Q4."

The brand we look at -- it’s hard to understand specifically, like I said earlier, that what's attached to the public relations and its effect on our business as a whole. We don't believe that it's -- that is the reason for our bridal not being strong this quarter. If you look at some of our competitors that have talked about their bridal business, they've also had soft sales in the bridal area for this quarter. We believe it's something that is a consumer mindset issued that relates to bridal and that they just want to get some stability and understand what's going on as a whole in the world and what's going on in the presidential election. But we don't believe it is hard to determine that the bridal business not being as strong as it has been in the quarter is due to the public relations issues. But there is no direct correlation, there's no way we can completely measure it. But, again, like I said we've heard throughout the industry, and we've seen other publicly traded jewelry chains -- jewelry companies also have issues with bridal in this last quarter."

In Q1, again, that trend continued, and we started to see a couple of these spread into a few more states on how we define that energy-reliant region.

I would like to start by discussing some of our key points that we would like you to take away from our third quarter financial results presentation. While we are never pleased with lower year-over-year results, our sales and earnings exceeded our expectations. In a challenging environment, our team delivered some solid results, especially in the fashion jewelry categories, our outlet locations, our online business, our U.K. stores and finally, our kiosk business. 
We also managed our SG&A and inventory well, which not only helped earnings but also increased our free cash flow substantially year-over-year. We initiated a fourth quarter guidance consistent with our thinking in August. That is when we gave fiscal year and third quarter guidance on our August call, we obviously implied a fourth quarter guide. And today, we are formally guiding the fourth quarter consistent with our thinking back in August. Our fiscal year earnings guidance is updated to reflect only the flow-through of our third quarter earnings. 
Our Zale division delivered a variety of wins in the third quarter. Our sales increased on an inventory decrease, which was driven in part by continued focus on our integration efforts. Piercing Pagoda delivered nearly a 10% comp sales gain. We saw unfavorable impact to sales less [ph] in energy regions, where the Zale division stores have a large presence. And lastly and perhaps most importantly, our holiday season initiatives are numerous, well tested, and our team members are well trained and prepared to deliver a wonderful customer experience. 
Now let's get into some more detail behind these high-level takeaways. We achieved some wins in the third quarter starting with the diamond fashion jewelry category. Our Ever Us 2-stone diamond jewelry collection produced significantly more sales year-over-year. We also saw contributions from bracelets as we continued to lean into the bracelet trend of stacking with fresh looks and innovative fastening systems in both branded and non-branded collections. And our earrings of all types are resonating with customers, including the growing trend in earring climbers. 
Third quarter sales were also driven in part by select bridal collections. Vera Wang and Neil Lane led the way and a variety of other bridal collections also contributed. We continued to drive forward on our omni-channel initiatives to deliver a seamless experience to our customers. In the third quarter, our omni-channel selling approach continued to deliver results. Our eCommerce sales increased. But more importantly, we continued to connect with our customers through enhanced digital experience. 
Our new clienteling system was launched in our Kay and Jared locations. The system provides a single view of the customer with the capability to holistically capture customer information. This enables our team members to improve their interactions with customers before, during and after their visit to our stores or our sites. We've also broadened our affiliate marketing relationships with other retail shopping sites. 
And finally, the diversity of our real estate footprint served us well. The U.K. division delivered a 3.6% comp sales increase. Outlets were up, too, with very broad-based gains. And Piercing Pagoda delivered strong results in diamond and gold jewelry. And we continue to see growth opportunities in the children's jewelry classification. 
In the third quarter, our team did a nice job of continuing to drive synergies on the Zale integration. To review, a synergy, as we define it, is a net contribution to operating profit. I won't go into depth on each of the examples listed here on Slide 5 and the work stream detail behind each one. But as you can see, we have got a lot of energy, a lot of activity going on to fully optimize the business operation. 
Due to the synergy work being done on our Zale division store inventories, they're operating on a much more productive basis, which is assisting in increasing our free cash flow. We also continued to enhance our organizational structure as this has led to leaner, more efficient teams delivering consistent execution of processes. Some of the departments that have streamlined operations are human resources, eCommerce, inventory management, real estate, legal, finance, supply [indiscernible] and distribution and repair. These are just some examples of many other projects that are positioning us well to build upon our long history of growth and improving profitability. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where we have historically made about half of our annual profit. As I mentioned, the team is prepared and focused on the opportunities in front of us. And we are ready to serve and delight our customers. This is the season when our competitive positioning and our ability to invest in growth-enhancing, innovative, new products and initiatives really allow Signet to capture profitable market share. 
One of our biggest initiatives is year 2 of the Ever Us collection. In our experience, beacon or industry trend-driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in their second year as compared to their first. We are selling additional jewelry categories and styles, higher carat weights and more inventory supported with greater digital, print, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. 
We also expanded the Vera Wang LOVE bridal collection into the fashion jewelry category in Zale. This collection includes diamond jewelry as well as pearls supported with new in-store displays. Zale is also introducing the new iconic Vera Wang Kindred Heart collection. 
This holiday season, bracelets are sure to continue their momentum. We have beautiful new collections, which include the Le Vian Ombre exclusive, which is pictured here, which is exclusive in Jared, on the slide. Also all eyes are on the ear this fourth quarter as we continue to drive the trend in earrings, earring climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our Radiant Reflections and our Endless Brilliance collections, which create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings. 
In all of our Jared stores, we have reset our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores or boutiques managed by our PANDORA specialists. We are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry, including a slew of products and exclusive collections. And it's all supported with new TV advertising creative. 
The new Chosen Diamond is now in all Jared stores also, which shows customers each stage of a diamond's journey, from a rough diamond to a finished piece of beautiful jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer, who tends to value this type of product and information. We also designed a brand-new TV ad to support the Chosen. We significantly improved websites for Kay and Jared, which incorporates fully responsive design to work seamlessly across all devices. We also significantly increased investment in digital marketing across all of our channels and all of our store banners with more effective targeting and personalization than ever before. 
And lastly, we have many targeted marketing plans tying in the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media. You can get a great sense of the powerful motion behind each of our store banners' TV advertisings by viewing them at signetjewelers.com. Just click on the Media Center and you'll see our ads.
Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I will focus on a few very high-level points. As you can imagine, this is a very intense and complex process to analyze. We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. But we must make a thoughtfully analyzed decision, taking into account near-term and long-term economics as well as our ability to continue serving our customers. We are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio. And we are confident that we will deliver shareholder value regardless of the direction that we choose. Importantly, we are pleased with the interest expressed by several different financial institutions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Michele."
693964,382507318,1090362,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right, so let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relati",2136,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right, so let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relatively small size of the quarter, this can have some distortion on our ratios. Now with that in mind, I'll cover our operating performance, starting with sales. 
For the third quarter, Signet's comps decreased 2% against an increase of 3.3% in the prior year third quarter. And that compares to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 7.5%. Of our comp sales decline, about 80 basis points was driven by oil and gas-reliant regions. Total Signet sales decreased 2.5%. And on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 0.5% for the quarter. 
Sales on an operating segment basis were as follows. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 2.9% to $712 million. Comp sales decreased 3.8% compared to an increase of 3.5% last year and compared to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 10.3%. Sales weakness was more pronounced in the non-core regional store brand, Jared to a lesser extent and energy-dependent regional economies across all store banners. Fashion jewelry, including select branded diamond jewelry, performed relatively better than the rest of the merchandise portfolio. 
From a channel perspective, outlets and eComm performed a little better than the rest of the selling channels. The Zale Jewelry operating segment's total sales increased 0.2% to $282 million. And that was flat on a constant currency exchange basis. Comps were down 1.4% against a 2-year comp rate of 0.7%. 
On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. total sales increased 0.3% while comps decreased 1.5%. And that compares to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 0.7%. In Canada, total sales declined 0.4% or 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Canadian comp sales declined 0.9% against a 2-year comp rate of 0.3%. For the Zale Jewelry operating segment, the modest increase in total sales was driven primarily by select diamond jewelry collections with fashion jewelry in total slightly outperforming bridal. Q3 results in both U.S. and Canada were also unfavorably impacted by energy-dependent reliant regions. 
Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 11.3% to $53 million with comp sales of 9.5% on top of a 10% comp rate last year and a 2-year comp rate of 8.5%. Sales increases in Pagoda were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. In the U.K., our total sales decreased 12.8% to $130 million but increased 4.2% at constant currency rates. Comps sales grew 3.6% on top of a 4.1% in the prior year and a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 7.8%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the U.K. comp sales increases. 
So moving on to Signet's consolidated and adjusted results. On Slide 9, we're continuing to present this reconciliation through the end of fiscal year '17 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting as well as IT implementation expenses associated with global systems that will drive future efficiencies and cost benefits. The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. 
So starting in the lower left portion of the slide. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.20. Our third quarter EPS benefited by $0.02 due to a lower tax rate of 12.4% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 31.5%. The Q3 rate is attributed to a lower annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017, which I'll discuss further prior to wrapping up my commentary. 
In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.03 of EPS dilution. This was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration costs, which relate to consulting costs related information technology implementations. Integration costs were responsible for $0.07 of EPS dilution. On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.10 worth of adjustment, our adjusted EPS was $0.30 for the third quarter. 
So looking below the sales line of Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $352.5 million or 29.6% of adjusted sales, down 100 basis points. The lower rate was due principally to lower sales, higher bad debt expense and deleverage on store occupancy. And this was partially offset by favorable merchandise cost and merchandise mix. Adjusted SG&A was $377.3 million, down $10.3 million. The rate was 31.7%, which is flat to prior year rate. The decline in dollars and steady rate was driven by lower variable compensation and a few other factors, which I'll elaborate momentarily. 
Other operating income was $68.6 million or 5.8% of sales. This increase of $7.7 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income was $43.8 million, down 7%. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 3.7%, which is down 20 basis points due primarily to lower top line. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.30, which compares to $0.33 last year, a decrease of $0.03 or 9.1%. 
So moving on, we'll take a closer look at SG&A. Our teams continue to focus on cost control and savings. Our SG&A expense declined $10.3 million, as I mentioned, or 2.7% in the third quarter. Although the dollar reduction in SG&A wasn't quite enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volume, it does reflect prudent use of expenses nonetheless. Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll. 
Our store and corporate payroll declined due in part to a variety of factors, which also include lower variable compensation, which flexes with sales, and a lower corporate incentive compensation; a one-time accrual reversal that I had briefly mentioned on our last quarter call related to harmonization of Signet's compensated absence policies; and lower merchant fees in the Zale credit programs. Also embedded throughout SG&A is favorability from foreign exchange. Our Q3 advertising expense was also slightly lower. And that's due primarily to a timing shift to spend out of Q3 to postelection period in Q4. Other expenses increased, driven predominantly by information technology projects. 
So moving off the P&L, we'll hit a few balance sheet highlights before touching on capital considerations and guidance. Our strong third quarter ending inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at $2.6 billion. Our teams did a good job of managing inventory levels in a slower sales environment. 
The decline of 2.8% in inventory compared 30 basis points favorably to Signet's decline in total sales of 2.5%. We saw sound, prudent management of inventory across categories and divisions. And it's worth noting, the Zale division inventory declined at a faster rate than Signet overall. This is directly related to the synergy-producing initiative that Mark previously discussed, which we call our inventory turnover improvement. Finally, Signet benefited from foreign exchange and inventory-procuring currencies other than the relatively strong U.S. dollar. 
So now let's move on and turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our third quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $476 million. And that's down 2.3%. Although lower, the in-house credit sales were more favorable than the division's total sales decline, and therefore, gained relative share in the mix of tender. In-house credit participation was 66.8%, up 40 basis points. This was due to faster growth and higher spending among our highest-quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in the credit sales mix within our best credit tiers. 
The average monthly payment collection rate for the third quarter fiscal 2017 was 10.6% compared to 11.1% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix and an increase in the average transaction value of what is getting financed. As a result, monthly payments are higher in dollars but lower as a percent of balances, thereby resulting in higher receivables outstanding to be collected. With that said, our credit plan mix is driving a higher FICO score customer with the rollout of our 36-month bridal plan to select customers. The combination of collection rate decline and a growth in credit participation contributed to an increase in our accounts receivable of $109 million or 8% to $1.55 billion. 
Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other operating income line on our income statement, was $67 million compared to $61.3 million last year. The increase of $5.7 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables space. Our net bad debt was $57.2 million compared to $53.1 million last year. As a percent of receivables, the nearly flat bad debt allowance, which you'll see on the next slide in just a minute, was driven primarily by low receivable growth, which was a symptom of the overall sales decline. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $9.8 million. And that's up $1.6 million. 
So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for capital account metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 7.9% in the third quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points for the prior year was driven by a variety of nearly offsetting factors. The impact of lower sales leading to lower receivables growth as well as the lingering effect from the Q2 IT glitch slightly offset the impact of higher-quality new borrowers. On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 50 basis points, the same as prior year, reflecting seasonality changes. For the nonperforming portion of our receivables, as a percent of the gross AR, Q3 was 4.9%. This was flat to last year and better by 10 basis points on a sequential basis. 
In summary, we remain confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance based on the visibility that we have into our daily collections, weekly roll rates and other key performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings. 
So just a few highlights in terms of our capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 10 million shares of our common stock, albeit all of our Q3 activity was related to offsetting dilution from our preferred stock issuance. As mentioned in the release, our buyback activity is in line with our expectations and our $525 million accelerated share repurchase program is continuing. 
Regarding cash and borrowings. The significant increase in free cash generation was driven primarily by favorable changes to working capital and higher net income. Separately, we borrowed from our revolving credit facility for seasonal working capital needs during Q3. This was normal activity and also within our expectations. 
Finally, our capital allocation policies remain unchanged. Signet maintains a balanced approach to investing in the growth of its business as well as returning capital to our shareholders via growing dividend and share repurchases. 
So with that, let's turn to our financial guidance. As Mark indicated, our fourth quarter guidance is consistent with the guidance implied on our August call. Signet's fourth quarter comparable store sales are expected to decrease between 2% to 4%. We feel well prepared and focused for the fourth quarter in what remains a relatively uncertain environment. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $4 to $4.20. The weighted average common shares outstanding is expected to be about 76 million. The increase in our fourth quarter shares from third quarter is driven by the inclusion of the effect of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion of our preferred security. In the third quarter, these shares were anti-dilutive, and therefore, were not in the calculation. 
EPS guidance for both Q4 and the full year implies a flow-through of synergies, general cost controls and higher finance income, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Below the operating profit time, our earnings per share guidance also is favorably impacted by: first, a lower tax rate of 25% to 26% due primarily to profit mix; and secondly, fewer shares from repurchase activity in the first half. The fiscal year earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increase in guidance are attributed solely to the third quarter actual results exceeding our previous expectations. Again, we are reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance. 
In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. That means a $60 million from last year, plus another $98 million to $115 [ph] million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. 
That concludes my prepared remarks, and with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

In terms of how that plays out going forward, that's, I guess, anyone's speculation, but we are going to start getting into territory that we're comping, and I think it was a good sign that what we saw from Q3 compared to our Q2 eased up a little bit. From a real estate perspective, we're not at a point that we're ready to guide what next year's square footage space is. But with that said, I would go back to -- we are a growth company and in terms of how we're going to achieve that growth, it really is through organic growth or to the potential that we see acquisitions that fit well within our core. So that should obviously imply that we expect our square footage to continue to grow into next year, at least comparable to what you see in terms of the guide this year that 3% to 3.5% of square footage space growth. And then on the Zale synergies, I'm not going to get ahead of ourselves on the Zale synergies. We're very confident in terms of achieving our $225 million to $250 million synergy range by the end of next year. We'll continue as we go through the synergies.

I would like to start by discussing some of our key points that we would like you to take away from our third quarter financial results presentation. While we are never pleased with lower year-over-year results, our sales and earnings exceeded our expectations. In a challenging environment, our team delivered some solid results, especially in the fashion jewelry categories, our outlet locations, our online business, our U.K. stores and finally, our kiosk business. 
We also managed our SG&A and inventory well, which not only helped earnings but also increased our free cash flow substantially year-over-year. We initiated a fourth quarter guidance consistent with our thinking in August. That is when we gave fiscal year and third quarter guidance on our August call, we obviously implied a fourth quarter guide. And today, we are formally guiding the fourth quarter consistent with our thinking back in August. Our fiscal year earnings guidance is updated to reflect only the flow-through of our third quarter earnings. 
Our Zale division delivered a variety of wins in the third quarter. Our sales increased on an inventory decrease, which was driven in part by continued focus on our integration efforts. Piercing Pagoda delivered nearly a 10% comp sales gain. We saw unfavorable impact to sales less [ph] in energy regions, where the Zale division stores have a large presence. And lastly and perhaps most importantly, our holiday season initiatives are numerous, well tested, and our team members are well trained and prepared to deliver a wonderful customer experience. 
Now let's get into some more detail behind these high-level takeaways. We achieved some wins in the third quarter starting with the diamond fashion jewelry category. Our Ever Us 2-stone diamond jewelry collection produced significantly more sales year-over-year. We also saw contributions from bracelets as we continued to lean into the bracelet trend of stacking with fresh looks and innovative fastening systems in both branded and non-branded collections. And our earrings of all types are resonating with customers, including the growing trend in earring climbers. 
Third quarter sales were also driven in part by select bridal collections. Vera Wang and Neil Lane led the way and a variety of other bridal collections also contributed. We continued to drive forward on our omni-channel initiatives to deliver a seamless experience to our customers. In the third quarter, our omni-channel selling approach continued to deliver results. Our eCommerce sales increased. But more importantly, we continued to connect with our customers through enhanced digital experience. 
Our new clienteling system was launched in our Kay and Jared locations. The system provides a single view of the customer with the capability to holistically capture customer information. This enables our team members to improve their interactions with customers before, during and after their visit to our stores or our sites. We've also broadened our affiliate marketing relationships with other retail shopping sites. 
And finally, the diversity of our real estate footprint served us well. The U.K. division delivered a 3.6% comp sales increase. Outlets were up, too, with very broad-based gains. And Piercing Pagoda delivered strong results in diamond and gold jewelry. And we continue to see growth opportunities in the children's jewelry classification. 
In the third quarter, our team did a nice job of continuing to drive synergies on the Zale integration. To review, a synergy, as we define it, is a net contribution to operating profit. I won't go into depth on each of the examples listed here on Slide 5 and the work stream detail behind each one. But as you can see, we have got a lot of energy, a lot of activity going on to fully optimize the business operation. 
Due to the synergy work being done on our Zale division store inventories, they're operating on a much more productive basis, which is assisting in increasing our free cash flow. We also continued to enhance our organizational structure as this has led to leaner, more efficient teams delivering consistent execution of processes. Some of the departments that have streamlined operations are human resources, eCommerce, inventory management, real estate, legal, finance, supply [indiscernible] and distribution and repair. These are just some examples of many other projects that are positioning us well to build upon our long history of growth and improving profitability. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where we have historically made about half of our annual profit. As I mentioned, the team is prepared and focused on the opportunities in front of us. And we are ready to serve and delight our customers. This is the season when our competitive positioning and our ability to invest in growth-enhancing, innovative, new products and initiatives really allow Signet to capture profitable market share. 
One of our biggest initiatives is year 2 of the Ever Us collection. In our experience, beacon or industry trend-driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in their second year as compared to their first. We are selling additional jewelry categories and styles, higher carat weights and more inventory supported with greater digital, print, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. 
We also expanded the Vera Wang LOVE bridal collection into the fashion jewelry category in Zale. This collection includes diamond jewelry as well as pearls supported with new in-store displays. Zale is also introducing the new iconic Vera Wang Kindred Heart collection. 
This holiday season, bracelets are sure to continue their momentum. We have beautiful new collections, which include the Le Vian Ombre exclusive, which is pictured here, which is exclusive in Jared, on the slide. Also all eyes are on the ear this fourth quarter as we continue to drive the trend in earrings, earring climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our Radiant Reflections and our Endless Brilliance collections, which create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings. 
In all of our Jared stores, we have reset our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores or boutiques managed by our PANDORA specialists. We are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry, including a slew of products and exclusive collections. And it's all supported with new TV advertising creative. 
The new Chosen Diamond is now in all Jared stores also, which shows customers each stage of a diamond's journey, from a rough diamond to a finished piece of beautiful jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer, who tends to value this type of product and information. We also designed a brand-new TV ad to support the Chosen. We significantly improved websites for Kay and Jared, which incorporates fully responsive design to work seamlessly across all devices. We also significantly increased investment in digital marketing across all of our channels and all of our store banners with more effective targeting and personalization than ever before. 
And lastly, we have many targeted marketing plans tying in the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media. You can get a great sense of the powerful motion behind each of our store banners' TV advertisings by viewing them at signetjewelers.com. Just click on the Media Center and you'll see our ads.
Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I will focus on a few very high-level points. As you can imagine, this is a very intense and complex process to analyze. We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. But we must make a thoughtfully analyzed decision, taking into account near-term and long-term economics as well as our ability to continue serving our customers. We are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio. And we are confident that we will deliver shareholder value regardless of the direction that we choose. Importantly, we are pleased with the interest expressed by several different financial institutions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Michele."

All right, so let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relati",2135,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right, so let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relatively small size of the quarter, this can have some distortion on our ratios. Now with that in mind, I'll cover our operating performance, starting with sales. 
For the third quarter, Signet's comps decreased 2% against an increase of 3.3% in the prior year third quarter. And that compares to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 7.5%. Of our comp sales decline, about 80 basis points was driven by oil and gas-reliant regions. Total Signet sales decreased 2.5%. And on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 0.5% for the quarter. 
Sales on an operating segment basis were as follows. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 2.9% to $712 million. Comp sales decreased 3.8% compared to an increase of 3.5% last year and compared to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 10.3%. Sales weakness was more pronounced in the non-core regional store brand, Jared to a lesser extent and energy-dependent regional economies across all store banners. Fashion jewelry, including select branded diamond jewelry, performed relatively better than the rest of the merchandise portfolio. 
From a channel perspective, outlets and eComm performed a little better than the rest of the selling channels. The Zale Jewelry operating segment's total sales increased 0.2% to $282 million. And that was flat on a constant currency exchange basis. Comps were down 1.4% against a 2-year comp rate of 0.7%. 
On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. total sales increased 0.3% while comps decreased 1.5%. And that compares to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 0.7%. In Canada, total sales declined 0.4% or 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Canadian comp sales declined 0.9% against a 2-year comp rate of 0.3%. For the Zale Jewelry operating segment, the modest increase in total sales was driven primarily by select diamond jewelry collections with fashion jewelry in total slightly outperforming bridal. Q3 results in both U.S. and Canada were also unfavorably impacted by energy-dependent reliant regions. 
Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 11.3% to $53 million with comp sales of 9.5% on top of a 10% comp rate last year and a 2-year comp rate of 8.5%. Sales increases in Pagoda were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. In the U.K., our total sales decreased 12.8% to $130 million but increased 4.2% at constant currency rates. Comps sales grew 3.6% on top of a 4.1% in the prior year and a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 7.8%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the U.K. comp sales increases. 
So moving on to Signet's consolidated and adjusted results. On Slide 9, we're continuing to present this reconciliation through the end of fiscal year '17 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting as well as IT implementation expenses associated with global systems that will drive future efficiencies and cost benefits. The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration costs. 
So starting in the lower left portion of the slide. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.20. Our third quarter EPS benefited by $0.02 due to a lower tax rate of 12.4% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 31.5%. The Q3 rate is attributed to a lower annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017, which I'll discuss further prior to wrapping up my commentary. 
In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.03 of EPS dilution. This was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration costs, which relate to consulting costs related information technology implementations. Integration costs were responsible for $0.07 of EPS dilution. On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.10 worth of adjustment, our adjusted EPS was $0.30 for the third quarter. 
So looking below the sales line of Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $352.5 million or 29.6% of adjusted sales, down 100 basis points. The lower rate was due principally to lower sales, higher bad debt expense and deleverage on store occupancy. And this was partially offset by favorable merchandise cost and merchandise mix. Adjusted SG&A was $377.3 million, down $10.3 million. The rate was 31.7%, which is flat to prior year rate. The decline in dollars and steady rate was driven by lower variable compensation and a few other factors, which I'll elaborate momentarily. 
Other operating income was $68.6 million or 5.8% of sales. This increase of $7.7 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income was $43.8 million, down 7%. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 3.7%, which is down 20 basis points due primarily to lower top line. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.30, which compares to $0.33 last year, a decrease of $0.03 or 9.1%. 
So moving on, we'll take a closer look at SG&A. Our teams continue to focus on cost control and savings. Our SG&A expense declined $10.3 million, as I mentioned, or 2.7% in the third quarter. Although the dollar reduction in SG&A wasn't quite enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volume, it does reflect prudent use of expenses nonetheless. Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll. 
Our store and corporate payroll declined due in part to a variety of factors, which also include lower variable compensation, which flexes with sales, and a lower corporate incentive compensation; a one-time accrual reversal that I had briefly mentioned on our last quarter call related to harmonization of Signet's compensated absence policies; and lower merchant fees in the Zale credit programs. Also embedded throughout SG&A is favorability from foreign exchange. Our Q3 advertising expense was also slightly lower. And that's due primarily to a timing shift to spend out of Q3 to postelection period in Q4. Other expenses increased, driven predominantly by information technology projects. 
So moving off the P&L, we'll hit a few balance sheet highlights before touching on capital considerations and guidance. Our strong third quarter ending inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at $2.6 billion. Our teams did a good job of managing inventory levels in a slower sales environment. 
The decline of 2.8% in inventory compared 30 basis points favorably to Signet's decline in total sales of 2.5%. We saw sound, prudent management of inventory across categories and divisions. And it's worth noting, the Zale division inventory declined at a faster rate than Signet overall. This is directly related to the synergy-producing initiative that Mark previously discussed, which we call our inventory turnover improvement. Finally, Signet benefited from foreign exchange and inventory-procuring currencies other than the relatively strong U.S. dollar. 
So now let's move on and turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our third quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $476 million. And that's down 2.3%. Although lower, the in-house credit sales were more favorable than the division's total sales decline, and therefore, gained relative share in the mix of tender. In-house credit participation was 66.8%, up 40 basis points. This was due to faster growth and higher spending among our highest-quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in the credit sales mix within our best credit tiers. 
The average monthly payment collection rate for the third quarter fiscal 2017 was 10.6% compared to 11.1% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix and an increase in the average transaction value of what is getting financed. As a result, monthly payments are higher in dollars but lower as a percent of balances, thereby resulting in higher receivables outstanding to be collected. With that said, our credit plan mix is driving a higher FICO score customer with the rollout of our 36-month bridal plan to select customers. The combination of collection rate decline and a growth in credit participation contributed to an increase in our accounts receivable of $109 million or 8% to $1.55 billion. 
Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other operating income line on our income statement, was $67 million compared to $61.3 million last year. The increase of $5.7 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables space. Our net bad debt was $57.2 million compared to $53.1 million last year. As a percent of receivables, the nearly flat bad debt allowance, which you'll see on the next slide in just a minute, was driven primarily by low receivable growth, which was a symptom of the overall sales decline. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $9.8 million. And that's up $1.6 million. 
So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for capital account metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 7.9% in the third quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points for the prior year was driven by a variety of nearly offsetting factors. The impact of lower sales leading to lower receivables growth as well as the lingering effect from the Q2 IT glitch slightly offset the impact of higher-quality new borrowers. On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 50 basis points, the same as prior year, reflecting seasonality changes. For the nonperforming portion of our receivables, as a percent of the gross AR, Q3 was 4.9%. This was flat to last year and better by 10 basis points on a sequential basis. 
In summary, we remain confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance based on the visibility that we have into our daily collections, weekly roll rates and other key performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings. 
So just a few highlights in terms of our capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 10 million shares of our common stock, albeit all of our Q3 activity was related to offsetting dilution from our preferred stock issuance. As mentioned in the release, our buyback activity is in line with our expectations and our $525 million accelerated share repurchase program is continuing. 
Regarding cash and borrowings. The significant increase in free cash generation was driven primarily by favorable changes to working capital and higher net income. Separately, we borrowed from our revolving credit facility for seasonal working capital needs during Q3. This was normal activity and also within our expectations. 
Finally, our capital allocation policies remain unchanged. Signet maintains a balanced approach to investing in the growth of its business as well as returning capital to our shareholders via growing dividend and share repurchases. 
So with that, let's turn to our financial guidance. As Mark indicated, our fourth quarter guidance is consistent with the guidance implied on our August call. Signet's fourth quarter comparable store sales are expected to decrease between 2% to 4%. We feel well prepared and focused for the fourth quarter in what remains a relatively uncertain environment. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $4 to $4.20. The weighted average common shares outstanding is expected to be about 76 million. The increase in our fourth quarter shares from third quarter is driven by the inclusion of the effect of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion of our preferred security. In the third quarter, these shares were anti-dilutive, and therefore, were not in the calculation. 
EPS guidance for both Q4 and the full year implies a flow-through of synergies, general cost controls and higher finance income, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Below the operating profit line, our earnings per share guidance also is favorably impacted by: first, a lower tax rate of 25% to 26% due primarily to profit mix; and secondly, fewer shares from repurchase activity in the first half. The fiscal year earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increase in guidance are attributed solely to the third quarter actual results exceeding our previous expectations. 
Again, we are reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. That means a $60 million from last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

So let me first start with what we said in the past as part of our credit strategy review. If we are in the optimized scenario, optimization not only considers how we would further leverage our receivable portfolio, but it also would include disclosures and changes from the recency over to the contractual. So I just want to kind of start there, that if we're in the optimized scenario, we will move from recency over to the contractual. With that said, the prior comments of what we said is that the financial statement impact really would be immaterial moving to contractual.

If you look at the jewelry industry as a whole, it's increased about 3% to 4% on a compounded annual growth rate for the past 25 years. And through those 25 years, there are some up quarters and some down quarters, but it's been a consistent performer. And Signet has outperformed the industry consistently over those past 25 years and the most recent times. So we believe once the jewelry market comes back to normalcy, which it will, that we will continue to gain market share like we have in the past due to our strength in marketing, our strength in supply chain, our strength in training our people. So that's our perspective, Simeon. The jewelry industry has grown. And we believe it will continue to grow. Most importantly from all of our research, consumers still find jewelry as a wonderful way of expressing emotion and love. And we're going to be able to maximize those opportunities, what's out there."

And we're definitely not immune from traffic. And we see that, as you had mentioned, in terms of our lower-priced items, particularly the beads and charms that tend to be more reliant on the traffic. With that said, what helps is that with our exclusive brands and within the national marketing and advertising that we have that's going on, we do become more of a destination purchase rather than an impulse purchase.

As far as new information that we have, there was a [indiscernible] report out for the Jewelers Board of Trade that there was an increase in stores that closed during the third quarter year-on-year. I think was a 40% increase year-on-year in store closures. So there are -- stores are closing at a faster rate this year versus the prior year at the same time frame. That being said, we just believe that this gives us an opportunity to continue to gain market share in the long term."

I would like to start by discussing some of our key points that we would like you to take away from our third quarter financial results presentation. While we are never pleased with lower year-over-year results, our sales and earnings exceeded our expectations. In a challenging environment, our team delivered some solid results, especially in the fashion jewelry categories, our outlet locations, our online business, our U.K. stores and finally, our kiosk business. 
We also managed our SG&A and inventory well, which not only helped earnings but also increased our free cash flow substantially year-over-year. We initiated fourth quarter guidance consistent with our thinking in August. That is when we gave fiscal year and third quarter guidance on our August call, we obviously implied a fourth quarter guide. And today, we are formally guiding the fourth quarter consistent with our thinking back in August. Our fiscal year earnings guidance is updated to reflect only the flow-through of our third quarter earnings. 
Our Zale division delivered a variety of wins in the third quarter. Our sales increased on an inventory decrease, which was driven in part by our continued focus on our integration efforts. Piercing Pagoda delivered nearly a 10% comp sales gain. We saw unfavorable impact to sales less [ph] than in energy regions, where the Zale division stores have a large presence. And lastly and perhaps most importantly, our holiday season initiatives are numerous, well tested, and our team members are well trained and prepared to deliver a wonderful customer experience. 
Now let's get into some more detail behind these high-level takeaways. We achieved some wins in the third quarter starting with the diamond fashion jewelry category. Our Ever Us 2-stone diamond jewelry collection produced significantly more sales year-over-year. We also saw contributions from bracelets as we continued to lean into the bracelet trend of stacking with fresh looks and innovative fastening systems in both branded and non-branded collections. And our earrings of all types are resonating with customers, including the growing trend in earring climbers. 
Third quarter sales were also driven in part by select bridal collections. Vera Wang and Neil Lane led the way, and a variety of other bridal collections also contributed. We continue to drive forward on our omnichannel initiatives to deliver a seamless experience to our customers. In the third quarter, our omnichannel selling approach continued to deliver results. Our eCommerce sales increased. But more importantly, we continued to connect with our customers through an enhanced digital experience. 
Our new clienteling system was launched in our Kay and Jared locations. The system provides a single view of the customer with the capability to holistically capture customer information. This enables our team members to improve their interactions with customers before, during and after their visits to our stores or our sites. We've also broadened our affiliate marketing relationships with other retail shopping sites. 
And finally, the diversity of our real estate footprint served us well. The U.K. division delivered a 3.6% comp sales increase. Outlets were up, too, with very broad-based gains. And Piercing Pagoda delivered strong results in diamond and gold jewelry. And we continue to see growth opportunities in the children's jewelry classification. 
In the third quarter, our team did a nice job of continuing to drive synergies on the Zale integration. To review, a synergy, as we define it, is a net contribution to operating profit. I won't go into depth on each of the examples listed here on Slide 5 and the work stream detail behind each one. But as you can see, we have got a lot of energy, a lot of activity going on to fully optimize the business operation. 
Due to the synergy work being done on our Zale division store inventories, they're operating on a much more productive basis, which is assisting in increasing our free cash flow. We also continue to enhance our organizational structure and this has led to leaner, more efficient teams delivering consistent execution of processes. Some of the departments that have streamlined operations are human resources, eCommerce, inventory management, real estate, legal, finance, supply date [ph] and distribution and repair. These are just some examples of the many other projects that are positioning us well to build upon our long history of growth and improving profitability. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where we have historically made about half of our annual profit. As I mentioned, the team is prepared and focused on the opportunities in front of us. And we are ready to serve and delight our customers. This is the season when our competitive positioning and our ability to invest in growth-enhancing, innovative new products and initiatives really allow Signet to capture a profitable market share. 
One of our biggest initiatives is year 2 of the Ever Us collection. In our experience, beacon or industry trend-driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in their second year as compared to their first. We are selling additional jewelry categories and styles, higher carat weights and more inventory supported with greater digital, print, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. 
We also expanded the Vera Wang LOVE bridal collection into the fashion jewelry category in Zales. This collection includes diamond jewelry as well as pearls supported with new in-store displays. Zale is also introducing the new iconic Vera Wang Kindred Heart collection. 
This holiday season, bracelets are sure to continue their momentum. We have beautiful new collections, which include the Le Vian Ombre exclusive, which is pictured here, which is exclusive in Jared, on the slide. Also all eyes are on the ear this fourth quarter as we continue to drive the trend in earrings, earring climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our Radiant Reflections and our Endless Brilliance collections, which create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings. 
In all of our Jared stores, we have reset our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores or boutiques managed by our PANDORA specialists. We are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry, including exclusive products and exclusive collections. And it's all supported with new TV advertising creative. 
The new Chosen Diamond is now in all Jared stores also, which shows customers each stage of a diamond's journey, from a rough diamond to a finished piece of beautiful jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer, who tends to value this type of product and information. We also designed a brand-new TV ad to support the Chosen. We significantly improved websites for Kay and Jared, which incorporates fully responsive design to work seamlessly across all devices. We also significantly increased investment in digital marketing across all of our channels and all of our store banners with more effective targeting and personalization than ever before. 
And lastly, we have many targeted marketing plans tying in the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media. You can get a great sense of the powerful motion behind each of our store banners' TV advertisings by viewing them at signetjewelers.com. Just click on the Media Center and you'll see our ads.
Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I will focus on a few very high-level points. As you can imagine, this is a very intense and complex process to analyze. We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. But we must make a thoughtfully analyzed decision, taking into account near-term and long-term economics as well as our ability to continue serving our customers. We are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio. And we are confident that we will deliver shareholder value regardless of the direction that we choose. Importantly, we are pleased with the interest expressed by several different financial institutions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Michele."

All right, so let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relati",2140,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right, so let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relatively small size of the quarter, this can have some distortion on our ratios. Now with that in mind, I'll cover our operating performance, starting with sales. 
For the third quarter, Signet's comps decreased 2% against an increase of 3.3% in  the prior year third quarter. And that compares to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 7.5%. Of our comp sales decline, about 80 basis points was driven by oil and gas-reliant regions. Total Signet sales decreased 2.5%. And on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 0.5% for the quarter. 
Sales on an operating segment basis were as follows. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 2.9% to $712 million. Comp sales decreased 3.8% compared to an increase of 3.5% last year and compared to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 10.3%. Sales weakness was more pronounced in the noncore regional store brands, Jared to a lesser extent and energy-dependent regional economies across all store banners. Fashion jewelry, including select branded diamond jewelry, performed relatively better than the rest of the merchandise portfolio. 
From a channel perspective, outlets and eComm performed a little better than the rest of the selling channels. The Zale Jewelry operating segment's total sales increased 0.2% to $282 million. And that was flat on a constant currency exchange basis. Comps were down 1.4% against a 2-year comp rate of 0.7%. 
On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. total sales increased 0.3% while comps decreased 1.5%. And that compares to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 0.7%. In Canada, total sales declined 0.4% or 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Canadian comp sales declined 0.9% against a 2-year comp rate of 0.3%. For the Zale Jewelry operating segment, the modest increase in total sales was driven primarily by select diamond jewelry collections with fashion jewelry in total slightly outperforming bridal. Q3 results in both U.S. and Canada were also unfavorably impacted by energy-dependent reliant regions. 
Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 11.3% to $53 million with comp sales of 9.5% on top of a 10% comp rate last year and a 2-year comp rate of 8.5%. Sales increases in Pagoda were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. In the U.K., our total sales decreased 12.8% to $130 million but increased 4.2% at constant currency rates. Comps sales grew 3.6% on top of a 4.1% in the prior year and a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 7.8%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the U.K. comp sales increases. 
So moving on to Signet's consolidated and adjusted results. On Slide 9, we're continuing to present this reconciliation through the end of fiscal year '17 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting as well as IT implementation expenses associated with global systems that will drive future efficiencies and cost benefits. The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration cost. 
So starting in the lower left portion of the slide. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.20. Our third quarter EPS benefited by $0.02 due to a lower tax rate of 12.4% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 31.5%. The Q3 rate is attributed to a lower annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017, which I'll discuss further prior to wrapping up my commentary. 
In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.03 of EPS dilution. This was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration costs, which relate to consulting costs related information technology implementations. Integration costs were responsible for $0.07 of EPS dilution. On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.10 worth of adjustment, our adjusted EPS was $0.30 for the third quarter. 
So looking below the sales line of Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $352.5 million or 29.6% of adjusted sales, down 100 basis points. The lower rate was due principally to lower sales, higher bad debt expense and deleverage on store occupancy. And this was partially offset by favorable merchandise cost and merchandise mix. Adjusted SG&A was $377.3 million, down $10.3 million. The rate was 31.7%, which is flat to prior year rate. The decline in dollars and steady rate was driven by lower variable compensation and a few other factors, which I'll elaborate momentarily. 
Other operating income was $68.6 million or 5.8% of sales. This increase of $7.7 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income was $43.8 million, down 7%. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 3.7%, which is down 20 basis points due primarily to lower top line. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.30, which compares to $0.33 last year, a decrease of $0.03 or 9.1%. 
So moving on, we'll take a closer look at SG&A. Our teams continue to focus on cost control and savings. Our SG&A expense declined $10.3 million, as I mentioned, or 2.7% in the third quarter. Although the dollar reduction in SG&A wasn't quite enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volume, it does reflect prudent use of expenses nonetheless. Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll. 
Our store and corporate payroll declined due in part to a variety of factors, which also include lower variable compensation, which flexes with sales, and a lower corporate incentive compensation; a onetime accrual reversal that I had briefly mentioned on our last quarter call related to harmonization of Signet's compensated absence policies; and lower merchant fees in the Zale credit program. Also embedded throughout SG&A is favorability from foreign exchange. Our Q3 advertising expense was also slightly lower. And that's due primarily to a timing shift to spend out of Q3 to postelection period in Q4. Other expenses increased, driven predominantly by information technology projects. 
So moving off the P&L, we'll hit a few balance sheet highlights before touching on capital considerations and guidance. Our strong third quarter ending inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at $2.6 billion. Our teams did a good job of managing inventory levels in a slower sales environment. 
The decline of 2.8% in inventory compared 30 basis points favorably to Signet's decline in total sales of 2.5%. We saw sound, prudent management of inventory across categories and divisions. And it's worth noting, the Zale division inventory declined at a faster rate than Signet overall. This is directly related to the synergy-producing initiative that Mark previously discussed, which we call our inventory turnover improvement. Finally, Signet benefited from foreign exchange on inventory procured in currencies other than the relatively strong U.S. dollar. 
So now let's move on and turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our third quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $476 million. And that's down 2.3%. Although lower, the in-house credit sales were more favorable than the division's total sales decline, and therefore, gained relative share in the mix of tender. In-house credit participation was 66.8%, up 40 basis points. This was due to faster growth and higher spending among our highest-quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in the credit sales mix within our best credit tiers. 
The average monthly payment collection rate for the third quarter fiscal 2017 was 10.6% compared to 11.1% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix and an increase in the average transaction value of what is getting financed. As a result, monthly payments are higher in dollars but lower as a percent of balances, thereby resulting in higher receivables outstanding to be collected. With that said, our credit plan mix is driving a higher FICO score customer with the rollout of our 36-month bridal plan to select customers. The combination of collection rate decline and a growth in credit participation contributed to an increase in our accounts receivable of $109 million or 8% to $1.55 billion. 
Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other operating income line on our income statement, was $67 million compared to $61.3 million last year. The increase of $5.7 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. Of our net bad debt it -- was $57.2 million compared to $53.1 million last year. As a percent of receivables, the nearly flat bad debt allowance, which you'll see on the next slide in just a minute, was driven primarily by low receivable growth, which was a symptom of the overall sales decline. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $9.8 million. And that's up $1.6 million. 
So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful account metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 7.9% in the third quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points from the prior year was driven by a variety of nearly offsetting factors. The impact of lower sales leading to lower receivables growth as well as a lingering effect from the Q2 IT glitch slightly offset the impact of higher-quality new borrowers. On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 50 basis points, the same as prior year, reflecting seasonality changes. For the nonperforming portion of our receivables, as a percent of the gross AR, Q3 was 4.9%. This was flat to last year and better by 10 basis points on a sequential basis. 
In summary, we remain confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance based on the visibility that we have into our daily collections, weekly roll rates and other key performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings. 
So just a few highlights in terms of our capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 10 million shares of our common stock, albeit all of our Q3 activity was related to offsetting dilution from our preferred stock issuance. As mentioned in the release, our buyback activity is in line with our expectations and our $525 million accelerated share repurchase program is continuing. 
Regarding cash and borrowings. The significant increase in free cash generation was driven primarily by favorable changes to working capital and higher net income. Separately, we borrowed from our revolving credit facility for seasonal working capital needs during Q3. This was normal activity and also within our expectations. 
Finally, our capital allocation policies remain unchanged. Signet maintains a balanced approach to investing in the growth of its business as well as returning capital to our shareholders via growing dividend and share repurchases. 
So with that, let's turn to our financial guidance. As Mark indicated, our fourth quarter guidance is consistent with the guidance implied on our August call. Signet's fourth quarter comparable store sales are expected to decrease between 2% to 4%. We feel well prepared and focused for the fourth quarter in what remains a relatively uncertain environment. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $4 to $4.20. The weighted average common shares outstanding is expected to be about 76 million. The increase in our fourth quarter shares from third quarter is driven by the inclusion of the effect of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion of our preferred security. In the third quarter, these shares were anti-dilutive, and therefore, were not in the calculation. 
EPS guidance for both Q4 and the full year implies a flow-through of synergies, general cost controls and higher finance income, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Below the operating profit line, our earnings per share guidance also is favorably impacted by: first, a lower tax rate of 25% to 26% due primarily to profit mix; and secondly, fewer shares from repurchase activity in the first half. The fiscal year earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increase in guidance are attributed solely to the third quarter actual results exceeding our previous expectations. 
Again, we are reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. That means the $60 million from last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

And Michele, you did a great job kind of giving us the parameters around 3Q being a smaller quarter. But it seems like this bodes really well for fourth quarter. If you could just help us understand how we should think about expectations for fourth quarter relative to what you just printed, which was a better comp for third quarter, that would be helpful."

So on the energy front, and you could see from our Q2 results compared to Q3 that we did ease up in terms of the comp impact in the energy-reliant. In terms of how that plays out going forward that's, I guess, anyone's speculation. But we are going to start getting into territory that we're comping. And I think it was a good sign that what we saw from Q3 compared to Q2 eased up a little bit. From a real estate perspective, we're not at a point that we're ready to guide what next year's square footage space is. But with that said, I would go back to we are a growth company. And in terms of how we're going to achieve that growth, it really is through organic growth or to the potential that we see acquisitions that fit well within our core. So that should obviously imply that we expect our square footage to continue to grow into next year, at least comparable to what you see in terms of the guide this year, that 3% to 3.5% of square footage space growth. And then on the Zale synergies, I'm not going to get ahead of ourselves on the Zale synergies. We're very confident in terms of achieving our $225 million to $250 million synergy range by the end of next year. We'll continue as we go through the synergies. There's a list, a significant list of initiatives that we're continuing to work through. But I think it'd be premature to start calling out if there's anything incremental or if there's new buckets to add to it."

I would like to start by discussing some of our key points that we would like you to take away from our third quarter financial results presentation. While we are never pleased with lower year-over-year results, our sales and earnings exceeded our expectations. In a challenging environment, our team delivered some solid results, especially in the fashion jewelry categories, our outlet locations, our online business, our U.K. stores and finally, our kiosk business. 
We also managed our SG&A and inventory well, which not only helped earnings but also increased our free cash flow substantially year-over-year. We initiated fourth quarter guidance consistent with our thinking in August. That is when we gave fiscal year and third quarter guidance on our August call, we obviously implied a fourth quarter guide. And today, we are formally guiding the fourth quarter consistent with our thinking back in August. Our fiscal year earnings guidance is updated to reflect only the flow-through of our third quarter earnings. 
Our Zale division delivered a variety of wins in the third quarter. Our sales increased on an inventory decrease, which was driven in part by our continued focus on our integration efforts. Piercing Pagoda delivered nearly a 10% comp sales gain. We saw unfavorable impact to sales less [ph] than in energy regions, where the Zale division stores have a large presence. And lastly and perhaps most importantly, our holiday season initiatives are numerous, well tested, and our team members are well trained and prepared to deliver a wonderful customer experience. 
Now let's get into some more detail behind these high-level takeaways. We achieved some wins in the third quarter starting with the diamond fashion jewelry category. Our Ever Us 2-stone diamond jewelry collection produced significantly more sales year-over-year. We also saw contributions from bracelets as we continued to lean into the bracelet trend of stacking with fresh looks and innovative fastening systems in both branded and non-branded collections. And our earrings of all types are resonating with customers, including the growing trend in earring climbers. 
Third quarter sales were also driven in part by select bridal collections. Vera Wang and Neil Lane led the way, and a variety of other bridal collections also contributed. We continue to drive forward on our omnichannel initiatives to deliver a seamless experience to our customers. In the third quarter, our omnichannel selling approach continued to deliver results. Our eCommerce sales increased. But more importantly, we continued to connect with our customers through an enhanced digital experience. 
Our new clienteling system was launched in our Kay and Jared locations. The system provides a single view of the customer with the capability to holistically capture customer information. This enables our team members to improve their interactions with customers before, during and after their visits to our stores or our sites. We've also broadened our affiliate marketing relationships with other retail shopping sites. 
And finally, the diversity of our real estate footprint served us well. The U.K. division delivered a 3.6% comp sales increase. Outlets were up, too, with very broad-based gains. And Piercing Pagoda delivered strong results in diamond and gold jewelry. And we continue to see growth opportunities in the children's jewelry classification. 
In the third quarter, our team did a nice job of continuing to drive synergies on the Zale integration. To review, a synergy, as we define it, is a net contribution to operating profit. I won't go into depth on each of the examples listed here on Slide 5 and the work stream detail behind each one. But as you can see, we have got a lot of energy, a lot of activity going on to fully optimize the business operation. 
Due to the synergy work being done on our Zale division store inventories, they're operating on a much more productive basis, which is assisting in increasing our free cash flow. We also continue to enhance our organizational structure and this has led to leaner, more efficient teams delivering consistent execution of processes. Some of the departments that have streamlined operations are human resources, eCommerce, inventory management, real estate, legal, finance, supply date [ph] and distribution and repair. These are just some examples of the many other projects that are positioning us well to build upon our long history of growth and improving profitability. 
Now let's discuss the fourth quarter, where we have historically made about half of our annual profit. As I mentioned, the team is prepared and focused on the opportunities in front of us. And we are ready to serve and delight our customers. This is the season when our competitive positioning and our ability to invest in growth-enhancing, innovative new products and initiatives really allow Signet to capture a profitable market share. 
One of our biggest initiatives is year 2 of the Ever Us collection. In our experience, beacon or industry trend-driving strategies like this tend to perform even better in their second year as compared to their first. We are selling additional jewelry categories and styles, higher carat weights and more inventory supported with greater digital, print, social and TV marketing of the Ever Us collection. 
We also expanded the Vera Wang LOVE bridal collection into the fashion jewelry category in Zales. This collection includes diamond jewelry as well as pearls supported with new in-store displays. Zale is also introducing the new iconic Vera Wang Kindred Heart collection. 
This holiday season, bracelets are sure to continue their momentum. We have beautiful new collections, which include the Le Vian Ombre exclusive, which is pictured here, which is exclusive in Jared, on the slide. Also all eyes are on the ear this fourth quarter as we continue to drive the trend in earrings, earring climbers, studs and hoops. We also see a lot of promise in our Radiant Reflections and our Endless Brilliance collections, which create bigger looks with smaller stones and innovative settings. 
In all of our Jared stores, we have reset our PANDORA presentation with beautiful new PANDORA store-in-stores or boutiques managed by our PANDORA specialists. We are selling a broader collection of PANDORA products and fashion jewelry, including exclusive products and exclusive collections. And it's all supported with new TV advertising creative. 
The new Chosen Diamond is now in all Jared stores also, which shows customers each stage of a diamond's journey, from a rough diamond to a finished piece of beautiful jewelry. This is in total alignment with the Jared customer, who tends to value this type of product and information. We also designed a brand-new TV ad to support the Chosen. We significantly improved websites for Kay and Jared, which incorporates fully responsive design to work seamlessly across all devices. We also significantly increased investment in digital marketing across all of our channels and all of our store banners with more effective targeting and personalization than ever before. 
And lastly, we have many targeted marketing plans tying in the 100th anniversary of Kay Jewelers. We have contests, promotions and awareness campaigns using all forms of media. You can get a great sense of the powerful motion behind each of our store banners' TV advertisings by viewing them at signetjewelers.com. Just click on the Media Center and you'll see our ads.
Now moving on to the strategic review of our credit portfolio. I will focus on a few very high-level points. As you can imagine, this is a very intense and complex process to analyze. We are motivated to move as quickly and as prudently as possible in order to remove uncertainty around this issue for all of our constituencies. But we must make a thoughtfully analyzed decision, taking into account near-term and long-term economics as well as our ability to continue serving our customers. We are analyzing opportunities to create shareholder value by optimizing or monetizing our credit portfolio. And we are confident that we will deliver shareholder value regardless of the direction that we choose. Importantly, we are pleased with the interest expressed by several different financial institutions. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to Michele."
693964,382507318,1090916,"Signet Jewelers Limited, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Signet Jewelers Limited","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right, so let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relati",2140,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. All right, so let me just start by putting the third quarter in perspective. Our third quarter represents less than 20% of sales and about 5% of operating profit on an annual basis. So as a result of the relatively small size of the quarter, this can have some distortion on our ratios. Now with that in mind, I'll cover our operating performance, starting with sales. 
For the third quarter, Signet's comps decreased 2% against an increase of 3.3% in  the prior year third quarter. And that compares to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 7.5%. Of our comp sales decline, about 80 basis points was driven by oil and gas-reliant regions. Total Signet sales decreased 2.5%. And on a constant exchange basis, total sales decreased 0.5% for the quarter. 
Sales on an operating segment basis were as follows. In Sterling Jewelers, total sales declined 2.9% to $712 million. Comp sales decreased 3.8% compared to an increase of 3.5% last year and compared to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 10.3%. Sales weakness was more pronounced in the noncore regional store brands, Jared to a lesser extent and energy-dependent regional economies across all store banners. Fashion jewelry, including select branded diamond jewelry, performed relatively better than the rest of the merchandise portfolio. 
From a channel perspective, outlets and eComm performed a little better than the rest of the selling channels. The Zale Jewelry operating segment's total sales increased 0.2% to $282 million. And that was flat on a constant currency exchange basis. Comps were down 1.4% against a 2-year comp rate of 0.7%. 
On a geographic basis, our Zale U.S. total sales increased 0.3% while comps decreased 1.5%. And that compares to a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 0.7%. In Canada, total sales declined 0.4% or 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Canadian comp sales declined 0.9% against a 2-year comp rate of 0.3%. For the Zale Jewelry operating segment, the modest increase in total sales was driven primarily by select diamond jewelry collections with fashion jewelry in total slightly outperforming bridal. Q3 results in both U.S. and Canada were also unfavorably impacted by energy-dependent reliant regions. 
Piercing Pagoda total sales increased 11.3% to $53 million with comp sales of 9.5% on top of a 10% comp rate last year and a 2-year comp rate of 8.5%. Sales increases in Pagoda were driven primarily by gold chains and diamond jewelry. In the U.K., our total sales decreased 12.8% to $130 million but increased 4.2% at constant currency rates. Comps sales grew 3.6% on top of a 4.1% in the prior year and a 2-year comp hurdle rate of 7.8%. Diamond jewelry and prestige watches were the primary drivers of the U.K. comp sales increases. 
So moving on to Signet's consolidated and adjusted results. On Slide 9, we're continuing to present this reconciliation through the end of fiscal year '17 to reflect the impacts of purchase accounting as well as IT implementation expenses associated with global systems that will drive future efficiencies and cost benefits. The difference between Signet and adjusted Signet are in the columns reflecting purchase accounting and integration cost. 
So starting in the lower left portion of the slide. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.20. Our third quarter EPS benefited by $0.02 due to a lower tax rate of 12.4% compared to the prior year quarter rate of 31.5%. The Q3 rate is attributed to a lower annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017, which I'll discuss further prior to wrapping up my commentary. 
In the next column over, purchase accounting adjustments were worth $0.03 of EPS dilution. This was driven primarily by deferred revenue adjustments related to acquisition accounting. The next column over reflects our integration costs, which relate to consulting costs related information technology implementations. Integration costs were responsible for $0.07 of EPS dilution. On an adjusted Signet basis, in the far right column, by adding back the $0.10 worth of adjustment, our adjusted EPS was $0.30 for the third quarter. 
So looking below the sales line of Signet's adjusted P&L results. Our adjusted gross margin was $352.5 million or 29.6% of adjusted sales, down 100 basis points. The lower rate was due principally to lower sales, higher bad debt expense and deleverage on store occupancy. And this was partially offset by favorable merchandise cost and merchandise mix. Adjusted SG&A was $377.3 million, down $10.3 million. The rate was 31.7%, which is flat to prior year rate. The decline in dollars and steady rate was driven by lower variable compensation and a few other factors, which I'll elaborate momentarily. 
Other operating income was $68.6 million or 5.8% of sales. This increase of $7.7 million was due principally to higher interest income earned from higher outstanding receivable balances. Adjusted operating income was $43.8 million, down 7%. Our adjusted operating margin rate was 3.7%, which is down 20 basis points due primarily to lower top line. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.30, which compares to $0.33 last year, a decrease of $0.03 or 9.1%. 
So moving on, we'll take a closer look at SG&A. Our teams continue to focus on cost control and savings. Our SG&A expense declined $10.3 million, as I mentioned, or 2.7% in the third quarter. Although the dollar reduction in SG&A wasn't quite enough to leverage our SG&A rate on lower sales volume, it does reflect prudent use of expenses nonetheless. Within SG&A, the biggest expense component is payroll. 
Our store and corporate payroll declined due in part to a variety of factors, which also include lower variable compensation, which flexes with sales, and a lower corporate incentive compensation; a onetime accrual reversal that I had briefly mentioned on our last quarter call related to harmonization of Signet's compensated absence policies; and lower merchant fees in the Zale credit program. Also embedded throughout SG&A is favorability from foreign exchange. Our Q3 advertising expense was also slightly lower. And that's due primarily to a timing shift to spend out of Q3 to postelection period in Q4. Other expenses increased, driven predominantly by information technology projects. 
So moving off the P&L, we'll hit a few balance sheet highlights before touching on capital considerations and guidance. Our strong third quarter ending inventory position reflects the success of our continued focus on inventory optimization. Net inventory ended the period at $2.6 billion. Our teams did a good job of managing inventory levels in a slower sales environment. 
The decline of 2.8% in inventory compared 30 basis points favorably to Signet's decline in total sales of 2.5%. We saw sound, prudent management of inventory across categories and divisions. And it's worth noting, the Zale division inventory declined at a faster rate than Signet overall. This is directly related to the synergy-producing initiative that Mark previously discussed, which we call our inventory turnover improvement. Finally, Signet benefited from foreign exchange on inventory procured in currencies other than the relatively strong U.S. dollar. 
So now let's move on and turn our attention to our in-house credit metrics and statistics. Our third quarter in-house credit sales in the Sterling division were $476 million. And that's down 2.3%. Although lower, the in-house credit sales were more favorable than the division's total sales decline, and therefore, gained relative share in the mix of tender. In-house credit participation was 66.8%, up 40 basis points. This was due to faster growth and higher spending among our highest-quality cohorts. As a result, we continue to see growth in the credit sales mix within our best credit tiers. 
The average monthly payment collection rate for the third quarter fiscal 2017 was 10.6% compared to 11.1% last year. Our monthly collection rate is calculated as cash payment received divided by beginning accounts receivable. The decline in the collection rate is due principally to credit plan mix and an increase in the average transaction value of what is getting financed. As a result, monthly payments are higher in dollars but lower as a percent of balances, thereby resulting in higher receivables outstanding to be collected. With that said, our credit plan mix is driving a higher FICO score customer with the rollout of our 36-month bridal plan to select customers. The combination of collection rate decline and a growth in credit participation contributed to an increase in our accounts receivable of $109 million or 8% to $1.55 billion. 
Interest income for finance charges, which makes up virtually all of the other operating income line on our income statement, was $67 million compared to $61.3 million last year. The increase of $5.7 million was due primarily to more interest income on the higher outstanding receivables base. Of our net bad debt it -- was $57.2 million compared to $53.1 million last year. As a percent of receivables, the nearly flat bad debt allowance, which you'll see on the next slide in just a minute, was driven primarily by low receivable growth, which was a symptom of the overall sales decline. The net impact of bad debt and finance income generated operating profit of $9.8 million. And that's up $1.6 million. 
So now let me take you through some of the key Sterling division allowance for doubtful account metrics. Our total valuation allowance as a percent of gross receivables was 7.9% in the third quarter. The slight increase of 10 basis points from the prior year was driven by a variety of nearly offsetting factors. The impact of lower sales leading to lower receivables growth as well as a lingering effect from the Q2 IT glitch slightly offset the impact of higher-quality new borrowers. On a sequential basis, the ratio was up 50 basis points, the same as prior year, reflecting seasonality changes. For the nonperforming portion of our receivables, as a percent of the gross AR, Q3 was 4.9%. This was flat to last year and better by 10 basis points on a sequential basis. 
In summary, we remain confident in our ongoing credit portfolio performance based on the visibility that we have into our daily collections, weekly roll rates and other key performing metrics. Our portfolio continues to enable responsible and profitable growth of our merchandise sales and earnings. 
So just a few highlights in terms of our capital allocation. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 10 million shares of our common stock, albeit all of our Q3 activity was related to offsetting dilution from our preferred stock issuance. As mentioned in the release, our buyback activity is in line with our expectations and our $525 million accelerated share repurchase program is continuing. 
Regarding cash and borrowings. The significant increase in free cash generation was driven primarily by favorable changes to working capital and higher net income. Separately, we borrowed from our revolving credit facility for seasonal working capital needs during Q3. This was normal activity and also within our expectations. 
Finally, our capital allocation policies remain unchanged. Signet maintains a balanced approach to investing in the growth of its business as well as returning capital to our shareholders via growing dividend and share repurchases. 
So with that, let's turn to our financial guidance. As Mark indicated, our fourth quarter guidance is consistent with the guidance implied on our August call. Signet's fourth quarter comparable store sales are expected to decrease between 2% to 4%. We feel well prepared and focused for the fourth quarter in what remains a relatively uncertain environment. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be $4 to $4.20. The weighted average common shares outstanding is expected to be about 76 million. The increase in our fourth quarter shares from third quarter is driven by the inclusion of the effect of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion of our preferred security. In the third quarter, these shares were anti-dilutive, and therefore, were not in the calculation. 
EPS guidance for both Q4 and the full year implies a flow-through of synergies, general cost controls and higher finance income, partially offset by unfavorable FX. Below the operating profit line, our earnings per share guidance also is favorably impacted by: first, a lower tax rate of 25% to 26% due primarily to profit mix; and secondly, fewer shares from repurchase activity in the first half. The fiscal year earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share increase in guidance are attributed solely to the third quarter actual results exceeding our previous expectations. 
Again, we are reaffirming the multiyear synergy guidance. In fiscal 2017, we intend to deliver $158 million to $175 million cumulatively. That means the $60 million from last year plus another $98 million to $115 million this fiscal year. Then by the end of fiscal 2018, we expect to deliver $225 million to $250 million of cumulative synergies. 
That concludes my prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark."

So on the energy front, and you could see from our Q2 results compared to Q3 that we did ease up in terms of the comp impact in the energy-reliant. In terms of how that plays out going forward that's, I guess, anyone's speculation. But we are going to start getting into territory that we're comping. And I think it was a good sign that what we saw from Q3 compared to Q2 eased up a little bit. From a real estate perspective, we're not at a point that we're ready to guide what next year's square footage space is. But with that said, I would go back to we are a growth company. And in terms of how we're going to achieve that growth, it really is through organic growth or to the potential that we see acquisitions that fit well within our core. So that should obviously imply that we expect our square footage to continue to grow into next year, at least comparable to what you see in terms of the guide this year, that 3% to 3.5% of square footage space growth. And then on the Zale synergies, I'm not going to get ahead of ourselves on the Zale synergies. We're very confident in terms of achieving our $225 million to $250 million synergy range by the end of next year. We'll continue as we go through the synergies.
