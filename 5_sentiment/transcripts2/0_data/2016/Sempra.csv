Before discussing the quarter, I would like to say a few words about the natural gas leak at our Aliso Canyon storage facility. On February 18, the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, or DOGGR, confirmed that the leaking well was permanently sealed. Our focus since the beginning has been safely stopping the leak, reducing the order from the well, reducing the amount of natural gas being emitted into the environment, working cooperatively with agencies and elected officials, and supporting local residents including providing temporary housing and air filtration systems. Now that we have stopped the leak, an independent investigation of the root cause will be conducted. I want to emphasize that providing safe and reliable service to our customers is the highest priority for SoCalGas. We will continue to work with our regulators and customers to ensure our path ahead reflects these values. 
Later, I will provide more information on Aliso Canyon and Dennis and Martha are also here to address your questions. 
Turning to our financial performance. In 2015, we had very strong results and exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance. This morning, we reported full year earnings of $5.37 per share or $5.21 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2015 results were driven largely by growth in operating earnings at our California Utilities and Sempra International.
In addition, our board approved an increase in the 2016 dividend to $3.02 per share. This payout represents an 8% annual increase and provides dividend growth that more closely aligns with the 11% annual increase in our 2015 adjusted earnings. Moreover, we are targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years to better align our dividend growth with our projected EPS growth. Our dividend strategy is underpinned by confidence in our future cash flows and supports our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.
Regarding 2016 earnings. We have updated our assumptions and are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 per share to $5.20 per share. When compared with the 2015 results, we forecast a higher effective tax rate for 2016. In part, this is due to a large number of benefits recorded last year that related to the resolution of tax matters. 
Also, as we move into the new GRC cycle at our California Utilities, we will now be providing an estimated $60 million of repair allowance tax benefits to ratepayers as part of the standard rate case true up. In our 2016 adjusted guidance, we assumed that we retain all repair allowance benefits for tax years preceding our new GRC. Key updates and comparisons to the 2016 guidance we provided at last year's analyst conference reflects several other factors, notably, we include our best estimate of the GRC decision for the California Utilities based on our settlement agreement, as well as new market assumptions for commodities and foreign exchange rates that have changed considerably since last year. Additionally, our adjusted guidance range now includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of estimated LNG development expense. 
Regarding transactions we announced last year that were added into our base plan, such as the potential PEMEX acquisition and new renewable contract, we expect the earnings impact to largely occur in 2017 and beyond. 
Please note that our proposed GRC settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval and we do not anticipate receiving a final decision until the second quarter. 
We have moved our analyst conference to May in order to incorporate an expected final GRC decision. And we'll provide you with our business unit guidance and longer-term projections at that time. Overall, we are well-positioned to achieve our long-term strategy of providing earnings growth that is twice that of the average utility, but with a moderate risk profile. Combined with strong anticipated growth in the dividend, we are focused on providing top-tier shareholder return. 
Now please turn to Slide 5. This slide summarizes the key assumptions included in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance. And we'll briefly discuss each item and you can find additional detail in the appendix. 
First, as I mentioned earlier, this year, we include development cost for our LNG and liquefaction in related infrastructure opportunities. In 2015, we had about $10 million of similar expense that was excluded from adjusted guidance due to uncertainty about the nature and timing of these costs. Given progress on the projects, and our estimates and the spin rate and the amounts capitalized and shared with partners, we now include a 2016 after-tax expense of roughly $0.08 to $0.10 per share. Please note, however, that the vast majority of planned expense is targeted for Port Arthur and related infrastructure as we have already incurred most of the upfront cost for Cameron expansion. Going forward, we will be sharing cost for Port Arthur with our partner Woodside. We will nevertheless monitor our progress in securing market commitments and other needed approvals to advance the project. To the extent our progress is slower than expected, we will adjust our spending accordingly.
Next, we have seen a significant decline in natural gas price forecast over the past year. Specifically, the Cal border 2016 forward curve has fallen from $3.60 in our prior guidance to $2.60 on our new adjusted guidance. The impact from this assumption is a reduction in earnings of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share that is associated with the LNG marketing contract from our ICA Import Facility in Mexico. 
Third, we reduced projected earnings from the TDM power plant due to the lower power places and lower expected capacity revenue. This month, IEnova decided to hold the asset for sale. The sale would complete our exit from merchant generation and allow IEnova to deploy capital in projects that provide more stable earnings. 
While we project approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share of reduced earnings associated with TDM, we do not consider any potential gain or loss from the sale in our adjusted guidance. 
Moving to parent. We assumed that we will use dividends from Mexico to participate in a potential IEnova equity offering. We forecast a 2016 earnings benefit from lower repatriation tax expense of between $0.08 and $0.10 per share. Offsetting this impact is an estimated $0.04 per share after tax of higher interest expense to fund projects in our base plan. 
Next, like natural gas prices, we have seen exchange rate forecasts move significantly over the past year. Relative to our previous guidance, our current forecast is for the dollar to strengthen in 2016 by an additional 20% against the Chilean currency and by an additional 13% against the Peruvian currency. Projected earnings are reduced by roughly $0.09 to $0.11 per share as a result of translating South American earnings into dollars.
In Mexico, we have not previously forecast the impact of foreign currency effects. We now include in our adjusted guidance a reduction in tax expense associated with peso depreciation during 2016. Based upon the forward curve at year end, we estimate this benefit to be approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share. 
With regard to IEnova's acquisition of PEMEX, it's ownership and their share joint venture, Mexico's Competition Commission has required PEMEX to competitively auction 2 assets included in the original transaction. IEnova is negotiating changes to the original agreement with PEMEX that will reflect the auction outcome among other things. Our adjusted guidance assumes that the transaction moves forward with the same assets enclosed in the second quarter of the 2016. Based on this timing, we assume an estimated $0.02 of accretion this year. Our adjusted guidance excludes however any potential gain associated with a remeasurement of our investment in the joint venture.
In our renewables business, we incorporate new forecast for wind resource and availability that reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. However, our base plan now includes 328 megawatts of additional projects announced last year that are under construction. Given that these projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016, we expect to see the full earnings impact beginning in 2017.
Finally, for the California Utilities, our prior guidance was based on a very conservative assumption that revenues would be based on our current attrition mechanism with no further adjustment. Our new adjusted guidance range includes projected earnings that more closely align with the GRC settlement agreement and our best estimate of the outcome given the record in the preceding. 
Now let's go to Slide 6 for a business update, beginning with the California Utilities. In our general rate case, we are currently expecting to see a proposed decision in March and to receive a final decision in the second quarter. As you recall, we reached a multiparty settlement agreement with major parties in the case. Until we get a final GRC position, we will record revenues based upon the authorized revenue requirement in 2015. When we receive the final decision, we will make an adjustment to reflect the retroactive earnings back to January 1, 2016. 
Turning to Aliso Canyon. We have received confirmation from DOGGR, the California agency responsible for regulating gas storage, that the leaking well has been permanently sealed. We have approximately 15 BCF of natural gas in the storage field and the field is stable. Moving forward, an independent engineering firm has been selected by DOGGR and the CPUC to investigate the root cause of the leak. While we do not know how long this process will take, we will cooperate on the investigation and share publicly available data.
Consistent with new rules under development, we are implementing enhanced leak detection and well inspection activities. We are also working cooperatively with all of the agencies involved to determine a path forward for the facility which is regarded as integral to the reliability of the electric grid in California. 
Reflecting the most up-to-date information, which primarily includes revised temporary relocation and well drilling expenses, we now estimate the total cost for amounts paid and those forecast to be paid to be approximately $330 million. Of this amount, approximately 90% is for the temporary relocation program, cost to address the leak and attempts to stop or reduce the emission. The remaining amount includes, among other items, the value of lost gas and estimated cost to mitigate the GHG emissions. For the estimate, we assume that the relocation period for the majority of residents ended on February 25, as agreed upon with the City of Los Angeles. We have concluded, it is probable that we will receive insurance recovery for the total amount less retention of $325 million.
Beyond this estimate, we cannot predict all of the potential categories or total amount of future costs that we may incur as a result of the leak. We have at least 4 types of insurance policies that provide an excess of $1 billion in insurance coverage. Based upon what we know today, and subject to various policy limits, exclusions and conditions, we believe that our insurance should also cover the following categories not included in our estimates, costs associated with litigation and claims by nearby residents and businesses, and in some circumstances, depending upon their nature and matter of assessment, fines and penalties. I refer you to our 10-K for further detail. 
Please turn to Slide 7. In Mexico, CFE is tendering several more gas pipelines. IEnova submitted a bid for 1 pipeline earlier this month, is in process of submitting a bid for second and is preparing to submit a third bid in March. According to CFE estimates, the 3 pipelines represent an investment opportunity of almost $2 billion and we expect award dates to occur in March and April. 
This spring, IEnova is also preparing to participate in Mexico's first auction, a renewable energy certificate. IEnova is looking at potential fuller opportunities and may submit a bid to expand the ESJ wind facility with its joint venture partner Intergen. The CFE will be the initial offtaker under 15 to 20-year contracts and total awards could amount to 2,500 megawatts of new power generation.
In our LNG business, there have been 2 noteworthy developments, our Cameron expansion project received its FERC environmental assessment on February 12 and we expect to receive the FERC permit in the second quarter. Though current market conditions are not ideal, Cameron Train 4 is a better competitive offering for long-term buyers. Based on recent meetings with potential customers, we are bypassing the Memorandum of Understanding stage and are in negotiations for definitive 20-year sales and purchase agreements. While a sales and purchase agreement will take longer to execute than an MoU, we are targeting the second half of 2016 for announcing customer agreements needed to launch the project. This approach provides us with greater certainty on project commitments prior to incurring large capital expenditures.
For Port Arthur, yesterday, we signed a joint develop agreement with Woodside Petroleum that outlines development rules in the potential project. In addition to how we will share cost and market capacity, the agreement provides a framework for how we will work together technically to design a cost competitive plant. 
Last month, I was in Australia, meeting with the CEO and senior management of Woodside. And we shared a view that Port Arthur has good market prospects post 2020. Before moving on, remember that we have not incorporated additional LNG or other growth projects in our guidance. We are actively working on development opportunities across our businesses that could provide upside to both our near-term and long-term projections. 
With that, please turn to Slide 8 and Joe will discuss our financial results. Joe?"

Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses",470,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses related to the development of our proposed LNG liquefaction projects. In addition, in October 2015, an agreement was reached with the SONGS insurance provider for a $400 million payment associated with the failure of the replacement theme generators. Of this amount, SDG&E share was $80 million. After reimbursement of legal fees and an allocation of $75 million of net proceeds to the rate payers, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings exclude a $2 million after-tax adjustment to the loss on the SONGS plant closure. 
Full year 2015 earnings totaled $1,349,000,000 or $5.37 per share. This compares to 2014 earnings of $1,161,000,000 or $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2015 earnings were $5.21 per share. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings grew 11%.
Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. 
I will address the key drivers for our consolidated quarterly results now on Slide 9. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter earnings include a $48 million seasonality impact that increased earnings at SoCalGas. Recall that applying seasonality to earnings at SoCalGas does not affect full year results. Instead, this fourth quarter variance offset seasonality impacts during the first 3 quarters of the year.
At parent, we recorded $21 million of lower tax expense, primarily related to favorable resolution of income tax matters and reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico. The lower tax expense at parent, along with lower effective tax rates at the California Utilities, were primary reasons why we exceeded our revised 2015 adjusted guidance that we gave on our third quarter call.
Third, SoCalGas recorded $16 million of higher earnings due to higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses. Then offsetting these factors was $18 million of lower tax expense in South America in 2014 as a result to Peruvian tax reform. 
Now let's conclude, so please turn to Slide 10. Overall, we delivered strong financial results in 2015 and exceeded our adjusted guidance. Solid growth in operating earnings and confidence in our long-term cash flows supported our decision to raise the 2016 dividend. In order to better align over future dividend growth with projected EPS growth, we are now targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years.
Looking ahead over the next 5 years, we continue to anticipate earnings growth around twice the level of our utility sector average. Combined with the strong dividend growth, we aim to provide top-tier total shareholder returns. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have."

If I look at the fundamental building blocks, as you know, our business is based upon long-term contracted and utility assets. And when we lay out our growth rate. The key things that are driving our growth longer term are our Cameron 1 through 3 which are progressing on schedule, on budget and we expect that to come online in 2018, as we've outlined before. Our Mexican pipelines are now, all except for 3 of them, are actually in operation that are contracted. And so, that is going quite well. And then our utility businesses. And the fundamentals of our utility businesses, as you can see from last year's earnings, are very strong. And we would anticipate getting a rate case decision soon. And one reason we want to hold off providing any numeric guidance is we want to get that rate case decision and then be able to go through, as we always do with you, at the analyst meetings, the detail. The other thing that I would just comment on is that in our board felt that there is great visibility to our growth. And since its long-term contracted in utility, they were very comfortable setting an 8% to 9% target for dividend increases over the next several years. And I think that is a really strong statement in our sector to be able to grow your dividend at that kind of rate."

And as you know, given the way we structure our deals on the LNG, we're not just selling cargoes for a price, which would be much easier sell, we're actually putting together deals that deal with low commodity risks and essentially long-term capacity for the liquefaction. So we have to speak a lot to our customers about the upstream conditions, where the gas from, where it's delivered, how it's delivered. And those tend to be more complicated sessions. And as a result, we've all decided to go forward -- it wasn't just us, the customers also decided to go that way.

As far as the importance of Aliso, and just gas storage in general, to both gas and electric reliability. I think it's been very clear with a lot of the comments by both policy and regulatory leaders especially, I mean, from the California Energy Commission as well as the PUC that it's vital that we have safe and reliable gas storage to support not just gas demand, but especially in the Los Angeles basin, electric reliability as well. So we're pleased see that in the visit that the Department of Energy, Secretary [indiscernible] when he came out and visited, he reemphasized the importance of making sure that obviously the facilities are safe, but that we had been back online in order to support both gas and electric reliability. So we know that there is -- as Debbie mentioned, there is a full process that's been approved by DOGGR on their comprehensive safety review. We're working very closely with them on that. There's also some legislation that's been percent had that so far is open to amendments to incorporate the process that DOGGR has laid out.

We are very well-positioned, not only for this new work, but to expand those opportunities and start building laterals into other industrialized areas.

First is, we're obviously, as Debbie mentioned, we're cooperating with the investigation that's being led by DOGGR and the CPUC.

And they're really driving the time schedule there, whatever time it takes for them to do the work and do issue the report, will kind of take it's own path. But as far as getting the deal back into service, as I mentioned, DOGGR has issued its comprehensive safety review that were working on them with. And it's very detailed process of testing and inspecting, and if necessary, repairs. As Debbie mentioned, it really does -- it's very parallel to what we have put in place as far as our SIM program and what were doing from a pilot standpoint. So we're working to expeditiously to implement that. It's hard to tell at this point in time how long it will take us to get through all of the 115 wells. But the way that the program is put together, it does allow us, once we've accomplished a minimum threshold of tests on all the wells, we can start bringing some of the wells on, we don't have to do a complete work on 100% of those, we can isolate or abandon certain wells and bring on other wells at the same time. So yes, we'll be giving further updates on that down the road. I think the key point there is, again, policy makers, the regulators and we're very closely working with all of these so that they understand what could happen both here in the summer and electric reliability standpoint and from a gas standpoint. We're all really working together to make sure that Aliso and all of our gas storage facilities are safe and reliable and they can service our customers. We're also -- there also is an emergency regulation that was put in place by DOGGR that applies to all gas storage facilities, not just Aliso. So we're complying with that as well. And that includes things such as daily pressure reads, testing the wellhead valves and some other procedures that have to be put in place.

We have some really really well run utilities in South America. And over time, those have done extremely well and you can look back to the early 2000s. And they've done very well over time and we like those assets a lot. But they are local currency run companies. And their revenues are in local currencies. And so we've seen a depreciation against the U.S. dollar, because we had to translate those into dollars of about 15% to 20%, since last year's plan. So when we did the 2016 plan last year and showed you a number, those currencies have depreciated 15% to 20%. And there's, to some degrees, some offset in our tariffs because they catch-up over time because we have adjustments in our tariffs. But we've adjusted the revenues or the net earnings from those companies for that change in FX rates from a year ago to the ones we have now. In Mexico, the tax expense I was just referring to a moment ago, that's an annual adjustment, it kind of goes from what was the peso at the beginning of the year to what is it going to be at the end of the year. And I think Debbie mentioned in her remarks that we haven't had this in our planning in the past. And the reason is we're not allowed to under accounting, under GAAP accounting rules, we're not allowed to forecast that. But this year we put it in the plan, because we know that the Mexican peso is forecasted to move about 3.5%. And so we forecasted a change in our tax expense for that 3.5%. And so in 2016, we see a little bit of a loss there. In 2015, we actually had earnings as a result of this. We had $31 million increase at Mexico and a $20 million decrease in South America. So we had $11 million plus. So again, in 2013, 2014, it was neutral, and between 2015 and 2016, it's going to be kind of neutral. These things don't move the needle very much for us, they're pretty small."

If you have a project coming on where there's a market need and that market need grows over time, then that's a very different market that you're going after.

One thing that we need start to look at, is the current market is oversupplied as you indicated, no discussion about that. But we also have a little problem with the current market. We have an oversupplied market and yet the spot cargoes are more expensive than the long-term pricing, which was agreed in the tight market. So the market is broken in its pricing formula and the market is adjusting to it as we speak and will adjust for the next couple of years. But our focus is not the current market. Our focus is that 2020, as Debbie indicated, where you'll see that the current oversupply will be absorbed then there's a shortage, and then fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, these facilities take 5, 6 years to come online once you decide to go forward. And then as a result, we need to make decisions today to meet that demand. It is difficult to make. It's largely very capital investments when a lot of the big players are taking write-downs because of oil, that's the condition where the market is tough. Some of the buyers are confused with the oversupply. But our focus is not the current market. So Globally, believe we're going to switch everything from gas to coal and oil which will increase our current footprint significantly which seems like the wins or the other way around. If you believe that we're going forward not only with the continuous economic growth, but with a change to a lower carbon footprint, then gas is going to play a role not just in the current market but in other markets that are yet to open. One interesting statistic I heard this week at [indiscernible] week was the fact that the lower demand from Korea and Japan was made up by increased demand in Middle East countries and therefore the demand didn't go away. And that was not there in the earlier projections. So globally, where our projects fit, we are comfortable, it is a tough market for people to make decisions when they're under significant pressure. But we think we are offering to the market the lowest cost producing facility for 2020, that's why the interest is there."

Regarding in economics of the the Cameron -- Cameron, pardon me. In the Cameron based projects, we included the $1 billion of the cost of the existing facilities, which is essentially replacement value. So the economics of Cameron in that chart you saw at Analyst Day as well as all the other charts included the value of existing facilities. And so, what we are doing with Woodside and Port Arthur is looking at ways to break some of the paradigms in the industry, keep it as safe and reliable as we wanted to be, as the customers expected to be, but look at ways to reduce cost, just like we found when we did Cameron when we had the lower cost per ton for the Congressional technology liquefaction. We had an even lower price for the expansion of Cameron for trains 4 and 5 and we expect to see similar results for Port Arthur. If we don't find that we can do that, that Port Arthur is not going to go away. We simply believe that the industry has to be going back to a discipline of developing the next lowest marginal cost of supply available in order to be sustainable."

So to the degree that they can use other parties capital. And that would be us, I mean, we'd like to put our capital there. And that they can build the infrastructure that reduces their energy cost that they are moving forward on that basis. And so we think that -- I think it's a struggle for PEMEX with having been reliant on oil revenues.

I think that the -- when we talk about energy reform in Mexico, I think a lot of folks are focused on the reforms of PEMEX. And they haven't seen increases in production and some of the things that they wanted to see from energy reform. And I think that's entirely the fault of $30 oil and very little to do with the reforms. What are coming out of the reforms is the massive amount of it energy infrastructure within the company -- within the country. And that infrastructure is doing exactly what its supposed to do. As Debbie said, it's lowering energy cost, bringing natural gas in the region of the country that didn't have access to it before. It's making it -- it's really making a big difference in lowering electricity costs across the country. And that's working very, very well. And to the extent that low gas -- low oil prices are hindering some of the reforms at PEMEX, I think that again is creating a large opportunity for us, because it increases the need for PEMEX for capital, it gives opportunities for us to look at the assets that they're going to be putting up for sale. And so, from our perspective, I think we think that the reforms are working very much as intended.

This morning, we reported full year earnings of $5.37 per share or $5.21 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2015 results were driven largely by growth in operating earnings at our California Utilities and Sempra International.
In addition, our board approved an increase in the 2016 dividend to $3.02 per share. This payout represents an 8% annual increase and provides dividend growth that more closely aligns with the 11% annual increase in our 2015 adjusted earnings. Moreover, we are targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years to better align our dividend growth with our projected EPS growth. Our dividend strategy is underpinned by confidence in our future cash flows and supports our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.
Regarding 2016 earnings. We have updated our assumptions and are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 per share to $5.20 per share. When compared with the 2015 results, we forecast a higher effective tax rate for 2016. In part, this is due to a large number of benefits recorded last year that related to the resolution of tax matters. 
Also, as we move into the new GRC cycle at our California Utilities, we will now be providing an estimated $60 million of repair allowance tax benefits to ratepayers as part of the standard rate case true-up. In our 2016 adjusted guidance, we assume that we retain all repair allowance benefits for tax years preceding our new GRC. Key updates and comparisons to the 2016 guidance we provided at last year's analyst conference reflects several other factors. Notably, we include our best estimate of the GRC decision for the California Utilities based on our settlement agreement as well as new market assumptions for commodities and foreign exchange rates that have changed considerably since last year. Additionally, our adjusted guidance range now includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of estimated LNG development expense. 
Regarding transactions we announced last year that were additive to our base plan, such as the potential PEMEX acquisition and NEIL renewable contract, we expect the earnings impact to largely occur in 2017 and beyond. 
Please note that our proposed GRC settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval, and we do not anticipate receiving a final decision until the second quarter. We have moved our analyst conference to May in order to incorporate an expected final GRC decision and will provide you with our business unit guidance and longer-term projections at that time. Overall, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term strategy of providing earnings growth that is twice that of the average utility, but with a moderate risk profile. Combined with strong anticipated growth in the dividend, we are focused on providing top-tier shareholder return. 
Now please turn to Slide 5. This slide summarizes the key assumptions included in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance, and we'll briefly discuss each item and you can find additional detail in the appendix. 
First, as I mentioned earlier, this year, we include development cost for our LNG liquefaction and related infrastructure opportunities. In 2015, we had about $10 million of similar expense that was excluded from adjusted guidance due to uncertainty about the nature and timing of these costs. Given progress on the projects and our estimates of the spend rate and amounts capitalized and shared with partners, we now include a 2016 after-tax expense of roughly $0.08 to $0.10 per share. Please note, however, that the vast majority of planned expense is targeted for Port Arthur and related infrastructure, as we have already incurred most of the upfront cost for Cameron expansions. Going forward, we will be sharing cost for Port Arthur with our partner, Woodside. We will nevertheless monitor our progress in securing market commitments and other needed approvals to advance the project. To the extent our progress is slower than expected, we will adjust our spending accordingly.
Next, we have seen a significant decline in natural gas price forecast over the past year. Specifically, the Cal border [ph] 2016 forward curve has fallen from $3.60 in our prior guidance to $2.60 in our new adjusted guidance. The impact from this assumption is a reduction in earnings of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share that is associated with the LNG marketing contract from our ICA import facility in Mexico. 
Third, we reduced projected earnings from the TDM power plant due to lower power places and lower expected capacity revenues. This month, IEnova decided to hold the asset for sale. The sale would complete our exit from merchant generation and allow IEnova to deploy capital in projects that provide more stable earnings. 
While we project approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share of reduced earnings associated with TDM, we do not consider any potential gain or loss from the sale in our adjusted guidance. 
Moving to parent. We assume that we will use dividends from Mexico to participate in a potential IEnova equity offering. We forecast a 2016 earnings benefit from lower repatriation tax expense of between $0.08 and $0.10 per share. Offsetting this impact is an estimated $0.04 per share after tax of higher interest expense to fund projects in our base plan. 
Next, like natural gas prices, we have seen exchange rate forecasts move significantly over the past year. Relative to our previous guidance, our current forecast is for the dollar to strengthen in 2016 by an additional 20% against the Chilean currency and by an additional 13% against the Peruvian currency. Projected earnings are reduced by roughly $0.09 to $0.11 per share as a result of translating South American earnings into dollars.
In Mexico, we have not previously forecast the impact of foreign currency effects. We now include in our adjusted guidance a reduction in tax expense associated with peso depreciation during 2016. Based upon the forward curve at year-end, we estimate this benefit to be approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share. 
With regard to IEnova's acquisition of PEMEX's ownership and their shared joint venture, Mexico's Competition Commission has required PEMEX to competitively auction 2 assets included in the original transaction. IEnova is negotiating changes to the original agreement with PEMEX that will reflect the auction outcome, among other things. Our adjusted guidance assumes that the transaction moves forward with the same assets and closes in the third quarter of 2016. Based on this timing, we assume an estimated $0.02 of accretion this year. Our adjusted guidance excludes, however, any potential gain associated with the remeasurement of our investment in the joint venture.
In our renewables business, we incorporate new forecast for wind resource and availability that reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. However, our base plan now includes 328 megawatts of additional projects announced last year that are under construction. Given that these projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016, we expect to see the full earnings impact beginning in 2017.
Finally, for the California Utilities, our prior guidance was based on a very conservative assumption that revenues would be based on our current attrition mechanism with no further adjustments. Our new adjusted guidance range includes projected earnings that more closely align with the GRC settlement agreement and our best estimate of the outcome given the record in the proceeding. 
Now let's go to Slide 6 for a business update, beginning with the California Utilities. In our general rate case, we are currently expecting to see a proposed decision in March and to receive the final decision in the second quarter. As you recall, we reached a multiparty settlement agreement with the major parties in the case. Until we get a final GRC decision, we will record revenues based upon the authorized revenue requirement in 2015. When we receive the final decision, we will make an adjustment to reflect the retroactive earnings back to January 1, 2016. 
Turning to Aliso Canyon. We have received confirmation from DOGGR, the California agency responsible for regulating gas storage, that the leaking well has been permanently sealed. We have approximately 15 Bcf of natural gas in the storage field, and the field is stable. Moving forward, an independent engineering firm has been selected by DOGGR and the CPUC to investigate the root cause of the leak. While we do not know how long this process will take, we will cooperate on the investigation and share publicly available data.
Consistent with new rules under development, we are implementing enhanced leak detection and well inspection activities. We are also working cooperatively with all of the agencies involved to determine a path forward for the facility, which is regarded as integral to the reliability of the electric grid in California. 
Reflecting the most up-to-date information, which primarily includes revised temporary relocation and well drilling expenses, we now estimate the total cost for amounts paid and those forecasted to be paid to be approximately $330 million. Of this amount, approximately 90% is for the temporary relocation program, cost to address the leak and attempts to stop or reduce the emissions. The remaining amount includes, among other items, the value of lost gas and estimated cost to mitigate the GHG emissions. For the estimate, we assume the relocation period for the majority of residents ended on February 25, as agreed upon with the City of Los Angeles. We have concluded it is probable that we will receive insurance recovery for the total amount, less retentions, of $325 million.
Beyond this estimate, we cannot predict all of the potential categories or total amount of future costs that we may incur as a result of the leak. We have at least 4 types of insurance policies that provide an excess of $1 billion in insurance coverage. Based upon what we know today, and subject to various policy limits, exclusions and conditions, we believe that our insurance should also cover the following categories not included in our estimates: costs associated with litigation and claims by nearby residents and businesses; and in some circumstances, depending upon their nature and matter of assessment, fines and penalties. I refer you to our 10-K for further detail. 
Please turn to Slide 7. In Mexico, CFE is tendering several more gas pipelines. IEnova submitted a bid for one pipeline earlier this month, is in process of submitting a bid for a second and is preparing to submit a third bid in March. According to CFE estimates, the 3 pipelines represent an investment opportunity of almost $2 billion, and we expect award dates to occur in March and April. 
This spring, IEnova is also preparing to participate in Mexico's first auction of renewable energy certificate. IEnova is looking at potential solar opportunities and may submit a bid to expand the ESJ wind facility with its joint venture partner, Intergen. The CFE will be the initial off-taker under 15- to 20-year contracts, and total awards could amount to 2,500 megawatts of new power generation.
In our LNG business, there have been 2 noteworthy developments. Our Cameron Expansion project received its FERC environmental assessment on February 12, and we expect to receive the FERC permit in the second quarter. Though current market conditions are not ideal, Cameron Train 4 is a very competitive market offering for long-term buyers. Based on recent meetings with potential customers, we are bypassing the memorandum of understanding stage and are in negotiations for definitive 20-year sales and purchase agreements. While a sales and purchase agreement will take longer to execute than an MOU, we are targeting the second half of 2016 for announcing customer agreements needed to launch the project. This approach provides us greater certainty on project commitments prior to incurring large capital expenditures.
For Port Arthur, yesterday, we signed a joint development agreement with Woodside Petroleum that outlines development roles in the potential project. In addition to how we will share cost and market capacity, the agreement provides a framework for how we will work together technically to design a cost-competitive plant. 
Last month, I was in Australia meeting with the CEO and senior management of Woodside. And we shared a view that Port Arthur has good market prospects post 2020. 
Before moving on, remember that we have not incorporated additional LNG or other growth projects in our guidance. We are actively working on development opportunities across our businesses that could provide upside to both our near-term and long-term projections. 
With that, please turn to Slide 8, and Joe will discuss our financial results. Joe?"

Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses",471,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses related to the development of our proposed LNG liquefaction projects. In addition, in October 2015, an agreement was reached with the SONGS insurance provider for a $400 million payment associated with the failure of the replacement steam generators. Of this amount, SDG&E's share was $80 million. After reimbursement of legal fees and an allocation of $75 million of net proceeds to the ratepayers, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings exclude a $2 million after-tax adjustment to the loss on the SONGS plant closure. 
Full year 2015 earnings totaled $1,349,000,000 or $5.37 per share. This compares to 2014 earnings of $1,161,000,000 or $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2015 earnings were $5.21 per share. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings grew 11%.
Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. 
I will address the key drivers for our consolidated quarterly results now on Slide 9. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter earnings include a $48 million seasonality impact that increased earnings at SoCalGas. Recall that applying seasonality to earnings at SoCalGas does not affect full year results. Instead, this fourth quarter variance offsets seasonality impacts during the first 3 quarters of the year.
At parent, we recorded $21 million of lower tax expense, primarily related to favorable resolution of prior year's income tax matters and reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico. The lower tax expense at parent along with lower effective tax rates at the California Utilities were primary reasons why we exceeded our revised 2015 adjusted guidance that we gave on our third quarter call.
Third, SoCalGas recorded $16 million of higher earnings due to higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses. And offsetting these factors was $18 million of lower tax expense in South America in 2014 as a result of Peruvian tax reform. 
Now let's conclude, so please turn to Slide 10. Overall, we delivered strong financial results in 2015 and exceeded our adjusted guidance. Solid growth in operating earnings and confidence in our long-term cash flows supported our decision to raise the 2016 dividend. In order to better align our future dividend growth with projected EPS growth, we are now targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years.
Looking ahead over the next 5 years, we continue to anticipate earnings growth around twice the level of our utility sector average. Combined with the strong dividend growth, we aim to provide top-tier total shareholder returns. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have."

If I look at the fundamental building blocks, as you know, our business is based upon long-term contracted and utility assets. And when we lay out our growth rates, the key things that are driving our growth longer term are Cameron 1 through 3, which is progressing on schedule, on budget, and we expect that to come online in 2018, as we've outlined before. Our Mexican pipelines are now -- all except for 3 of them are actually in operations that are contracted, and so that is going quite well. And then our utility businesses. And the fundamentals of our utility businesses, as you can see from last year's earnings, are very strong. And we would anticipate getting a rate case decision soon. And one reason we want to hold off providing any numeric guidance is that we want to get that rate case decision and then be able to go through, as we always do with you at the analyst meetings, the details. The other thing that I would just comment on is our board felt that there's a great visibility to our growth. And since it's long-term contracted in utility, they were very comfortable setting an 8% to 9% target for dividend increases over the next several years. And I think that is a really strong statement in our sector to be able to grow your dividend at that kind of rate."

The reason why is because, as Debbie indicated, we have a time frame that's tight, and we're trying to take advantage of the long-term pricing that we have from our EPC contractor. So going through an MOU would create an additional step that might drag that schedule. And as you know, given the way we structure our deals on the LNG, we're not just selling cargoes for a price, which would be much easier sell. We're actually putting together deals that deal with low commodity risk and, essentially, long contracting capacity for the liquefaction. So we have to speak a lot to our customers about the upstream conditions, where the gas comes from, where it's delivered, how it's delivered. And those tend to be more complicated sessions. And as a result, we've all decided to go forward -- it wasn't just us, the customers also decided to go that way. So the people we're talking to at this point, we all agreed to pursue the supply purchase agreements and gas supply agreements as part of our discussions in order for -- later in the year, to have the full commitment to take the commitments we need to make on the capital side to launch the project."

But we actually started on a pilot program back in 2014, even before we have gotten approval. And as you know, we have requested within our General Rate Case for additional funding for our Storage Integrity Management Program, so that we're waiting for the final decision there. As far as the importance of Aliso, and just gas storage in general, to both gas and electric reliability, I think it's been very clear with a lot of the comments by both policy and regulatory leaders, especially, I mean, from the California Energy Commission as well as the PUC that it's vital that we have safe and reliable gas storage to support not just gas demand but, especially in the Los Angeles basin, electric reliability as well. So we're pleased to see that -- even in the visit that Department of Energy Secretary Moniz, when he came out and visited, he reemphasized the importance of making sure that, obviously, the facilities are safe, but that we have been back online in order to support both gas and electric reliability. So we know that there's -- as Debbie mentioned, there's a full process that's been approved by DOGGR on their comprehensive safety review. We're working very closely with them on that. There's also some legislation that's been presented that, so far, is open to amendments to incorporate the process that DOGGR has laid out. So we're optimistic that sounder minds now, from the policy and regulatory and political side, recognize the importance of getting Aliso back online as safely and as expeditiously as possible."

But I think the most important thing, as Debbie's pointed, is on the opportunities around our existing pipeline footprint, which, just to remind everyone, we are the largest pipeline operator in Mexico. We're very well positioned, not only for this new work, but to expand those opportunities and start building laterals into other industrialized areas. And so we see the opportunity for IEnova in Mexico for continued growth. And I think we've all seen some of the comments on PEMEX over the last few days and their desire to raise additional capital and to think about selling some of their additional assets.

Julien, let me start with Aliso, and it's kind of really a 2-pronged approach. First is we're obviously -- as Debbie mentioned, we're cooperating with the investigation that's being led by DOGGR and the CPUC, and they have an independent expert on the outside, a company called Blade Energy Partners. And so we're supporting them. And they're really driving the time schedule there, so whatever time it takes for them to do their work and to issue their report will kind of take its own path. But as far as getting the field back into service, as I mentioned, DOGGR has issued its comprehensive safety review that we're working with them on. And it's a very detailed process of testing, inspecting and, if necessary, repairs. And as Debbie mentioned, it really does -- it's very parallel what we had put in place as far as our SIMP program and what we were doing from a pilot standpoint. So we're working to expeditiously implement that. It's hard to tell at this point in time how long it'll take us to get through all of the 115 wells. But the way that the program is put together, it does allow us, once we've accomplished a minimum threshold of tests on all the wells, we can start bringing some of the wells on. We don't have to do complete work on 100% of those. We can isolate or abandon certain wells and bring on other wells at the same time. So we'll be giving further updates on that down the road. But I think the key point there is, again, policy makers, the regulators -- and we're very closely working with all of these so that they understand what could happen both here in the summer from an electric reliability standpoint and from a gas standpoint. We're all really working together to make sure that Aliso and all of our gas storage facilities are safe and reliable and they can service our customers. We're also -- there also is an emergency regulation that was put in place by DOGGR that applies to all gas storage facilities, not just Aliso, and so we're complying with that as well. And that includes things such as daily pressure reads, testing the wellhead valves and some other procedures that have to be put in place. So there's a lot going on. We've got a lot of people at all of our facilities, and we're focused on, again, doing this as expeditiously and as safely as possible."

Yes, let me walks through that, Faisel, because I think this is important for everybody to understand, and we talk about it from time to time. But we have some really, really well-run utilities in South America. And over time, those have done extremely well, and you can look back to the early 2000s. They've done very well over time, and we like those assets a lot. But they are local currency-run companies, and their revenues are in local currency. And so we've seen a depreciation against the U.S. dollar, because we have to translate those into dollars, of about 15% to 20% since last year's plan. So when we did the 2016 plan last year and showed you a number, those currencies have depreciated 15% to 20%. And there's, to some degree, some offset in our tariffs and they catch up over time because we have adjustments in our tariffs. But we've adjusted the revenues or the net earnings from those companies for that change in FX rates from a year ago to the ones we have now. In Mexico, the tax expense I was just referring to a moment ago, that's an annual adjustment. It kind of goes from what was the peso at the beginning of the year to what is it going to be at the end of the year. And I think Debbie mentioned in her remarks that we haven't had this in our planning in the past. And the reason is we're not allowed to, under accounting -- GAAP accounting rules, we're not allowed to kind of forecast that. So -- but this year, we put it in the plan because we know that the Mexican peso is forecasted to move about 3.5%. And so we forecasted a change in our tax expense for that 3.5%. And so in 2016, we see a little bit of a loss there. In 2015, we actually had earnings as a result of this. We had $31 million increase at Mexico and a $20 million decrease in South America. So we had $11 million plus. So again, in 2013, 2014, it was neutral, in between 2015 and 2016, net, it's going to be kind of neutral. These things don't move the needle very much for us. They're pretty small."

If you have a project coming on when there's a market need and that market need grows over time, then that's a very different market that you're going after.

No discussion about that. But we also have a little problem with the current market. We have an oversupplied market, and yet the spot cargoes are more expensive than the long-term pricing, which was agreed on in a tight market. So the market is broken in its pricing formulas, and it -- the market is adjusting to it as we speak and will adjust for the next couple of years. But our focus is not the current market. Our focus is the 2020, as Debbie indicated, where you'll see that the current oversupply will be absorbed, and then, there's a shortage. And unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your point of view, these facilities take 5, 6 years to come online once you decide to go forward. And as a result, we need to make decisions today to meet that demand. It is difficult to make. It's large capital investments when a lot of the big players are taking write-downs because of oil. That's the condition why the market is tough. Some of the buyers are confused by the oversupply. But our focus is not the current market. So globally, unless you believe we're going to switch everything from gas to coal and oil, which would increase our current footprint significantly and it seems like the winds are the other way around, if you do believe that we are going forward not only with the continuous economic growth but with a change to a lower carbon footprint, then gas is going to play a role not just in the current markets but in other markets that are yet to open. One interesting statistic I heard this week at CERAWeek was the fact that the lower demand from Korea and Japan was made up by increased demand in Middle East countries, and therefore, the demand didn't go away. And that was not there in the earlier projections. So globally, where our projects fit, we're comfortable. It is a tough market for people to make decisions when they're under significant pressure. But we think we are offering to the market the lowest-cost producing facility for 2020, and that's why the interest is there."

In the economics of the Carmen -- pardon me, in the Cameron-based project, we included $1 billion of the cost of the existing facilities, which is essentially replacement value. So the economics of Cameron in that chart you saw at Analyst Day, as well as all the other charts, included the value of existing facilities. And so what we're doing with Woodside and Port Arthur is looking at ways to break some of the paradigms in the industry, keep it as safe and reliable as we want it to be, as the customers expect it to be, but look at ways to reduce cost. Just like we found when we did Cameron that we had the lower cost per ton for conventional technology of liquefaction. We have an even lower price for the expansion of Cameron for Trains 4 and 5, and we expect to achieve similar results with Port Arthur. If we don't find that we can do that, then Port Arthur is not going to go away. We simply believe that the industry has to be going back to a discipline of developing the next lowest marginal cost available of supply in order to be sustainable."

So to the degree that they can use other party's capital, and that would be us -- I mean, we'd like to put our capital there, and that they can build the infrastructure that reduces their energy cost, that they're moving forward on that basis. And so we think that -- I think it's a struggle for PEMEX with having been reliant on oil revenues, but it's an opportunity for us to come in and build things that wouldn't otherwise be built and that are needed as part of the long-term Mexican infrastructure.

And they haven't seen increases in production and some of the things that they expected to see from energy reform, and I think that's entirely the fault of $30 oil and very little to do with the reforms. What are coming out of the reforms is a massive amount of energy infrastructure within the company -- within the country, and that infrastructure is doing exactly what it's supposed to do. As Debbie said, it's lowering energy cost, bringing natural gas in the regions of the country that didn't have access to it before. It's making it -- it's really making a big difference in lowering electricity costs across the country. And that's working very, very well. And to the extent that low gas -- low oil prices are hindering some of the reforms at PEMEX, I think that, again, is creating a large opportunity for us, because it increases the need for PEMEX for capital, it gives opportunities for us to look at the assets that they're going to be putting up for sale. And so from our perspective, I think we think that the reforms are working very much as intended and that we will continue to benefit as being one of the best placed companies in the country to take advantage of those opportunities."

Before discussing the quarter, I would like to say a few words about the natural gas leak at our Aliso Canyon storage facility. On February 18, the Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources, or DOGGR, confirmed that the leaking well was permanently sealed. Our focus since the beginning has been on safely stopping the leak, reducing the odor from the well, reducing the amount of natural gas being emitted into the environment, working cooperatively with agencies and elected officials and supporting local residents, including providing temporary housing and air filtration systems. Now that we have stopped the leak, an independent investigation of the root cause will be conducted. I want to emphasize that providing safe and reliable service to our customers is the highest priority for SoCalGas. We will continue to work with our regulators and customers to ensure our path ahead reflects these values. 
Later, I will provide more information on Aliso Canyon, and Dennis and Martha are also here to address your questions. 
Turning to our financial performance. In 2015, we had very strong results and exceeded our adjusted earnings guidance. This morning, we reported full year earnings of $5.37 per share or $5.21 per share on an adjusted basis. Our 2015 results were driven largely by growth in operating earnings at our California Utilities and Sempra International.
In addition, our board approved an increase in the 2016 dividend to $3.02 per share. This payout represents an 8% annual increase and provides dividend growth that more closely aligns with the 11% annual increase in our 2015 adjusted earnings. Moreover, we are targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years to better align our dividend growth with our projected EPS growth. Our dividend strategy is underpinned by confidence in our future cash flows and supports our commitment to return capital to our shareholders.
Regarding 2016 earnings. We have updated our assumptions and are providing an adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 per share to $5.20 per share. When compared with the 2015 results, we forecast a higher effective tax rate for 2016. In part, this is due to a large number of benefits recorded last year that related to the resolution of tax matters. 
Also, as we move into the new GRC cycle at our California Utilities, we will now be providing an estimated $60 million of repair allowance tax benefits to ratepayers as part of the standard rate case true-up. In our 2016 adjusted guidance, we assume that we retain all repair allowance benefits for tax years preceding our new GRC. Key updates and comparisons to the 2016 guidance we provided at last year's analyst conference reflects several other factors. Notably, we include our best estimate of the GRC decision for the California Utilities based on our settlement agreement as well as new market assumptions for commodities and foreign exchange rates that have changed considerably since last year. Additionally, our adjusted guidance range now includes approximately $20 million to $25 million of estimated LNG development expense. 
Regarding transactions we announced last year that were additive to our base plan, such as the potential PEMEX acquisition and new renewable contracts, we expect the earnings impact to largely occur in 2017 and beyond. 
Please note that our proposed GRC settlement agreement is subject to CPUC approval, and we do not anticipate receiving a final decision until the second quarter. We have moved our analyst conference to May in order to incorporate an expected final GRC decision, and will provide you with our business unit guidance and longer-term projections at that time. Overall, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term strategy of providing earnings growth that is twice that of the average utility, but with a moderate risk profile. Combined with strong anticipated growth in the dividend, we are focused on providing top-tier shareholder return. 
Now please turn to Slide 5. This slide summarizes the key assumptions included in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance, and we'll briefly discuss each item, and you can find additional detail in the appendix. 
First, as I mentioned earlier, this year, we include development cost for our LNG liquefaction and related infrastructure opportunities. In 2015, we had about $10 million of similar expense that was excluded from adjusted guidance due to uncertainty about the nature and timing of these costs. Given progress on the projects and our estimates of the spend rate and amounts capitalized and shared with partners, we now include a 2016 after-tax expense of roughly $0.08 to $0.10 per share. Please note, however, that the vast majority of planned expense is targeted for Port Arthur and related infrastructure, as we have already incurred most of the upfront cost for Cameron expansions. Going forward, we will be sharing cost for Port Arthur with our partner, Woodside. We will nevertheless monitor our progress in securing market commitments and other needed approvals to advance the project. To the extent our progress is slower than expected, we will adjust our spending accordingly.
Next, we have seen a significant decline in natural gas price forecast over the past year. Specifically, the Cal border [ph] 2016 forward curve has fallen from $3.60 in our prior guidance to $2.60 in our new adjusted guidance. The impact from this assumption is a reduction in earnings of approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share that is associated with the LNG marketing contract from our ICA import facility in Mexico. 
Third, we reduced projected earnings from the TDM power plant due to lower power prices and lower expected capacity revenues. This month, IEnova decided to hold the asset for sale. The sale would complete our exit from merchant generation and allow IEnova to deploy capital in projects that provide more stable earnings. 
While we project approximately $0.04 to $0.06 per share of reduced earnings associated with TDM, we do not consider any potential gain or loss from the sale in our adjusted guidance. 
Moving to parent. We assume that we will use dividends from Mexico to participate in a potential IEnova equity offering. We forecast a 2016 earnings benefit from lower repatriation tax expense of between $0.08 and $0.10 per share. Offsetting this impact is an estimated $0.04 per share after tax of higher interest expense to fund projects in our base plan. 
Next, like natural gas prices, we have seen exchange rate forecasts move significantly over the past year. Relative to our previous guidance, our current forecast is for the dollar to strengthen in 2016 by an additional 20% against the Chilean currency and by an additional 13% against the Peruvian currency. Projected earnings are reduced by roughly $0.09 to $0.11 per share as a result of translating South American earnings into dollars.
In Mexico, we have not previously forecast the impact of foreign currency effects. We now include in our adjusted guidance a reduction in tax expense associated with peso depreciation during 2016. Based upon the forward curve at year-end, we estimate this benefit to be approximately $0.05 to $0.07 per share. 
With regard to IEnova's acquisition of PEMEX's ownership and their shared joint venture, Mexico's Competition Commission has required PEMEX to competitively auction 2 assets included in the original transaction. IEnova is negotiating changes to the original agreement with PEMEX that will reflect the auction outcome, among other things. Our adjusted guidance assumes that the transaction moves forward with the same assets and closes in the third quarter of 2016. Based on this timing, we assume an estimated $0.02 of accretion this year. Our adjusted guidance excludes, however, any potential gain associated with the remeasurement of our investment in the joint venture.
In our renewables business, we incorporate new forecast for wind resource and availability that reduced earnings by approximately $0.02 per share. However, our base plan now includes 328 megawatts of additional projects announced last year that are under construction. Given that these projects are expected to be in operation by the end of 2016, we expect to see the full earnings impact beginning in 2017.
Finally, for the California Utilities, our prior guidance was based on a very conservative assumption that revenues would be based on our current attrition mechanism with no further adjustments. Our new adjusted guidance range includes projected earnings that more closely align with the GRC settlement agreement and our best estimate of the outcome given the record in the proceeding. 
Now let's go to Slide 6 for a business update, beginning with the California Utilities. In our general rate case, we are currently expecting to see a proposed decision in March and to receive the final decision in the second quarter. As you recall, we reached a multiparty settlement agreement with the major parties in the case. Until we get a final GRC decision, we will record revenues based upon the authorized revenue requirement in 2015. When we receive the final decision, we will make an adjustment to reflect the retroactive earnings back to January 1, 2016. 
Turning to Aliso Canyon. We have received confirmation from DOGGR, the California agency responsible for regulating gas storage, that the leaking well has been permanently sealed. We have approximately 15 Bcf of natural gas in the storage field, and the field is stable. Moving forward, an independent engineering firm has been selected by DOGGR and the CPUC to investigate the root cause of the leak. While we do not know how long this process will take, we will cooperate on the investigation and share publicly available data.
Consistent with new rules under development, we are implementing enhanced leak detection and well inspection activities. We are also working cooperatively with all of the agencies involved to determine a path forward for the facility, which is regarded as integral to the reliability of the electric grid in California. 
Reflecting the most up-to-date information, which primarily includes revised temporary relocation and well drilling expenses, we now estimate the total cost for amounts paid and those forecasted to be paid to be approximately $330 million. Of this amount, approximately 90% is for the temporary relocation program, cost to address the leak and attempts to stop or reduce the emissions. The remaining amount includes, among other items, the value of lost gas and estimated cost to mitigate the GHG emissions. For the estimate, we assume the relocation period for the majority of residents ended on February 25, as agreed upon with the City of Los Angeles. We have concluded it is probable that we will receive insurance recovery for the total amount, less retentions, of $325 million.
Beyond this estimate, we cannot predict all of the potential categories or total amount of future costs that we may incur as a result of the leak. We have at least 4 types of insurance policies that provide in excess of $1 billion in insurance coverage. Based upon what we know today, and subject to various policy limits, exclusions and conditions, we believe that our insurance should also cover the following categories not included in our estimates: costs associated with litigation and claims by nearby residents and businesses; and in some circumstances, depending upon their nature and matter of assessment, fines and penalties. I refer you to our 10-K for further detail. 
Please turn to Slide 7. In Mexico, CFE is tendering several more gas pipelines. IEnova submitted a bid for one pipeline earlier this month, is in process of submitting a bid for a second and is preparing to submit a third bid in March. According to CFE estimates, the 3 pipelines represent an investment opportunity of almost $2 billion, and we expect award dates to occur in March and April. 
This spring, IEnova is also preparing to participate in Mexico's first auction of renewable energy certificate. IEnova is looking at potential solar opportunities, and may submit a bid to expand the ESJ wind facility with its joint venture partner, Intergen. The CFE will be the initial off-taker under 15- to 20-year contracts, and total awards could amount to 2,500 megawatts of new power generation.
In our LNG business, there have been 2 noteworthy developments. Our Cameron Expansion project received its FERC environmental assessment on February 12, and we expect to receive the FERC permit in the second quarter. Though current market conditions are not ideal, Cameron Train 4 is a very competitive market offering for long-term buyers. Based on recent meetings with potential customers, we are bypassing the memorandum of understanding stage and are in negotiations for definitive 20-year sales and purchase agreements. While a sales and purchase agreement will take longer to execute than an MOU, we are targeting the second half of 2016 for announcing customer agreements needed to launch the project. This approach provides us greater certainty on project commitments prior to incurring large capital expenditures.
For Port Arthur, yesterday, we signed a joint development agreement with Woodside Petroleum that outlines development roles in the potential project. In addition to how we will share cost and market capacity, the agreement provides a framework for how we will work together technically to design a cost-competitive plant. 
Last month, I was in Australia meeting with the CEO and senior management of Woodside. And we share the view that Port Arthur has good market prospects post 2020. 
Before moving on, remember that we have not incorporated additional LNG or other growth projects in our guidance. We are actively working on development opportunities across our businesses that could provide upside to both our near-term and long-term projections. 
With that, please turn to Slide 8, and Joe will discuss our financial results. Joe?"

Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses",471,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $369 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter exclude $3 million of expenses related to the development of our proposed LNG liquefaction projects. In addition, in October 2015, an agreement was reached with the SONGS insurance provider for a $400 million payment associated with the failure of the replacement steam generators. Of this amount, SDG&E's share was $80 million. After reimbursement of legal fees and an allocation of $75 million of net proceeds to the ratepayers, our fourth quarter adjusted earnings exclude a $2 million after-tax adjustment to the loss on the SONGS plant closure. 
Full year 2015 earnings totaled $1,349,000,000 or $5.37 per share. This compares to 2014 earnings of $1,161,000,000 or $4.63 per share. On an adjusted basis, 2015 earnings were $5.21 per share. Year-over-year, adjusted earnings grew 11%.
Individual financial results for each of our businesses can be found in the section of our presentation entitled Business Unit Earnings. 
I will address the key drivers for our consolidated quarterly results now on Slide 9. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter earnings include a $48 million seasonality impact that increased earnings at SoCalGas. Recall that applying seasonality to earnings at SoCalGas does not affect full year results. Instead, this fourth quarter variance offsets seasonality impacts during the first 3 quarters of the year.
At parent, we recorded $21 million of lower tax expense, primarily related to favorable resolution of prior year's income tax matters and reduced repatriation of dividends from Mexico. The lower tax expense at parent along with lower effective tax rates at the California Utilities were primary reasons why we exceeded our revised 2015 adjusted guidance that we gave on our third quarter call.
Third, SoCalGas recorded $16 million of higher earnings due to higher CPUC base margin, net of operating expenses. And offsetting these factors was $18 million of lower tax expense in South America in 2014 as a result of Peruvian tax reform. 
Now let's conclude, so please turn to Slide 10. Overall, we delivered strong financial results in 2015 and exceeded our adjusted guidance. Solid growth in operating earnings and confidence in our long-term cash flows supported our decision to raise the 2016 dividend. In order to better align our future dividend growth with projected EPS growth, we are now targeting annual dividend increases of 8% to 9% over the next several years.
Looking ahead over the next 5 years, we continue to anticipate earnings growth around twice the level of our utility sector average. Combined with the strong dividend growth, we aim to provide top-tier total shareholder returns. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take any questions you may have."

If I look at the fundamental building blocks, as you know, our business is based upon long-term contracted and utility assets. And when we lay out our growth rates, the key things that are driving our growth longer term are Cameron 1 through 3, which is progressing on schedule, on budget, and we expect that to come online in 2018, as we've outlined before. Our Mexican pipelines are now -- all except for 3 of them are actually in operations that are contracted, and so that is going quite well. And then our utility businesses. And the fundamentals of our utility businesses, as you can see from last year's earnings, are very strong. And we would anticipate getting a rate case decision soon. And one reason we want to hold off providing any numeric guidance is that we want to get that rate case decision and then be able to go through, as we always do with you at the analyst meetings, the details. The other thing that I would just comment on is our board felt that there's a great visibility to our growth. And since it's long-term contracted in utility, they were very comfortable setting an 8% to 9% target for dividend increases over the next several years. And I think that is a really strong statement in our sector to be able to grow your dividend at that kind of rate."

The reason why is because, as Debbie indicated, we have a time frame that's tight, and we're trying to take advantage of the long-term pricing that we have from our EPC contractor. So going through an MOU would create an additional step that might drag that schedule. And as you know, given the way we structure our deals on the LNG, we're not just selling cargoes for a price, which would be much easier sell. We're actually putting together deals that deal with low commodity risk and, essentially, long contracting capacity for the liquefaction. So we have to speak a lot to our customers about the upstream conditions, where the gas comes from, where it's delivered, how it's delivered. And those tend to be more complicated sessions. And as a result, we've all decided to go forward -- it wasn't just us, the customers also decided to go that way. So the people we're talking to at this point, we’ve all agreed to pursue the supply purchase agreements and gas supply agreements as part of our discussions in order for -- later in the year, to have the full commitment to take the commitments we need to make on the capital side to launch the project."

Yes, as Debbie talked about, our SIMP program -- and we -- at utilities, we have an acronym for everything. But we actually started on a pilot program back in 2014, even before we had gotten approval. And as you know, we have requested within our General Rate Case for additional funding for our Storage Integrity Management Program, so that we're waiting for the final decision there. As far as the importance of Aliso, and just gas storage in general, to both gas and electric reliability, I think it's been very clear with a lot of the comments by both policy and regulatory leaders, especially, I mean, from the California Energy Commission as well as the PUC that it's vital that we have safe and reliable gas storage to support not just gas demand but, especially in the Los Angeles basin, electric reliability as well. So we're pleased to see that -- even in the visit that Department of Energy Secretary Moniz, when he came out and visited, he reemphasized the importance of making sure that, obviously, the facilities are safe, but that we have been back online in order to support both gas and electric reliability. So we know that there's -- as Debbie mentioned, there's a full process that's been approved by DOGGR on their comprehensive safety review. We're working very closely with them on that. There's also some legislation that's been presented that, so far, is open to amendments to incorporate the process that DOGGR has laid out. So we're optimistic that sounder minds now from the policy and regulatory and political side recognize the importance of getting Aliso back online as safely and as expeditiously as possible."

But I think the most important thing, as Debbie's point, is on the opportunities around our existing pipeline footprint, which, just to remind everyone, we are the largest pipeline operator in Mexico. We're very well positioned, not only for this new work, but to expand those opportunities and start building laterals into other industrialized areas. And so we see the opportunity for IEnova in Mexico for continued growth. And I think we've all seen some of the comments on PEMEX over the last few days and their desire to raise additional capital and to think about selling some of their additional assets. We're very well poised to take advantage of those opportunities. Our relationships there are very strong. And so we're very optimistic about IEnova's growth potential."

Julien, let me start with Aliso, and it's kind of really a 2-pronged approach. First is we're obviously, as Debbie mentioned, we're cooperating with the investigation that's being led by DOGGR and the CPUC, and they have an independent expert on the outside, a company called Blade Energy Partners. And so we're supporting them. And they're really driving the time schedule there, so whatever time it takes for them to do their work and to issue their report will kind of take its own path. But as far as getting the field back into service, as I mentioned, DOGGR has issued its comprehensive safety review that we're working with them on. And it's a very detailed process of testing, inspecting and, if necessary, repairs. And as Debbie mentioned, it really does -- it's very parallels what we had put in place as far as our SIMP program and what we were doing from a pilot standpoint. So we're working to expeditiously implement that. It's hard to tell at this point in time how long it'll take us to get through all of the 115 wells. But the way that the program is put together, it does allow us, once we've accomplished a minimum threshold of tests on all the wells, we can start bringing some of the wells on. We don't have to do complete work on 100% of those. We can isolate or abandon certain wells and bring on other wells at the same time. So we'll be giving further updates on that down the road. But I think the key point there is, again, policy makers, the regulators -- and we're very closely working with all of these so that they understand what could happen both here in the summer from an electric reliability standpoint and from a gas standpoint. We're all really working together to make sure that Aliso and all of our gas storage facilities are safe and reliable and they can service our customers. We're also -- there also is an emergency regulation that was put in place by DOGGR that applies to all gas storage facilities, not just Aliso, and so we're complying with that as well. And that includes things such as daily pressure reads, testing the wellhead valves and some other procedures that have to be put in place. So there's a lot going on. We've got a lot of people at all of our facilities, and we're focused on, again, doing this as expeditiously and as safely as possible."

They've done very well over time, and we like those assets a lot. But they are local currency-run companies, and their revenues are in local currency. And so we've seen a depreciation against the U.S. dollar, because we have to translate those into dollars, of about 15% to 20% since last year's plan. So when we did the 2016 plan last year and showed you a number, those currencies have depreciated 15% to 20%. And there's, to some degree, some offset in our tariffs and they catch up over time because we have adjustments in our tariffs. But we've adjusted the revenues or the net earnings from those companies for that change in FX rates from a year ago to the ones we have now. In Mexico, the tax expense I was just referring to a moment ago, that's an annual adjustment. It kind of goes from what was the peso at the beginning of the year to what is it going to be at the end of the year. And I think Debbie mentioned in her remarks that we haven't had this in our planning in the past. And the reason is we're not allowed to, under accounting -- GAAP accounting rules, we're not allowed to kind of forecast that. So -- but this year, we put it in the plan because we know that the Mexican peso is forecasted to move about 3.5%. And so we forecasted a change in our tax expense for that 3.5%. And so in 2016, we see a little bit of a loss there. In 2015, we actually had earnings as a result of this. We had $31 million increase at Mexico and a $20 million decrease in South America. So we had $11 million plus. So again, in 2013, 2014, it was neutral, in between 2015 and 2016, net, it's going to be kind of neutral. These things don't move the needle very much for us. They're pretty small."

If you have a project coming on when there's a market need and that market need grows over time, then that's a very different market that you're going after.

No discussion about that. But we also have a little problem with the current market. We have an oversupplied market, and yet the spot cargoes are more expensive than the long-term pricing, which was agreed on in a tight market. So the market is broken in its pricing formulas, and it -- the market is adjusting to it as we speak and will adjust for the next couple of years. But our focus is not the current market. Our focus is the 2020, as Debbie indicated, where you'll see that the current oversupply will be absorbed, and then, there's a shortage. And unfortunately, or fortunately depending on your point of view, these facilities take 5, 6 years to come online once you decide to go forward. And as a result, we need to make decisions today to meet that demand. It is difficult to make. It's large capital investments when a lot of the big players are taking write-downs because of oil. That's the condition why the market is tough. Some of the buyers are confused by the oversupply. But our focus is not the current market. So globally, unless you believe we're going to switch everything from gas to coal and oil, which would increase our current footprint significantly and it seems like the winds are the other way around, if you do believe that we are going forward not only with the continuous economic growth but with a change to a lower carbon footprint, then gas is going to play a role not just in the current markets but in other markets that are yet to open. One interesting statistic I heard this week at CERAWeek was the fact that the lower demand from Korea and Japan was made up by increased demand in Middle East countries, and therefore, the demand didn't go away. And that was not there in the earlier projections. So globally, where our projects fit, we're comfortable. It is a tough market for people to make decisions when they're under significant pressure. But we think we are offering to the market the lowest-cost producing facility for 2020, and that's why the interest is there."

How are you thinking about how the economics of Port Arthur as a greenfield would differ from some of the disclosures you've given previously on Cameron 1 through 3?"

In the economics of the Carmen -- pardon me, in the Cameron-based project, we included $1 billion of the cost of the existing facilities, which is essentially replacement value. So the economics of Cameron in that chart you saw at Analyst Day, as well as all the other charts, included the value of existing facilities. And so what we're doing with Woodside and Port Arthur is looking at ways to break some of the paradigms in the industry, keep it as safe and reliable as we want it to be, as the customers expect it to be, but look at ways to reduce cost. Just like we found when we did Cameron that we had the lower cost per ton for conventional technology of liquefaction. We have an even lower price for the expansion of Cameron for Trains 4 and 5, and we expect to achieve similar results with Port Arthur. If we don't find that we can do that, then Port Arthur is not going to go away. We simply believe that the industry has to be going back to a discipline of developing the next lowest marginal cost available of supply in order to be sustainable."

And they haven't seen increases in production and some of the things that they expected to see from energy reform, and I think that's entirely the fault of $30 oil and very little to do with the reforms. What are coming out of the reforms is a massive amount of energy infrastructure within the company -- within the country, and that infrastructure is doing exactly what it's supposed to do. As Debbie said, it's lowering energy cost, bringing natural gas in the regions of the country that didn't have access to it before. It's making it -- it's really making a big difference in lowering electricity costs across the country. And that's working very, very well. And to the extent that low gas -- low oil prices are hindering some of the reforms at PEMEX, I think that, again, is creating a large opportunity for us, because it increases the need for PEMEX for capital, it gives opportunities for us to look at the assets that they're going to be putting up for sale. And so from our perspective, I think we think that the reforms are working very much as intended and that we will continue to benefit as being one of the best placed companies in the country to take advantage of those opportunities."

120622,331536922,972534,"Sempra Energy, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Rick. On today's call, we are following a slightly different format. As you know, the final GRC decision for our California Utilities has not been issued. However, we expect to receive the proposed decision relatively soon. Because we have reached",1418,"Thanks, Rick. On today's call, we are following a slightly different format. As you know, the final GRC decision for our California Utilities has not been issued. However, we expect to receive the proposed decision relatively soon. Because we have reached a multiparty settlement agreement, we continue to believe the most likely GRC outcome is one consistent with that settlement. We also believe we have made a strong showing to support our historical treatment of tax repair allowance benefits. Therefore, today, we are updating our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance and providing you with our long-term growth rate assuming a GRC outcome consistent with the settlement. We think the best approach is to postpone our analyst conference until we have a final GRC decision. We are tentatively looking at the month of July in New York City as a possible date for the conference. Once we receive a PD, we will confirm the date and location. 
In our other businesses, we recently announced the sale of our Southeast utilities and our interest in REX. We expect to receive about $760 million of cash proceeds to invest in projects that align better with our growth strategy. As you know, our strategy is to provide growth that is roughly twice that of the utility average but with a commensurate risk profile. I will discuss these transactions later on the call. 
Our updated 2016 adjusted guidance range is now $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects approximately $60 million of reduced earnings from REX. The sale of our Southeast utilities does not affect current or future earnings, since earnings reduced from the sale can largely be offset by lower interest cost. 
Looking forward, we are well positioned for strong growth over the next 5 years. We expect our base plan to provide earnings in 2020 at $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted compound annual growth rate for 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. 
Prior to the sale of REX, the comparable growth rate would have been about 11%. 
Joe will address the growth rate further in his remarks, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have significant credit capacity in the latter years of our plan, which will provide us with flexibility and capital allocation. We will discuss our plan assumptions, business unit projections and growth strategy in more depth once we reschedule the analyst conference. 
Turning to our financial results. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $370 million. As a reminder, until we receive a final GRC, we are recording revenues based upon 2015 authorized amounts. Once we receive a final decision, we will record the impact of the 2016 authorized margins back to January 1. 
If the GRC have been finalized by January and was consistent with the settlement agreements, utility first quarter earnings would have been in line with last year, despite the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC. 
Now please turn to Slide 5. There are several updates related to Aliso Canyon. First, SoCalGas is cooperating with the other and the CPUC on the root cause investigation through their contractor Blade Energy Partners. We expect the investigation to take about 6 to 9 months with the results being issued by the agents late this year or early next year. Second, we are working to get the field back in service for injection. Consistent with [indiscernible] proposed safety review, we have implemented a plan to prioritize and test wells with the goal to have the facility in service by the end of this summer. Third, we are working with state and local agencies to address electric reliability concerns. Aliso Canyon currently has about 15 Bcf of gas available for withdrawal. When deciding how best to use that gas, reliability for both the summer and winter seasons must be considered. Fourth, we are completing our estimate of the total amount of gas lost from the leak and formulating a plan to mitigate that amount. Fifth, the temporary relocation program has been extended to allow the county to complete in-home testing, which results expected this month. SoCalGas and public agencies have conducted numerous tests of outdoor air quality. Results continue to confirm that air quality in Quarter Ranch is at normal levels. Finally, we are addressing the litigation that has been filed related to the leak. 
With regards to cost, we have incurred additional amounts, primarily from continuation of the temporary relocation program as ordered by the court. The court has scheduled a follow appearing on June 7. Based on an expectation that the relocation program continues through June 7, we estimate the cost for amounts paid and forecast to be paid at approximately $665 million. We have recorded an insurance receivable of $660 million. Our cost estimate does not include certain potential items as described on the slide. Please refer to our 2015 10-K and first quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on cost and our insurance. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our other businesses. Since our current assets to determine whether they fit with our long-term contracted infrastructure model and whether they integrate with other assets to offer strong long-term growth prospects. We identified 3 assets that are no longer a strategic fit for us: REX, our Southeast utilities and the TDM power plant in Mexico. For the first 2, we have announced sales agreement; and for TDM, we are conducting a sales process. 
For REX, we expect the sale of our equity interest to close in the second quarter and to provide $440 million in proceeds. The sale also allows us to forego expected future contributions for capital investment and debt repayments. We believe our capital can be better utilized to further enhance our strong growth outlook. As a result of the sale, we forecast the reduction for partial year 2016 earnings of approximately $60 million, which is included in our adjusted EPS range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. It is important to note that had we held our interest in REX, we expected 2020 earnings to be immaterial and dilute our growth, largely due to loss of earnings from west to east contracts that expire in 2019. In addition, we plan to permanently release uncontracted capacity held by Sempra. The negative earnings impacted this capacity release is projected to be between $100 million and $120 million, and will be recorded in the second quarter. This amount reflects the acceleration estimated losses that would have otherwise been realized over the remaining contract term. It is excluded from our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. 
Moving to our Southeast utilities. We finalized the sales agreement last week and expect to receive $323 million in cash proceeds with the buyer to assume $67 million of debt. We did not see significant additional growth potential in our Southeast utility footprint, and the earnings impact is projected to be offset with reduced interest cost. Similar to REX, we expect to use the proceeds to invest in projects with strong growth prospects. 
Finally, TDM is the third asset that no longer fits with our long-term contracted infrastructure strategy. It is currently held for sale, and we are in the midst of a sales process. 
Now pleased to turn to Slide 7. IEnova is building its position as the largest private energy company in Mexico to identify and originate new investment opportunities. IEnova is working on multiple development initiatives, including M&A, asset optimization, strategic partnerships with established companies and new companies seeking to enter the Mexican market, and emerging the opportunities in clean energy, storage and liquids infrastructure. One example of asset optimization is the building laterals of our gas pipeline network to interconnect with end users. Just this week, CFE awarded IEnova a contracted build to small lateral that connects our Sonora pipeline to a combined cycle power plant. In addition to project opportunities identified by IEnova, the CFE bidding process for natural gas pipelines continues. We are currently evaluating 2 tenders with likely bid dates during the second quarter. In generation, we expect to see the second round of renewable energy auctions in August. And in Electric Transmission, we expect to see the first 2 bids under new rules on energy reform in 2016 and 2017. Each Electric Transmission project represents an estimated $1.2 billion of investments. 
With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"

Turning to our long-term financial projections, we expect that our base plan can provide 2020 earnings of $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted earnings cater from 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Some of our key plan assumptions include an $18.5 billion capital program, including joint venture CapEx for Cameron Trains 1 to 3; full year earnings of $300 million to $350 million from Cameron Trains 1 to 3 in both 2019 and 2020; a GRC outcome in line with our proposed settlement agreement; and tax repair allowance benefits prior to 2016 being retained by shareholders; and an optional $2 billion share repurchase. Under our base plan, annual adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by $1.7 billion over the planned period, raising our FFO to debt to roughly 22%. Including our targeted annual increase in the dividend of 8% to 9%, we project excess credit capacity in the later years of our plan to be between $2 billion and $4 billion. Leaving excess capacity on our balance sheet would not maximize shareholder value. We have used a conservative assumption of an optional $2 billion share repurchase, split between 2019 and 2020. While we do include this assumption, it is our intention to allocate capital toward high-value development projects. 
I will discuss all of our base plan assumptions and provide business unit guidance at our analyst conference. I want to remind you today that our plan is not aspirational in nature. It is anchored on expected utility performance and projects that are already contracted and operating or under construction. This approach gives us high visibility and conviction in our growth rate. 
On a final note, before turning to the quarterly results, I want to address the long-term earnings impact from the REX capacity release that Debbie discussed earlier. In the base plan we presented last year, we had only assumed about $5 million to $10 million of annual losses associated with this capacity for 2016 and 2017 because we have not factored in the financial distress that several counterparties have recently experienced. We have no capacity obligations in 2020. By permanently releasing the capacity now, our new 5-year plan does not have to reflect any future losses from this capacity nor any negative impact from the recently announced counterparty bankruptcies beyond the loss we expect to record in the second quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 9. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $319 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported first quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude the $27 million after-tax loss on the pending sale of our equity interest in REX and $24 million of deferred Mexican income tax expense as a result of holding the TDM power plant for sale. In addition, just as a reminder, in 2016, we are now including LNG development expenses in our reported adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings guidance. Whereas in 2015, these were excluded. There are several factors affecting the first quarter results that are either timing items or items expected to reverse in later quarters. 
Please turn to Slide 10 and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: At our California Utilities, we had $17 million of lower earnings, mostly due to higher operating cost from higher depreciation and litigation, with no increase in authorized margin due to the delay in our GRC. As Debbie noted, until we receive a final decision, we are recording revenues based on amounts authorized for 2015. Once we receive the final decision, we will record the cumulative impact of 2016 authorized revenues back to January 1. Including this retroactive benefit, we expect the utilities' quarterly earnings would be roughly in line with last year, which is important given the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC. 
Moving to the parent category, we recorded $10 million of higher losses due to $7 million of lower repatriation tax expense that was more than offset by $10 million of higher net interest expense combined with the $5 million income tax benefit that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. At U.S. Gas & Power, we had $9 million of lower earnings due primarily to the impact of natural gas price movements on inventories that we sold forward. We expect this $9 million lost to reverse by year-end. At Sempra International, we had $8 million of lower earnings from foreign currency effects. This was due to a $4 million negative impact from South America and a $4 million higher positive impact in Mexico in Q1 2015. At SoCalGas, our Q1 '15 results included an $8 million GCIM award. No GCIM award is recorded in Q1 2016 as this award was received in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let's conclude on Slide 11. In summary, we have updated our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.60 per share to $5 per share to reflect the REX sale. The annualized impact of the REX sale will also reduce earnings by approximately $70 million per year for the next few years. Our adjusted guidance is defined in further detail in the appendix. 
In terms of our financial results. While our first quarter earnings were impacted by the delay in our GRC, we will record the retroactive authorized margin back to January 1 once the final decision is received. 
Finally, assuming the GRC outcome is consistent with the settlement agreement, we project the base plan adjusted earnings CAGR of about 12% from 2016 to 2020. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have."

First of all, we are still looking at the train 4 being developed, and so that we would anticipate having agreements in place by the end of the year, based upon conversations we've been having with the parties now, and that is not the call up our growth plan. The numbers we gave you for 2020 has nothing for any additional LNG beyond Trains 1 through 3. So we're still focused on that. We think it's a good growth opportunity for us. And then what we also think is the integrated assets, when you have such a huge demand for gas, the opportunity to develop high points to serve the loads is a really good opportunity for REX. So we continue to look at putting capital into those areas. I would also say that as you look at the opening of the energy markets in Mexico, they're at their infancy right now. They've only done sort of the gas infrastructure. We have Electric Transmission, we have pipeline for liquids, have a pipeline -- terminals to liquid, we have a lot of more energy infrastructure to come out for opportunities in Mexico. And we think we just have wonderful foundation of assets there that allows us some opportunities. And then I would say, our renewable business, we don't talk a lot about our renewables business. But we have a growing robust successful renewable business that we continue to have new projects that we find that we have the ability to expand some of our existing projects. What I would say is that we have a strategy that really focused on growing more than twice the rate or twice the rate of typical utility, but with a similar risk profile. So when we start looking at the assets, we look at, or the long-term contracted? Can they have low volatility because we know you all value low volatility with growth, and can they support our growing dividends, and can they give us the strength of the balance sheet that we're seeing over the 5 years of the plan. And so projects that kind of a pick that criteria, we're open to let things. We constantly look on the M&A, and we see some assets that may be on the market that might be of interest to us. So our strategy hasn’t changed, and we just thought that the capital that we have in some of these things was kind of trapped and was not really integrated with anything else we had, and was not going to provide the kind of growth that other investments might."

I mean, on those particular bids, what the methodology that we used was to adjust our tariff  to CFE by additional capacity that we anticipated to sell to other customers down the road. But without specifying exactly where of a pipeline we would do that, and that's basis of which they would disqualify us. And as Debbie said, we submitted 3 bids at once, used that same methodology, we're disqualified. We don't agree with it, and we challenged it. But I think we've adjusted our bidding procedure going forward. And we -- frankly, it's kind of behind us now, and we're looking at the other bids, and we have adjusted how we're doing it, and we would expect to be quite competitive in the future. So it's not something -- it was unfortunate and just the way those bids came together. But it's behind us now, and we're moving on. So I will say that I think -- talking about Mexico, in particular, we're still in a very, very good competitive position there. And I'm really pleased with the growth that we've had. It's unfortunate you don't see it quite in the financials, but our EBITDA, it was up 19% from $93 million last year to $110 million, if you include our ownership in the JV, our proportionate share of the EBITDA. And it gets mass a little bit in the GAAP reporting and because of FX. Last quarter, in 2015, in the first quarter, we had a 3% inflation with the strengthening of the peso, which actually reduced our tax expense. And in '16, it was pretty much flat, and so we didn't get that same benefit. So that kind of masked the underlying growth.

We're also looking at some of the other energy assets that are in Mexico now, some of which are in operations, some of which are in the development stage, that we could potentially acquire, and we have some that we're looking at there. And then just in terms of the broader markets opening, you have the bids coming out that are about $1.2 billion a piece for Electric Transmission that we're seeing. We have renewables being bid, and several billions worth of potential there. And then for us, since we kind of own and operate pipeline, there's a lot of liquid pipeline assets in Mexico. They're currently held by PEMEX now or needs for new liquids pipeline that deal with their opening of the oil market. And so we think that, that's a great the area for us as well to have similar type of long-term contract and infrastructure in liquids."

And then to expand those in a way that you can pick up additional customers, whether they're like generations facilities or manufacturing facilities, and really have a full pipeline. So what we tend to look at is where we have a load and where the ones that has that cloud, whether it's a utility or say a contract with PEMEX, or let's say, a contract for LNG export that we like to have access that integrate with that load. So that would be priority for looking at access as to how they could be more integrated with our business. I mean REX is fine, but it doesn't integrate with anything we had. We don’t have a 25% interest in, we did not control that. It has contracts expiring, it just really didn't fit our model. And I don't want to that to tell you what all that we're reluctant to get into other midstream assets. We are very interested in getting into those types of assets. But they need to provide us more growth. And when we look at REX, we just did not see the profile as providing the kind of growth. But there's are some interesting asset that we're starting to look at now that maybe come on market that we are already in existence. And then there's some that we foresee the need to develop that we think will be very interesting as well."

Let me just remind you all, Jeff and Dennis and their teams have been working closely with the commission on this issue. And we've tried to emphasize with them that we are very unique, that we are differentiated from some of the other utilities. And some of those things relate to our rate case was actually worked on and closed -- and officially closed by the ALJ before we made our changes in the tax treatment. And in our 2012 GRC, we offered up a sharing mechanism, much like we have in the past, and that was rejected, it was denied. So we've kind of offered up avenues for them to look at these kind of things. And as we talked about before, there's very good precedent that the savings you generate before the next rate case, for all kinds of things, tax and general operating flow to shareholders, so we think this will be resolved favorably. But let me get to the numbers that you ask about. There's 2 timing periods that are important. One is up through 2014, and then one is 2015. And I'll talk about the first period first. So from the beginning of the rate case through '14, the intervenors that applied for this suggested that we had about $90 million at each utility that they want to be adjusted through rate base. So that will be a rate base adjustment, and the impact if we loss that, we don't think we will, but if we lost that, the impact will be $6 million to $7 million in each of the utilities kind of going forward, because of that change in rate base. But then the commission asked us to put a memorandum account together for 2015 savings from this tax repair allowance. And if we were to lose that issue, we will of course repeal it and fight it. But if you were to lose it, we would have to take a charge of about $70 million, that's broken between the 2 utilities, but in total, $65 million to $70 million in total for the '15 memorandum account. Again, I think these are things that we expect to go in our favor. We're giving all kinds of data done before."

When you look -- first of all, the leak was permanently sealed back on February 18. And at the time, when you look at the number of people that were impacted, it was really the vast majority of the households around Aliso Canyon, they never left. They stayed at their homes, everything was safe and everything. So it was a smaller number, to begin with. But since then, we've had over 54% of any impacted residents that have actually gone back to their homes. And every week, we're seeing more and more. So to give you an actual run rate is difficult because, as Debbie said, we're doing things within our program that allow us to -- and help the residents move say from hotels to corporate-style apartments, more family-situated apartments with kitchens where they can cook and everything, and that helps bring down the cost. The other things that we're doing is we've been offering in-home cleaning services to give further assurance to residents that everything's safe. So while we haven't given an official run rate, what we can tell you is that the number that we gave out for -- $655 million assumed relocation expenses through June 7. And as we said, we expect to get additional information from the Department of Public Health this month regarding their testing. And I think that type of information will even further get people more comfortable that they can get home, and we'll see the numbers continue to drop week after week."

Now what we are seeing and this was incorporated into our assumptions, is that as we're cleaning more homes, people are going home, they were even more comfortable that their homes are safe and everything. So we are seeing more and more people go home that way. The other thing that we've been doing that we incorporated into our assumptions is as we're able to locate more of the family-style corporate housing options within the area, we're transitioning more people from hotels where they're also receiving per [indiscernible] to these corporate apartments, where they have their kitchens and we don't have to pay the per [indiscernible]. So those are the types -- and that's the part of the program that we have, that's part of the approved program. So that helped reduce the overall cost as well. So all those things are built into it.

So we try to use conservative assumptions for that. But then we show you all the development projects. And in this time, we thought that using the assumption of the buyback is conservative because we wouldn't be sitting there with 22% FFO to debt on our balance sheet and not do something with it. What we fully expect in the next 5 years that we will have projects that will have a much better return than what we're showing you with the stock buyback. But we have -- we have wonderful flexibility. To be able to show you 5 years what we have long-term contracted that yields that kind of a growth rate, and gives us the strength of the balance sheet, that gives us the flexibility if we were not to find projects, buyback stock, which we don't think is going to be an outcome, because we have a robust backlog of projects that we're working on. But it's just a wonderful position to be in.

Therefore, today, we are updating our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance and providing you with our long-term growth rate, assuming a GRC outcome consistent with the settlement. 
We think the best approach is to postpone our analyst conference until we have a final GRC decision. We are tentatively looking at the month of July in New York City as a possible date for the conference. Once we receive a PD, we will confirm the date and location. 
In our other businesses, we recently announced the sale of our Southeast utilities and our interest in REX. We expect to receive about $760 million of cash proceeds to invest in projects that align better with our growth strategy. As you know, our strategy is to provide growth that is roughly twice that of the utility average but with a commensurate risk profile. I will discuss these transactions later on the call. 
Our updated 2016 adjusted guidance range is now $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects approximately $60 million of reduced earnings from REX. The sale of our Southeast utilities does not affect current or future earnings, since earnings reduced from the sale can largely be offset by lower interest costs.
Looking forward, we are well positioned for strong growth over the next 5 years. We expect our base plan to provide earnings in 2020 of $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted compound annual growth rate for 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Prior to the sale of REX, the comparable growth rate would have been about 11%. Joe will address the growth rate further in his remarks, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have significant credit capacity in the latter years of our plan, which will provide us with flexibility and capital allocation. We will discuss our plan assumptions, business unit projections and growth strategy in more depth once we reschedule the analyst conference. 
Turning to our financial results. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $370 million. As a reminder, until we receive a final GRC, we are recording revenues based upon 2015 authorized amounts. Once we receive a final decision, we will record the impact of the 2016 authorized margin back to January 1. If the GRC had been finalized by January 1 and was consistent with the settlement agreement, Utilities' first quarter earnings would have been in line with last year, despite the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC. 
Now please turn to Slide 5. There are several updates related to Aliso Canyon. First, SoCalGas is cooperating with DOGGR and the CPUC on the root cause investigation through their contractor, Blade Energy Partners. We expect the investigation to take about 6 to 9 months with the results being issued by the agencies late this year or early next year. 
Second, we are working to get the field back in service for injection. Consistent with DOGGR's proposed safety review, we have implemented a plan to prioritize and test wells, with a goal to have the facility in service by the end of this summer.
Third, we are working with state and local agencies to address electric reliability concerns. Aliso Canyon currently has about 15 Bcf of gas available for withdrawal. When deciding how best to use that gas, reliability for both the summer and winter seasons must be considered. 
Fourth, we are completing our estimate of the total amount of gas lost from the leak and formulating a plan to mitigate that amount. 
Fifth, the temporary relocation program has been extended to allow the county to complete in-home testing, which results expected this month. SoCalGas and public agencies have conducted numerous tests of outdoor air quality. Results continue to confirm that air quality in Porter Ranch is at normal levels. 
Finally, we are addressing the litigations that has been filed related to the leak. 
With regards to cost, we have incurred additional amounts, primarily from continuation of the temporary relocation program as ordered by the court. The court has scheduled a follow appearing on June 7. Based on an expectation that the relocation program continues through June 7, we estimate the cost for amounts paid and forecast to be paid at approximately $665 million. We have recorded an insurance receivable of $660 million. Our cost estimate does not include certain potential items as described on the slide. Please refer to our 2015 10-K and first quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on cost and our insurance. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our other businesses. Sempra constantly looks at our assets to determine whether they fit with our long-term contracted infrastructure model and whether they integrate with other assets to offer strong long-term growth prospects. We identified 3 assets that are no longer a strategic fit for us: REX, our Southeast utilities and the TdM power plant in Mexico. For the first 2, we have announced sales agreement; and for TdM, we are conducting a sales process. 
For REX, we expect the sale of our equity interest to close in the second quarter and to provide $440 million in proceeds. The sale also allows us to forego expected future contributions for capital investment and debt repayments. We believe our capital can be better utilized to further enhance our strong growth outlook. 
As a result of the sale, we forecast the reduction for partial year 2016 earnings of approximately $60 million, which is included in our adjusted EPS range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. It is important to note that had we held our interest in REX, we expected 2020 earnings to be immaterial and dilute our growth, largely due to loss of earnings from west-to-east contracts that expire in 2019. 
In addition, we plan to permanently release uncontracted capacity held by Sempra. The negative earnings impact of this capacity release is projected to be between $100 million and $120 million, and will be recorded in the second quarter. This amount reflects the acceleration of estimated losses that would have otherwise been realized over the remaining contract term. It is excluded from our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. 
Moving to our Southeast utilities. We finalized the sales agreement last week and expect to receive $323 million in cash proceeds with the buyer to assume $67 million of debt. We did not see significant additional growth potential in our Southeast utility footprint, and the earnings impact is projected to be offset with reduced interest costs. Similar to REX, we expect to use the proceeds to invest in projects with stronger growth prospects. 
Finally, TdM is the third asset that no longer fits with our long-term contracted infrastructure strategy. It is currently held for sale, and we are in the midst of a sales process. 
Now pleased to turn to Slide 7. IEnova's building upon its position as the largest private energy company in Mexico to identify and originate new investment opportunities. IEnova is working on multiple development initiatives: including M&A; asset optimization; strategic partnerships with established companies and new companies seeking to enter the Mexican market; and emerging the opportunities in clean energy, storage and liquids infrastructure. 
One example of asset optimization is the building of laterals of our gas pipeline network to interconnect with end users. Just this week, CFE awarded IEnova a contract to build to small lateral that connects our Sonora pipeline to a combined-cycle power plant. In addition to project opportunities identified by IEnova, the CFE bidding process for natural gas pipelines continues. We are currently evaluating 2 tenders with likely bid dates during the second quarter. 
In generation, we expect to see the second round of renewable energy auctions in August. And in Electric Transmission, we expect to see the first 2 bids under new rules on energy reform in 2016 and 2017. Each Electric Transmission project represents an estimated $1.2 billion of investment.
With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"

Turning to our long-term financial projections, we expect that our base plan can provide 2020 earnings of $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted earnings CAGR from 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Some of our key plan assumptions include an $18.5 billion capital program, including joint venture CapEx for Cameron trains 1 through 3; full year earnings of $300 million to $350 million from Cameron trains 1 through 3 in both 2019 and 2020; a GRC outcome in line with our proposed settlement agreement; and tax repair allowance benefits prior to 2016 being retained by shareholders; and an optional $2 billion share repurchase.
Under our base plan, annual adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by $1.7 billion over the plan period, raising our FFO to debt to roughly 22%. Including our targeted annual increase in the dividend of 8% to 9%, we project excess credit capacity in the later years of our plan to be between $2 billion and $4 billion. 
Leaving excess capacity on our balance sheet would not maximize shareholder value. We have used a conservative assumption of an optional $2 billion share repurchase, split between 2019 and 2020. While we do include this assumption, it is our intention to allocate capital toward high-value development projects. 
I will discuss all of our base plan assumptions and provide business unit guidance at our analyst conference. I want to remind you today that our plan is not aspirational in nature. It is anchored on expected utility performance and projects that are already contracted and operating or under construction. This approach gives us high visibility and conviction in our growth rate. 
On a final note, before turning to the quarterly results, I want to address the long-term earnings impact from the REX capacity release that Debbie discussed earlier. In the base plan we presented last year, we had only assumed about $5 million to $10 million of annual losses associated with this capacity for 2016 and 2017 because we had not factored in the financial distress that several counterparties have recently experienced. We had no capacity obligations in 2020. By permanently releasing the capacity now, our new 5-year plan does not have to reflect any future losses from this capacity nor any negative impact from the recently announced counterparty bankruptcies beyond the loss we expect to record in the second quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 9. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $319 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported first quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude the $27 million after-tax loss on the pending sale of our equity interest in REX and $24 million of deferred Mexican income tax expense as a result of holding the TdM power plant for sale. 
In addition, just as a reminder, in 2016, we are now including LNG development expenses in our reported adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings guidance, whereas in 2015, these were excluded. There are several factors affecting the first quarter results that are either timing items or items expected to reverse in later quarters. 
Please turn to Slide 10 and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items. At our California Utilities, we had $17 million of lower earnings, mostly due to higher operating cost from higher depreciation and litigation, with no increase in authorized margin due to the delay in our GRC. As Debbie noted, until we receive a final decision, we are recording revenues based on amounts authorized for 2015. Once we receive the final decision, we will record the cumulative impact of 2016 authorized revenues back to January 1. Including this retroactive benefit, we expect the Utilities' quarterly earnings would be roughly in line with last year, which is important, given the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC. 
Moving to the parent category, we recorded $10 million of higher losses due to $7 million of lower repatriation tax expense that was more than offset by $10 million of higher net interest expense combined with the $5 million income tax benefit that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. 
At U.S. Gas & Power, we had $9 million of lower earnings due primarily to the impact of natural gas price movements on inventories that we sold forward. We expect this $9 million lost to reverse by year-end. 
At Sempra International, we had $8 million of lower earnings from foreign currency effects. This was due to a $4 million negative impact in South America and a $4 million higher positive impact in Mexico in Q1 2015. 
At SoCalGas, our Q1 '15 results included an $8 million GCIM award. No GCIM award was recorded in Q1 2016 as this award was received in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let's conclude on Slide 11. In summary, we have updated our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.60 per share to $5 per share to reflect the REX sale. The annualized impact of the REX sale will also reduce earnings by approximately $70 million per year for the next few years. Our adjusted guidance is defined in further detail in the appendix. 
In terms of our financial results. While our first quarter earnings were impacted by the delay in our GRC, we will record the retroactive authorized margin back to January 1 once the final decision is received. 
Finally, assuming the GRC outcome is consistent with the settlement agreement, we project the base plan adjusted earnings CAGR of about 12% from 2016 to 2020. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have."

And obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity right now in the space, there's a lot opportunities. But we have a lot of organic growth as well, so let me talk about some of those things. First of all, we are still looking at the train 4 being developed. And so that we would anticipate having agreements in place by the end of the year, based upon conversations we've been having with the parties now. And that is not at all in our growth plans. So the numbers we gave you for 2020 has nothing for any additional LNG beyond trains 1 through 3. So we still focus on that. We think it's a good growth opportunity for us. And then what we also think is the integrated assets. When you have such a huge demand for gas, the opportunity to develop pipelines and storage to serve those loads is a really good opportunity for us so we continue to look at putting capital into those areas. I would also say that as you look at the opening of the energy markets in Mexico, they're at the infancy right now. They've only done some of the gas infrastructure. We have Electric Transmission. We have pipelines for liquids. We have a pipelines -- or terminals to liquids. We have a lot of more energy infrastructure to come out for opportunities in Mexico. And we think we just have wonderful foundation of assets there that allows with some opportunity. And then I would say, our renewable business -- we don't talk a lot about our renewable business. But we had a growing, robust, successful renewable business that we continue to have new projects that we find, and we have the ability to expand on some of our existing projects. What I would say is that we have a strategy that's really focused on growing at more than twice the rate or twice the rate of the typical utility, but with a similar risk profile. So when we start looking at the assets, we look at are they long-term contracted? Can they have low volatility? Because we know you all value low volatility with growth. And can they support our growing dividends? And can they give us the strength of the balance sheet that we're seeing over the 5 years of the plan? And so projects that kind of fit that criteria, we're open to a lot of things. We constantly look on the M&A, and we see some assets that may be on the market that might be of interest to us. So our strategy hasn't changed, and we just thought that the capital that we had in some of these things was kind of trapped and was not really integrated with anything else we had, and was not going to provide us the kind of growth that other investments might."

And as Debbie said, we submitted 3 bids at once, used that same methodology where we're disqualified. We don't agree with it, and we've challenged it. But I think we've adjusted our bidding procedure going forward. And we -- frankly, it's kind of behind us now. And we're looking at the other bids, and we have adjusted how we're doing it. We would expect to be quite competitive in the future. So it's not something -- it was unfortunate in just the way those bids came together. But it's behind us now, and we're moving on. But I will say that I think -- talking about Mexico, in particular, it's -- we're still in a very, very good competitive position there. And I'm really pleased with the growth that we've had. It's unfortunate that you don't see it quite in the financials. But our EBITDA there was up 19% from $93 million last year to $110 million, if you include our ownership in the JV -- I mean, our proportionate share of their EBITDA. And it gets masked a little bit in the GAAP reporting and because of FX. Last quarter, in 2015, in the first quarter, we had a 3% inflation with -- or strengthening of the peso, which actually reduced our tax expense. And in '16, it was pretty much flat, and so we didn't get that same benefit. So that kind of masked the underlying growth.

We're also looking at some of the other energy assets that are in Mexico now, some of which are in operations, some of which are in the development stage, that we could potentially acquire. And we have some that we're looking at there. And then just in terms of the broader markets opening, you have the bids coming out that are about $1.2 billion a piece for Electric Transmission that we're seeing. We have renewables being bid, and several billions worth of potential there. And then for us, since we kind of own and operate pipelines, there's a lot of liquid pipeline assets in Mexico.

And then to expand those in a way that you can pick up additional customers, whether they're electric generation facilities or manufacturing facilities, and really have a full pipeline. So what we tend to look at is where we have a load and where the ones that has that load, whether it's a utility or it's a contract with PEMEX or it's a contract for LNG export, that we like to have assets that integrate with that load. And so that would be kind of our priority for looking at access, it's to how they could be more integrated with our business. I mean REX is fine. But it doesn't integrate with anything we had. We only had the 25% interest in it. We didn't control it. It had contracts expiring. It just really didn't fit our model. And I don't want that to tell you at all that we're reluctant to get into other midstream assets. We are very interested in getting into those types of assets. But they need to provide us more growth. And when we look at REX, we just did not see the profile as providing the kind of growth. But there's some interesting assets that we're starting to look at now, that maybe come on market that we -- are already in existence. And then there's some that we foresee the need to develop that we think would be very interesting as well."

So then when we looked at this and we thought with all the projects we have under contract and what that would yield, and then looking at the cash flows we have coming from the projects that are in service at the time and what that did to our FFO to debt, we just said there's no way we would sit with that FFO to debt on our balance sheet at that time. So what's of the most conservative assumption we could put in and decided that to do a stock buyback were the most conservative way to handle it. So I'm going to turn it to Joe to talk a bit more about how you might think about that in your question."

I do think both economies, probably Chile more than Peru, but both economies have been affected by the downturn in the mining sector, and effectively China's downturn. And so I think that's hurt their overall growth. But I think when you look at them, where they've been historically and what the expectation is for this year and next year, we still see strong underlying growth that you just don't see in any domestic utilities. You still see the 3%, 4% customer growth and 3%, 4% energy growth coming back. And we -- I think with the recession, we've had a little bit of a downturn there. But it's -- we see that coming back. And then on top of that, we see some large infrastructure needs, which really wouldn't be available to us if we weren't active in that market, in the utility market there. We just wouldn't have a presence to be able to capitalize on those. And so we're -- I think, we're -- again, we don't put those in our plan because we don't have them signed up yet. But we're close on several things, and I think it looks promising. It looks like there's definitely some activity level that's going to be happening down there that'll increase the growth for those facilities."

The -- let me talk about the rate case though, while he's getting the precise numbers on that. What I would say is on the GRC, that we've been given every indication that we should be getting a decision soon. And that we're expecting, since we had 8 out of 11 parties sign on to the settlement, that we would likely get the settlement as the outcome. We would also expect to get the repair allowance because we feel like we have very strong argument and have differentiated ourselves in terms of how we handled it in our rate cases going forward and returning the benefits to customers. And so we would anticipate getting a decision hopefully very soon and that very consistent with the settlement. And what we've been told is that the paying up and the delay is not any different than what you're hearing from other utilities commenting on their proceedings is that there's just a lack of resources at the commission right now, especially in the ALJ division to get some out these things out as quickly as they would like. And so we anticipated that it would come earlier. But -- that we continue to be told it will be soon, and that it is really more hung up because of their resource issue. Okay, Joe?"

And we've tried to emphasize with them that we have very unique facts that we are differentiated from some of the other utilities. And some of those things relate to -- our rate case was actually worked on and closed -- and officially closed by the ALJ before we made our changes in the tax treatment. And in our 2012 GRC, we offered up a sharing mechanism, much like we have in the past, and that was rejected. It was denied. So we've kind of offered up avenues for them to look at these kind of things. And as we've talked about before, there's very good precedent that the savings you generate before the next rate case were all kinds of things, tax, general operating flow to shareholders. So we think this will be resolved favorably. But let me get to the numbers that you asked about. There's 2 timing periods that are important: one is up through 2014 and then one is 2015. And I'll talk about the first period first. So from the beginning of the rate case through '14, the intervenors that applied for this suggested that we had about $90 million at each utility that they want to be adjusted through rate base. So that would be a rate base adjustment. And the impact, if we loss that -- we don't think we will. But if we lost that, the impact would be $6 million to $7 million in each of the utilities kind of going forward because of that change in rate base. But then, the commission asked us to put a memorandum account together for 2015 savings from this tax repair allowance. And if we were to lose that issue, we will of course appeal it and fight it. But if we were to lose it, we would have to take a charge of about $70 million. That's broken between the 2 utilities. But in total, $65 million to $70 million in total for the '15 memorandum account. Again, I think these are things that we expect to go in our favor. We're giving you all the data done before."

And at the time, when you look at the number of people that were impacted, it was really a -- the vast majority of the households around Aliso Canyon, they never left. They stayed at their homes. Everything was safe and everything. So it was a smaller number to begin with. But since then, we've had over 54% of any impacted residents that have actually gone back to their homes. And every week, we're seeing more and more. So to give you an actual run rate is difficult because, as Debbie said, we're doing things within our program that allow us to -- and help the residents move, say, from hotels to corporate-style apartments, more family-situated apartments with kitchens where they can cook and everything, and that helps bring down the cost. The other things that we're doing is we've been offering in-home cleaning services to give further assurance to residents that everything's safe. So while we haven't given an official run rate, what we can tell you is that the number that we gave out for -- the $655 million assumed relocation expenses through June 7. And as we said, we expect to get additional information from the Department of Public Health this month regarding their testing.

The other thing that we've been doing, that we incorporated into our assumptions is as we're able to locate more of the family-style corporate housing options within the area, we're transitioning more people from hotels where they're also receiving Per Diem to these corporate apartments, where they have their kitchens and we don't have to pay the Per Dies. So those are the types of -- and that's part of the program that we have. That's part of the approved program. So that helps reduce the overall cost as well.

But it's just a wonderful position to be in. And honestly, this is what I was going to talk about at the analyst meeting. Because it's -- not too many others can talk about having a strengthening balance sheet, having this type of a 12% growth rate with conservative assumptions and then having the ability to grow the dividend by 8% to 9% over that 5-year period of time, with nothing else. So that was going to be a lot of my presentation. I'm -- kind of close to even kind of what we're going to be talking about. But it's a really great position to be in. And since we didn't do the analyst conference, we wanted you to all understand where we stood relative to that. And we'll go into a lot more detail, as we always do, when we get to the conference."

On today's call, we are following a slightly different format. As you know, the final GRC decision for our California Utilities has not been issued. However, we expect to receive a proposed decision relatively soon. Because we have reached a",1419,"Thanks, Rick. On today's call, we are following a slightly different format. As you know, the final GRC decision for our California Utilities has not been issued. However, we expect to receive a proposed decision relatively soon. Because we have reached a multiparty settlement agreement, we continue to believe the most likely GRC outcome is one consistent without settlement. We also believe we have made a strong showing to support our historical treatment of tax repair allowance benefits. Therefore, today, we are updating our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance and providing you with our long-term growth rate, assuming a GRC outcome consistent with the settlement. 
We think the best approach is to postpone our analyst conference until we have a final GRC decision. We are tentatively looking at the month of July in New York City as a possible date for the conference. Once we receive a PD, we will confirm the date and location. 
In our other businesses, we recently announced the sale of our Southeast utilities and our interest in REX. We expect to receive about $760 million of cash proceeds to invest in projects that align better with our growth strategy. As you know, our strategy is to provide growth that is roughly twice that of the utility average but with a commensurate risk profile. I will discuss these transactions later on the call. 
Our updated 2016 adjusted guidance range is now $4.60 per share to $5 per share. This range reflects approximately $60 million of reduced earnings from REX. The sale of our Southeast utilities does not affect current or future earnings, since earnings reduced from the sale can largely be offset by lower interest costs.
Looking forward, we are well positioned for strong growth over the next 5 years. We expect our base plan to provide earnings in 2020 of $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted compound annual growth rate for 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Prior to the sale of REX, the comparable growth rate would have been about 11%. Joe will address the growth rate further in his remarks, but I want to emphasize that we expect to have significant credit capacity in the latter years of our plan, which will provide us with flexibility in capital allocation. We will discuss our plan assumptions, business unit projections and growth strategy in more depth once we reschedule the analyst conference. 
Turning to our financial results. We reported first quarter adjusted earnings of $370 million. As a reminder, until we receive a final GRC, we are recording revenues based upon 2015 authorized amounts. Once we receive a final decision, we will record the impact of the 2016 authorized margin back to January 1. If the GRC had been finalized by January 1 and was consistent with the settlement agreement, Utilities' first quarter earnings would have been in line with last year, despite the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC. 
Now please turn to Slide 5. There are several updates related to Aliso Canyon. First, SoCalGas is cooperating with DOGGR and the CPUC on the root cause investigation through their contractor, Blade Energy Partners. We expect the investigation to take about 6 to 9 months with the results being issued by the agencies late this year or early next year. 
Second, we are working to get the field back in service for injection. Consistent with DOGGR's proposed safety review, we have implemented a plan to prioritize and test wells, with a goal to have the facility in service by the end of this summer.
Third, we are working with state and local agencies to address electric reliability concerns. Aliso Canyon currently has about 15 Bcf of gas available for withdrawal. When deciding how best to use that gas, reliability for both the summer and winter seasons must be considered. 
Fourth, we are completing our estimate of the total amount of gas lost from the leak and formulating a plan to mitigate that amount. 
Fifth, the temporary relocation program has been extended to allow the county to complete in-home testing, which results expected this month. SoCalGas and public agencies have conducted numerous tests of outdoor air quality. Results continue to confirm that air quality in Porter Ranch is at normal levels. 
Finally, we are addressing the litigations that has been filed related to the leak. 
With regards to cost, we have incurred additional amounts, primarily from continuation of the temporary relocation program as ordered by the court. The court has scheduled a follow appearing on June 7. Based on an expectation that the relocation program continues through June 7, we estimate the cost for amounts paid and forecast to be paid at approximately $665 million. We have recorded an insurance receivable of $660 million. Our cost estimate does not include certain potential items as described on the slide. Please refer to our 2015 10-K and first quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on cost and our insurance. 
Now let's turn to Slide 6 for an update on our other businesses. Sempra constantly looks at our assets to determine whether they fit with our long-term contracted infrastructure model and whether they integrate with other assets to offer strong long-term growth prospects. We identified 3 assets that are no longer a strategic fit for us: REX, our Southeast utilities and the TdM power plant in Mexico. For the first 2, we have announced sales agreement; and for TdM, we are conducting a sales process. 
For REX, we expect the sale of our equity interest to close in the second quarter and to provide $440 million in proceeds. The sale also allows us to forego expected future contributions for capital investment and debt repayments. We believe our capital can be better utilized to further enhance our strong growth outlook. 
As a result of the sale, we forecast the reduction for partial year 2016 earnings of approximately $60 million, which is included in our adjusted EPS range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. It is important to note that had we held our interest in REX, we expected 2020 earnings to be immaterial and dilute our growth, largely due to loss of earnings from west-to-east contracts that expire in 2019. 
In addition, we plan to permanently release uncontracted capacity held by Sempra. The negative earnings impact of this capacity release is projected to be between $100 million and $120 million, and will be recorded in the second quarter. This amount reflects the acceleration of estimated losses that would have otherwise been realized over the remaining contract term. It is excluded from our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance. 
Moving to our Southeast utilities. We finalized the sales agreement last week and expect to receive $323 million in cash proceeds with the buyer to assume $67 million of debt. We did not see significant additional growth potential in our Southeast utility footprint, and the earnings impact is projected to be offset with reduced interest costs. Similar to REX, we expect to use the proceeds to invest in projects with stronger growth prospects. 
Finally, TdM is the third asset that no longer fits with our long-term contracted infrastructure strategy. It is currently held for sale, and we are in the midst of a sales process. 
Now please turn to Slide 7. IEnova's building upon its position as the largest private energy company in Mexico to identify and originate new investment opportunities. IEnova is working on multiple development initiatives: including M&A; asset optimization; strategic partnerships with established companies and new companies seeking to enter the Mexican market; and emerging the opportunities in clean energy, storage and liquids infrastructure. 
One example of asset optimization is the building of laterals of our gas pipeline network to interconnect with end users. Just this week, CFE awarded IEnova a contract to build to small lateral that connects our Sonora pipeline to a combined-cycle power plant. In addition to project opportunities identified by IEnova, the CFE bidding process for natural gas pipelines continues. We are currently evaluating 2 tenders with likely bid dates during the second quarter. 
In generation, we expect to see the second round of renewable energy auctions in August. And in Electric Transmission, we expect to see the first 2 bids under new rules on energy reform in 2016 and 2017. Each Electric Transmission project represents an estimated $1.2 billion of investment.
With that, please turn to Slide 8, and I'll turn the call over to Joe. Joe?"

Turning to our long-term financial projections, we expect that our base plan can provide 2020 earnings of $7.20 per share to $7.80 per share. The resulting adjusted earnings CAGR from 2016 to 2020 is about 12%. Some of our key plan assumptions include an $18.5 billion capital program, including joint venture CapEx for Cameron trains 1 through 3; full year earnings of $300 million to $350 million from Cameron trains 1 through 3 in both 2019 and 2020; a GRC outcome in line with our proposed settlement agreement; and tax repair allowance benefits prior to 2016 being retained by shareholders; and an optional $2 billion share repurchase.
Under our base plan, annual adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by $1.7 billion over the plan period, raising our FFO to debt to roughly 22%. Including our targeted annual increase in the dividend of 8% to 9%, we project excess credit capacity in the later years of our plan to be between $2 billion and $4 billion. 
Leaving excess capacity on our balance sheet would not maximize shareholder value. We have used a conservative assumption of an optional $2 billion share repurchase, split between 2019 and 2020. While we do include this assumption, it is our intention to allocate capital toward high-value development projects. 
I will discuss all of our base plan assumptions and provide business unit guidance at our analyst conference. I want to remind you today that our plan is not aspirational in nature. It is anchored on expected utility performance and projects that are already contracted and operating or under construction. This approach gives us high visibility and conviction in our growth rate. 
On a final note, before turning to the quarterly results, I want to address the long-term earnings impact from the REX capacity release that Debbie discussed earlier. In the base plan we presented last year, we had only assumed about $5 million to $10 million of annual losses associated with this capacity for 2016 and 2017 because we had not factored in the financial distress that several counterparties have recently experienced. We had no capacity obligations in 2020. By permanently releasing the capacity now, our new 5-year plan does not have to reflect any future losses from this capacity nor any negative impact from the recently announced counterparty bankruptcies beyond the loss we expect to record in the second quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 9. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $319 million. On an adjusted basis, we reported first quarter earnings of $370 million or $1.47 per share. Adjusted earnings this quarter exclude the $27 million after-tax loss on the pending sale of our equity interest in REX and $24 million of deferred Mexican income tax expense as a result of holding the TdM power plant for sale. 
In addition, just as a reminder, in 2016, we are now including LNG development expenses in our reported adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings guidance, whereas in 2015, these were excluded. There are several factors affecting the first quarter results that are either timing items or items expected to reverse in later quarters. 
Please turn to Slide 10 and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings. Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items. At our California Utilities, we had $17 million of lower earnings, mostly due to higher operating cost from higher depreciation and litigation, with no increase in authorized margin due to the delay in our GRC. As Debbie noted, until we receive a final decision, we are recording revenues based on amounts authorized for 2015. Once we receive the final decision, we will record the cumulative impact of 2016 authorized revenues back to January 1. Including this retroactive benefit, we expect the Utilities' quarterly earnings would be roughly in line with last year, which is important, given the fact that approximately $60 million of annual tax repair benefits will now flow to customers under the new GRC. 
Moving to the parent category, we recorded $10 million of higher losses due to $7 million of lower repatriation tax expense that was more than offset by $10 million of higher net interest expense combined with the $5 million income tax benefit that was recorded in the first quarter of 2015. 
At U.S. Gas & Power, we had $9 million of lower earnings due primarily to the impact of natural gas price movements on inventories that we sold forward. We expect this $9 million lost to reverse by year-end. 
At Sempra International, we had $8 million of lower earnings from foreign currency effects. This was due to a $4 million negative impact in South America and a $4 million higher positive impact in Mexico in Q1 2015. 
At SoCalGas, our Q1 '15 results included an $8 million GCIM award. No GCIM award was recorded in Q1 2016 as this award was received in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let's conclude on Slide 11. In summary, we have updated our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance to $4.60 per share to $5 per share to reflect the REX sale. The annualized impact of the REX sale will also reduce earnings by approximately $70 million per year for the next few years. Our adjusted guidance is defined in further detail in the appendix. 
In terms of our financial results. While our first quarter earnings were impacted by the delay in our GRC, we will record the retroactive authorized margin back to January 1 once the final decision is received. 
Finally, assuming the GRC outcome is consistent with the settlement agreement, we project the base plan adjusted earnings CAGR of about 12% from 2016 to 2020. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take any questions you may have."

And in 2019, will be the first full year of Cameron trains 1 through 3 going into service. Those trains remain on schedule to be completed throughout 2018, as we've told you before. So 2019, you'll see that come into 2019. And so 2019 will be lumpy in comparison to 2018. And 2018 will be lumpy when compared to 2017 as the trains kind of service."

And obviously, there's a lot of M&A activity right now in the space, there's a lot opportunities. But we have a lot of organic growth as well, so let me talk about some of those things. First of all, we are still looking at the train 4 being developed. And so that we would anticipate having agreements in place by the end of the year, based upon conversations we've been having with the parties now. And that is not at all in our growth plans. So the numbers we gave you for 2020 has nothing for any additional LNG beyond trains 1 through 3. So we still focus on that. We think it's a good growth opportunity for us. And then what we also think is the integrated assets. When you have such a huge demand for gas, the opportunity to develop pipelines and storage to serve those loads is a really great opportunity for us so we continue to look at putting capital into those areas. I would also say that as you look at the opening of the energy markets in Mexico, they're at the infancy right now. They've only done some of the gas infrastructure. We have Electric Transmission. We have pipelines for liquids. We have a pipelines -- or terminals for liquids. We have a lot of more energy infrastructure to come out for opportunities in Mexico. And we think we just have wonderful foundation of assets there that allows us some opportunity. And then I would say, our renewable business -- we don't talk a lot about our renewable business. But we had a growing, robust, successful renewable business that we continue to have new projects that we find, and we have the ability to expand on some of our existing projects. What I would say is that we have a strategy that's really focused on growing at more than twice the rate or twice the rate of the typical utility, but with a similar risk profile. So when we start looking at the assets, we look at are they long-term contracted? Can they have low volatility? Because we know you all value low volatility with growth. And can they support our growing dividends? And can they give us the strength of the balance sheet that we're seeing over the 5 years of the plan? And so projects that kind of fit that criteria, we're open to a lot of things. We constantly look on the M&A, and we see some assets that may be on the market that might be of interest to us. So our strategy hasn't changed, and we just thought that the capital that we had in some of these things was kind of trapped and was not really integrated with anything else we had, and was not going to provide us the kind of growth that other investments might."

And as Debbie said, we submitted 3 bids at once, used that same methodology where we're disqualified. We don't agree with it, and we've challenged it. But I think we've adjusted our bidding procedure going forward. And we -- frankly, it's kind of behind us now. And we're looking at the other bids, and we have adjusted how we're doing it. We would expect to be quite competitive in the future. So it's not something -- it was unfortunate in just the way those bids came together. But it's behind us now, and we're moving on. But I will say that I think -- talking about Mexico, in particular, it's -- we're still in a very, very good competitive position there. And I'm really pleased with the growth that we've had. It's unfortunate that you don't see it quite in the financials. But our EBITDA there was up 19% from $93 million last year to $110 million, if you include our ownership in the JV -- I mean, our proportionate share of their EBITDA. And it gets masked a little bit in the GAAP reporting and because of FX. Last quarter, in 2015, in the first quarter, we had a 3% inflation with -- or strengthening of the peso, which actually reduced our tax expense. And in '16, it was pretty much flat, and so we didn't get that same benefit. So that kind of masked the underlying growth. But we had very strong growth there, and are in a very good and competitive position in Mexico."

But as you probably read, now PEMEX is looking at other potential asset sales, and they have a number of assets that we would be interested in that would give us some opportunities. We're also looking at some of the other energy assets that are in Mexico now, some of which are in operations, some of which are in the development stage, that we could potentially acquire. And we have some that we're looking at there. And then just in terms of the broader markets opening, you have the bids coming out that are about $1.2 billion a piece for Electric Transmission that we're seeing. We have renewables being bid, and several billions worth of potential there. And then for us, since we kind of own and operate pipelines, there's a lot of liquid pipeline assets in Mexico. They're currently held by PEMEX now or needs for new liquids pipeline that deal with their opening of the oil markets. And so we think that, that's a great area for us as well to have similar type of long-term contract and infrastructure in liquids."

And that -- when you have a huge load, like building an LNG facility, that gives you the opportunity to build pipelines and storage to serve that load, that integrate with others. And then to expand those in a way that you can pick up additional customers, whether they're electric generation facilities or manufacturing facilities, and really have a full pipeline. So what we tend to look at is where we have a load and where the ones that has that load, whether it's a utility or it's a contract with PEMEX or it's a contract for LNG export, that we like to have assets that integrate with that load. And so that would be kind of our priority for looking at access, it's to how they could be more integrated with our business. I mean REX is fine. But it doesn't integrate with anything we had. We only had the 25% interest in it. We didn't control it. It had contracts expiring. It just really didn't fit our model. And I don't want that to tell you at all that we're reluctant to get into other midstream assets. We are very interested in getting into those types of assets. But they need to provide us more growth. And when we look at REX, we just did not see the profile as providing the kind of growth. But there's some interesting assets that we're starting to look at now, that maybe come on market that we -- are already in existence. And then there's some that we foresee the need to develop that we think would be very interesting as well."

So then when we looked at this and we thought with all the projects we have under contract and what that would yield, and then looking at the cash flows we have coming from the projects that are in service at the time and what that did to our FFO to debt, we just said there's no way we would sit with that FFO to debt on our balance sheet at that time.

I do think both economies, probably Chile more than Peru, but both economies have been affected by the downturn in the mining sector, and effectively China's downturn. And so I think that's hurt their overall growth. But I think when you look at them, where they've been historically and what the expectation is for this year and next year, we still see strong underlying growth that you just don't see in any domestic utilities. You still see the 3%, 4% customer growth and 3%, 4% energy growth coming back. And we -- I think with the recession, we've had a little bit of a downturn there. But it's -- we see that coming back. And then on top of that, we see some large infrastructure needs, which really wouldn't be available to us if we weren't active in that market, in the utility market there. We just wouldn't have a presence to be able to capitalize on those. And so we're -- I think, we're -- again, we don't put those in our plan because we don't have them signed up yet.

The -- let me talk about the rate case though, while he's getting the precise numbers on that. What I would say is on the GRC, that we've been given every indication that we should be getting a decision soon. And that we're expecting, since we had 8 out of 11 parties sign on to the settlement, that we would likely get the settlement as the outcome. We would also expect to get the repair allowance because we feel like we have very strong argument and have differentiated ourselves in terms of how we handled it in our rate cases going forward and returning the benefits to customers. And so we would anticipate getting a decision hopefully very soon and that very consistent with the settlement. And what we've been told is that the paying up and the delay is not any different than what you're hearing from other utilities commenting on their proceedings is that there's just a lack of resources at the commission right now, especially in the ALJ division to get some out these things out as quickly as they would like. And so we anticipated that it would come earlier. But -- that we continue to be told it will be soon, and that it is really more hung up because of their resource issue. Okay, Joe?"

And we've tried to emphasize with them that we have very unique facts that are differentiated from some of the other utilities. And some of those things relate to -- our rate case was actually worked on and closed and officially closed by the ALJ before we made our changes in the tax treatment. And in our 2012 GRC, we offered up a sharing mechanism, much like we have in the past, and that was rejected. It was denied. So we've kind of offered up avenues for them to look at these kind of things. And as we've talked about before, there's very good precedent that the savings you generate before the next rate case were all kinds of things, tax, general operating flow to shareholders. So we think this will be resolved favorably. But let me get to the numbers that you asked about. There's 2 timing periods that are important: one is up through 2014 and then one is 2015. And I'll talk about the first period first. So from the beginning of the rate case through '14, the intervenors that applied for this suggested that we had about $90 million at each utility that they want to be adjusted through rate base. So that would be a rate base adjustment. And the impact, if we loss that -- we don't think we will. But if we lost that, the impact would be $6 million to $7 million in each of the utilities kind of going forward because of that change in rate base. But then, the commission asked us to put a memorandum account together for 2015 savings from this tax repair allowance. And if we were to lose that issue, we will of course appeal it and fight it. But if we were to lose it, we would have to take a charge of about $70 million. That's broken between the 2 utilities. But in total, $65 million to $70 million in total for the '15 memorandum account. Again, I think these are things that we expect to go in our favor. We're giving you all the data done before."

And at the time, when you look at the number of people that were impacted, it was really a -- the vast majority of the households around Aliso Canyon, they never left. They stayed at their homes. Everything was safe and everything. So it was a smaller number to begin with. But since then, we've had over 54% of any impacted residents that have actually gone back to their homes. And every week, we're seeing more and more. So to give you an actual run rate is difficult because, as Debbie said, we're doing things within our program that allow us to -- and help the residents move, say, from hotels to corporate-style apartments, more family-situated apartments with kitchens where they can cook and everything, and that helps bring down the cost. The other things that we're doing is we've been offering in-home cleaning services to give further assurance to residents that everything's safe. So while we haven't given an official run rate, what we can tell you is that the number that we gave out for -- the $665 million assumed relocation expenses through June 7. And as we said, we expect to get additional information from the Department of Public Health this month regarding their testing.

I said that in our plan, the one that we gave you last year, we had for 2016 and '17 between $5 million and $10 million of losses related to this capacity, because we had a lot of capacity sold forward. It wasn't exactly at the same price we were buying the capacity up. It is pretty close. So we had a $5 million to $10 million loss for '16 and '17. That did not take into account some of the recent financial troubles that some of the capacity holders had. So if we had kept it, we would have had bigger losses going forward, which is why, as we tried to sell this forward and on a permanent basis, we're taking a bigger loss than you would assume from the $5 million to $10 million had been in our plan. But for you to adjust your plan, you were probably basing them off of our numbers.

So -- and what our expected utility earnings would be, assuming we get the settlement in the rate case, and then we just assume in out years that we use attrition in addition to that. So we try to use conservative assumptions for that. But then we show you all the development projects. And in this time, we thought that using the assumption of the buyback is conservative because we wouldn't be sitting there with 22% FFO to debt on our balance sheet and not do something with it. What we fully expect in the next 5 years that we will have projects that will have a much better return than what we're showing you with the stock buyback. But we have is just -- we have wonderful flexibility. And to be able to show you 5 years what we have long-term contracted that yields that kind of a growth rate and gives us the strength of the balance sheet, that gives us the flexibility if we were not to find projects to buyback stock, which we don't think is going to be the outcome because we have a robust backlog of projects that we're working on. But it's just a wonderful position to be in. And honestly, this is what I was going to talk about at the analyst meeting. Because it's -- not too many others can talk about having a strengthening balance sheet, having this type of a 12% growth rate with conservative assumptions and then having the ability to grow the dividend by 8% to 9% over that 5-year period of time, with nothing else. So that was going to be a lot of my presentation. I'm -- kind of close to even kind of what we're going to be talking about. But it's a really great position to be in.

We couldn't have asked for better attendance and enjoyed being able to talk to you in person and listen to your feedback.Based on our year-to-date",357,"Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who were able to make it to our analyst conference a few weeks ago. We couldn't have asked for better attendance and enjoyed being able to talk to you in person and listen to your feedback.
Based on our year-to-date results, I will start by reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Joe will review the details of this quarter's results, but first, let me take some time to address the strategic goals we have for the natural gas business. We previously disclosed the sale of our interest in REX, which negatively impacted our quarterly results. We also expect losses in this segment in 2016 and 2017, which are incorporated into our adjusted guidance. 
Our decision to sell REX reflects an implementation of our strategy for the natural gas business to focus our investments around our anchor LNG assets where we have competitive advantages. Octávio discussed this at our analyst conference. We also decided to sell our Southeast utilities and TdM and redeployed the capital on assets that better align with our strategy and provide stronger long-term growth.
I'd like to spend a minute reiterating the value proposition that we believe is top-tier among our utility industry peers. And that is a result of Sempra's long-term strategy. First, our strategy continues to provide the building blocks for high total shareholder return. Our base plan projections result in an approximate 12% adjusted earnings per share compound growth rate through 2020.  
Second, we plan to grow the dividend 8% to 9% annually. Third, we have a healthy balance sheet, with significant projected credit capacity in the latter years of the plan, which gives us several options to return value to our shareholders. Fourth, our businesses have great development platforms with a long runway of opportunity. Finally, with those development opportunities, we are committed to our strategy of long-term contracted infrastructure and utility earnings, which moderates risk and provides less volatility in varying market environments.
Now I will turn it over to Joe to review the quarterly financial results. Please turn to Slide 5."
120622,376896225,1025081,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259",672,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259 million or $1.03 per share. 
Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: at U.S. Gas & Power, we have losses of $19 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with gains of $5 million in the second quarter of 2015, both related to the movements of natural gas prices on inventory that we sold forward. We expect the majority of this quarter's losses to reverse by year-end as we sell the natural gas held in inventory. Our goal is to operate this part of the business to lower our economic exposure to commodity price swings. Also at U.S. Gas & Power, we had $8 million of lower equity earnings due to the sale of our interest in REX.
At SoCalGas, we had a $13 million impairment as a result of the CPUC decision related to the North-South Pipeline. We are now working on ways to recover all or a portion of these expenses and more importantly, develop alternative solutions for the reliability needs in Southern California that this pipeline was designed to address. Last year, SoCalGas had a $13 million retroactive earnings benefit from higher CPUC rate base approved in the second quarter of 2015. You can find the individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section.
Please turn to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned, we took actions in the first half of this year to continue to align our assets with our long-term strategy, and that our California Utilities, we received the final general rate case decision. As a result, we made several after-tax adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings this quarter. 
The significant adjustments are: first, a loss of $123 million for the permanent releases of pipeline capacity that natural gas held with REX and others; second, $80 million in charges as a result of the final GRC decision for the reallocation to ratepayers of certain benefits from tax repairs deductions; and third also related to the GRC decision, earnings benefits of $21 million for the retroactive GRC effect related to the first quarter of 2016.
Additionally, I want to remind you that we expect to report significant gains that will be excluded from adjusted earnings for 2 transactions when they close, both of which may happen in the third quarter. First, we expect the after-tax gain for the sale of our Southeast utilities to be approximately $70 million. We also expect to record a significant after-tax gain from the remeasurement of IEnova's investment in the shared joint venture with PEMEX upon its acquisition of PEMEX's interest. 
Regarding this acquisition, we have made progress recently, and we expect to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction was restructured earlier in July and a new price for the 7 assets was finalized at approximately $1.1 billion. The sale by PEMEX will be submitted to the regulators for final approval. 
I'd also like to address Aliso Canyon. We have increased the cost estimate to $717 million, and we have begun collecting under the insurance policies and to date have received approximately $34 million. On July 25, the individual and business filed an updated and consolidated complaint as required under the case management order. In addition, the county of Los Angeles filed a separate complaint against SoCalGas, a primary component of which takes new safety measures.
Please see our Aliso Canyon Status Update slide in the appendix, which describes the costs included and excluded from our estimate. And please refer to our 2015 10-K and second quarter 10-Q for more detail on these costs and our insurance coverage.
Finally, as Debbie mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions."

Let me talk a little bit about first, the investment opportunities that are there, and we have a lot of things that are -- that are coming together now, first of which we won the Marine Pipeline bid in conjunction with TransCanada, and our investment there is about $840 million for that project. And then it appears that the transaction with PEMEX is going to move forward as we had indicated and hopefully close by the end of the third quarter, and that's about $1.1 billion. In addition to that, we're looking at some M&A activity. There are some renewables, that second auction is coming up for bid and we have some projects that we're looking at bidding into that second auction. And so if you kind of look at all of those, we have several billion dollars' worth of new projects that we're going to be working on over the next few years and we've already secured and several other billion dollars' worth of project between the renewables and then the transmission bids that are going to be coming up that are additional opportunities for us. And further than that, we're starting to do some things with the assets we have, like we just built a lateral or got an agreement to build a lateral. We have some others under negotiation of the existing pipelines. So we're looking at how we keep taking assets that we have and growing those assets. So it has a great opportunity. I was just with Joe and Mark in Mexico City last week. We spent time down there with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Treasury, the head of PEMEX, the head the CFE, . And everyone is very enthusiastic about the Mexico infrastructure opportunities. And I will tell you, their view is they're not slowing down because it's critical to what their goal is to have manufacturing in Mexico. So we're really, really excited about the IEnova opportunities. Going specific to your question then, what we're going to do, and I can't tell you what position we're going to take on the equity, but we're going to look at all of that, and we are going to look at all of the capital needs. I think we have a couple hundred million of available in Mexico right now. And so we're going to have to look at the total capital needs that we would expect over the next year or so and then look at what's the right position for us to be in relative to that. We told you that we're not repatriating because we wanted to take a position in the equity offering assuming that the equity offering occurs, and we would expect this to occur. So there's really not a definitive percentage ownership that we've ascribed to. What we'd love to do is have the pie keep getting better, and we don't have to keep our same position in the pie. We don't have to own 80% of the pie. We'd like the pie to be bigger and own a significant position in that pie."

So that -- I wouldn't say that's a consideration but we have some things going on in Peru right now that are very exciting. Potentially, we have the projects in Mexico and then we have the Cameron 4. And so from a capital allocation standpoint, as we've kind of looked at it, that we've set up IEnova so that we could issue equity through IEnova. We have the opportunity through our Peruvian company to issue equity. It already has -- it's in the market and we own like 83% of that. So if we need the capital for that, we could issue equity and Luz Del Sur. And then for Cameron 4, we could issue equity at Sempra for that. So we have different ways that we can finance these things. And honestly, if we have great projects that earn significantly above the cost of capital, we have not had an issue in being able to finance them. Further, we showed you at the analyst meeting, our balance sheet strengthened over the 5-year period of time. And so we put a plug in at $1.5 billion of cash -- of our stock buyback. We would hope to invest that money in good projects, and I think we're going to be able to do that."

The things that I think that you mentioned are the things that will take effect over the rest of the year. A few things to consider usually, SDG&E has its best quarter in third quarter but SoCalGas has its worst quarter because of the way that the revenues are and then have a good quarter in the fourth quarter. So the earnings are not even throughout the year for the utilities. That the inventory, hedged inventory that we talked about should reverse in the second half of the year. We had a North-South impairment at SoCalGas in the quarter, a $13 million that hit SoCalGas. That's not something that is repeated again throughout the course of the year.

We've already signed some letters of intent with various dairy owners. And our strategy here is consistent with what the Air Resources Board the plan they put up. Our strategy basically is to look at destruction of methane. The biggest opportunities in California are in with dairies and/or landfills. So we're working with some of those owners. We're actually in the process of due diligence on a handful of dairies to see how we can most cost effectively mitigate what resulted from Aliso. From a system standpoint, as Debbie said, and we've obviously worked with the American Gas Association or the other trade groups, SoCalGas' emissions from our system itself are some of the lowest in the country. So we don't see a huge amount of opportunities to be able to make improvements in rate base, but we're looking at new technologies from the monitoring standpoint, for example, that could be associated that could help us that those types of things could be added into rate base in the future. I think that what we see is there's just technology's continuing to evolve, and we're on the leading edge of working with those technology manufacturers and the gas industry. So we're going to look at what we can do to try to grow rate base in a smart way that helps improve our system."

And so we have 20- to 25-year contracts on those. Most of those assets, honestly when you look at once, was they go into service, they're more like a bond because you have a steady stream of earnings coming from those. And so -- and the construction risk on those projects is not much different than the construction risk that was on building sunrise.

And then SDG&E, we historically reported earnings based upon the same methodology. And so you can kind of look at what percentage of earnings usually fall within a quarter. So those -- if you look at last year, those are pretty regularized in terms of how the earnings get allocated by quarter. And we can give you the precise percentages for SoCalGas if you want those. I mean, but this quarter, we obviously had a lot of unique things because we had the REX transaction, we had the capacity release, we had the change in the rate case, the rate case decision coming out, the impact of the taxes from the rate case decision so there are a lot of things that occurred this quarter. Next quarter, we're going to have a lot of things occurring as well, and we tried to foresee that and communicate that because we should have a close mobile and happening sometime at least by the end of this year. And then that we will have also by the end of this year, most likely the PEMEX transaction closed. And so both of those will have gains that would be adjusted out of adjusted earnings. Hopefully, once we get through some of that, the other thing we have, we have PDM as an asset held for sale and depending on the sales process on that. And earlier this year, we took a $26 million hit in terms of deferred taxes for holding out for sale. So we had a lot of things because we're really trying to go through and take their asset portfolio and of things that we think are going to add to the growth in the long term and then reinvest our capital. Hopefully, you'll start seeing more normalized kinds of earnings going forward since we have now pretty much accomplished that plan, with the exception of getting some of these things close.

And that's -- the $717 million includes all of the well costs, it includes all the relocation costs, it includes the costs where the blade to do the investigation, all of those kinds of costs that are estimateable. What's not estimateable is what happens on litigation. And we don't know what that would be. I would say the good thing is that we paid for relocation. We had offered people to be out of the area. We tried to do things to reduce damages. And then further, the Department of Health Services has come out repeatedly and most recently, after thorough investigation of the homes and testing and all and said that there were no long-term health effects from this. And so how that all plays out in litigation is, we don't -- we can't estimate that. But what we tried to do is to put this in a box to the extent possible and ensure that we've managed the risks effectively. And so we'll go forward with the litigation, but I think from the basis of the estimates that we have over $1 billion of insurance and that we continue to believe that the -- what we see that the insurance coverage is adequate for the damages.

We couldn't have asked for better attendance and enjoyed being able to talk to you in person and listen to your feedback.
Based on our year-to-date results, I will start by reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Joe will review the details of this quarter's results, but first let me take some time to address the strategic goals we have for the natural gas business. We previously disclosed the sale of our interest in REX, which negatively impacted our quarterly results. We also expect losses in this segment in 2016 and 2017, which are incorporated into our adjusted guidance. 
Our decision to sell REX reflects an implementation of our strategy for the natural gas business to focus our investments around our anchor LNG assets where we have competitive advantages. Octávio discussed this at our analyst conference. We also decided to sell our Southeast utilities and TdM and redeploy the capital on assets that better align with our strategy and provide stronger long-term growth.
I'd like to spend a minute reiterating the value proposition that we believe is top-tier among our utility industry peers. And that is a result of Sempra's long-term strategy. First, our strategy continues to provide the building blocks for high total shareholder return. Our base plan projections result in an approximate 12% adjusted earnings per share compound growth rate through 2020. 
Second, we plan to grow the dividend 8% to 9% annually. Third, we have a healthy balance sheet, with significant projected credit capacity in the latter years of the plan, which gives us several options to return value to our shareholders. Fourth, our businesses have great development platforms with a long runway of opportunity. Finally, with those development opportunities, we are committed to our strategy of long-term contracted infrastructure and utility earnings, which moderates risk and provides less volatility in varying market environments.
Now I will turn it over to Joe to review the quarterly financial results. Please turn to Slide 5."
120622,376896225,1025438,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259",673,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259 million or $1.03 per share. 
Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: at U.S. Gas & Power, we have losses of $19 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with gains of $5 million in the second quarter of 2015, both related to the movements of natural gas prices on inventory that we sold forward. We expect a majority of this quarter's losses to reverse by year-end as we sell the natural gas held in inventory. Our goal is to operate this part of the business to lower our economic exposure to commodity price swings. Also at U.S. Gas & Power, we had $8 million of lower equity earnings due to the sale of our interest in REX.
At SoCalGas, we had a $13 million impairment as a result of the CPUC decision related to the North-South Pipeline. We are now working on ways to recover all or a portion of these expenses and more importantly, develop alternative solutions for the reliability needs in Southern California that this pipeline was designed to address. Last year, SoCalGas had a $13 million retroactive earnings benefit from higher CPUC rate base approved in the second quarter of 2015. You can find the individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section.
Please turn to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned, we took actions in the first half of this year to continue to align our assets with our long-term strategy, and that our California Utilities, we received the final general rate case decision. As a result, we made several after-tax adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings this quarter. 
The significant adjustments are: first, a loss of $123 million for the permanent releases of pipeline capacity that Sempra Natural Gas held with REX and others; second, $80 million in charges as a result of the final GRC decision for the reallocation to ratepayers of certain benefits from tax repairs deductions; and third also related to the GRC decision, earnings benefits of $21 million for the retroactive GRC effect related to the first quarter of 2016.
Additionally, I want to remind you that we expect to report significant gains that will be excluded from adjusted earnings for 2 transactions when they close, both of which may happen in the third quarter. First, we expect the after-tax gain for the sale of our Southeast utilities to be approximately $70 million. We also expect to record a significant after-tax gain from the remeasurement of IEnova's investment in the shared joint venture with PEMEX upon its acquisition of PEMEX's interest. 
Regarding this acquisition, we have made progress recently, and we expect to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction was restructured earlier in July and a new price for the 7 assets was finalized at approximately $1.1 billion. The sale by PEMEX will be submitted to the regulators for final approval. 
I'd also like to address Aliso Canyon. We have increased the cost estimate to $717 million, and we have begun collecting under the insurance policies and to-date have received approximately $34 million. On July 25, the individual and business plaintiffs filed an updated and consolidated complaint as required under the case management order. In addition, the county of Los Angeles filed a separate complaint against SoCalGas, a primary component of which speaks new safety measures.
Please see our Aliso Canyon Status Update slide in the appendix, which describes the costs included and excluded from our estimate. And please refer to our 2015 10-K and second quarter 10-Q for more detail on these costs and our insurance coverage.
Finally, as Debbie mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions."

Let me talk a little bit about, first, the investment opportunities that are there. And we have a lot of things that are -- that are coming together now, first of which we won the Marine Pipeline bid in conjunction with TransCanada, and our investment there is about $840 million for that project. And then it appears that the transaction with PEMEX is going to move forward, as we had indicated and hopefully close by the end of the third quarter, and that's about $1.1 billion. In addition to that, we're looking at some M&A activity. There are some renewables, that second auction is coming up for bid and we have some projects that we're looking at bidding into that second auction. And so if you kind of look at all of those, we have several billion dollars' worth of new projects that we're going to be working on over the next few years that we've already secured and several other billion dollars' worth of project between the renewables and then the transmission bids that are going to be coming up that are additional opportunities for us. And further than that, we're starting to do some things with the assets we have, like we just built a lateral or got an agreement to build a lateral. We have some others under negotiation of the existing pipelines. So we're looking at how we keep taking the assets that we have and growing those assets. So it is a great opportunity. I was just with Joe and Mark in Mexico City last week. We spent time down there with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Treasury, the head of PEMEX, the head the CFE, [indiscernible], and everyone is very enthusiastic about the Mexico infrastructure opportunities. And I will tell you, their view is they're not slowing down because it's critical to what their goal is to have manufacturing in Mexico. So we're really, really excited about the IEnova opportunities. Going specific to your question then, what we're going to do, and I can't tell you what position we're going to take on the equity, but we're going to look at all of that, and we're going to look at all of the capital needs. I think we have a couple hundred million of available in Mexico right now. And so we're going to have to look at the total capital needs that we would expect over the next year or so and then look at what's the right position for us to be in relative to that. We've told you that we're not repatriating because we wanted to take a position in the equity offering, assuming that the equity offering occurs, and we would expect this to occur. So there's really not a definitive percentage ownership that we strive to. What we'd love to do is have the pie keep getting better and that we don't have to keep our same position in the pie. We don't have to own 80% of the pie. We'd like the pie to be bigger and own a significant position in that pie."

So that -- I wouldn't say that's a consideration, but we have some things going on in Peru right now that are very exciting potentially. We have the projects in Mexico and then we have the Cameron 4. And so from a capital allocation standpoint, as we've kind of looked at it, that we've set up IEnova so that we could issue equity through IEnova. We have the opportunity through our Peruvian company to issue equity. It already has. It's in the market and we own like 83% of it. So if we needed capital for that, we could issue equity in Luz Del Sur. And then for Cameron 4, we could issue equity at Sempra for that. So we have different ways that we can finance these things. And honestly, if we have great projects that earn significantly above the cost of capital, we have not had an issue in being able to finance them. Further, we showed you at the analyst meeting, our balance sheet strengthened over the 5-year period of time. And so we put a plug in at $1.5 billion of cash -- of our stock buyback. We would hope to invest that money in good projects, and I think we're going to be able to do that."

We've already signed some letters of intent with various dairy owners. And our strategy here is consistent with what the Air Resources Board, the plan they put up. But our strategy basically is to look at destruction of methane. And the biggest opportunities in California are with dairies and/or landfills. So we're working with some of those owners. We're actually in the process of due diligence on a handful of dairies to see how we can most cost effectively mitigate what resulted from Aliso. From a system standpoint, as Debbie said, and we've obviously worked with the American Gas Association and the other trade groups, SoCalGas' emissions from our system itself are some of the lowest in the country. So we don't see a huge amount of opportunities to be able to make improvements in rate base, but we're looking at new technologies from a monitoring standpoint, for example, that could be associated that could help us. That those types of things could be added into rate base in the future.

What I will tell you is that our strategy is based upon having a portfolio that has similar risk profiles between our utility and our nonutility business. And we do that by doing long-term contracts. And if you look at our nonutility businesses, they're either -- our international businesses are either foreign utilities that have been under a regulatory framework for 30 years or they are long-term contracted assets like our pipelines. And so we have 20- to 25-year contracts on those. Most of those assets, honestly when you look at it, once they go into service, they're more like a bond because you have a steady stream of earnings coming from those. And so -- and the construction risk on those projects is not much different than the construction risk that was on building Sunrise. So I would say they're very similar, and that's our strategy is to not go into extremely high-risk areas to create the growth but to have our risk profile be quite similar."

So that kind of gives you what percentage of the revenues come out each year. And they're just allocated on that kind of a percentage basis. And so that should follow suite. And then SDG&E, we historically reported earnings based upon the same methodology. And so you can kind of look at what percentage of earnings usually fall within a quarter. So those -- if you look at last year, those are pretty regularized in terms of how the earnings get allocated by quarter. And we can give you the precise percentages for SoCalGas if you want those. I mean, but this quarter, we obviously had a lot of unique things because we had the REX transaction, we had the capacity release, we had the change in the rate case, the rate case decision coming out, the impact of the taxes from the rate case decision. So there were a lot of things that occurred this quarter. Next quarter, we're going to have a lot of things occurring as well, and we tried to foresee that and communicate that because we should have a close Mobile and Willmut happening sometime at least by the end of this year. And then we will have, also by the end of this year, most likely the PEMEX transaction closed. And so both of those will have gains that would be adjusted out of adjusted earnings. Hopefully once we get through some of that, the other thing we have, we have TdM as an asset held for sale and depending on the sales process on that. And earlier this year, we took a $26 million hit in terms of deferred taxes for holding out for sale. So we've had a lot of things because we're really trying to go through and take our asset portfolio and cleanse it of things that we don't think are going to add to our growth in the long term and then reinvest our capital. Hopefully, you'll start seeing more normalized kinds of earnings going forward since we have now pretty much accomplished that plan, with the exception of getting some of these things closed. And I don't know if that helps you at all."

And that you cannot cut back an LNG facility like that. So what we're looking at, we haven't put any money in terms of developing those yet. We think as the LNG facilities come online in the Gulf, that the need for storage adjacent to this will become a lot more apparent and that this is part of our strategy. We're hoping to develop some of the storage facilities and some adjacent pipelines to serve Cameron, other LNG facilities that are in the area, manufacturing that's in the area and Port Arthur when that gets developed.

But we are starting to see -- year-to-year, we're starting to see some price movement upward from where we were last year. Not huge amounts but we are starting to see some upward movement in pricing.

We've tried to do things to reduce damages.

We couldn't have asked for better attendance and enjoyed being able to talk to you in person and listen to your feedback.Based on our year-to-date",357,"Thanks, Rick, and thanks to all of you who were able to make it to our analyst conference a few weeks ago. We couldn't have asked for better attendance and enjoyed being able to talk to you in person and listen to your feedback.
Based on our year-to-date results, I will start by reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Joe will review the details of this quarter's results, but first let me take some time to address the strategic goals we have for the natural gas business. We previously disclosed the sale of our interest in REX, which negatively impacted our quarterly results. We also expect losses in this segment in 2016 and 2017, which are incorporated into our adjusted guidance. 
Our decision to sell REX reflects an implementation of our strategy for the natural gas business to focus our investments around our anchor LNG assets where we have competitive advantages. Octávio discussed this at our analyst conference. We also decided to sell our Southeast utilities and TdM and redeploy the capital on assets that better align with our strategy and provide stronger long-term growth.
I'd like to spend a minute reiterating the value proposition that we believe is top-tier among our utility industry peers. And that is a result of Sempra's long-term strategy. First, our strategy continues to provide the building blocks for high total shareholder return. Our base plan projections result in an approximate 12% adjusted earnings per share compound growth rate through 2020. 
Second, we plan to grow the dividend 8% to 9% annually. Third, we have a healthy balance sheet, with significant projected credit capacity in the latter years of the plan, which gives us several options to return value to our shareholders. Fourth, our businesses have great development platforms with a long runway of opportunity. Finally, with those development opportunities, we are committed to our strategy of long-term contracted infrastructure and utility earnings, which moderates risk and provides less volatility in varying market environments.
Now I will turn it over to Joe to review the quarterly financial results. Please turn to Slide 5."
120622,376896225,1025648,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259",673,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259 million or $1.03 per share. 
Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: at U.S. Gas & Power, we have losses of $19 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with gains of $5 million in the second quarter of 2015, both related to the movements of natural gas prices on inventory that we sold forward. We expect a majority of this quarter's losses to reverse by year-end as we sell the natural gas held in inventory. Our goal is to operate this part of the business to lower our economic exposure to commodity price swings. Also at U.S. Gas & Power, we had $8 million of lower equity earnings due to the sale of our interest in REX.
At SoCalGas, we had a $13 million impairment as a result of the CPUC decision related to the North-South Pipeline. We are now working on ways to recover all or a portion of these expenses and more importantly, develop alternative solutions for the reliability needs in Southern California that this pipeline was designed to address. Last year, SoCalGas had a $13 million retroactive earnings benefit from higher CPUC rate base approved in the second quarter of 2015. You can find the individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section.
Please turn to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned, we took actions in the first half of this year to continue to align our assets with our long-term strategy, and at our California Utilities, we received the final general rate case decision. As a result, we made several after-tax adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings this quarter. 
The significant adjustments are: first, a loss of $123 million for the permanent releases of pipeline capacity that Sempra Natural Gas held with REX and others; second, $80 million in charges as a result of the final GRC decision for the reallocation to ratepayers of certain benefits from tax repairs deductions; and third also related to the GRC decision, earnings benefits of $21 million for the retroactive GRC effect related to the first quarter of 2016.
Additionally, I want to remind you that we expect to report significant gains that will be excluded from adjusted earnings for 2 transactions when they close, both of which may happen in the third quarter. First, we expect the after-tax gain for the sale of our Southeast utilities to be approximately $70 million. We also expect to record a significant after-tax gain from the remeasurement of IEnova's investment in the shared joint venture with PEMEX upon its acquisition of PEMEX's interest. 
Regarding this acquisition, we have made progress recently, and we expect to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction was restructured earlier in July and a new price for the 7 assets was finalized at approximately $1.1 billion. The sale by PEMEX will be submitted to the regulators for final approval. 
I'd also like to address Aliso Canyon. We have increased the cost estimate to $717 million, and we have begun collecting under the insurance policies and to-date have received approximately $34 million. On July 25, the individual and business plaintiffs filed an updated and consolidated complaint as required under the case management order. In addition, the county of Los Angeles filed a separate complaint against SoCalGas, a primary component of which seeks new safety measures.
Please see our Aliso Canyon Status Update slide in the appendix, which describes the costs included and excluded from our estimate. And please refer to our 2015 10-K and second quarter 10-Q for more detail on these costs and our insurance coverage.
Finally, as Debbie mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. With that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and stop to take your questions."

Let me talk a little bit about, first, the investment opportunities that are there. And we have a lot of things that are -- that are coming together now, first of which we won the Marine Pipeline bid in conjunction with TransCanada, and our investment there is about $840 million for that project. And then it appears that the transaction with PEMEX is going to move forward, as we had indicated and hopefully close by the end of the third quarter, and that's about $1.1 billion. In addition to that, we're looking at some M&A activity. There are some renewables, that second auction is coming up for bid and we have some projects that we're looking at bidding into that second auction. And so if you kind of look at all of those, we have several billion dollars' worth of new projects that we're going to be working on over the next few years that we've already secured and several other billion dollars' worth of projects between the renewables and then the transmission bids that are going to be coming up that are additional opportunities for us. And further than that, we're starting to do some things with the assets we have, like we just built a lateral or got an agreement to build a lateral. We have some others under negotiation off the existing pipelines. So we're looking at how we keep taking the assets that we have and growing those assets. So it is a great opportunity. I was just with Joe and Mark in Mexico City last week. We spent time down there with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Treasury, the head of PEMEX, the head the CFE, Cenagás, and everyone is very enthusiastic about the Mexico infrastructure opportunities. And I will tell you, their view is they're not slowing down because it's critical to what their goal is to have manufacturing in Mexico. So we're really, really excited about the IEnova opportunities. Going specific to your question then, what we're going to do, and I can't tell you what position we're going to take on the equity, but we're going to look at all of that, and we're going to look at all of the capital needs. I think we have a couple hundred million of available in Mexico right now. And so we're going to have to look at the total capital needs that we would expect over the next year or so and then look at what's the right position for us to be in relative to that. We've told you that we're not repatriating because we wanted to take a position in the equity offering, assuming that the equity offering occurs, and we would expect it to occur. So there's really not a definitive percentage ownership that we strive to. What we'd love to do is have the pie keep getting bigger and that we don't have to keep our same position in the pie. We don't have to own 80% of the pie. We'd like the pie to be bigger and own a significant position in that pie."

So that -- I wouldn't say that's a consideration, but we have some things going on in Peru right now that are very exciting potentially. We have the projects in Mexico and then we have the Cameron 4. And so from a capital allocation standpoint, as we've kind of looked at it, that we've set up IEnova so that we could issue equity through IEnova. We have the opportunity through our Peruvian company to issue equity. It already has. It's in the market and we own like 83% of it. So if we needed capital for that, we could issue equity in Luz Del Sur. And then for Cameron 4, we could issue equity at Sempra for that. So we have different ways that we can finance these things. And honestly, is we have great projects that earn significantly above the cost of capital, we have not had an issue in being able to finance them. Further, we showed you at the analyst meeting, our balance sheet strengthened over the 5-year period of time. And so we put a plug in of $1.5 billion of cash -- of our stock buyback. We would hope to invest that money in good projects, and I think we're going to be able to do that."

But our strategy basically is to look at destruction of methane. And the biggest opportunities in California are in -- with dairies and/or landfills. So we're working with some of those owners. We're actually in the process of due diligence on a handful of dairies to see how we can most cost effectively mitigate what resulted from Aliso. From a system standpoint, as Debbie said, and we've obviously worked with the American Gas Association and the other trade groups, SoCalGas' emissions from our system itself are some of the lowest in the country. So we don't see a huge amount of opportunities to be able to make improvements in rate base, but we're looking at new technologies from a monitoring standpoint, for example, that could be associated that could help us. That those types of things could be added into rate base in the future. I think that what we see is there's just technologies continuing to evolve, and we're on the leading edge of working with those technology manufacturers and the gas industry.

But it's more complex than, I think, we would take time here with everybody because rate case -- the utility assets are much bigger than their rate base.

I mean, that's a really difficult -- that's a difficult comparison. What I will tell you is that our strategy is based upon having a portfolio that has similar risk profiles between our utility and our nonutility business. And we do that by doing long-term contracts. And if you look at our nonutility businesses, they're either -- our international businesses are either foreign utilities that have been under a regulatory framework for 30 years or they are long-term contracted assets like our pipelines. And so we have 20- to 25-year contracts on those. Most of those assets, honestly when you look at it, once they go into service, they're more like a bond because you have a steady stream of earnings coming from those. And so -- and the construction risk on those projects is not much different than the construction risk that was on building Sunrise. So I would say they're very similar, and that's our strategy is to not go into extremely high-risk areas to create the growth but to have our risk profile be quite similar."

And while we don't have ratings on all the project financing at the renewables, as Debbie said, they're all contracted long term with utilities. Kate and I just spent a good deal of time last summer with all the rating agencies, explaining to them why our nonutility businesses were as strong or stronger than our utility businesses because we don't have 3-year rate cases or 4-year rate cases. We have long-term contracts. And so they liked that very much, and they understand our business very well. I think it's very strong."

So that kind of gives you what percentage of the revenues come out each year. And they're just allocated on that kind of a percentage basis. And so that should follow suit. And then SDG&E, we historically reported earnings based upon the same methodology. And so you can kind of look at what percentage of earnings usually fall within a quarter. So those -- if you look at last year, those are pretty regularized in terms of how the earnings get allocated by quarter. And we can give you the precise percentages for SoCalGas if you want those. I mean, but this quarter, we obviously had a lot of unique things because we had the REX transaction, we had the capacity release, we had the change in the rate case, the rate case decision coming out, the impact of the taxes from the rate case decision. So there were a lot of things that occurred this quarter. Next quarter, we're going to have a lot of things occurring as well, and we tried to foresee that and communicate that because we should have the close of Mobile and Willmut happening sometime at least by the end of this year. And then we will have, also by the end of this year, most likely the PEMEX transaction closed. And so both of those will have gains that would be adjusted out of adjusted earnings. Hopefully once we get through some of that, the other thing we have, we have TdM as an asset held for sale and depending on the sales process on that. And earlier this year, we took a $26 million hit in terms of deferred taxes for holding that for sale. So we've had a lot of things because we're really trying to go through and take our asset portfolio and cleanse it of things that we don't think are going to add to our growth in the long term and then reinvest our capital. Hopefully, you'll start seeing more normalized kinds of earnings going forward since we have now pretty much accomplished that plan, with the exception of getting some of these things closed. And I don't know if that helps you at all."

And that we think that really to run an LNG facility, it makes sense to have storage. There was a situation that just happened last week where Cheniere was cut back on their pipeline capacity. And that you cannot cut back an LNG facility like that. So what we're looking at, we haven't put any money in terms of developing those yet. We think as the LNG facilities come online in the Gulf, that the need for storage adjacent to facilities will become a lot more apparent and that -- this is part of our strategy is we're hoping to develop some of the storage facilities and some adjacent pipelines to serve Cameron, other LNG facilities that are in the area, manufacturing that's in the area and then that Port Arthur when that gets developed. So we think that there's really going to need -- there's going to be a need for more robust infrastructure in that Gulf region as the LNG comes on."

But what we've seen in reality is it's been slower than what their projections have been. So we took a conservative view in our plan. But we are starting to see -- year-to-year, we're starting to see some price movement upward from where we were last year. Not huge amounts but we are starting to see some upward movement in pricing.

So that's our best estimate right now is in September, we'll -- later -- maybe as early as perhaps later this month, we'll be going back to DOGGR, asking for that approval but they've got to go through a process with public hearings.

We've tried to do things to reduce damages. And then further, the Department of Health Services has come out repeatedly and most recently after thorough investigation of the homes and testing and all and said that there were no long-term health effects from this. And so how that all plays out in litigation, we don't -- we can't estimate that. But what we've tried to do is to put this in a box to the extent possible and ensure that we've managed the risks effectively.

We couldn't have asked for better attendance and enjoyed being able to talk to you in person and listen to your feedback.
Based on our year-to-date results, I will start by reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Joe will review the details of this quarter's results, but first let me take some time to address the strategic goals we have for the natural gas business. We previously disclosed the sale of our interest in REX, which negatively impacted our quarterly results. We also expect losses in this segment in 2016 and 2017, which are incorporated into our adjusted guidance. 
Our decision to sell REX reflects an implementation of our strategy for the natural gas business to focus our investments around our anchor LNG assets where we have competitive advantages. Octávio discussed this at our analyst conference. We also decided to sell our Southeast utilities and TdM and redeploy the capital on assets that better align with our strategy and provide stronger long-term growth.
I'd like to spend a minute reiterating the value proposition that we believe is top-tier among our utility industry peers. And that is a result of Sempra's long-term strategy. First, our strategy continues to provide the building blocks for high total shareholder return. Our base plan projections result in an approximate 12% adjusted earnings per share compound growth rate through 2020. 
Second, we plan to grow the dividend 8% to 9% annually. Third, we have a healthy balance sheet, with significant projected credit capacity in the latter years of the plan, which gives us several options to return value to our shareholders. Fourth, our businesses have great development platforms with a long runway of opportunity. Finally, with those development opportunities, we are committed to our strategy of long-term contracted infrastructure and utility earnings, which moderates risk and provides less volatility in varying market environments.
Now I will turn it over to Joe to review the quarterly financial results. Please turn to Slide 5."
120622,376896225,1026298,"Sempra Energy, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259",673,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $16 million or $0.06 per share. We also reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million or $0.79 per share compared to second quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $259 million or $1.03 per share. 
Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: at U.S. Gas & Power, we have losses of $19 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared with gains of $5 million in the second quarter of 2015, both related to the movements of natural gas prices on inventory that we sold forward. We expect a majority of this quarter's losses to reverse by year-end as we sell the natural gas held in inventory. Our goal is to operate this part of the business to lower our economic exposure to commodity price swings. Also at U.S. Gas & Power, we had $8 million of lower equity earnings due to the sale of our interest in REX.
At SoCalGas, we had a $13 million impairment as a result of the CPUC decision related to the North-South Pipeline. We are now working on ways to recover all or a portion of these expenses and more importantly, develop alternative solutions for the reliability needs in Southern California that this pipeline was designed to address. Last year, SoCalGas had a $13 million retroactive earnings benefit from higher CPUC rate base approved in the second quarter of 2015. You can find the individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section.
Please turn to the next slide. As Debbie mentioned, we took actions in the first half of this year to continue to align our assets with our long-term strategy, and at our California Utilities, we received the final general rate case decision. As a result, we made several after-tax adjustments to arrive at adjusted earnings this quarter. 
The significant adjustments are: first, a loss of $123 million for the permanent releases of pipeline capacity that Sempra Natural Gas held with REX and others; second, $80 million in charges as a result of the final GRC decision for the reallocation to ratepayers of certain benefits from tax repairs deductions; and third also related to the GRC decision, earnings benefits of $21 million for the retroactive GRC effect related to the first quarter of 2016.
Additionally, I want to remind you that we expect to report significant gains that will be excluded from adjusted earnings for 2 transactions when they close, both of which may happen in the third quarter. First, we expect the after-tax gain for the sale of our Southeast utilities to be approximately $70 million. We also expect to record a significant after-tax gain from the remeasurement of IEnova's investment in the shared joint venture with PEMEX upon its acquisition of PEMEX's interest. 
Regarding this acquisition, we have made progress recently, and we expect to close this year, subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction was restructured earlier in July and a new price for the 7 assets was finalized at approximately $1.1 billion. The sale by PEMEX will be submitted to the regulators for final approval. 
I'd also like to address Aliso Canyon. We have increased the cost estimate to $717 million, and we have begun collecting under the insurance policies and to-date have received approximately $34 million. On July 25, the individual and business plaintiffs filed an updated and consolidated complaint as required under the case management order.

Let me talk a little bit about, first, the investment opportunities that are there. And we have a lot of things that are -- that are coming together now, first of which we won the Marine Pipeline bid in conjunction with TransCanada, and our investme",519,"Sure. Let me talk a little bit about, first, the investment opportunities that are there. And we have a lot of things that are -- that are coming together now, first of which we won the Marine Pipeline bid in conjunction with TransCanada, and our investment there is about $840 million for that project. And then it appears that the transaction with PEMEX is going to move forward, as we had indicated and hopefully close by the end of the third quarter, and that's about $1.1 billion. In addition to that, we're looking at some M&A activity. There are some renewables, that second auction is coming up for bid and we have some projects that we're looking at bidding into that second auction. And so if you kind of look at all of those, we have several billion dollars' worth of new projects that we're going to be working on over the next few years that we've already secured and several other billion dollars' worth of projects between the renewables and then the transmission bids that are going to be coming up that are additional opportunities for us. And further than that, we're starting to do some things with the assets we have, like we just built a lateral or got an agreement to build a lateral. We have some others under negotiation off the existing pipelines. So we're looking at how we keep taking the assets that we have and growing those assets. So it is a great opportunity. I was just with Joe and Mark in Mexico City last week. We spent time down there with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Treasury, the head of PEMEX, the head the CFE, Cenagás, and everyone is very enthusiastic about the Mexico infrastructure opportunities. And I will tell you, their view is they're not slowing down because it's critical to what their goal is to have manufacturing in Mexico. So we're really, really excited about the IEnova opportunities. Going specific to your question then, what we're going to do, and I can't tell you what position we're going to take on the equity, but we're going to look at all of that, and we're going to look at all of the capital needs. I think we have a couple hundred million of available in Mexico right now. And so we're going to have to look at the total capital needs that we would expect over the next year or so and then look at what's the right position for us to be in relative to that. We've told you that we're not repatriating because we wanted to take a position in the equity offering, assuming that the equity offering occurs, and we would expect it to occur. So there's really not a definitive percentage ownership that we strive to. What we'd love to do is have the pie keep getting bigger and that we don't have to keep our same position in the pie. We don't have to own 80% of the pie. We'd like the pie to be bigger and own a significant position in that pie."

So that -- I wouldn't say that's a consideration, but we have some things going on in Peru right now that are very exciting potentially. We have the projects in Mexico and then we have the Cameron 4. And so from a capital allocation standpoint, as we've kind of looked at it, that we've set up IEnova so that we could issue equity through IEnova. We have the opportunity through our Peruvian company to issue equity. It already has. It's in the market and we own like 83% of it. So if we needed capital for that, we could issue equity in Luz Del Sur. And then for Cameron 4, we could issue equity at Sempra for that. So we have different ways that we can finance these things. And honestly, is we have great projects that earn significantly above the cost of capital, we have not had an issue in being able to finance them. Further, we showed you at the analyst meeting, our balance sheet strengthened over the 5-year period of time. And so we put a plug in of $1.5 billion of cash -- of our stock buyback. We would hope to invest that money in good projects, and I think we're going to be able to do that."

We've already signed some letters of intent with various dairy owners. And our strategy here is, and it's consistent with what the Air Resources Board, the plan they put out. But our strategy basically is to look at destruction of methane. And the biggest opportunities in California are in -- with dairies and/or landfills. So we're working with some of those owners. We're actually in the process of due diligence on a handful of dairies to see how we can most cost effectively mitigate what resulted from Aliso. From a system standpoint, as Debbie said, and we've obviously worked with the American Gas Association and the other trade groups, SoCalGas' emissions from our system itself are some of the lowest in the country. So we don't see a huge amount of opportunities to be able to make improvements in rate base, but we're looking at new technologies from a monitoring standpoint, for example, that could be associated that could help us. That those types of things could be added into rate base in the future. I think that what we see is there's just technologies continuing to evolve, and we're on the leading edge of working with those technology manufacturers and the gas industry.

And so we have 20- to 25-year contracts on those. Most of those assets, honestly when you look at it, once they go into service, they're more like a bond because you have a steady stream of earnings coming from those.

So that kind of gives you what percentage of the revenues come out each year. And they're just allocated on that kind of a percentage basis. And so that should follow suit. And then SDG&E, we historically reported earnings based upon the same methodology. And so you can kind of look at what percentage of earnings usually fall within a quarter. So those -- if you look at last year, those are pretty regularized in terms of how the earnings get allocated by quarter. And we can give you the precise percentages for SoCalGas if you want those. I mean, but this quarter, we obviously had a lot of unique things because we had the REX transaction, we had the capacity release, we had the change in the rate case, the rate case decision coming out, the impact of the taxes from the rate case decision. So there were a lot of things that occurred this quarter. Next quarter, we're going to have a lot of things occurring as well, and we tried to foresee that and communicate that because we should have the close of Mobile and Willmut happening sometime at least by the end of this year. And then we will have, also by the end of this year, most likely the PEMEX transaction closed. And so both of those will have gains that would be adjusted out of adjusted earnings. Hopefully once we get through some of that, the other thing we have, we have TdM as an asset held for sale and depending on the sales process on that. And earlier this year, we took a $26 million hit in terms of deferred taxes for holding that for sale. So we've had a lot of things because we're really trying to go through and take our asset portfolio and cleanse it of things that we don't think are going to add to our growth in the long term and then reinvest our capital. Hopefully, you'll start seeing more normalized kinds of earnings going forward since we have now pretty much accomplished that plan, with the exception of getting some of these things closed. And I don't know if that helps you at all."

And that we think that really to run an LNG facility, it makes sense to have storage. There was a situation that just happened last week where Cheniere was cut back on their pipeline capacity. And that you cannot cut back an LNG facility like that. So what we're looking at, we haven't put any money in terms of developing those yet. We think as the LNG facilities come online in the Gulf, that the need for storage adjacent to facilities will become a lot more apparent and that -- this is part of our strategy is we're hoping to develop some of the storage facilities and some adjacent pipelines to serve Cameron, other LNG facilities that are in the area, manufacturing that's in the area and then that Port Arthur when that gets developed. So we think that there's really going to need -- there's going to be a need for more robust infrastructure in that Gulf region as the LNG comes on."

So that's our best estimate right now is in September, we'll -- later -- maybe as early as perhaps later this month, we'll be going back to DOGGR, asking for that approval but they've got to go through a process with public hearings.

What's not estimateable is what happens on litigation. And we don't know what that would be. I would say the good thing is that we paid for relocation. We had offered people to be out of the area. We've tried to do things to reduce damages. And then further, the Department of Health Services has come out repeatedly and most recently after thorough investigation of the homes and testing and all and said that there were no long-term health effects from this. And so how that all plays out in litigation, we don't -- we can't estimate that. But what we've tried to do is to put this in a box to the extent possible and ensure that we've managed the risks effectively.

During the third quarter, our strong operating and financial performance continued across the company.

I would like to start off with an update on Cameron for LNG. Lastly, Cameron JVs EPC contractor gave indication that the project is facing delays. Cameron JV and the partners are assessing the information. Any delay will likely cost 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings to be lower than anticipated, but those earnings would be made up over time. Most importantly, our NPV should be substantially maintained as the tariff adjusts as a result of the delay. I will go into further detail in a moment. 
Moving on to the important elements of our base plan. I'm pleased to say that since our analyst conference in July, our team has been successfully executing on our project. At IEnova, we had closed the approximately $1.1 billion acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the joint venture, and issued $1.6 billion of follow-on equity. At the California Utilities, we continued to make progress on our $12 billion 5-year capital plan. Most recently, the CPC has approved the Sycamore Canyon Peñasquitos Transmission project at SDG&E. 
We also made progress on securing development opportunities that can enhance our value proposition. At IEnova, we plan on adding approximately 400 megawatts of new renewable projects. At SDG&E, we received CPUC approval to own and operate 37.5 megawatts of energy storage that we expect to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2017. Now please turn to Slide 5.
Let me start with an update on Cameron trains 123. Cameron JV received indication from its EPC contractor that the in-service state for each train maybe facing delay. The contractors information reflects updated in-service dates as follows: mid-2018 for Train 1, late 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. Sempra and our partners are assessing this new information in ways to mitigate any impact. We are disappointed with the short-term delay because at Sempra, we take great pride in delivering projects on-time and on-budget, but under a lump sum keep turnkey agreement the contractor retains the responsibility and overall control of the project schedule. The good news is the EPC contract does provide for liquidated damages for certain delays. Those damages would be factored into the tariff and would alleviate some of the impact of Cameron's customers. 
As a reminder, our JV partners are also our customers. The terms of our agreement provides that EPC scheduled delays and changes in costs results in tariff adjustments. The adjustments are designed to substantially maintain the expected NPV on the project. Therefore, delays are not likely to impact the project's overall NPV. However, any construction delays would likely defer a portion of 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings. We had originally anticipated all 3 trains being in service by the end of 2018. To give you a sense of the impact, Sempra's expected quarterly earnings from the project with all 3 trains in service in 2019 are approximately $8- million. 
Moving to Cameron Train 4, any expansion of Cameron beyond the first 3 trains requires unanimous consent from our equity partners. One of the partners has indicated they do not want to invest additional capital for an expansion. Discussions among the partners have been going on for several months, and we are considering a variety of options that may result in a clearer path to an expansion. Although we can't project timing until we receive the necessary approval, we continue to believe a Cameron expansion would be well-positioned as one of the lowest cost sources of LNG supply. As a reminder, LNG expansions have never been part of our base plan. 
Now please turn to the next slide for an update on IEnova. We are proud of our recent accomplishments in Mexico. Our new investments in IEnova are underpinned by dollar-based long-term contracts consistent with Sempra strategy. They enhance Sempra Mexico's value proposition by diversifying its growth platforms and customer base. IEnova recently completed the purchase of PEMEX's 50% equity interest in our shared joint venture. In October, IEnova raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on equity issuance, primarily to finance of the PEMEX acquisition and other growth. The equity offering was the largest follow-on deal in Mexico in the last 2 years. It was substantially oversubscribed and priced at a 5% premium to the launch of marketing. 
Sempra purchased $351 million of IEnova's stock, and now owns approximately 66% of the company. The strong deal showing is market confirmation that we have been successful with our strategy in Mexico. 
In September, IEnova announced nearly 400 megawatts of additional renewable projects that are in addition to the base plan. This includes the acquisition of the 252 megawatts facility. [indiscernible] went into service in April of this year and is the largest wind farm in Mexico. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. And 141 megawatts of solar capacity awarded in Mexico's second renewable auction. Operations are scheduled to come online in the first half of 2019.  We continue to see a large amount of growth opportunity for Mexico that fit our strategy. 
Now please turn to Slide 7 for several other business updates. As noted in the press, we are working on an agreement to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Peru pipeline project. It is an approximately $6.5 billion natural gas pipeline. We are hopeful an agreement can be reached but there is no assurance and we are still resolving several significant issues. We are not able to comment on this further at this time. 
Moving on to Canyon, SoCalGas has made significant infrastructure technology and safety enhancements to the facility. We are continuing the process to resume injections by requesting authority from DOGGR and the CPUC this week, which could be approved by year end. Regarding the root-cause analysis, we expect to receive the final report sometime in the first half of 2017, but the timing is dictated by DOGGR, the CPUC and Blade Energy. 
Next, we've settled the only criminal suit with the L.A. District attorneys office for approximately $4 million. The settlement covers a small fine of penalty and enhances the safety in ethane monitoring at the site. The settlement is still subject to court approval. Also, if you all recall, we previously stated our insurance coverage with over $1 billion. We are now providing a more precise range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We have received a total of $94 million of insurance proceeds to date. The total cost estimate has increased to $763 million. The increase is primarily related to updated cost estimates for the third party root-cause analysis and the claims recovery process associated with the temporary relocation program.  Please refer to our third quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on the costs included and excluded from our estimated costs in our insurance coverage. 
Before I hand the call over to Joe, let me discuss the management changes we recently announced. Mark Snell is going to retire in March 2017. Although we are sad to see Mark leave, we appreciate his many contributions to Sempra. 
We also announced several other management changes as part of our succession planning. One of our strengths is the ability to develop and experience a diverse leadership team. We strive talented leaders within our organization and expand their experience across different areas of our business. These management changes are part of our succession planning process to ensure all leadership transitions can be made smoothly with no disruptions to our business. 
With that, I will hand it over to Joe, for his last time as CFO, to review the quarterly financial results starting on Slide 8."

Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $622 million or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $238 million or $0.99 per share. This quarter, we had 3 adjustments to GAAP earnings. First, as Debbie mentioned, we completed the acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the JVC joint venture and recorded a gain of $350 million, which represents the step up in value of our previously existing ownership interest. 
Second, U.S. Gas & Power closed sale of its southeast utilities and recorded a gain of $78 million. And finally, as part of the TDM sales process, additional market information became available this quarter that required us to reconsider its current book value. As a result, we recorded a net $65 million noncash charge at Sempra Mexico. All 3 of these items are excluded from third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings and our 2016 adjusted guidance.
I'd like to point out that this quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation resulting in a benefit of $34 million retroactive to January 1, 2016, which is reflected in the results for 9 months that had no impact on third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 9, and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings.
Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: at the California Utilities, we had $21 million of higher earnings, primarily due to higher CPUC base margin net of operating expenses. Sempra International had $13 million of lower earnings, including a $4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency transaction effects and inflation in the current year compared to a $16 million favorable impact in 2015 as a result of significant devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the dollar in 2015.  This was partially offset by $5 million of higher operational earnings in Mexico and Peru. 
I would also like to mention an item that didn't impact this quarter but it could moving forward. Now that we have closed the PEMEX JV acquisition, we have larger deferred tax balances in Mexico. This increases our exposure to Mexican peso movements in the future. You can find individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section. 
I will wrap up by going over a few of our highlights. Based in our financial results, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is $5 per share to $5.40 per share. Our primary focus as a company is executing on our base plan. We had as strong quarter with IEnova closing the PEMEX JV acquisition and completing a $1.6 billion equity issuance. We are also working to drive additional growth with new development opportunities. Just this past quarter, additional battery storage was ordered at SDG&E, and approximately 400 megawatts of renewable projects were announced at IEnova. Incremental projects like these that fit our strategy can enable us to grow during and beyond the 5 years of our base plan. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions."

We received notice last week of this, and what they indicated when they give us notice was just the in-service dates that they anticipated with the 3 trains, that I went over",383,"Yes. Let me try that, just to give you a little more color around the situation. We received notice last week of this, and what they indicated when they give us notice was just the in-service dates that they anticipated with the 3 trains, that I went over in the prepared remarks, but that would be Train 1 mid-2018; Train 2, the end of 2018; Train 3, mid-2019. They didn't give us any indication officially of the cost of the delay. But on their call, they indicated that there had been rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge. And apparently, they've had some flooding, particularly at their fabrication facility. In terms of 2020, what -- we're not going to -- we're not going to revise any guidance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, we have a lot going on between this and potential of the Peruvian pipeline. And so we're not going to do any update to guidance. But we try to give you an indication of kind of the economics that the 3 trains, that all 3 trains are operating and what this delay would be. Because we have said previously, we expected all 3 trains to be in service by the end of 2018. But I think with what we've given you, you can kind of calculate what you would anticipate. In terms of the NPV, and this is very important, the way the tariff works is that the IRR was established that when we saw in the contract for the project. And at the end of construction of the first train, then all of the assumptions are trued up. What their capital costs are and then what the amount is of the toll in order to maintain the IRR that was agreed upon. And so that will occur. And then so we will collect those dollars to achieve the same NPV on the project, as we would have had, had it gone on service on the originally planned dates. And the toll actually goes up in future years, as the way that its calculated, but it will -- this will cause a delay in 2018 and 2019 earnings as I stated in my comments. I hope that was clear, Julien, was that awful?"

Greg, so what we wanted to do here is make sure everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes.

Greg, so what we wanted to do here is make sure everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes. And because the tax system calculates all of our taxes in pesos, these dollar-denominated items, when they're converted to pesos, obviously can move, and so we see some impact of that. Over the last number of years, it's a generally been a pre-close push between what was happening, if the currencies are all moving in the same direction, what's happening until Mexico kind of offset each other. What we wanted to explain is because we have more deferred taxes now, because we're acquiring the other half of this joint venture, our exposure to peso dollar movement will move on that deferred tax liability and some of our monetary assets and liabilities. It's hard to predict because obviously, we would have to forecast what the effect of the dollar peso movement would be over the course of the year. Last year, we actually had a positive, a significant positive benefit to earnings because of this. We, just to remind everybody, we do hedge our current tax liabilities. So if there's a cash impact, then we hedge that to make sure we don't have a cash impact. But we don't hedge the deferred tax liabilities because it's just an accounting item, it moves up and down and that would be costly to do. So I can't give you precise number. What we wanted to give you some visibility into is -- we've been saying for the past 5 years or so that we have a natural hedge between Chile, Peru and Mexico when the currencies are moving in the same direction against the dollar, now it will be a little bit more tilted against Mexico. It could move up and it could move down and it will and there will be a little bit more exposure but again, it's a noncash exposure."

What I will say, though, is that the project is about 57% complete in total and all the materials are on-site for the construction. We were there last 3. All of the cooling were on train 1, there's been a lot of construction progress. And so it's not like dirty -- it's not really early on I would say in the progress of the project. And it's the contractor's responsibility if they feel there's a potential love delay to give his notification and that's what they did last week. As I said, all we know is that on the call, they said there was rain at the site and their fabrication facility that caused some flooding. We don't know what the actual cost of the delay but until we get in and have the chance to have them explain to us what they're looking at and then look out what the potential is to mitigate some of those, it's really hard for us to assess the likelihood of it getting better through those discussions, but we'll be making every effort to have that occur.

Part of the thing that's actually very good is that when we did our contract, we really tried to mitigate the risk for tran-4 in terms of the long-term value of this project and so we set it up to where we were not the ones who bore the risk for these things and that the MPV of the project remain the same and that the contractor has responsibility for the delay and the contractor has a lump sum turnkey contract.

And with the expectation of the delay in getting the outcome there, we would expect the cost to be slightly higher. And so we took that into account. And then the other thing is we're going through now recovery with our insurance on all the relocation expense and validating all of the claims that we have in insurance -- recoverability in that. And going through that, that has taken a lot more detailed type of work to get the claims ready, and so we included some of the costs associated with that. Those were the 2 drivers for the change in costs. I would say, these costs will be updated over time, though. As we get into litigation, as we get into -- knowing what our legal costs we're incurring and knowing what litigation claims, any settlements that have been reflected with parties with any of the potential claims, fines or penalties or other claims. As an example, on this reserve, we did reach a settlement with the L.A. County DA district attorney on the criminal charges, and reached a settlement on that. And so once we could quantify that, then that goes into the reserve numbers that we give you. So those are the kinds of things that would continue to flow through in updates of that reserve. We've also spent the time looking at our insurance and looking at what the types of claims we have, the types of claims that have been filed and what the insurance coverage is, and being able to refine that a bit. And so we're able to give you in kind of a better estimate of what the range of insurance we believe is available."

We got a lot of advice from our IEnova investors of how -- you guys should maybe not to work, we want to own more. So definitely, there was a lot of demand for this equity which was great. The roadshow was very similar to the IPO. We've got a lot of orders every day, and it was a really amazing roadshow with the investors. At the end of the day, we wanted to make sure, because we really love these assets and this business, that we maintain the strong ownership interest in it. And so we've kind of went to the max because we were actually issuing more equity than we originally put on the table when we started the roadshow and upside to that amount.

But it's up to the contractor to give their best estimates of the time frame. And it's probably not in their interest to give us something that they feel like they're not going to be able to meet.

But we don't know what the issues are that were driving the delays, and so that's one of the things we need to spend some time on. And so I love to give you comfort, but I think until we get through some of those discussions with the contractor, I don't think it's a thing that I should be doing.

Now I'll just give you a brief update, I mean one of the things I think we've done relatively successful is, you've got to manage both your GRC capital and the capital which, per project, which is approved outside the GRC. So just recently, we've had, just this year, we've had $1 billion of incremental projects approved. That's not incremental to the plan, but that is to the GRC. That's the Cleveland National Forest project, Sycamore PQ, as well as the batteries which were discussed earlier on the call. we're making great progress there for our '16, '17 and '18 capital plan was roughly $3.5 billion, $3.25 billion of that has already been approved and is going forward. That's really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the certainty of our future capital plan. In terms of things which are not in the plan, Debbie touched on the DC line, this is the Southwest power link which originates in Arizona. We think there's an opportunity as we think about providing more liability, particularly into the L.A. basin, of giving access to more renewables and more power from that Palo Verde generating electricity there in California, back in California project of about $1 billion. Secondly, we think there's an increased opportunity for batteries at San Diego Gas & Electric. By the end of Q1, we will have just over 50 megawatts of utility owned batteries, and we think there's some incremental 200-megawatt opportunity. That's really associated with this new bill which was passed this year, which is AB 2868, which call it for 500 megawatts of new batteries to be installed, split 1/3 between the 3 industrial and utilities: Overtime, MESA, you referenced which is a 600-megawatt combined cycle plant in the heart of our load center. That is subject to a put color arrangement with [indiscernible] And as you may recall, I think correctly from our last analyst conference, that was not included in our 5-year plan. And then the last thing I'd mention is electric vehicles. I mean, with the passage of SB 32, we're now required to drive our greenhouse gas emissions footprint in California 40% below 1990 over the next 14 years. And almost 50% of that have to come from the transportation sector. In fact, that's close to 53% or 54% in our service territory. So big picture on this green gas house image issue, Michael is, you've only got about 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions coming from electric generation that sits inside the State of California, maybe another 8% to 10% outside the state. There's no question that the state is serious about meeting its goals. We have to have a revolution around the transportation sector, and I think almost in every scenario, the California Utilities will play big in that space."

The second and we've touched on this a little bit before seeing more momentum here on the state is focusing on using natural gas for heavy-duty transportation. So these are fueling infrastructure around that. And then thirdly, focusing on the gathering and cleaning of renewable natural gas from landfills and dairies and things. So we're not going to give out dollar amounts on those yet, but I think those are 3 areas that we definitely see opportunity and upside for our gas companies here in California."

During the third quarter, our strong operating and financial performance continued across the company. Our third quarter financial results keep us on track to achieve our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 to $5 per share. 
I would like to start off with an update on Cameron LNG. Last week, Cameron JV's EPC contractor gave indication that the project is facing delays. Cameron JV and the partners are assessing the information. Any delay would likely cost 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings to be lower than anticipated, but those earnings would be made up over time. Most importantly, our NPV should be substantially maintained as the tariff adjusts as a result of the delay. I will go into further detail in a moment. 
Moving on to other important elements of our base plan. I'm pleased to say that since our analyst conference in July, our team has been successfully executing on our projects. At IEnova, we have closed the approximately $1.1 billion acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the joint venture, and issued $1.6 billion of follow-on equity. At the California Utilities, we continue to make progress on our $12 billion 5-year capital plan. Most recently, the CPC has approved the Sycamore-Peñasquitos Electric Transmission Project at SDG&E. 
We had also made progress on securing development opportunities that can enhance our value proposition. At IEnova, we plan on adding approximately 400 megawatts of new renewable projects. At SDG&E, we received CPUC approval to own and operate 37.5 megawatts of energy storage that we expect to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2017. Now please, turn to Slide 5.
Let me start with an update on Cameron Trains 1 through 3. Last week, Cameron JV received indication from its EPC contractor that the in-service date for each train may be facing delay. The contractor's information reflects updated in-service dates as follows: mid-2018 for Train 1, late 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. Sempra and our partners are assessing this new information in ways to mitigate any impact. We are disappointed with the short-term delay because at Sempra, we take great pride in delivering projects on-time and on-budget, but under a lump sum turnkey construction agreement, the contractor retains the responsibility and overall control of the project schedule. The good news is the EPC contract does provide for liquidated damages for certain delays. Those damages would be factored into the tariff and would alleviate some of the impact to Cameron's customers. As a reminder, our JV partners are also our customers. 
The terms of our agreement provides that EPC-scheduled delays and changes in costs results in tariff adjustments. The adjustments are designed to substantially maintain the expected NPV on the project. Therefore, delays are not likely to impact the project's overall NPV. However, any construction delays would likely defer a portion of 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings. We had originally anticipated all 3 trains being in service by the end of 2018. To give you a sense of the impact, Sempra's expected quarterly earnings from the project when all 3 trains are in service in 2019 are approximately $80 million. 
Moving to Cameron Train 4, any expansion of Cameron beyond the first 3 trains requires unanimous consent from our equity partners. One of the partners has indicated they do not want to invest additional capital for an expansion. Discussions among the partners have been going on for several months, and we are considering a variety of options that may result in a clearer path to an expansion. Although we can't project timing until we receive the necessary approvals, we continue to believe a Cameron expansion would be well positioned as one of the lowest cost sources of global LNG supply. As a reminder, LNG expansions had never been part of our base plan. 
Now please, turn to the next slide for an update on IEnova. We are proud of our recent accomplishments in Mexico. Our new investments in IEnova are underpinned by dollar-based, long-term contracts consistent with Sempra's strategy. They enhance Sempra Mexico's value proposition by diversifying its growth platforms and customer base. IEnova recently completed the purchase of PEMEX's 50% equity interest in our shared joint venture. In October, IEnova raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on equity issuance, primarily to finance the PEMEX acquisition and other growth. The equity offering was the largest follow-on deal in Mexico in the last 2 years. It was substantially oversubscribed and priced at a 5% premium to the launch of marketing. 
Sempra purchased $351 million of IEnova's stock, and now owns approximately 66% of the company. The strong deal is showing -- is market confirmation that we have been successful with our strategy in Mexico. 
In September, IEnova announced nearly 400 megawatts of additional renewable projects that are in addition to the base plan. This includes the acquisition of the 252-megawatt Ventika wind facility. Ventika went into service in April of this year and is the largest wind farm in Mexico. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. And 141 megawatts of solar capacity awarded in Mexico's second renewable auction. Operations are scheduled to come online in the first half of 2019. We continue to see a large amount of growth opportunity for Mexico that fit our strategy. 
Now please, turn to Slide 7 for several other business updates. As noted in the press, we are working on an agreement to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Peru pipeline project. It is an approximately $6.5 billion natural gas pipeline. We are hopeful an agreement can be reached, but there is no assurance and we are still resolving several significant issues. We are not able to comment on this further at this time. 
Moving on to Aliso Canyon, SoCalGas has made significant infrastructure technology and safety enhancements to the facility. We are continuing the process to resume injections by requesting authority from DOGGR and the CPUC this week, which could be approved by year end. Regarding the root-cause analysis, we expect to receive the final report sometime in the first half of 2017, but the timing is dictated by DOGGR, the CPUC and Blade Energy. 
Next, we've settled the only criminal suit with the L.A. County District Attorney's Office for approximately $4 million. The settlement covers a small fine or penalty in enhancements to safety and methane monitoring at the site. The settlement is still subject to court approval. Also, if you'll recall, we previously stated our insurance coverage was over $1 billion. We are now providing a more precise range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We have received a total of $94 million of insurance proceeds to-date. The total cost estimate has increased to $763 million. The increase is primarily related to updated cost estimates for the third party root-cause analysis and the claims recovery process associated with the temporary relocation program. Please refer to our third quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on the costs included and excluded from our estimated costs in our insurance coverage. 
Before I hand the call over to Joe, let me discuss the management changes we recently announced. Mark Snell is going to retire in March 2017. Although we are sad to see Mark leave, we appreciate his many contributions to Sempra. 
We also announced several other management changes as part of our succession planning. One of our strengths is the ability to develop and experience a diverse leadership team. We strive to identify talented leaders within our organization and expand their experience across different areas of our business. These management changes are part of our succession planning process to ensure all leadership transitions can be made smoothly with no disruptions to our business. 
With that, I will hand it over to Joe, for his last time as CFO, to review the quarterly financial results starting on Slide 8."

On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $248 million or $0.99 per share. This quarter, we had 3 adjustments to GAAP earnings. First, as Debbie mentioned, we completed the acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the GdC joint venture and recorded a gain of $350 million, which represents the step up in value of our previously existing ownership interest. 
Second, U.S. Gas & Power closed the sale of its southeast utilities and recorded a gain of $78 million. And finally, as part of the TdM sales process, additional market information became available this quarter that required us to reconsider its current book value. As a result, we recorded a net $65 million noncash charge at Sempra Mexico. All 3 of these items are excluded from third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings and our 2016 adjusted guidance.
I would like to point out that this quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation, resulting in a benefit of $34 million retroactive to January 1, 2016, which is reflected in the results for the 9 months that had no impact on third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 9, and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings.
  
Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: at the California Utilities, we had $21 million of higher earnings, primarily due to higher CPUC base margin net of operating expenses. Sempra International had $13 million of lower earnings, including a $4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactional effects and inflation in the current year compared to a $16 million favorable impact in 2015 as a result of significant devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the dollar in 2015.  This was partially offset by $5 million of higher operational earnings in Mexico and Peru. 
I would also like to mention an item that didn't impact this quarter, but it could moving forward. Now that we have closed the PEMEX JV acquisition, we have larger deferred tax balances in Mexico. This increases our exposure to Mexican peso movements in the future. You can find individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section. 
I will wrap up by going over a few of our highlights. Based in our financial results, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is $5 per share to $5.40 per share. 
Our primary focus as a company is executing on our base plan. We had as strong quarter with IEnova closing the PEMEX JV acquisition and completing a $1.6 billion equity issuance. We are also working to drive additional growth with new development opportunities. Just this past quarter, additional battery storage was awarded at SDG&E, and approximately 400 megawatts of renewable projects were announced at IEnova. Incremental projects like these that fit our strategy can enable us to grow during and beyond the 5 years of our base plan. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions."

Let me try to just give a little more color around the situation. We received notice last week of this, and what they indicated when they gave us notice was just the in-service dates that they anticipated for the 3 trains, that I went over in the prepared remarks. But that would be Train 1, mid-2018; Train 2, the end of 2018; and Train 3, mid-2019. They didn't give us any indication officially of the cause of the delay. But on their call, they indicated that there had been rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge. And apparently, they've had some flooding, particularly at their fabrication facility. In terms of 2020, what -- we're not going to revise any guidance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, we have a lot going on between this and potential of the Peruvian pipeline. And so we're not going to do any update to guidance. But we try to give you an indication of kind of the economics of the 3 trains, and all 3 trains are operating, and that what this delay would be because we had said previously we expected all 3 trains to be in service by the end of 2018. So I think with what we've given you, you can kind of calculate what you would anticipate. In terms of the NPV, and this is very important, the way the tariff works is that the IRR was established that -- when we signed the contract for the project. And at the end of construction of the first train, then all of the assumptions are trued up. What the capital costs are and then what the amount is of the toll in order to maintain the IRR that was agreed upon. And so that will occur, and then so we will collect those dollars to achieve the same NPV on the project, as we would have had, had it gone in service on the originally planned dates. And the toll actually goes up in future years as the way that it's calculated, but it will -- this will cause a delay in 2018 and 2019 earnings, as I stated in my comments. I hope that was clear. Julien, was that awful?"

Greg, so what we wanted to do here is make sure everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes.

Greg, so what we wanted to do here is make sure everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes. And because the tax system calculates all of our taxes in pesos, these dollar-denominated items, when they're converted to pesos, obviously, can move. And so we see some impact of that. Over the last number of years, it's generally been a pre-close push between what was happening if the currencies are all moving in the same direction, what's happening in Chile, Peru and Mexico kind of offset each other. What we wanted to explain is because we have more deferred taxes now because we're acquiring the other half of this joint venture, our exposure to peso-dollar movement will move on that deferred tax liability and some of our monetary assets and liabilities. It's hard to predict because obviously, we would have to forecast what the effect of the dollar-peso movement would be over the course of the year. Last year, we actually had a positive -- a significant positive benefit to earnings because of this. We, just to remind everybody, we do hedge our current tax liabilities. So if there's a cash impact, then we hedge that to make sure we don't have a cash impact. But we don't hedge the deferred tax liabilities because it's just an accounting item. It moves up and down, and that would be costly to do. So I can't give you a precise number. What we wanted to give you some visibility into is we've been saying for the past 5 years or so that we have a natural hedge between Chile, Peru and Mexico when the currencies are moving in the same direction against the dollar. Now it will be a little bit more tilted to Mexico. It can move up and it can move down, and it will. And so there'll be a little bit more exposure, but again it's a noncash exposure."

We were there last week. All of the cooling units were on Train 1. I mean, there's been a lot of construction progress. And so it's not like early -- it's not really early on, I would say, in the progress of the project. And it's the contractor's responsibility when they feel that there's a potential for a delay to give us this notification, and that's what they did just last week. As I said, all we know is that on their call, they said that there was rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that caused some flooding. We don't know what the actual cause of the delay is.

But to the extent that there's a delay and that, that increases the toll -- and that's the way we designed it, with -- everyone with full knowledge. I mean, part of the thing that's actually very good is that when we did our contract, we really tried to mitigate the risk for Sempra in terms of the long-term value of this project. And so we set it up to where we were not the ones who took -- bore the risk for these things and that the NPV of the project remain the same and that the contractor had responsibility for delay. And the contractor has a lump sum turnkey contract, the only way that they can increase cost is by change-orders. So that was the design of the project to really mitigate the risk long term to our shareholders.

And that -- and going through that, that has taken a lot more detailed type of work to get the claims ready, and so we included some of the costs associated with that. Those were the 2 drivers for the change in cost. I would say, these costs will be updated over time, though. As we get into litigation, as we get into -- knowing what legal costs we're incurring and knowing what litigation claims, any settlements that have been reflected with parties on any of the potential claims, fines or penalties or other claims. As an example, on this reserve, we did reach a settlement with the L.A. County D.A., District Attorney, on the criminal charges, and reached a settlement on that. And so once we could quantify that, then that goes into the reserve number that we give you. So those are the kinds of things that would continue to flow through in updates of that reserve. We've also spent, though, time looking at our insurance and looking at what the types of claims we have, the types of claims that have been filed and what the insurance coverage is, and been able to refine that a bit. And so we're able to give you kind of a better estimate of what the range of insurance we believe is available."

Now I'll just give you a brief update. I mean, one of the things that I think we've done relatively successful is, you've got to be able to manage both your GRC capital and the capital which should -- per project, which are approved outside the GRC. So just recently, we've had -- just this year, we've had $1 billion of incremental projects approved. That's not incremental to the plan, but that's outside the GRC. That's the Cleveland National Forest project, Sycamore-PQ as well as the batteries, which were discussed earlier on the call. So we're making great progress there. For our '16, '17 and '18 capital plan, it was roughly $3.5 billion. $3.25 billion of that has already been approved and is going forward. So that really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the certainty of our future capital plan. In terms of things, which are not in the plan, Debbie touched on the D.C. line, this is the Southwest power link, which originates in Arizona. We think there's an opportunity, as we think about providing more reliability, particularly into the L.A. basin, of giving access to more renewables and more power from that Palo Verde, generating center in Arizona back into California. That's one project of about $1 billion. Secondly, we think there's an increased opportunity for batteries at San Diego Gas & Electric. By the end of Q1, we will have just over 50 megawatts of utility-owned batteries, and we think there's some incremental 200-megawatt opportunity. That's really associated with this new bill, which was passed this year, which is AB 2868, which calls for 500 megawatts of new batteries to be installed, split 1/3 between the 3 industrial and utilities. Otay Mesa you referenced, which is a 600-megawatt combined cycle plant in the heart of our load center. That is subject to a put collar arrangement with Calpine. And as you may recall, I think, correctly from our last analyst conference, that was not included in our 5-year plan. And then the last thing I would mention is electric vehicles. I mean, with the passage of SB 32, we're now required to drive our greenhouse gas emissions footprint in California 40% below 1990 over the next 14 years, and almost 50% of that have to come from the transportation sector. In fact, that's close to 53% or 54% in our service territory. So big picture on this greenhouse gas image -- issue Michael is, you've only got about 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions coming from electric generation that sit inside the State of California, maybe another 8% to 10% outside the state. There is no question that the state is serious about meeting its goals. We have to have a revolution around the transportation sector. And I think almost in every scenario, the California Utilities will play big in that space."

And I think that, that's an opportunity as we continue to enhance the overall infrastructure and the safety of all of our facilities, that's number one. The second, and we've touched on this a little bit, but we're seeing more momentum here on the state is focusing on using natural gas for heavy-duty transportation. So these are fueling infrastructure around that. And then thirdly, focusing on the gathering and cleaning of renewable natural gas from landfills and dairies and things. So we're not going to give out dollar amounts for those yet, but I think those are 3 areas that we definitely see opportunity and upside for our gas companies here in California."

That tax benefit has historically gone through adjusted paid-in capital and now the accounting standards have put it through the P&L. So going forward, we anticipate, assuming that the stock price continues to rise and that the multiplier effect is in place, like it has been in the past years, we would get a similar type benefit.

I would like to start off with an update on Cameron LNG. Last week, Cameron JV's EPC contractor gave indication that the project is facing delays. Cameron JV and the partners are assessing the information. Any delay would likely cost 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings to be lower than anticipated, but those earnings would be made up over time. Most importantly, our NPV should be substantially maintained as the tariff adjusts as a result of the delay. I will go into further detail in a moment. 
Moving on to other important elements of our base plan. I'm pleased to say that since our analyst conference in July, our team has been successfully executing on our projects. At IEnova, we have closed the approximately $1.1 billion acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the joint venture, and issued $1.6 billion of follow-on equity. At the California Utilities, we continue to make progress on our $12 billion 5-year capital plan. Most recently, the CPC has approved the Sycamore-Peñasquitos Electric Transmission Project at SDG&E. 
We had also made progress on securing development opportunities that can enhance our value proposition. At IEnova, we plan on adding approximately 400 megawatts of new renewable projects. At SDG&E, we received CPUC approval to own and operate 37.5 megawatts of energy storage that we expect to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2017. Now please, turn to Slide 5.
Let me start with an update on Cameron Trains 1 through 3. Last week, Cameron JV received indication from its EPC contractor that the in-service date for each train may be facing delay. The contractor's information reflects updated in-service dates as follows: mid-2018 for Train 1, late 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. Sempra and our partners are assessing this new information in ways to mitigate any impact. We are disappointed with the short-term delay because at Sempra, we take great pride in delivering projects on-time and on-budget, but under a lump sum turnkey construction agreement, the contractor retains the responsibility and overall control of the project schedule. The good news is the EPC contract does provide for liquidated damages for certain delays. Those damages would be factored into the tariff and would alleviate some of the impact to Cameron's customers. As a reminder, our JV partners are also our customers. 
The terms of our agreement provides that EPC-scheduled delays and changes in costs results in tariff adjustments. The adjustments are designed to substantially maintain the expected NPV on the project. Therefore, delays are not likely to impact the project's overall NPV. However, any construction delays would likely defer a portion of 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings. We had originally anticipated all 3 trains being in service by the end of 2018. To give you a sense of the impact, Sempra's expected quarterly earnings from the project when all 3 trains are in service in 2019 are approximately $80 million. 
Moving to Cameron Train 4, any expansion of Cameron beyond the first 3 trains requires unanimous consent from our equity partners. One of the partners has indicated they do not want to invest additional capital for an expansion. Discussions among the partners have been going on for several months, and we are considering a variety of options that may result in a clearer path to an expansion. Although we can't project timing until we receive the necessary approvals, we continue to believe a Cameron expansion would be well positioned as one of the lowest cost sources of global LNG supply. As a reminder, LNG expansions had never been part of our base plan. 
Now please, turn to the next slide for an update on IEnova. We are proud of our recent accomplishments in Mexico. Our new investments in IEnova are underpinned by dollar-based, long-term contracts consistent with Sempra's strategy. They enhance Sempra Mexico's value proposition by diversifying its growth platforms and customer base. IEnova recently completed the purchase of PEMEX's 50% equity interest in our shared joint venture. In October, IEnova raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on equity issuance, primarily to finance the PEMEX acquisition and other growth. The equity offering was the largest follow-on deal in Mexico in the last 2 years. It was substantially oversubscribed and priced at a 5% premium to the launch of marketing. 
Sempra purchased $351 million of IEnova's stock, and now owns approximately 66% of the company. The strong deal is showing is market confirmation that we have been successful with our strategy in Mexico. 
In September, IEnova announced nearly 400 megawatts of additional renewable projects that are in addition to the base plan. This includes the acquisition of the 252-megawatt Ventika wind facility. Ventika went into service in April of this year and is the largest wind farm in Mexico. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. And 141 megawatts of solar capacity awarded in Mexico's second renewable auction. Operations are scheduled to come online in the first half of 2019. We continue to see a large amount of growth opportunities in Mexico that fit our strategy. 
Now please, turn to Slide 7 for several other business updates. As noted in the press, we are working on an agreement to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Peru pipeline project. It is an approximately $6.5 billion natural gas pipeline. We are hopeful an agreement can be reached, but there is no assurance and we are still resolving several significant issues. We are not able to comment on this further at this time. 
Moving on to Aliso Canyon, SoCalGas has made significant infrastructure technology and safety enhancements to the facility. We are continuing the process to resume injections by requesting authority from DOGGR and the CPUC this week, which could be approved by year end. Regarding the root-cause analysis, we expect to receive the final report sometime in the first half of 2017, but the timing is dictated by DOGGR, the CPUC and Blade Energy. 
Next, we've settled the only criminal suit with the L.A. County District Attorney's Office for approximately $4 million. The settlement covers a small fine or penalty in enhancements to safety and methane monitoring at the site. The settlement is still subject to court approval. Also, if you'll recall, we previously stated our insurance coverage was over $1 billion. We are now providing a more precise range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We have received a total of $94 million of insurance proceeds to-date. The total cost estimate has increased to $763 million. The increase is primarily related to updated cost estimates for the third party root-cause analysis and the claims recovery process associated with the temporary relocation program. Please refer to our third quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on the costs included and excluded from our estimated costs in our insurance coverage. 
Before I hand the call over to Joe, let me discuss the management changes we recently announced. Mark Snell is going to retire in March 2017. Although we are sad to see Mark leave, we appreciate his many contributions to Sempra. 
We also announced several other management changes as part of our succession planning. One of our strengths is the ability to develop and experience a diverse leadership team. We strive to identify talented leaders within our organization and expand their experience across different areas of our business. These management changes are part of our succession planning process to ensure all leadership transitions can be made smoothly with no disruptions to our business. 
With that, I will hand it over to Joe, for his last time as CFO, to review the quarterly financial results starting on Slide 8."

Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $622 million or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 o",537,"Thanks, Debbie. Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $622 million or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $248 million or $0.99 per share. This quarter, we had 3 adjustments to GAAP earnings. First, as Debbie mentioned, we completed the acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the GdC joint venture and recorded a gain of $350 million, which represents the step up in value of our previously existing ownership interest. 
Second, U.S. Gas & Power closed the sale of its southeast utilities and recorded a gain of $78 million. And finally, as part of the TdM sales process, additional market information became available this quarter that required us to reconsider its current book value. As a result, we recorded a net $65 million noncash charge at Sempra Mexico. All 3 of these items are excluded from third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings and our 2016 adjusted guidance.
I would like to point out that this quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation, resulting in a benefit of $34 million retroactive to January 1, 2016, which is reflected in the results for the 9 months that had no impact on third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 9, and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings.
  
Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: at the California Utilities, we had $21 million of higher earnings, primarily due to higher CPUC base margin net of operating expenses. Sempra International had $13 million of lower earnings, including a $4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactional effects and inflation in the current year compared to a $16 million favorable impact in 2015 as a result of significant devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the dollar in 2015.  This was partially offset by $5 million of higher operational earnings in Mexico and Peru. 
I would also like to mention an item that didn't impact this quarter, but it could moving forward. Now that we have closed the PEMEX JV acquisition, we have larger deferred tax balances in Mexico. This increases our exposure to Mexican peso movements in the future. You can find individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section. 
I will wrap up by going over a few of our highlights. Based in our financial results, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is $5 per share to $5.40 per share. 
Our primary focus as a company is executing on our base plan. We had as strong quarter with IEnova closing the PEMEX JV acquisition and completing a $1.6 billion equity issuance. We are also working to drive additional growth with new development opportunities. Just this past quarter, additional battery storage was awarded at SDG&E, and approximately 400 megawatts of renewable projects were announced at IEnova. Incremental projects like these that fit our strategy can enable us to grow during and beyond the 5 years of our base plan. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions."

Let me try to just give a little more color around the situation. We received notice last week of this, and what they indicated when they gave us notice was just the in-service dates that they anticipated for the 3 trains, that I went over in the prepared remarks. But that would be Train 1, mid-2018; Train 2, the end of 2018; and Train 3, mid-2019. They didn't give us any indication officially of the cause of the delay. But on their call, they indicated that there had been rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge. And apparently, they've had some flooding, particularly at their fabrication facility. In terms of 2020, what -- we're not going to revise any guidance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, we have a lot going on between this and potential of the Peruvian pipeline. And so we're not going to do any update to guidance. But we try to give you an indication of kind of the economics of the 3 trains, if all 3 trains are operating, and that what this delay would be because we had said previously we expected all 3 trains to be in service by the end of 2018. So I think with what we've given you, you can kind of calculate what you would anticipate. In terms of the NPV, and this is very important, the way the tariff works is that the IRR was established that -- when we signed the contract for the project. And at the end of construction of the first train, then all of the assumptions are trued up. What the capital costs are and then what the amount is of the toll in order to maintain the IRR that was agreed upon. And so that will occur, and then so we will collect those dollars to achieve the same NPV on the project, as we would have had, had it gone in service on the originally planned dates. And the toll actually goes up in future years as the way that it's calculated, but it will -- this will cause a delay in 2018 and 2019 earnings, as I stated in my comments. I hope that was clear. Julien, was that helpful?"

Greg, so what we wanted to do here is make sure everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes. And because the tax system calculates all of our taxes in pesos, these dollar-denominated items, when they're converted to pesos, obviously, can move. And so we see some impact of that. Over the last number of years, it's generally been a pretty close push between what was happening if the currencies are all moving in the same direction, what's happening in Chile, Peru and Mexico kind of offset each other. What we wanted to explain is because we have more deferred taxes now because we're acquiring the other half of this joint venture, our exposure to peso-dollar movement will move on that deferred tax liability and some of our monetary assets and liabilities. It's hard to predict because obviously, we would have to forecast what the effect of the dollar-peso movement would be over the course of the year. Last year, we actually had a positive -- a significant positive benefit to earnings because of this. We, just to remind everybody, we do hedge our current tax liabilities. So if there's a cash impact, then we hedge that to make sure we don't have a cash impact. But we don't hedge the deferred tax liabilities because it's just an accounting item. It moves up and down, and that would be costly to do. So I can't give you a precise number. What we wanted to give you some visibility into is we've been saying for the past 5 years or so that we have a natural hedge between Chile, Peru and Mexico when the currencies are moving in the same direction against the dollar. Now it will be a little bit more tilted to Mexico. It can move up and it can move down, and it will. And so there'll be a little bit more exposure, but again it's a noncash exposure."

And so it's not like early -- it's not really early on, I would say, in the progress of the project.

I mean, part of the thing that's actually very good is that when we did our contract, we really tried to mitigate the risk for Sempra in terms of the long-term value of this project. And so we set it up to where we were not the ones who took -- bore the risk for these things and that the NPV of the project remain the same and that the contractor had responsibility for delay. And the contractor has a lump sum turnkey contract, the only way that they can increase cost is by change-orders.

And when we looked at -- we look at our reserves on an ongoing basis based upon new knowledge of cost. One of the key things that caused our estimate to go up is the work that's being done on the root-cause analysis and the fact that the third parties that are doing work on that are expecting a delay. And with the expectation of a delay in getting the outcome there, we would expect the cost to be slightly higher. And so we took that into account. And then the other thing is we're going through now recovery with our insurance on all the relocation expense and validating all of the claims that we have full insurance recoverability. And that -- and going through that, that has taken a lot more detailed type of work to get the claims ready, and so we included some of the costs associated with that. Those were the 2 drivers for the change in cost. I would say, these costs will be updated over time, though. As we get into litigation, as we get into -- knowing what legal costs we're incurring and knowing what litigation claims, any settlements that have been reflected with parties on any of the potential claims, fines or penalties or other claims. As an example, on this reserve, we did reach a settlement with the L.A. County D.A., District Attorney, on the criminal charges, and reached a settlement on that. And so once we could quantify that, then that goes into the reserve number that we give you. So those are the kinds of things that would continue to flow through in updates of that reserve. We've also spent, though, time looking at our insurance and looking at what the types of claims we have, the types of claims that have been filed and what the insurance coverage is, and been able to refine that a bit. And so we're able to give you kind of a better estimate of what the range of insurance we believe is available."

Now I'll just give you a brief update. I mean, one of the things that I think we've done relativel",507,"Michael, we laid out at our analyst conference kind of some of those green box items, which were not in the plan, that could provide some additional upside. Now I'll just give you a brief update. I mean, one of the things that I think we've done relatively successful is, you've got to be able to manage both your GRC capital and the capital which should -- per project, which are approved outside the GRC. So just recently, we've had -- just this year, we've had $1 billion of incremental projects approved. That's not incremental to the plan, but that's outside the GRC. That's the Cleveland National Forest project, Sycamore-PQ as well as the batteries, which were discussed earlier on the call. So we're making great progress there. For our '16, '17 and '18 capital plan, it was roughly $3.5 billion. $3.25 billion of that has already been approved and is going forward. So that really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the certainty of our future capital plan. In terms of things, which are not in the plan, Debbie touched on the D.C. line, this is the Southwest power link, which originates in Arizona. We think there's an opportunity, as we think about providing more reliability, particularly into the L.A. basin, of giving access to more renewables and more power from that Palo Verde, generating center in Arizona back into California. That's one project of about $1 billion. Secondly, we think there's an increased opportunity for batteries at San Diego Gas & Electric. By the end of Q1, we will have just over 50 megawatts of utility-owned batteries, and we think there's some incremental 200-megawatt opportunity. That's really associated with this new bill, which was passed this year, which is AB 2868, which calls for 500 megawatts of new batteries to be installed, split 1/3 between the 3 industrial and utilities. Otay Mesa you referenced, which is a 600-megawatt combined cycle plant in the heart of our load center. That is subject to a put collar arrangement with Calpine. And as you may recall, I think, correctly from our last analyst conference, that was not included in our 5-year plan. And then the last thing I would mention is electric vehicles. I mean, with the passage of SB 32, we're now required to drive our greenhouse gas emissions footprint in California 40% below 1990 over the next 14 years, and almost 50% of that has to come from the transportation sector. In fact, that's close to 53% or 54% in our service territory. So big picture on this greenhouse gas image -- issue Michael is, you've only got about 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions coming from electric generation that sit inside the State of California, maybe another 8% to 10% outside the state. There is no question that the state is serious about meeting its goals. We have to have a revolution around the transportation sector. And I think almost in every scenario, the California Utilities will play big in that space."

One is we expect that going forward, there's going to be new national or state rules or regulations on storage. And I think that, that's an opportunity as we continue to enhance the overall infrastructure and the safety of all of our facilities, that's number one. The second, and we've touched on this a little bit, but we're seeing more momentum here on the state is focusing on using natural gas for heavy-duty transportation. So these are fueling infrastructure around that. And then thirdly, focusing on the gathering and cleaning of renewable natural gas from landfills and dairies and things. So we're not going to give out dollar amounts for those yet, but I think those are 3 areas that we definitely see opportunity and upside for our gas companies here in California."

That tax benefit has historically gone through adjusted paid-in capital and now the accounting standards have put it through the P&L. So going forward, we anticipate, assuming that the stock price continues to rise and that the multiplier effect is in place, like it has been in the past years, we would get a similar type benefit.

During the third quarter, our strong operating and financial performance continued across the company. Our third quarter financial results keep us on track to achieve our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.60 to $5 per share. 
I would like to start off with an update on Cameron LNG. Last week, Cameron JV's EPC contractor gave indication that the project is facing delays. Cameron JV and the partners are assessing the information. Any delay would likely cost 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings to be lower than anticipated, but those earnings would be made up over time. Most importantly, our NPV should be substantially maintained as the tariff adjusts as a result of the delay. I will go into further detail in a moment. 
Moving on to other important elements of our base plan. I'm pleased to say that since our analyst conference in July, our team has been successfully executing on our projects. At IEnova, we have closed the approximately $1.1 billion acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the joint venture, and issued $1.6 billion of follow-on equity. At the California Utilities, we continue to make progress on our $12 billion 5-year capital plan. Most recently, the CPC has approved the Sycamore-Peñasquitos Electric Transmission Project at SDG&E. 
We had also made progress on securing development opportunities that can enhance our value proposition. At IEnova, we plan on adding approximately 400 megawatts of new renewable projects. At SDG&E, we received CPUC approval to own and operate 37.5 megawatts of energy storage that we expect to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2017. Now please, turn to Slide 5.
Let me start with an update on Cameron Trains 1 through 3. Last week, Cameron JV received indication from its EPC contractor that the in-service date for each train may be facing delay. The contractor's information reflects updated in-service dates as follows: mid-2018 for Train 1, late 2018 for Train 2 and mid-2019 for Train 3. Sempra and our partners are assessing this new information in ways to mitigate any impact. We are disappointed with the short-term delay because at Sempra, we take great pride in delivering projects on-time and on-budget, but under a lump sum turnkey construction agreement, the contractor retains the responsibility and overall control of the project schedule. The good news is the EPC contract does provide for liquidated damages for certain delays. Those damages would be factored into the tariff and would alleviate some of the impact to Cameron's customers. As a reminder, our JV partners are also our customers. 
The terms of our agreement provides that EPC-scheduled delays and changes in costs results in tariff adjustments. The adjustments are designed to substantially maintain the expected NPV on the project. Therefore, delays are not likely to impact the project's overall NPV. However, any construction delays would likely defer a portion of 2018 and 2019 Cameron earnings. We had originally anticipated all 3 trains being in service by the end of 2018. To give you a sense of the impact, Sempra's expected quarterly earnings from the project when all 3 trains are in service in 2019 are approximately $80 million. 
Moving to Cameron Train 4, any expansion of Cameron beyond the first 3 trains requires unanimous consent from our equity partners. One of the partners has indicated they do not want to invest additional capital for an expansion. Discussions among the partners have been going on for several months, and we are considering a variety of options that may result in a clearer path to an expansion. Although we can't project timing until we receive the necessary approvals, we continue to believe a Cameron expansion would be well positioned as one of the lowest cost sources of global LNG supply. As a reminder, LNG expansions had never been part of our base plan. 
Now please, turn to the next slide for an update on IEnova. We are proud of our recent accomplishments in Mexico. Our new investments in IEnova are underpinned by dollar-based, long-term contracts consistent with Sempra's strategy. They enhance Sempra Mexico's value proposition by diversifying its growth platforms and customer base. IEnova recently completed the purchase of PEMEX's 50% equity interest in our shared joint venture. In October, IEnova raised $1.6 billion in a follow-on equity issuance, primarily to finance the PEMEX acquisition and other growth. The equity offering was the largest follow-on deal in Mexico in the last 2 years. It was substantially oversubscribed and priced at a 5% premium to the launch of marketing. 
Sempra purchased $351 million of IEnova's stock, and now owns approximately 66% of the company. The strong deal is showing is market confirmation that we have been successful with our strategy in Mexico. 
In September, IEnova announced nearly 400 megawatts of additional renewable projects that are in addition to the base plan. This includes the acquisition of the 252-megawatt Ventika wind facility. Ventika went into service in April of this year and is the largest wind farm in Mexico. We expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. And 141 megawatts of solar capacity awarded in Mexico's second renewable auction. Operations are scheduled to come online in the first half of 2019. We continue to see a large amount of growth opportunities in Mexico that fit our strategy. 
Now please, turn to Slide 7 for several other business updates. As noted in the press, we are working on an agreement to purchase a 50% equity interest in the Southern Peru pipeline project. It is an approximately $6.5 billion natural gas pipeline. We are hopeful an agreement can be reached, but there is no assurance and we are still resolving several significant issues. We are not able to comment on this further at this time. 
Moving on to Aliso Canyon, SoCalGas has made significant infrastructure technology and safety enhancements to the facility. We are continuing the process to resume injections by requesting authority from DOGGR and the CPUC this week, which could be approved by year end. Regarding the root-cause analysis, we expect to receive the final report sometime in the first half of 2017, but the timing is dictated by DOGGR, the CPUC and Blade Energy. 
Next, we've settled the only criminal suit with the L.A. County District Attorney's Office for approximately $4 million. The settlement covers a small fine or penalty in enhancements to safety and methane monitoring at the site. The settlement is still subject to court approval. Also, if you'll recall, we previously stated our insurance coverage was over $1 billion. We are now providing a more precise range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. We have received a total of $94 million of insurance proceeds to-date. The total cost estimate has increased to $763 million. The increase is primarily related to updated cost estimates for the third party root-cause analysis and the claims recovery process associated with the temporary relocation program. Please refer to our third quarter 2016 10-Q for more detail on the costs included and excluded from our estimated costs in our insurance coverage. 
Before I hand the call over to Joe, let me discuss the management changes we recently announced. Mark Snell is going to retire in March 2017. Although we are sad to see Mark leave, we appreciate his many contributions to Sempra. 
We also announced several other management changes as part of our succession planning. One of our strengths is the ability to develop and experience a diverse leadership team. We strive to identify talented leaders within our organization and expand their experience across different areas of our business. These management changes are part of our succession planning process to ensure all leadership transitions can be made smoothly with no disruptions to our business. 
With that, I will hand it over to Joe, for his last time as CFO, to review the quarterly financial results starting on Slide 8."

Earlier this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $622 million or $2.46 per share. On an adjusted basis, we reported third quarter earnings of $259 million or $1.02 per share, compared to third quarter adjusted earnings in 2015 of $248 million or $0.99 per share. This quarter, we had 3 adjustments to GAAP earnings. First, as Debbie mentioned, we completed the acquisition of PEMEX's interest in the GdC joint venture and recorded a gain of $350 million, which represents the step up in value of our previously existing ownership interest. 
Second, U.S. Gas & Power closed the sale of its southeast utilities and recorded a gain of $78 million. And finally, as part of the TdM sales process, additional market information became available this quarter that required us to reconsider its current book value. As a result, we recorded a net $65 million noncash charge at Sempra Mexico. All 3 of these items are excluded from third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings and our 2016 adjusted guidance.
I would like to point out that this quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation, resulting in a benefit of $34 million retroactive to January 1, 2016, which is reflected in the results for the 9 months that had no impact on third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 9, and I will discuss the key factors impacting our quarterly earnings.
  
Quarter-over-quarter, adjusted earnings were impacted by the following items: at the California Utilities, we had $21 million of higher earnings, primarily due to higher CPUC base margin net of operating expenses. Sempra International had $13 million of lower earnings, including a $4 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactional effects and inflation in the current year compared to a $16 million favorable impact in 2015 as a result of significant devaluation of the Mexican peso versus the dollar in 2015.  This was partially offset by $5 million of higher operational earnings in Mexico and Peru. 
I would also like to mention an item that didn't impact this quarter, but it could moving forward. Now that we have closed the PEMEX JV acquisition, we have larger deferred tax balances in Mexico. This increases our exposure to Mexican peso movements in the future. You can find individual financial results for our businesses in the Business Unit Earnings section. 
I will wrap up by going over a few of our highlights. Based in our financial results, we are reaffirming our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.60 per share to $5 per share. Our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance is $5 per share to $5.40 per share. 
Our primary focus as a company is executing on our base plan. We had as strong quarter with IEnova closing the PEMEX JV acquisition and completing a $1.6 billion equity issuance. We are also working to drive additional growth with new development opportunities. Just this past quarter, additional battery storage was awarded at SDG&E, and approximately 400 megawatts of renewable projects were announced at IEnova. Incremental projects like these that fit our strategy can enable us to grow during and beyond the 5 years of our base plan. 
With that, we will conclude our prepared comments and stop to take your questions."

Let me try to just give a little more color around the situation. We received notice last week of this, and what they indicated when they gave us notice was just the in-service dates that they anticipated for the 3 trains, that I went over in the prepared remarks. But that would be Train 1, mid-2018; Train 2, the end of 2018; and Train 3, mid-2019. They didn't give us any indication officially of the cause of the delay. But on their call, they indicated that there had been rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge. And apparently, they've had some flooding, particularly at their fabrication facility. In terms of 2020, what -- we're not going to revise any guidance for 2020 at this point. Obviously, we have a lot going on between this and potential of the Peruvian pipeline. And so we're not going to do any update to guidance. But we try to give you an indication of kind of the economics of the 3 trains, if all 3 trains are operating, and that what this delay would be because we had said previously we expected all 3 trains to be in service by the end of 2018. So I think with what we've given you, you can kind of calculate what you would anticipate. In terms of the NPV, and this is very important, the way the tariff works is that the IRR was established that -- when we signed the contract for the project. And at the end of construction of the first train, then all of the assumptions are trued up. What the capital costs are and then what the amount is of the toll in order to maintain the IRR that was agreed upon. And so that will occur, and then so we will collect those dollars to achieve the same NPV on the project, as we would have had, had it gone in service on the originally planned dates. And the toll actually goes up in future years as the way that it's calculated, but it will -- this will cause a delay in 2018 and 2019 earnings, as I stated in my comments. I hope that was clear. Julien, was that helpful?"

Greg, so what we wanted to do here is make sure everybody had the visibility into the fact that we have monetary assets and liabilities and we have deferred taxes. And because the tax system calculates all of our taxes in pesos, these dollar-denominated items, when they're converted to pesos, obviously, can move. And so we see some impact of that. Over the last number of years, it's generally been a pretty close push between what was happening if the currencies are all moving in the same direction, what's happening in Chile, Peru and Mexico kind of offset each other. What we wanted to explain is because we have more deferred taxes now because we're acquiring the other half of this joint venture, our exposure to peso-dollar movement will move on that deferred tax liability and some of our monetary assets and liabilities. It's hard to predict because obviously, we would have to forecast what the effect of the dollar-peso movement would be over the course of the year. Last year, we actually had a positive -- a significant positive benefit to earnings because of this. We, just to remind everybody, we do hedge our current tax liabilities. So if there's a cash impact, then we hedge that to make sure we don't have a cash impact. But we don't hedge the deferred tax liabilities because it's just an accounting item. It moves up and down, and that would be costly to do. So I can't give you a precise number. What we wanted to give you some visibility into is we've been saying for the past 5 years or so that we have a natural hedge between Chile, Peru and Mexico when the currencies are moving in the same direction against the dollar. Now it will be a little bit more tilted to Mexico. It can move up and it can move down, and it will. And so there'll be a little bit more exposure, but again it's a noncash exposure."

When you see something like this kind of get announced by the contractor this early in the process and take into consideration that you have built in kind of time and cost contingencies into the overall package so far kind of where do we shake out here? Is this the contractor being especially conservative and maybe there's a chance down the road that they get back on schedule? Or is this kind of a sign of something even worse to come? And then just a point of clarification as well. On the kind of NPV staying whole, are you guys being made whole for that? If the contractor is not responsible, then just, I guess, mathematically it would be the counterparties that are absorbing all of that potential risk, if that's correct?"

So let me try to address the -- if you look at -- the delay notice, like I said, we just got it last week. We have not had the opportunity to sit down with the contractor and discuss it. We'll be doing that within the next week or so. What I will say, though, is that the project is about 57% complete in total and all the materials are on-site for the construction. We were there last week. All of the cooling units were on Train 1. I mean, there's been a lot of construction progress. And so it's not like early -- it's not really early on, I would say, in the progress of the project. And it's the contractor's responsibility when they feel that there's a potential for a delay to give us this notification, and that's what they did just last week. As I said, all we know is that on their call, they said that there was rain at the site and at their fabrication facility that caused some flooding. We don't know what the actual cause of the delay is. And until we get in and have the chance to have them explain to us what they're looking at and then look at what the potential is to mitigate some of those, it's really hard for us to assess the likelihood of it getting better through those discussions, but we'll be making every effort to have that occur.

But all the LDs would go against the capital cost, which would also reduce the toll to the customer. So to the extent there's a delay that's caused by the contractor, the customer benefits from that in a reduced toll, because it reduces capital cost. But to the extent that there's a delay and that, that increases the toll -- and that's the way we designed it, with -- everyone with full knowledge. I mean, part of the thing that's actually very good is that when we did our contract, we really tried to mitigate the risk for Sempra in terms of the long-term value of this project. And so we set it up to where we were not the ones who took -- bore the risk for these things and that the NPV of the project remain the same and that the contractor had responsibility for delay. And the contractor has a lump sum turnkey contract, the only way that they can increase cost is by change-orders. So that was the design of the project to really mitigate the risk long term to our shareholders. And I think it's showing that it's pretty effective in doing that in the long term, while it may affect some of the shorter term."

And when we looked at -- we look at our reserves on an ongoing basis based upon new knowledge of cost. One of the key things that caused our estimate to go up is the work that's being done on the root-cause analysis and the fact that the third parties that are doing work on that are expecting a delay. And with the expectation of a delay in getting the outcome there, we would expect the cost to be slightly higher. And so we took that into account. And then the other thing is we're going through now recovery with our insurance on all the relocation expense and validating all of the claims that we have full insurance recoverability. And that -- and going through that, that has taken a lot more detailed type of work to get the claims ready, and so we included some of the costs associated with that. Those were the 2 drivers for the change in cost. I would say, these costs will be updated over time, though. As we get into litigation, as we get into -- knowing what legal costs we're incurring and knowing what litigation claims, any settlements that have been reflected with parties on any of the potential claims, fines or penalties or other claims. As an example, on this reserve, we did reach a settlement with the L.A. County D.A., District Attorney, on the criminal charges, and reached a settlement on that. And so once we could quantify that, then that goes into the reserve number that we give you. So those are the kinds of things that would continue to flow through in updates of that reserve. We've also spent, though, time looking at our insurance and looking at what the types of claims we have, the types of claims that have been filed and what the insurance coverage is, and been able to refine that a bit. And so we're able to give you kind of a better estimate of what the range of insurance we believe is available."

We have the ability to expand the Mesquite site. We have the ability to expand the Broken Bow wind site. And so we think that with all the RPS standards that are coming across the country, that there are some good growth opportunities for renewables. I will say that the returns on renewables have gone down over time. And so what we look at is do you really have good projects that have decent returns on them, because we have -- otherwise we can invest our capital. And so we always look at the allocation of our capital to the projects that give us the highest return. And since we're not -- our renewables is just one of the things we do, we're not going to just go after building megawatts.

Now I'll just give you a brief update. I mean, one of the things that I think we've done relatively successful is, you've got to be able to manage both your GRC capital and the capital which should -- per project, which are approved outside the GRC. So just recently, we've had -- just this year, we've had $1 billion of incremental projects approved. That's not incremental to the plan, but that's outside the GRC. That's the Cleveland National Forest project, Sycamore-PQ as well as the batteries, which were discussed earlier on the call. So we're making great progress there. For our '16, '17 and '18 capital plan, it was roughly $3.5 billion. $3.25 billion of that has already been approved and is going forward. So that really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of the certainty of our future capital plan. In terms of things, which are not in the plan, Debbie touched on the D.C. line, this is the Southwest power link, which originates in Arizona. We think there's an opportunity, as we think about providing more reliability, particularly into the L.A. basin, of giving access to more renewables and more power from that Palo Verde, generating center in Arizona back into California. That's one project of about $1 billion. Secondly, we think there's an increased opportunity for batteries at San Diego Gas & Electric. By the end of Q1, we will have just over 50 megawatts of utility-owned batteries, and we think there's some incremental 200-megawatt opportunity. That's really associated with this new bill, which was passed this year, which is AB 2868, which calls for 500 megawatts of new batteries to be installed, split 1/3 between the 3 industrial and utilities. Otay Mesa you referenced, which is a 600-megawatt combined cycle plant in the heart of our load center. That is subject to a put collar arrangement with Calpine. And as you may recall, I think, correctly from our last analyst conference, that was not included in our 5-year plan. And then the last thing I would mention is electric vehicles. I mean, with the passage of SB 32, we're now required to drive our greenhouse gas emissions footprint in California 40% below 1990 over the next 14 years, and almost 50% of that has to come from the transportation sector. In fact, that's close to 53% or 54% in our service territory. So big picture on this greenhouse gas image -- issue Michael is, you've only got about 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions coming from electric generation that sit inside the State of California, maybe another 8% to 10% outside the state. There is no question that the state is serious about meeting its goals. We have to have a revolution around the transportation sector. And I think almost in every scenario, the California Utilities will play big in that space."

One is we expect that going forward, there's going to be new national or state rules or regulations on storage. And I think that, that's an opportunity as we continue to enhance the overall infrastructure and the safety of all of our facilities, that's number one. The second, and we've touched on this a little bit, but we're seeing more momentum here on the state is focusing on using natural gas for heavy-duty transportation. So these are fueling infrastructure around that. And then thirdly, focusing on the gathering and cleaning of renewable natural gas from landfills and dairies and things. So we're not going to give out dollar amounts for those yet, but I think those are 3 areas that we definitely see opportunity and upside for our gas companies here in California."

But when we listened to their earnings call, on the earnings call they said that there was rain at the site and at the site of their fabrication facility that's located near Baton Rouge that caused some flooding and that they expected some delays in construction. That's what they said on their call. You can listen to their call and get the precise language. I'm just kind of reiterating what they said, but we don't have any official notification. And we will be meeting with them soon. It's something where all the partners have to sit down with them together. So it's not something that you can do instantly. Because this is a joint venture, and so it will be ourselves and our 3 partners sitting down with CB&I and Chiyoda, and I think it's scheduled within the next week or 2 for that meeting to occur. To really go through, as I said, they give us this massive package that has a detailed schedule that they produce on the construction. And someone asked the -- what gives you some assurance? Well, part of the effort is to go through that detailed schedule that they give us, and to ensure that everything's been given consideration, and that's the process we need to go through."
