I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I will turn the call over to Doug Groves to go over financial results in detail.  
Let me start by acknowledging that we had several onetime charges this quarter amounting to $91.3 million on a pretax basis that affected our overall performance. Approximately $57 million was related to a noncash write-off of goodwill in our Structures business and roughly $33 million was related to noncash write-off of the LaBarge trade name along with $1.3 million in restructuring charges. Doug will go over these details in a moment, but let me reiterate that approximately $90 million of these charges were noncash in nature. 
Our management team has been extremely busy since the last earnings call over 4 months ago and the company has taken proactive approach to managing its product portfolio on aligning its businesses with the markets it serves. Given the challenging military environment and the volatile energy sector, we told shareholders last year that we would be decisive in reducing costs and focusing our energies on our core markets and products, particularly with the Aerospace & Defense sector. 
So what we accomplished in 2015 laid the groundwork for these initiatives earlier this year, all to transform Ducommun into a more strategically focused streamlined enterprise that can deliver unique structural and electronic solutions to our customers while providing higher returns to our shareholders. 
We've successfully caught overhead expenses, reduced headcount by some 12% over the past 5 quarters, consolidated multiple facilities in New York and closed an operation in Texas. We've also made additional moves to improve Ducommun's long-term growth and treasury and financial performance. The sale of our Pittsburgh facility and Miltec subsidiary sharpened our strategic focus, providing for additional debt reduction and leads in a strong position to invest in key Aerospace & Defense markets we serve. Pittsburgh with sales of approximately $42 million provided circuit and other electronics primarily to industrial energy and medical markets. Miltec, with sales of roughly $28 million, provided engineering and program management services to the United States Department of Defense. Neither business was considered core to our growth plans and both will benefit from new owners with broader commitments to the customers they serve. 
The Pittsburgh sale was finalized in January and we expect the Miltec divestiture to be completed early in the second quarter. In addition, this quarter, we will close an administrative office in St. Louis. With such changes this year and last, we reduced our non-aerospace and defense industrial business to approximately 10% of our sales going forward and then virtually eliminate all exposure to the volatile oil and gas market. We previously announced that our headcount reductions and streamlining actions and supply chain initiatives will remove some $68 million of annualized costs from our operations. And we're on track to see many of these savings in fiscal 2016. These cost reductions will allow us to move closer to our historical growth and operating margin parameters. 
In 2015, we also refinanced our debt, lowered our overall indebtedness and reduced interest expenses substantially. We generated approximately $34 million of cash from operations last year, excluding nearly $15 million used to refinance our debt and reduced total indebtedness from $204 million to $245 million from $290 million at the beginning of 2015. In addition, we are using the $50 million received from the Miltec and Pittsburgh divestitures to pay down debt even further. 
Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger every day. So we're doing what we said we would do: Enacting strategic decisions and cost-reduction initiatives, in the position the company for improved results going forward. The measures we've taken are meant to increase the company's asset utilization while concurrently reducing the volatility inherent such industries as the energy sector. We will continue to assess our portfolio for further refinement and believe that the strong commercial aerospace demand, along with greater stability across our military platforms, should lead to higher results in 2016. 
While we are not pleased at all with our operating performance in 2015, despite of the many accomplishments I just mentioned, we did experience a number of one-time issues, which will not be repeated in 2016. Our team is highly focused to delivering strong operation and growth performance in 2016. 
We focused -- we closed our 2015 sales of $666 million versus $742 million in 2014. This 10% shortfall primarily reflected a 21% drop experienced across our military and space markets, something we spoke about all last year. We also saw a 4% decline in industrial business, partially offset by a 3% increase in the commercial aerospace revenue. We'll get into the specifics in a moment, but there are 2 important things to keep in mind going forward. First, we believe that defense spending across our platforms is stabilize such that the company should not see that type of severe program swings experienced last year. And second, we've actually taken measures to reduce our industrial and market exposure as we should and which will also lower the volatility for this year. 
Now let me provide some color on our end markets products and programs. I'd like to start by noting a change in how we refer to our operating units to more clearly articulate business there are present. We've renamed Ducommun AeroStructures as our Structural Systems segment and our Ducommun LaBarge Technologies units as the Electronic Systems segment. We believe that these name changes will add more clarity as we go to the market as 1 company. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Let me reiterate that I mentioned just a moment ago, we see much greater stability here than last year, which was extremely challenging due to the budget curtailments and spending decisions that impacted nearly all of our platforms. The reductions were beyond what we expected and due to the lower build rates and reduced overall shipments. In fact, virtually no platforms saw growth in 2015 as lower spending impacted fixed-wing programs and helicopter programs alike, across both segments of our company. 
Our F-15 and F-18 radar rack shipments dropped sharply as did electronics and structural sales for the Apache and the Blackhawk, although the latter remain our largest military platform with roughly $42 million in revenue. As I said last year, these steep year-over-year declines have reset the base level for our defense-related operations and we have rapidly work to catch up and keep pace with the lower overhead absorption at our facilities by streamlining processes, reducing headcount and working capital and consolidating where possible. These efforts will continue in 2016. 
It's too soon to say what demand trends will play out this year and next, but Ducommun is dedicated to rightsizing our operations for a lower overall level of defense spending. 
Moving to our Commercial Aerospace business. Total revenue last year rose to just under $250 million, that's our highest level ever. The growth was driven primarily by a large fixed-wing aircraft where revenue expanded 5% to a record $144 million. But our growth in 2015 was only part of the story. More importantly, we ended the year with a record backlog of just under $270 million across the Commercial Aerospace sector. That's up from $250 million in Q3 and $230 million a year ago. 
The story here is one of strength and diversification that expected to drive higher growth in the quarters and years to come and we won a number of new applications in 2015, cementing our position as one of the best aircraft in the industry. As a reminder, our largest commercial platform is the 737 and Boeing's plan to increase the 737 Max output to approximately 57 ship sets a month by 2019 represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Ducommun. 
So while the near-term impacts of the transition for both the 737 and the 777 onto their next generation models may be a little bumpy, the story will accelerate our top line growth in the coming years. 
Also, for 2016, Boeing is increasing their production of the 787 from 12 aircraft -- from 10 aircraft a month to 12 aircraft a month, providing a further boost to our expected growth this year. We continue to work on expanding our business with Airbus and are optimistic about additional content on both the A320neo and A350 aircraft as well as other platforms going forward. We also made substantial headway in winning new content with engine suppliers and OEMs last year, leveraging our proprietary composite technology and our titanium structural applications. 
In total, we have over 30 new development programs in place and we expect that we will begin positively impact Ducommun's top line later in 2016 and accelerate into 2017, driven by a step-up in several platform build rates. Our wins last year included a 10% growth in aerospace electronics content, positioning us for more complex, value-added assemblies going forward. We also expect helicopters sales and regional business jets revenue to mirror 2015, bringing some stability to these platforms.  So overall, our Commercial Aerospace outlook is brighter than ever. 
Lastly, in our industrial defense business, is now smaller than last year as I previously mentioned, due to the divestitures and other actions. Given our lack of exposure to the energy markets, we anticipate 2016 to be a more stable year in the remaining areas that we serve. And while we try to grow this business as our business development initiatives focused on higher complexity industrial applications, we are very comfortable that the businesses that we serve now in the industrial segment will continue to grow as we go forward. 
Before turning the call over to Doug, let me just comment on some recent management changes here at Ducommun. First, we're glad to have Doug Groves as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Having taken the reins in January 1, Doug's been a great asset already and proving to be a resourceful thinker as we tackle many of the strategic decisions needed to improve the company going forward. I'd also like to thank Joel Benkie for his service to Ducommun. As we previously announced, he has decided to retire at the end of the quarter. Joe has been instrumental in many changes at the company. He deserves credit for redesigning the way we think strategically about operational excellence and capacity utilization. We wish him the best in going forward and I will be personally managing his responsibilities for the time being. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Doug."

Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were approximately $156.6 million, roughly 16% lower than the comparable quarter of 2014. The revenue decline reflected 19% lower revenue in the company's military and",1631,"Thank you, Tony, and good day to everybody. 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were approximately $156.6 million, roughly 16% lower than the comparable quarter of 2014. The revenue decline reflected 19% lower revenue in the company's military and space markets, mainly due to a decrease in the U.S. Defense spending as well as procurement delays in the shipment program priorities that impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms. 
In addition, the overall year-to-year top line shortfall reflected 20% lower revenue in the company's industrial end-use markets. This was mainly due to the closure of the company's Houston manufacturing center during the quarter and 12% lower revenue in the company's commercial aerospace end use markets, primarily reflecting delays in the timing of certain regional jet orders. 
That said, we continue to experience solid commercial aerospace demand to the current build rates and increased content such that during the quarter, we saw significant growth in our commercial aerospace backlog. New orders, both structural and electronic solutions, drove our backlog here to the highest level in our history. Just under $270 million as of year and, as Tony mentioned. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross profit margin was 14.6% in the fourth quarter as compared to 17.9% in last year's comparable quarter. This reflected the lower sales and reduced operating leverage even as we continue to realize supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. Given the rightsizing initiatives being implemented at the company, we expect to see gross margin improve as the year plays out and return to historical levels in the 80% to 90% range, particularly as the customer's new platforms gain momentum in later '16. 
Ducommun's operating loss for the current quarter was approximately $88.6 million compared to an operating income of $10.1 million or 5.4% of revenue for the comparable period in 2014. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the impairment charge of $57.2 million for the entire goodwill within our Structural System segment as a result of the company's annual goodwill impairment analysis and an impairment charge of $32.9 million related to the LaBarge tradename as we no longer plan on using it.  Both of these charges were noncash in nature. 
The operating loss in the fourth quarter was also impacted by inefficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volumes of approximately $5.7 million and the prior year included a nonrecurring $3.4 million reversal of a forward loss reserve as a result of the customer settlement that did not recur in '15. The fourth quarter also included a $1.3 million restructuring charge related to our facility rationalization initiatives. Excluding the impairment charges and the restructuring charges, the current quarter operating income would have been $2.8 million or 2% of revenue in '15 compared to $7 million in the previous year's fourth quarter, primarily due to a lower outstanding debt balance and reduced interest rate as a result of the company's refinancing in July of 2015.  We estimate interest expense will be approximately $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Our effective income tax benefit during the quarter was $26.6 million or 29.5% compared to a 27.8% income tax benefit for the comparable period last year. Going forward, we expect the effective tax rate for 2016 to average approximately 29%, now that the federal R&D tax credits have been made permanent. We reported a net loss of $63.6 million or a loss of $5.74 per share compared to net income of $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease in net loss was primarily due to the impairment charges, the forward-looking statements reversal in 2014, the restructuring charge and lower operating leverage due to reduced manufacturing volume, which was partially offset by the income tax benefit as previously mentioned. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $11 million or 7% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 10.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2014. 
Now let's turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $61 million in Q4 of 2015 versus $78.3 million in the prior-year period. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 37% decrease in military and space revenue. This reflected a decline in demand for military fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and a 14% decrease in commercial aerospace revenue, reflecting delays in the timing of certain regional jet orders. 
While commercial sales were down in the quarter, we ended 2015 with a record backlog of $224 million in this portion of our Structures business, underscoring the strength of the demand and the outlook for 2016. With the stabilization of the military business in this segment, we expect the current quarter revenue to be run rate for the next few quarters until our previously announced commercial aerospace wins come online in late 2016. 
The Structural Systems unit had an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $56 million compared to operating income of $6.9 million or 8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014, and this was primarily due to the previously mentioned $57.2 million goodwill impairment charge, loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volume of approximately $2.8 million, the previously mentioned nonrecurring forward loss statements reversals in 2014 of approximately $3.4 million and a $1 million restructuring charge in this segment in the quarter. Excluding the impairment charge and restructuring charge, the operating margin from the segment would have been $2.2 million or 4% of revenue in 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 million for the current quarter or 7.6% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 13.5% of revenue for the comparable quarter in 2014. 
Moving to our Electronic Systems segment. We posted revenue of $95.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $109.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 20% decrease in industrial revenue, reflecting the closure of our Houston operations in a 10% decrease in military and space revenue mainly due to the decline in demand for military fixed-wing and helicopter platforms. 
For 2016, the divestitures of our Pittsburgh and Miltec operations as well as our Houston facility closure will reduce 2016 full-year revenue within the Electronic Systems segment by approximately $80 million. However, it virtually eliminates the company's exposure to the volatile energy market. 
On a pro forma basis, excluding these operations, Electronic Systems would've posted revenue of $313 million in 2015. Electronic Systems had an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $27 million compared to operating income of $8.5 million or 7.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. This reflects the previously mentioned LaBarge tradename impairment charge of $32.9 million, loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volume of approximately $2.9 million and a $300,000 restructuring charge related to the site closures. Excluding impairment charge, the restructure charge, the operating margin from the segment would have been $6.2 million or 6.4% of revenue. 
The adjusted EBITDA was $11.3 million for the current quarter or 11.8% of revenue compared to $13 million or 11.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $5.6 million or 3.6% of total company revenue versus $5.3 million or 2.8% of revenue in the comparable quarter of 2014. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased slightly due to higher professional service fees of approximately $1 million related to the Pittsburgh and Miltec divestitures, which were offset by lower compensation and benefit cost of approximately $700,000. 
Now turning to our overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter, which was $546 million versus $553 million at the end of the third quarter as the significant increase in the commercial aerospace orders were offset by a decline in the defense and industrial bookings. 
Regarding liquidity and capital resources. We generated approximately $23.7 million of cash from operations in 2015, including the use of approximately $15 million to refinance our debt in mid-2015. Excluding the debt refinancing cost, we generated approximately $34 million in cash from operations compared to $53 million in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we entered into an interest rate cap hedge, totaling approximately $135 million, which decreases our exposure to interest rate increases going forward. We will be using in the net proceeds from the divestiture of Miltec and Pittsburgh of approximately $50 million to pay down debt in 2016 and we continue toward our goal of deleveraging to targets of 2.25s to 2.5x of that EBITDA over the next few years. We expect to exit the first quarter of 2016 with approximately $200 million in debt. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 were approximately $16 million. Our CapEx spending reflected the consolidation and expansion of our upstate New York operations resulting in a state-of-the-art advanced titanium products center of excellence. We expect CapEx to be approximately $18 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms that are ramping up later this year. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix of our business and taking decisive actions to streamline operations as evidenced by the 2 divestitures announced this quarter. We believe commercial aerospace demand will fuel higher revenue this year and that our defense related businesses will more stable going forward versus the sharp declines we've experienced in 2015. At the same time, as Tony mentioned, we will look to drive margin expansion, cash flow generation and further reduce debt. Our cost cutting activities will continue as we remain committed to improving financial results in 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, let me briefly summarize our strategic priorities as we begin 2016. Since last year was the year of transition exemplified by lower debt and strengthening of our balance sheet and cutting costs and strategic assessment of our operations, in the coming years, one of action and growth. We've already taken decisive steps to shed noncore underperforming assets and will, as I stated, close additional facility this quarter. The company is focused on providing unique value-added Electronic and Structural Systems to the aerospace, defense and other high-technology markets and continue to benefit from the strong commercial aerospace cycle and increasing build rates going forward. 
To pay down debt, we will continue to do so based on our solid cash flow projections, leaving us with an even stronger, more flexible balance sheet this year. We will also strive to reduce working capital, increase asset utilization and expand margins as we review our operations and product portfolios for additional efforts to focus the company and drive increased shareholder value. 
The bottom line is that we did what we said we would do in 2015 and position the company for stronger growth and improved bottom line results going forward. With our commercial aerospace programs on track for continued expansion and stability across our defense markets, we believe the company's in good shape to take advantage of the numerous opportunities across old and new customers alike.

So the aggregate, those numbers up, it's about $9 million to $12 million on an annualized basis, recognizing that we're in various stages of implementing each of those things.

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I will turn the call over to Doug Groves to go over financial results in detail.  
Let me start by acknowledging that we had several onetime charges this quarter amounting to $91.3 million on a pretax basis that affected our overall performance. Approximately $57 million was related to a noncash write-off of goodwill in our Structures business and roughly $33 million was related to noncash write-off of the LaBarge trade name along with $1.3 million in restructuring charges. Doug will go over these details in a moment, but let me reiterate that approximately $90 million of these charges were noncash in nature. 
Our management team has been extremely busy since the last earnings call over 4 months ago and the company has taken proactive approach to managing its product portfolio on aligning its businesses with the markets it serves. Given the challenging military environment and the volatile energy sector, we told shareholders last year that we would be decisive in reducing costs and focusing our energies on our core markets and products, particularly with the aerospace and defense sector. 
So what we accomplished in 2015 laid the groundwork for additional initiatives earlier this year, all to transform Ducommun into a more strategically focused streamlined enterprise that can deliver unique structural and electronic solutions to our customers while providing higher returns to our shareholders. 
We've successfully caught overhead expenses, reduced headcount by some 12% over the past 5 quarters, consolidated multiple facilities in New York and closed an operation in Texas. We've also made additional moves to improve Ducommun's long-term growth trajectory and financial performance. The sale of our Pittsburgh facility and Miltec subsidiary sharpened our strategic focus, providing for additional debt reduction and leaves us in a stronger position to invest in key aerospace and defense markets we serve. Pittsburgh, with sales of approximately $42 million, provided circuit card assembly and other electronics primarily to industrial energy and medical markets. Miltec, with sales of roughly $28 million, provided engineering and program management services to the United States Department of Defense. Neither business was considered core to our growth plans and both will benefit from new owners with broader commitments to the customers they serve. 
The Pittsburgh sale was finalized in January and we expect the military -- or the Miltec divestiture to be completed early in the second quarter. In addition, this quarter, we will close an administrative office in St. Louis. With such changes this year and last, we reduced our non-aerospace and defense industrial business to approximately 10% of our sales going forward and then virtually eliminate all exposure to the volatile oil and gas market. We previously announced that our headcount reductions, streamlining actions and supply chain initiatives would remove some $68 million of annualized costs from our operations. And we're on track to see many of these savings in fiscal 2016. These cost reductions will allow us to move closer to our historical growth and operating margin parameters. 
In 2015, we also refinanced our debt, lowered our overall indebtedness and reduced interest expenses substantially. We generated approximately $34 million of cash from operations last year, excluding nearly $15 million used to refinance our debt, and reduced total indebtedness from $204 million to $245 million from $290 million at the beginning of 2015. In addition, we are using the $50 million received from the Miltec and Pittsburgh divestitures to pay down debt even further. 
Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger every day. So we're doing what we said we would do: Enacting strategic decisions and cost-reduction initiatives, in the position the company for improved results going forward. The measures we've taken are meant to increase the company's asset utilization while concurrently reducing the volatility inherent in such industries as the energy sector. We will continue to assess our portfolio for further refinement and believe that the strong commercial aerospace demand, along with greater stability across our military platforms, should lead to higher results in 2016. 
While we are not pleased at all with our operating performance in 2015, despite of the many accomplishments I just mentioned, we did experience a number of onetime issues, which will not be repeated in 2016. Our team is highly focused to delivering strong operation and growth performance in 2016. 
We focused -- or excuse me, we closed our 2015 sales of $666 million versus $742 million in 2014. This 10% shortfall primarily reflected a 21% drop experienced across our military and space markets, something we spoke about all last year. We also saw a 4% decline in industrial business, partially offset by a 3% increase in the commercial aerospace revenue. We'll get into the specifics in a moment, but there are 2 important things to keep in mind going forward. First, we believe that defense spending across our platforms is stabilize such that the company should not see that type of severe program swings experienced last year. And second, we've actually taken measures to reduce our industrial and market exposure as we should and which will also lower the volatility for this year. 
Now let me provide some color on our end markets products and programs. I'd like to start by noting a change in how we refer to our operating units to more clearly articulate the business they represent. We've renamed Ducommun AeroStructures as our Structural Systems segment and our Ducommun LaBarge Technologies units as the Electronic Systems segment. We believe that these name changes will add more clarity as we go to the market as one company. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Let me reiterate that I mentioned just a moment ago, we see much greater stability here than last year, which was extremely challenging due to the budget curtailments and spending decisions that impacted nearly all of our platforms. The reductions were beyond what we expected and due to lower build rates and reduced overall -- oversea shipments. In fact, virtually no platforms saw a growth in 2015 as lower spending impacted fixed-wing programs and helicopter programs alike, across both segments of our company. 
Our F-15 and F-18 radar rack shipments dropped sharply as did electronics and structural sales for the Apache and the Black Hawk, although the latter remained our largest military platform with roughly $42 million in revenue. As I said last year, these steep year-over-year declines have reset the base level for our defense-related operations and we have rapidly work to catch up and keep pace with the lower overhead absorption at our facilities by streamlining processes, reducing headcount and working capital and consolidating where possible. These efforts will continue in 2016. 
It's too soon to say what demand trends will play out this year and next, but Ducommun is dedicated to rightsizing our operations for a lower overall level of defense spending. 
Moving to our commercial aerospace business. Total revenue last year rose to just under $250 million, that's our highest level ever. The growth was driven primarily by a large fixed-wing aircraft where revenue expanded 5% to a record $144 million. But our growth in 2015 was only part of the story. More importantly, we ended the year with a record backlog of under -- just under $270 million across the commercial aerospace sector. That's up from $250 million in Q3 and $230 million a year ago. 
The story here is one of strength and diversification that expected to drive higher growth in the quarters and years to come. And we won a number of new applications in 2015, cementing our position as some of the best aircraft in the industry. As a reminder, our largest commercial platform is the 737 and Boeing's plan to increase the 737 max output to approximately 57 shipsets a month by 2019 represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Ducommun. 
So while the near-term impacts of the transition for both the 737 and the 777 onto their next-generation models may be a little bumpy, the story will accelerate our top line growth in the coming years. 
Also, for 2016, Boeing is increasing the production of the 787 from 12 aircraft -- or from 10 aircraft a month to 12 aircraft a month, providing a further boost to our expected growth this year. We continue to work on expanding our business with Airbus and are optimistic about additional content on both the A320neo and the A350 aircraft as well as other platforms going forward. We also made substantial headway in winning new content with engine suppliers and OEMs last year, leveraging our proprietary composite technology and our titanium structural applications. 
In total, we have over 30 new development programs in place and we expect that we will begin positively impact Ducommun's top line later in 2016 and accelerate into 2017, driven by a step-up in several platform build rates. Our wins last year included a 10% growth in aerospace electronics content, positioning us for more complex, value-added assemblies going forward. We also expect helicopters sales and regional business jet revenue to mirror 2015, bringing some stability to these platforms.  So overall, our commercial aerospace outlook is brighter than ever. 
Lastly, in our industrial defense business -- in our industrial business is now smaller than last year, as I previously mentioned, due to the divestitures and other actions. Given our lack of exposure to the energy markets, we anticipate 2016 to be a more stable year in the remaining areas that we serve. And while we try to grow this business as our business development initiatives focus on higher complexity industrial applications, we are very comfortable that the businesses that we serve now in the industrial segment will continue to grow as we go forward. 
Before turning the call over to Doug, let me just comment on some recent management changes here at Ducommun. First, we're glad to have Doug Groves as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Having taken the reins in January 1, Doug's been a great asset already and proving to be a resourceful thinker as we tackle many of the strategic decisions needed to improve the company going forward. I'd also like to thank Joel Benkie for his service to Ducommun. As we previously announced, he has decided to retire at the end of the quarter. Joel has been instrumental in many changes at the company. He deserves credit for redesigning the way we think strategically about operational excellence and capacity utilization. We wish him the best in going forward and I will be personally managing his responsibilities for the time being. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Doug."

Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were approximately $156.6 million, roughly 16% lower than the comparable quarter of 2014. The revenue decline reflected 19% lower revenue in the company's military and",1631,"Thank you, Tony, and good day to everybody. 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were approximately $156.6 million, roughly 16% lower than the comparable quarter of 2014. The revenue decline reflected 19% lower revenue in the company's military and space markets, mainly due to a decrease in U.S. defense spending as well as procurement delays in the shipment program priorities that impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms. 
In addition, the overall year-to-year top line shortfall reflected 20% lower revenue in the company's industrial end-use markets. This was mainly due to the closure of the company's Houston manufacturing center during the quarter and 12% lower revenue in the company's commercial aerospace end use markets, primarily reflecting delays in the timing of certain regional jet orders. 
That said, we continue to experience solid commercial aerospace demand to the current build rates and increased content such that during the quarter, we saw significant growth in our commercial aerospace backlog. New orders, both structural and electronic solutions, drove our backlog here to the highest level in our history, just under $270 million as of year-end, as Tony mentioned. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross profit margin was 14.6% in the fourth quarter as compared to 17.9% in last year's comparable quarter. This reflected the lower sales and reduced operating leverage even as we continue to realize supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. Given the rightsizing initiatives being implemented at the company, we expect to see gross margin improve as the year plays out and return to historical levels in the 80% to 90% range, particularly as the customer's new platforms gain momentum in later '16. 
Ducommun's operating loss for the current quarter was approximately $88.6 million compared to an operating income of $10.1 million or 5.4% of revenue for the comparable period in 2014. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to an impairment charge of $57.2 million for the entire goodwill within our Structural Systems segment as a result of the company's annual goodwill impairment analysis and an impairment charge of $32.9 million related to the LaBarge tradename as we no longer plan on using it. Both of these charges were noncash in nature. 
The operating loss in the fourth quarter was also impacted by inefficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volumes of approximately $5.7 million and the prior year included a nonrecurring $3.4 million reversal of a forward loss reserve as a result of the customer settlement that did not recur in '15. The fourth quarter also included a $1.3 million restructuring charge related to our facility rationalization initiatives. Excluding the impairment charges and the restructuring charges, the current quarter operating income would have been $2.8 million or 2% of revenue than in '15 compared to $7 million in the previous year's fourth quarter, primarily due to a lower outstanding debt balance and reduced interest rate as a result of the company's refinancing in July of 2015.  We estimate interest expense will be approximately $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Our effective income tax benefit during the quarter was $26.6 million or 29.5% compared to a 27.8% income tax benefit for the comparable period last year. Going forward, we expect the effective tax rate for 2016 to average approximately 29%, now that the federal R&D tax credits have been made permanent. We reported a net loss of $63.6 million or a loss of $5.74 per share compared to net income of $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease to our net loss was primarily due to the impairment charges, then forward loss reversal in 2014, the restructuring charge and lower operating leverage due to reduced manufacturing volume, which was partially offset by the income tax benefit as previously mentioned. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $11 million or 7% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 10.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2014. 
Now let's turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $61 million in Q4 of 2015 versus $78.3 million in the prior-year period. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 37% decrease in military and space revenue. This reflected a decline in demand for military fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and a 14% decrease in commercial aerospace revenue, reflecting delays in the timing of certain regional jet orders. 
While commercial sales were down in the quarter, we ended 2015 with a record backlog of $224 million in this portion of our Structures business, underscoring the strength of the demand and the outlook for 2016. With the stabilization of the military business in this segment, we expect the current quarter revenue to be a run rate for the next few quarters until our previously announced commercial aerospace wins come online in late 2016. 
The Structural Systems unit had an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $56 million compared to operating income of $6.9 million or 8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014, and this was primarily due to the previously mentioned $57.2 million goodwill impairment charge, loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volume of approximately $2.8 million, the previously mentioned nonrecurring forward loss reversal in 2014 of approximately $3.4 million and a $1 million restructuring charge in this segment in the quarter. Excluding the impairment charge and restructuring charge, the operating margin from this segment would have been $2.2 million or 4% of revenue in 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 million for the current quarter or 7.6% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 13.5% of revenue for the comparable quarter in 2014. 
Moving to our Electronic Systems segment. We posted revenue of $95.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $109.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 20% decrease in industrial revenue, reflecting the closure of our Houston operations and a 10% decrease in military and space revenue mainly due to the decline in demand for military fixed-wing and helicopter platforms. 
For 2016, the divestitures of our Pittsburgh and Miltec operations as well as our Houston facility closure will reduce 2016 full-year revenue within the Electronic Systems segment by approximately $80 million. However, it virtually eliminates the company's exposure to the volatile energy market. 
On a pro forma basis, excluding these operations, Electronic Systems would have posted revenue of $313 million in 2015. Electronic Systems had an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $27 million compared to operating income of $8.5 million or 7.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. This reflects the previously mentioned LaBarge tradename impairment charge of $32.9 million, loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volume of approximately $2.9 million and a $300,000 restructuring charge related to the site closures. Excluding the impairment charge, the restructure charge, the operating margin from this segment would have been $6.2 million or 6.4% of revenue. 
The adjusted EBITDA was $11.3 million for the current quarter or 11.8% of revenue compared to $13 million or 11.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $5.6 million or 3.6% of total company revenue versus $5.3 million or 2.8% of revenue in the comparable quarter of 2014. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased slightly due to higher professional service fees of approximately $1 million related to the Pittsburgh and Miltec divestitures, which was offset by lower compensation and benefit cost of approximately $700,000. 
Now turning to our overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter, which was $546 million versus $553 million at the end of the third quarter as the significant increase in the commercial aerospace orders was offset by a decline in the defense and industrial bookings. 
Regarding liquidity and capital resources. We generated approximately $23.7 million of cash from operations in 2015, including the use of approximately $15 million to refinance our debt in mid-2015. Excluding the debt refinancing cost, we generated approximately $34 million in cash from operations compared to $53 million in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we entered into an interest rate cap hedge, totaling approximately $135 million, which decreases our exposure to interest rate increases going forward. We will be using the net proceeds from the divestiture of Miltec and Pittsburgh of approximately $50 million to pay down debt in 2016 and we continue toward our goal of deleveraging to targets of 2.25x to 2.5x of debt to EBITDA over the next few years. We expect to exit the first quarter of 2016 with approximately $200 million in debt. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 were approximately $16 million. Our CapEx spending reflected the consolidation and expansion of our upstate New York operations resulting in a state-of-the-art advanced titanium product center of excellence. We expect CapEx to be approximately $18 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms that are ramping up later this year. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix of our business and taking decisive actions to streamline operations as evidenced by the 2 divestitures announced this quarter. We believe commercial aerospace demand will fuel higher revenue this year and that our defense-related businesses will more stable going forward versus the sharp declines we experienced in 2015. At the same time, as Tony mentioned, we will look to drive margin expansion, cash flow generation and further reduce debt. Our cost-cutting activities will continue as we remain committed to improving financial results in 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, let me briefly summarize our strategic priorities as we begin 2016. If last year was a year of transition exemplified by lower debt, strengthening our balance sheet and cutting costs and strategic assessment of our operations, and the coming year is one of action and growth. We've already taken decisive steps to shed noncore underperforming assets and will, as I've stated, close an additional facility this quarter. The company is focused on providing unique value-added electronic and structural solutions to the aerospace, defense and other high-technology markets and will continue to benefit from the strong commercial aerospace cycle and increasing build rates going forward. 
We pay down debt, and we will continue to do so based on our solid cash flow projections, leaving us with an even stronger, more flexible balance sheet this year. We'll also strive to reduce working capital, increase asset utilization and expand margins as we review our operations and product portfolios for additional efforts to focus the company and drive increased shareholder value. 
The bottom line is that we did what we said we would do in 2015 and position the company for stronger growth and improved bottom line results going forward. With our commercial aerospace programs on track for continued expansion and stability across our defense markets, we believe the company is in good shape to take advantage of the numerous opportunities across old and new customers alike. We are a focused unique provider of cutting-edge aerospace technologies with strong client relationships and a reorganized business development team dedicated to executing on a variety of growth initiatives. 
And with that, Karen, I would just now like to open up the call for questions, please."

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I will turn the call over to Doug Groves to go over our financial results in detail.  
Let me start by acknowledging that we had several onetime charges this quarter amounting to $91.3 million on a pretax basis that affected our overall performance. Approximately $57 million was related to a noncash write-off of goodwill in our Structures business and roughly $33 million was related to a noncash write-off of the LaBarge trade name along with $1.3 million in restructuring charges. Doug will go over these details in a moment, but let me reiterate that approximately $90 million of these charges were noncash in nature. 
Our management team has been extremely busy since the last earnings call over 4 months ago and the company has taken proactive approach to managing its product portfolio and aligning its businesses with the markets it serves. Given the challenging military environment and the volatile energy sector, we told shareholders last year that we would be decisive in reducing costs and focusing our energies on our core markets and products, particularly with the aerospace and defense sector. 
So what we accomplished in 2015 laid the groundwork for additional initiatives earlier this year, all to transform Ducommun into a more strategically focused, streamlined enterprise that can deliver unique structural and electronic solutions to our customers while providing higher returns to our shareholders. 
We've successfully cut overhead expenses, reduced headcount by some 12% over the past 5 quarters, consolidated multiple facilities in New York and closed an operation in Texas. We've also made additional moves to improve Ducommun's long-term growth trajectory and financial performance. The sale of our Pittsburgh facility and Miltec subsidiary sharpened our strategic focus, providing for additional debt reduction and leaves us in a stronger position to invest in key aerospace and defense markets we serve. Pittsburgh, with sales of approximately $42 million, provided circuit card assemblies and other electronics primarily to industrial energy and medical markets. Miltec, with sales of roughly $28 million, provided engineering and program management services to the United States Department of Defense. Neither business was considered core to our growth plans and both will benefit from new owners with broader commitments to the customers they serve. 
The Pittsburgh sale was finalized in January and we expect the military -- or the Miltec divestiture to be completed early in the second quarter. In addition, this quarter, we will close an administrative office in St. Louis. With such changes this year and last, we reduced our Non-aerospace and Defense Industrial business to approximately 10% of our sales going forward and then virtually eliminated all exposure to the volatile oil and gas market. We previously announced that our headcount reductions, streamlining actions and supply chain initiatives would remove some $6 to 8 million of annualized costs from our operations. And we're on track to see many of these savings in fiscal 2016. These cost reductions will allow us to move closer to our historical gross and operating margin parameters. 
In 2015, we also refinanced our debt, lowered our overall indebtedness and reduced interest expenses substantially. We generated approximately $34 million of cash from operations last year, excluding nearly $15 million used to refinance our debt and reduced total indebtedness from $204 million -- to $245 million from $290 million at the beginning of 2015. In addition, we are using the $50 million received from the Miltec and Pittsburgh divestitures to pay down debt even further. 
Our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger every day. So we're doing what we said we would do: enacting strategic decisions and cost-reduction initiatives and positioned the company for improved results going forward. The measures we've taken are meant to increase the company's asset utilization while concurrently reducing the volatility inherent in such industries as the energy sector. We will continue to assess our portfolio for further refinement and believe that the strong commercial aerospace demand, along with greater stability across our military platforms, should lead to higher results in 2016. 
While we are not pleased at all with our operating performance in 2015, despite of the many accomplishments I just mentioned, we did experience a number of onetime issues, which will not be repeated in 2016. Our team is highly focused to delivering strong operation and growth performance in 2016. 
We focused -- or excuse me, we closed our 2015 sales of $666 million versus $742 million in 2014. This 10% shortfall primarily reflected a 21% drop experienced across our military and space markets, something we spoke about all last year. We also saw a 4% decline in industrial business, partially offset by a 3% increase in the Commercial Aerospace revenue. We'll get into the specifics in a moment, but there are 2 important things to keep in mind going forward. First, we believe that defense spending across our platforms has stabilized, such that the company should not see that type of severe program swings experienced last year. And second, we have actively taken measures to reduce our industrial and market exposure as we should and which will also lower the volatility for this year. 
Now let me provide some color on our end markets products and programs. I'd like to start by noting a change in how we refer to our operating units to more clearly articulate the business they represent. We've renamed Ducommun AeroStructures as our Structural Systems segment and our Ducommun LaBarge Technologies unit as the Electronic Systems segment. We believe that these name changes will add more clarity as we go to the market as one company. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Let me reiterate that I mentioned just a moment ago, we see much greater stability here than last year, which was extremely challenging due to the budget curtailments and spending decisions that impacted nearly all of our platforms. The reductions were beyond what we expected and due to lower build rates and reduced overall -- oversea shipments. In fact, virtually no platforms saw a growth in 2015 as lower spending impacted fixed-wing programs and helicopter programs alike, across both segments of our company. 
Our F-15 and F-18 radar rack shipments dropped sharply as did electronics and structural sales for the Apache and the Black Hawk, although the latter remained our largest military platform with roughly $42 million in revenue. As I said last year, these steep year-over-year declines have reset the base level for our defense-related operations and we have rapidly worked to catch up and keep pace with the lower overhead absorption at our facilities by streamlining processes, reducing headcount and working capital and consolidating where possible. These efforts will continue in 2016. 
It's too soon to say what demand trends will play out this year and next, but Ducommun is dedicated to rightsizing our operations for a lower overall level of defense spending. 
Moving to our Commercial Aerospace business. Total revenue last year rose to just under $250 million. That's our highest level ever. The growth was driven primarily by a large fixed-wing aircraft where revenue expanded 5% to a record $144 million. But our growth in 2015 was only part of the story. More importantly, we ended the year with a record backlog of under -- just under $270 million across the commercial aerospace sector. That's up from $250 million in Q3 and $230 million a year ago. 
The story here is one of strength and diversification that is expected to drive higher growth in the quarters and years to come. And we won a number of new applications in 2015, cementing our position as some of the best aircraft in the industry. As a reminder, our largest commercial platform is the 737 and Boeing's plan to increase the 737 max output to approximately 57 shipsets a month by 2019 represents a tremendous growth opportunity for Ducommun. 
So while the near-term impact of the transition for both the 737 and the 777 onto their next-generation models may be a little bumpy, the story will accelerate our top line growth in the coming years. 
Also, for 2016, Boeing is increasing the production of the 787 from 12 aircraft -- or from 10 aircraft a month to 12 aircraft a month, providing a further boost to our expected growth this year. We continue to work on expanding our business with Airbus and are optimistic about additional content on both the A320neo and the A350 aircraft as well as other platforms going forward. We also made substantial headway in winning new content with engine suppliers and OEMs last year, leveraging our proprietary composite technology and our titanium structural applications. 
In total, we have over 30 new development programs in place and we expect that we will begin to positively impact Ducommun's top line later in 2016 and accelerate into 2017, driven by a step-up in several platform build rates. Our wins last year included a 10% growth in aerospace electronics content, positioning us for more complex, value-added assemblies going forward. We also expect Helicopter sales and Regional Business Jet revenue to mirror 2015, bringing some stability to these platforms. So overall, our commercial aerospace outlook is brighter than ever. 
Lastly, in our Industrial Defense business -- in our Industrial business is now smaller than last year, as I previously mentioned, due to the divestitures and other actions. Given our lack of exposure to the energy markets, we anticipate 2016 to be a more stable year in the remaining areas that we serve. And while we try to grow this business as our business development initiatives focus on higher complexity industrial applications, we are very comfortable that the businesses that we serve now in the industrial segment will continue to grow as we go forward. 
Before turning the call over to Doug, let me just comment on some recent management changes here at Ducommun. First, we're glad to have Doug Groves as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Having taken the reins in January 1, Doug's been a great asset already and proving to be a resourceful thinker as we tackle many of the strategic decisions needed to improve the company going forward. I'd also like to thank Joel Benkie for his service to Ducommun. As we previously announced, he has decided to retire at the end of the quarter. Joel's been instrumental in many changes at the company. He deserves credit for redesigning the way we think strategically about operational excellence and capacity utilization. We wish him the best in going forward and I will be personally managing his responsibilities for the time being. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Doug."

Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2015 were approximately $156.6 million, roughly 16% lower than the comparable quarter of 2014. The revenue decline reflected 19% lower revenue in the company's military and space markets, mainly due to a decrease in U.S. defense spending as well as procurement delays in the shipment program priorities that impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms. 
In addition, the overall year-to-year top line shortfall reflected 20% lower revenue in the company's industrial end-use markets. This was mainly due to the closure of the company's Houston manufacturing center during the quarter and 12% lower revenue in the company's commercial aerospace end use markets, primarily reflecting delays in the timing of certain regional jet orders. 
That said, we continue to experience solid commercial aerospace demand to the current build rates and increased content such that during the quarter, we saw significant growth in our commercial aerospace backlog. New orders, both structural and electronic solutions, drove our backlog here to the highest level in our history, just under $270 million as of year end, as Tony mentioned. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross profit margin was 14.6% in the fourth quarter as compared to 17.9% in last year's comparable quarter. This reflected the lower sales and reduced operating leverage even as we continued to realize supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. Given the rightsizing initiatives being implemented at the company, we expect to see gross margin improve as the year plays out and return to historical levels in the 80% to 90% range, particularly as the customer's new platforms gain momentum in later '16. 
Ducommun's operating loss for the current quarter was approximately $88.6 million compared to an operating income of $10.1 million or 5.4% of revenue for the comparable period in 2014. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to an impairment charge of $57.2 million for the entire goodwill within our Structural Systems segment as a result of the company's annual goodwill impairment analysis and an impairment charge of $32.9 million related to the LaBarge tradename as we no longer plan on using it. Both of these charges were noncash in nature. 
The operating loss in the fourth quarter was also impacted by inefficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volume of approximately $5.7 million and the prior year included a nonrecurring $3.4 million reversal of a former loss reserve as a result of the customer settlement that did not recur in '15. The fourth quarter also included a $1.3 million restructure charge related to our facility rationalization initiatives. Excluding impairment charges and the restructuring charges, the current quarter operating income would have been $2.8 million or 2% of revenue than in '15 compared to $7 million in the previous year's fourth quarter, primarily due to a lower outstanding debt balance and reduced interest rate as a result of the company's refinancing in July of 2015.  We estimate interest expense will be approximately $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. 
Our effective income tax benefit during the quarter was $26.6 million or 29.5% compared to a 27.8% income tax benefit for the comparable period last year. Going forward, we expect the effective tax rate for 2016 to average approximately 29%, now that the federal R&D tax credits have been made permanent. We reported a net loss of $63.6 million or a loss of $5.74 per share compared to a net income of $5.2 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decrease to a net loss was primarily due to the impairment charges, then forward loss reversal in 2014, the restructure charge and lower operating leverage due to reduced manufacturing volume, which was partially offset by the income tax benefit as previously mentioned. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2015 was $11 million or 7% of revenue compared to $19.4 million or 10.3% of revenue for the comparable period in 2014. 
Now let's turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $61 million in Q4 of 2015 versus $78.3 million in the prior-year period. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 37% decrease in Military and Space revenue. This reflected a decline in demand for Military Fixed-wing and Helicopter platforms and a 14% decrease in Commercial Aerospace revenue, reflecting delays in the timing of certain regional jet orders. 
While commercial sales were down in the quarter, we ended 2015 with a record backlog of $224 million in this portion of our Structures business, underscoring the strength of the demand and the outlook for 2016. With the stabilization of the Military business in this segment, we expect the current quarter revenue to be a run rate for the next few quarters until our previously announced Commercial Aerospace wins come online in late 2016. 
The Structural Systems unit had an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $56 million compared to operating income of $6.9 million or 8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014, and this was primarily due to the previously mentioned $57.2 million goodwill impairment charge, loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volume of approximately $2.8 million, the previously mentioned nonrecurring forward loss reversal in 2014 of approximately $3.4 million and a $1 million restructuring charge in this segment in the quarter. Excluding the impairment charge and restructuring charge, the operating margin from this segment would have been $2.2 million or 4% of revenue in 2015. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $4.7 million for the current quarter or 7.6% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 13.5% of revenue for the comparable quarter in 2014. 
Moving to our Electronic Systems segment. We posted revenue of $95.6 million in the fourth quarter versus $109.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 20% decrease in Industrial revenue, reflecting the closure of our Houston operations and a 10% decrease in Military and Space revenue mainly due to the decline in demand for Military Fixed-wing and Helicopter platforms. 
For 2016, the divestitures of our Pittsburgh and Miltec operations as well as our Houston facility closure will reduce 2016 full year revenue within the Electronic Systems segment by approximately $80 million. However, it virtually eliminates the company's exposure to the volatile energy market. 
On a pro forma basis, excluding these operations, Electronic Systems would have posted revenue of $313 million in 2015. Electronic Systems had an operating loss for the fourth quarter of $27 million compared to operating income of $8.5 million or 7.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. This reflects the previously mentioned LaBarge tradename impairment charge of $32.9 million, loss of efficiencies resulting from lower manufacturing volume of approximately $2.9 million and a $300,000 restructuring charge related to the site closures. Excluding the impairment charge, the restructure charge, the operating margin from this segment would have been $6.2 million or 6.5% of revenue. 
The adjusted EBITDA was $11.3 million for the current quarter or 11.8% of revenue compared to $13 million or 11.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Corporate general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2015 were $5.6 million or 3.6% of total company revenue versus $5.3 million or 2.8% of revenue in the comparable quarter of 2014. Corporate general and administrative expenses increased slightly due to higher professional service fees of approximately $1 million related to the Pittsburgh and Miltec divestitures, which was offset by lower compensation and benefit costs of approximately $700,000. 
Now turning to our overall backlog at the end of the fourth quarter, which was $546 million versus $553 million at the end of the third quarter as the significant increase in the Commercial Aerospace orders was offset by a decline in the Defense and Industrial bookings. 
Regarding liquidity and capital resources. We generated approximately $23.7 million of cash from operations in 2015, including the use of approximately $15 million to refinance our debt in mid-2015. Excluding the debt refinancing costs, we generated approximately $34 million in cash from operations compared to $53 million in 2014. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. 
Also, during the fourth quarter, we entered into an interest rate cap hedge, totaling approximately $135 million, which decreases our exposure to interest rate increases going forward. We will be using the net proceeds from the divestiture of Miltec and Pittsburgh of approximately $50 million to pay down debt in 2016 and we continue toward our goal of deleveraging to targets of 2.25x to 2.5x of debt to EBITDA over the next few years. We expect to exit the first quarter of 2016 with approximately $200 million in debt. 
Capital expenditures in 2015 were approximately $16 million. Our CapEx spending reflected the consolidation and expansion of our upstate New York operations resulting in a state-of-the-art, advanced titanium product center of excellence. We expect CapEx to be approximately $18 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms that are ramping up later this year. 
In closing, we continue to focus on managing the changing mix of our business and taking decisive actions to streamline operations as evidenced by the 2 divestitures announced this quarter. We believe commercial aerospace demand will fuel higher revenue this year and that our defense-related businesses will more stable going forward versus the sharp declines we experienced in 2015. At the same time, as Tony mentioned, we will look to drive margin expansion, cash flow generation and further reduce debt. Our cost-cutting activities will continue as we remain committed to improving financial results in 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, let me briefly summarize our strategic priorities as we begin 2016. If last year was a year of transition exemplified by lower debt, strengthening our balance sheet and cutting costs and strategic assessment of our operations, then the coming year is one of action and growth. We've already taken decisive steps to shed noncore underperforming assets and will, as I've stated, close an additional facility this quarter. The company is focused on providing unique value-added electronic and structural solutions in the aerospace, defense and other high-technology markets and will continue to benefit from the strong commercial aerospace cycle and increasing build rates going forward. 
We paid down debt, and we will continue to do so based on our solid cash flow projections, leaving us with an even stronger, more flexible balance sheet this year. We'll also strive to reduce working capital, increase asset utilization and expand margins as we review our operations and product portfolios for additional efforts to focus the company and drive increased shareholder value. 
The bottom line is that we did what we said we would do in 2015 and positioned the company for stronger growth and improved bottom line results going forward. With our Commercial Aerospace programs on track for continued expansion and stability across our defense markets, we believe the company is in good shape to take advantage of the numerous opportunities across old and new customers alike. We are a focused unique provider of cutting-edge aerospace technologies with strong client relationships and a reorganized business development team dedicated to executing on a variety of growth initiatives.

And then in the third quarter, we took a small restructure charge of about $800,000 and that was really aligned with closing the Houston operations and St. Louis for which we said we'd see an annual cost savings of $2 million to $3 million on those facility closures and then the restructure charge in the fourth quarter of $1.3 million was largely around the consolidation of the New York facility as well as some continued headcount reductions and we have said that, that would yield a savings of about $3 million to $4 million. So when you aggregate those numbers up, it's about $9 million to $12 million on an annualized basis, recognizing that we're in various stages of implementing each of those things. So Houston just closed at the end of the year. The St. Louis operation doesn't close until the end of this quarter.

267761,331900259,978857,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 first quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which, Doug groves well over our financial results in deta",988,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 first quarter conference call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which, Doug groves well over our financial results in detail. 
First, as our investors know, we made many changes in our company over the past year to improve overall operating performance. We've cut cost, streamlined operations and most recently, shed noncore assets such as our Pittsburgh and Miltec businesses. We did this to focus Ducommun on the core aerospace and defense industry and improve margins and reduce the unpredictability inherent in certain industrial energy markets.  We did sell these operations at an attractive prices over 8x EBITDA, resulting in a gain on sale that Doug will speak to in a moment. Most importantly, the sales generated the proceeds of approximately $50 million, which we used to pay down debt. 
At the end of the quarter, total indebtedness stood at just $190 million, a far cry from where we were a year ago at $280 million. As you know, we are serious about delevering our company to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce interest expense and we've accomplished a great deal in this regard over the past year and half. At the same time, our gross margins have rebounded nicely, testimony to the many initiatives taken to reduce cost and improve the efficiency of our operations. Gross margins reached 19% this quarter versus about 15% last year and in Q4. So while revenue was down year-over-year as expected, primarily due to lower military spending, the actions we've taken have boosted our underlying operations and focused the company for better growth going forward. 
Our backlog at $564 million is the highest it's been in over a year. With the primary driver being increased military backlog, which bodes well for the stabilization of that market, we believe the performance we saw in the first quarter will also lead to improved results as the year plays out. We will continue to focus our streamlining initiatives such as the previously announced changes to reduce our administrative office in Saint Louis, which we concluded early in Q2. In addition, we will be closing a small integrated electronics facility serving the oilfield service industry in Tulsa, Oklahoma within the coming months as we look to further increase operating leverage at our core manufacturing locations and focus our capabilities on the markets we serve. 
Now let me provide some additional colors in our end markets and programs and products. I'll start off with the Commercial Aerospace business, where quarterly revenue once again was very strong at nearly $67 million. We saw a strong shipments across our large aircraft segment, slightly offset by weakness in the commercial helicopters and the regional and business jet markets, none of this was unexpected. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $268 million, near record highs for another sign that we believe further growth in this area is going forward will be strong. 
Ducommun has content on some of the best platforms in the industry, including the Boeing 737 where we'll see an acceleration of revenue due to higher content in production rates as this transitions to the 737 MAX in the coming years. We also have a strong position in the 777 and the 787 as well as content from the Airbus A320neo and the A350. As a matter of fact, we recently announced new contract with Airbus to provide titanium structures for engine support on the A320Neo and with the Airbus also awarded as the first work on the A330neo, an engineering design contract in which we will collaborate and improve the manufacturability, cost and function of certain metal structures applications for Airbus. These are great wins for Ducommun that will expand our support to A320 and A330 families, allowing us to demonstrate our manufacturing design expertise and potentially pave the way for other opportunities with this OEM as we go forward. 
As a reminder, we currently have over 30 new development programs under way across Ducommun, many of which will begin positively impacting topline results later this year and into next year. To support this growth, we will be investing in certain operations during the second half of this year to cover our titanium composite and electronics product lines. Expansion in these 3 areas has been an integral part of our strategy and, as a result, we made the appropriate so the upgrade, equipment and personnel to support the contracts already in place and ensure the capacity for additional new application. We will continue to focus on the strategic imperatives and see many opportunities for future growth. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Revenue fell to $58 million this quarter versus $71 million last year. This was not really a surprise, given what we've said in the past that overall budget curtailment's and reduced spending on certain platforms. However, some of this decrease was related to shipment timing. As we said, at the beginning of the year, we expect the current run rate for our Military business to be in that $60 million to $70 million range for the foreseeable future, so the first quarter was obviously shy of that. However, our defense backlog grew to $261 million this period, the highest level in over a year. This reflects needed electronic upgrades on many platforms we serve and demand in the missile-defense business. So while we're not bullish on this part of the business just yet, the stability I spoke about is clearly there and we anticipate room for growth going forward. We are in a much better shape operationally as evidenced by this quarter for the lower run rates currently in place as we look to take advantage of shifts in the budget spending. 
With that, would like to now turn the call over to Dough to go through the financial detail. Doug?"
267761,331900259,978857,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good day, everybody. Net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were approximately $142.1 million compared to $172.9 million for the comparable quarter of 2015. The revenue decline reflects a 19% lower revenue in the company's military a",1253,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everybody. Net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were approximately $142.1 million compared to $172.9 million for the comparable quarter of 2015. The revenue decline reflects a 19% lower revenue in the company's military and space markets, mainly due to a decrease in U.S. defense spending as well as procurement delays in the shipment program priorities that impacted both our fixed-wing and helicopter programs. In addition, the overall year-over-year top line shortfall reflects in aggregate a 43% decrease in industrial revenue due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation in January of 2016 and the closure of our Houston operations in December of 2015. 
Going forward, as a result of the Houston closure and the divestiture of Pittsburgh and Miltec, Electronic Systems revenue will be reduced by approximately $20 million per quarter. Commercial Aerospace revenue was nearly $67 million during the first quarter. In addition, the company's overall backlog rose to $564 million versus $546 million at the beginning of 2016, the highest level in over a year and is also included a very nice pickup in our military and space orders. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19% in the first quarter compared to approximately 15% last year's comparable quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015. This reflects improved product mix and the various cost initiatives over the past year, including supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. SG&A was down slightly year-over-year as the impact from cost-cutting initiatives reduced headcount in the sale of our Pittsburgh operation were offset by one-time retirement expenses as well as higher professional fees and the timing of certain research and development cost related to new program we announced last year. Such one-time items total roughly $1.8 million in aggregate in the quarter. 
Ducommun's operating profit for the current quarter was approximately $4.3 million or 3% of sales compared to operating income of $3.6 million or 2.1% of sales for the comparable period in 2015. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to the higher gross profit margins achieved in 2016. The interest expense decreased to $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $6.7 million in the previous year's first quarter. This was primarily due to lower outstanding debt, reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July 2015. 
The company also reported a pretax gain on sale of $18.8 million during the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the previously announced divestitures of our Pittsburgh and Miltec operations. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $7.2 million or 35% compared to a 35% income tax benefit for the comparable period last year. The higher rate this quarter was a result of the net gains on the divestitures. This is purely just a timing issue and the tax rate should normalize to approximately 29% for the full year. 
We reported net income of $13.6 million or $1.21 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The increase in net income was primarily due to the pretax gain on the divestitures of Pittsburgh and Miltec of approximately $18.8 million and lower interest expense of approximately $4.3 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2016 was approximately $11.1 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $12.2 million or 7% of revenue for the comparable period in '15. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Structural Systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $64 million in the first quarter of 2016, versus $72.1 million in the prior-year period. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 23% decrease in military and space revenue, reflecting a decline in the U.S. government defense spending as well shifting priorities that impacted certain platform deliveries. Structural Systems operating income for the first quarter was $2.7 million or 4.3% of revenue compared to operating income of 2.1% or 3% of the first quarter of 2015. This primarily reflected our improved operating efficiencies related to the company's ongoing cost improvement initiatives. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 million for the current quarter or 7.5% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 6.5% of revenue for the comparable quarter in 2015. 
Now turning to Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $78.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 versus $100.9 million in the prior-year period. The divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation, closure of our Houston facility, which I previously mentioned, reduced revenue by about 15%. In addition, there was a 17% decrease in military and space revenue mainly due to the decline in defense spending and shifting spending priorities as previously discussed. The impact of these items was partially offset by a 28% increase in the segment's commercial aerospace revenue where we continue to gain traction. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $7.1 million or 9% of revenue compared with operating income of 6.3% or 6.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Again, reflecting operating efficiencies related to the ongoing cost improvement initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million for the current quarter or 39. -- 37.9% of revenue compared to $10.6 million or 10.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Excluding the gains on the divestitures of $18.8 million this year, adjusted EBITDA would've been 13.8% of revenue for the first quarter. 
Looking at corporate, general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2016 were $5.5 million or 3.9% of total company revenue compared to $4.8 million or 2.8% of company revenue for the comparable quarter and the prior year. CG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher R&D expense related to new program awards announced in 2015 and one-time retirement charges of approximately $900,000, partially offset by approximately $700,000 and other cost reduction initiatives. 
Now turning to backlog. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $564 million versus $546 million at the end of the fourth quarter, which reflects significant increase in the military and space bookings. 
Liquidity and capital resources. We generated approximately $5.5 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $3.5 million in 2015. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. We used the net proceeds from divesting of Miltec and Pittsburgh of roughly $50 million to pay down debt, as Tony mentioned. And we continue toward our goal of delevering to targets of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA over the next few years. 
Capital expenditures were approximately $3.8 million in the first quarter and we now expect CapEx to be in the $18 million to $22 million range for the full year as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year. 
In closing, we've taken decisive steps this year and last to rightsize our operations to reflect lower defense spending as well as focus on the core aerospace and defense markets we serve. Our margins illustrate the results of our actions taken thus far, and we believe further performance improvements should be forthcoming as the year progresses. Given our current backlog in demand trends, we anticipate higher growth in the second half, along with a stronger balance sheet, lower debt and streamlined operations, which should feel better returns heading into 2017. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

267761,331900259,979048,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 first quarter conference call.

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations, including some market color, after which Doug Groves will go over our financial results in detail. 
First, as our investors know, we made many changes in our company over the past year to improve overall operating performance. We've cut cost, streamlined operations and most recently, shed noncore assets such as our Pittsburgh and Miltec businesses. We did this to focus Ducommun on the core aerospace and defense industry and improve margins and reduce the unpredictability inherent in certain industrial energy markets. We did sell these operations at an attractive prices over 8x EBITDA, resulting in a gain on the sale that Doug will speak to in a moment. Most importantly, the sales generated net proceeds of approximately $50 million, which we used to pay down debt. 
At the end of the quarter, total indebtedness stood at just $190 million, a far cry from where we were a year ago at $280 million. As you know, we are serious about delevering the company to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce interest expense, and we've accomplished a great deal in this regard over the past year and a half. At the same time, our gross margins have rebounded nicely, testimony to the many initiatives taken to reduce cost and improve the efficiency of our operations. Gross margins reached 19% this quarter versus about 15% last year and in Q4. So while revenue was down year-over-year as expected, primarily due to lower military spending, the actions we've taken have boosted our underlying operations and focused the company for better growth going forward. 
Our backlog at $564 million is the highest it's been in over a year. With the primary driver being increased military backlog, which bodes well for the stabilization of that market, we believe the performance we saw in the first quarter will also lead to improved results as the year plays out. We will continue to focus our streamlining initiatives such as the previously announced changes to reduce our administrative office in St. Louis, which we concluded early in Q2. In addition, we will be closing a small integrated electronics facility serving the oilfield service industry in Tulsa, Oklahoma, within the coming months as we look to further increase operating leverage at our core manufacturing locations and focus our capabilities on the markets we serve. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets and programs and products. I'll start off with the commercial aerospace business, where quarterly revenue once again was very strong at nearly $67 million. We saw strong shipments across our large aircraft segment, slightly offset by weakness in the commercial helicopters and the regional and business jet markets, none of this was unexpected. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $268 million, near record highs for another sign that we believe that further growth in this area is going forward will be strong. 
Ducommun has content on some of the best platforms in the industry, including the Boeing 737 where we'll see an acceleration of revenue due to higher content and production rates as this transitions to the 737 MAX in the coming years. We also have a strong position on the 777 and the 787 as well as content on the Airbus A320neo and the A350. As a matter of fact, we recently announced a new contract with Airbus to provide titanium structures for engine support on the A320Neo and with the Airbus also awarded us the first work on the A330neo, an engineering design contract in which we will collaborate and improve the manufacturability, cost and function of certain metal structures applications for Airbus. These are great wins for Ducommun that will expand our support to the A320 and A330 families, allowing us to demonstrate our manufacturing design expertise and potentially pave the way for other opportunities with this OEM as we go forward. 
As a reminder, we currently have over 30 new development programs under way across Ducommun, many of which will begin positively impacting top line results later this year and into next year. To support this growth, we will be investing in certain operations during the second half of this year to cover our titanium, composite and electronics product lines. Expansion in these 3 areas has been an integral part of our strategy and, as a result, we made the appropriate facility upgrades, equipment and personnel to support the contracts already in place and ensure the capacity for additional new applications. We will continue to focus on these strategic imperatives and see many opportunities for future growth. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Revenue fell to $58 million this quarter versus $71 million last year. This was not really a surprise, given what we've said in the past about overall budget curtailments and reduced spending on certain platforms. However, some of this decrease was related to shipment timing. As we said, at the beginning of the year, we expect the current run rate for our military business to be in that $60 million to $70 million range for the foreseeable future, so the first quarter was obviously shy of that. However, our defense backlog grew to $261 million this period, the highest level in over a year. This reflects needed electronic upgrades on many platforms we serve and demand for the missile defense -- in the missile-defense business. So while we're not bullish on this part of the business just yet, the stability I spoke about is clearly there and we anticipate room for growth going forward. We are in a much better shape operationally as evidenced by this quarter for the lower run rates currently in place as we look to take advantage of shifts in the budget spending. 
With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Doug to go through the financial detail. Doug?"
267761,331900259,979048,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good day, everybody. Net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were approximately $142.1 million compared to $172.9 million for the comparable quarter of 2015. The revenue decline reflects a 19% lower revenue in the company's military a",1263,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everybody. Net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were approximately $142.1 million compared to $172.9 million for the comparable quarter of 2015. The revenue decline reflects a 19% lower revenue in the company's military and space markets, mainly due to a decrease in U.S. defense spending as well as procurement delays in the shift in program priorities that impacted both our fixed-wing and helicopter programs. In addition, the overall year-over-year top line shortfall reflects in aggregate a 43% decrease in industrial revenue due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation in January of 2016 and the closure of our Houston operation in December 2015. 
Going forward, as a result of the Houston closure and the divestiture of the Pittsburgh and Miltec, Electronic Systems revenue will be reduced by approximately $20 million per quarter. Commercial aerospace revenue was nearly $67 million during the first quarter. In addition, the company's overall backlog rose to $564 million versus $546 million at the beginning of 2016, the highest level in over a year and has also included a very nice pickup in our military and space orders. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19% in the first quarter compared to approximately 15% last year's comparable quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015. This reflects improved product mix and the various cost initiatives over the past year, including supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. SG&A was down slightly year-over-year as the impact from cost-cutting initiatives, reduced headcount and the sale of our Pittsburgh operation were offset by onetime retirement expenses as well as higher professional fees and the timing of certain research and development costs related to new program we announced last year. Such onetime items totaled roughly $1.8 million in aggregate in the quarter. 
Ducommun's operating profit for the current quarter was approximately $4.3 million or 3% of sales compared to operating income of $3.6 million or 2.1% of sales for the comparable period in 2015. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to the higher gross profit margins achieved in 2016. The interest expense decreased to $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $6.7 million in the previous year's first quarter. This was primarily due to lower outstanding debt and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July 2015. 
The company also reported a pretax gain on sale of $18.8 million during the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the previously announced divestitures of our Pittsburgh and Miltec operations. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $7.2 million or 35% compared to a 35% income tax benefit for the comparable period last year. The higher rate this quarter was a result of the net gains on the divestitures. This is purely just a timing issue and the tax rate should normalize to approximately 29% for the full year. 
We reported net income of $13.6 million or $1.21 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The increase in net income was primarily due to the pretax gain on the divestitures of Pittsburgh and Miltec of approximately $18.8 million and lower interest expense of approximately $4.3 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2016 was approximately $11.1 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $12.2 million or 7% of revenue for the comparable period in '15. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Structural Systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $64 million in the first quarter of 2016, versus $72.1 million in the prior year period. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 23% decrease in military and space revenue, reflecting a decline in the U.S. government defense spending as well as shifting priorities that impacted certain platform deliveries. Structural Systems operating income for the first quarter was $2.7 million or 4.3% of revenue compared to operating income of 2.1% or 3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. This primarily reflected our improved operating efficiencies related to the company's ongoing cost-improvement initiatives. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 million for the current quarter or 7.5% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 6.5% of revenue for the comparable quarter in 2015. 
Now turning to Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $78.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 versus $100.9 million in the prior year period. The divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation, closure of our Houston facility, which I previously mentioned, reduced revenue by about 15%. In addition, there was a 17% decrease in military and space revenue mainly due to the decline in defense spending and shift in spending priorities as previously discussed. The impact of these items was partially offset by a 28% increase in the segment's commercial aerospace revenue where we continued to gain traction. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $7.1 million or 9% of revenue compared with operating income of 6.3% or 6.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Again, reflecting operating efficiencies related to the ongoing cost improvement initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million for the current quarter or 39 point -- excuse me, 37.9% of revenue compared to $10.6 million or 10.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Excluding the gains on the divestitures of $18.8 million this year, adjusted EBITDA would've been 13.8% of revenue for the first quarter. 
Looking at corporate, general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2016 were $5.5 million or 3.9% of total company revenue compared to $4.8 million or 2.8% of company revenue for the comparable quarter and the prior year. CG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher R&D expenses related to new program awards announced in 2015 and onetime retirement charges of approximately $900,000, partially offset by approximately $700,000 and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
Now turning to backlog. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $564 million versus $546 million at the end of the fourth quarter, which reflects a significant increase in the military and space bookings. 
Liquidity and capital resources. We generated approximately $5.5 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $3.5 million in 2015. We remained diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. We used the net proceeds from divesting of Miltec and Pittsburgh of roughly $50 million to pay down debt, as Tony mentioned. And we continued toward our goal of delevering to targets of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA over the next few years. 
Capital expenditures were approximately $3.8 million in the first quarter, and we now expect CapEx to be in the $18 million to $22 million range for the full year as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year. 
In closing, we've taken decisive steps this year and last to rightsize our operations to reflect lower defense spending as well as focus on the core aerospace and defense markets we serve. Our margins illustrate the results of our actions taken thus far, and we believe further performance improvements should be forthcoming as the year progresses. Given our current backlog in demand trends, we anticipate higher growth in the second half, along with a stronger balance sheet, lower debt and streamlined operations, which should feel better returns heading into 2017. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

267761,331900259,979087,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 first quarter conference call.

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations, including some market color, after which Doug Groves will go over our financial results in detail. 
First, as our investors know, we made many changes in our company over the past year to improve overall operating performance. We've cut cost, streamlined operations and most recently, shed noncore assets such as our Pittsburgh and Miltec businesses. We did this to focus Ducommun on the core aerospace and defense industry and improve margins and reduce the unpredictability inherent in certain industrial energy markets. We did sell these operations at an attractive prices over 8x EBITDA, resulting in a gain on the sale that Doug will speak to in a moment. Most importantly, the sales generated net proceeds of approximately $50 million, which we used to pay down debt. 
At the end of the quarter, total indebtedness stood at just $190 million, a far cry from where we were a year ago at $280 million. As you know, we are serious about delevering the company to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce interest expense, and we've accomplished a great deal in this regard over the past year and a half. At the same time, our gross margins have rebounded nicely, testimony to the many initiatives taken to reduce cost and improve the efficiency of our operations. Gross margins reached 19% this quarter versus about 15% last year and in Q4. So while revenue was down year-over-year as expected, primarily due to lower military spending, the actions we've taken have boosted our underlying operations and focused the company for better growth going forward. 
Our backlog at $564 million is the highest it's been in over a year. With the primary driver being increased military backlog, which bodes well for the stabilization of that market, we believe the performance we saw in the first quarter will also lead to improved results as the year plays out. We will continue to focus our streamlining initiatives such as the previously announced changes to reduce our administrative office in St. Louis, which we concluded early in Q2. In addition, we will be closing a small integrated electronics facility serving the oilfield service industry in Tulsa, Oklahoma, within the coming months as we look to further increase operating leverage at our core manufacturing locations and focus our capabilities on the markets we serve. 
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets and programs and products. I'll start off with the commercial aerospace business, where quarterly revenue once again was very strong at nearly $67 million. We saw strong shipments across our large aircraft segment, slightly offset by weakness in the commercial helicopters and the regional and business jet markets, none of this was unexpected. We ended the quarter with a backlog of $268 million, near record highs for another sign that we believe that further growth in this area is going forward will be strong. 
Ducommun has content on some of the best platforms in the industry, including the Boeing 737 where we'll see an acceleration of revenue due to higher content and production rates as this transitions to the 737 MAX in the coming years. We also have a strong position on the 777 and the 787 as well as content on the Airbus A320neo and the A350. As a matter of fact, we recently announced a new contract with Airbus to provide titanium structures for engine support on the A320Neo and with the Airbus also awarded us the first work on the A330neo, an engineering design contract in which we will collaborate and improve the manufacturability, cost and function of certain metal structures applications for Airbus. These are great wins for Ducommun that will expand our support to the A320 and A330 families, allowing us to demonstrate our manufacturing design expertise and potentially pave the way for other opportunities with this OEM as we go forward. 
As a reminder, we currently have over 30 new development programs under way across Ducommun, many of which will begin positively impacting top line results later this year and into next year. To support this growth, we will be investing in certain operations during the second half of this year to cover our titanium, composite and electronics product lines. Expansion in these 3 areas has been an integral part of our strategy and, as a result, we need the appropriate facility upgrades, equipment and personnel to support the contracts already in place and ensure the capacity for additional new applications. We will continue to focus on these strategic imperatives and see many opportunities for future growth. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Revenue fell to $58 million this quarter versus $71 million last year. This was not really a surprise, given what we've said in the past about overall budget curtailments and reduced spending on certain platforms. However, some of this decrease was related to shipment timing. As we said, at the beginning of the year, we expect the current run rate for our military business to be in that $60 million to $70 million range for the foreseeable future, so the first quarter was obviously shy of that. However, our defense backlog grew to $261 million this period, the highest level in over a year. This reflects needed electronic upgrades on many platforms we serve and demand for the missile defense -- in the missile-defense business. So while we're not bullish on this part of the business just yet, the stability I spoke about is clearly there and we anticipate room for growth going forward. We are in a much better shape operationally as evidenced by this quarter for the lower run rates currently in place as we look to take advantage of shifts in the budget spending. 
With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Doug to go through the financial detail. Doug?"
267761,331900259,979087,"Ducommun Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good day, everybody. Net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were approximately $142.1 million compared to $172.9 million for the comparable quarter of 2015. The revenue decline reflects a 19% lower revenue in the company's military a",1263,"Thank you, Tony, and good day, everybody. Net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were approximately $142.1 million compared to $172.9 million for the comparable quarter of 2015. The revenue decline reflects a 19% lower revenue in the company's military and space markets, mainly due to a decrease in U.S. defense spending as well as procurement delays in the shift in program priorities that impacted both our fixed-wing and helicopter programs. In addition, the overall year-over-year top line shortfall reflects in aggregate a 43% decrease in industrial revenue due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation in January of 2016 and the closure of our Houston operation in December 2015. 
Going forward, as a result of the Houston closure and the divestiture of the Pittsburgh and Miltec, Electronic Systems revenue will be reduced by approximately $20 million per quarter. Commercial aerospace revenue was nearly $67 million during the first quarter. In addition, the company's overall backlog rose to $564 million versus $546 million at the beginning of 2016, the highest level in over a year and has also included a very nice pickup in our military and space orders. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19% in the first quarter compared to approximately 15% last year's comparable quarter and the fourth quarter of 2015. This reflects improved product mix and the various cost initiatives over the past year, including supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. SG&A was down slightly year-over-year as the impact from cost-cutting initiatives, reduced headcount and the sale of our Pittsburgh operation were offset by onetime retirement expenses as well as higher professional fees and the timing of certain research and development costs related to new program wins announced last year. Such onetime items totaled roughly $1.8 million in aggregate in the quarter. 
Ducommun's operating profit for the current quarter was approximately $4.3 million or 3% of sales compared to operating income of $3.6 million or 2.1% of sales for the comparable period in 2015. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to the higher gross profit margins achieved in 2016. The interest expense decreased to $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $6.7 million in the previous year's first quarter. This was primarily due to lower outstanding debt and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July 2015. 
The company also reported a pretax gain on sale of $18.8 million during the first quarter of 2016 in connection with the previously announced divestitures of our Pittsburgh and Miltec operations. Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $7.2 million or 35% compared to a 35% income tax benefit for the comparable period last year. The higher rate this quarter was a result of the net gains on the divestitures. This is purely just a timing issue and the tax rate should normalize to approximately 29% for the full year. 
We reported net income of $13.6 million or $1.21 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $2 million or $0.18 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The increase in net income was primarily due to the pretax gain on the divestitures of Pittsburgh and Miltec of approximately $18.8 million and lower interest expense of approximately $4.3 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2016 was approximately $11.1 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $12.2 million or 7% of revenue for the comparable period in '15. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Structural Systems. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $64 million in the first quarter of 2016, versus $72.1 million in the prior year period. The lower revenue was primarily due to a 23% decrease in military and space revenue, reflecting a decline in the U.S. government defense spending as well as shifting priorities that impacted certain platform deliveries. Structural Systems operating income for the first quarter was $2.7 million or 4.3% of revenue compared to operating income of 2.1% or 3% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. This primarily reflected our improved operating efficiencies related to the company's ongoing cost-improvement initiatives. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 million for the current quarter or 7.5% of revenue compared to $4.7 million or 6.5% of revenue for the comparable quarter in 2015. 
Now turning to Electronic Systems. Our Electronic Systems segment posted revenue of $78.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 versus $100.9 million in the prior year period. The divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation, closure of our Houston facility, which I previously mentioned, reduced revenue by about 15%. In addition, there was a 17% decrease in military and space revenue mainly due to the decline in defense spending and shift in spending priorities as previously discussed. The impact of these items was partially offset by a 28% increase in the segment's commercial aerospace revenue where we continued to gain traction. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the first quarter of $7.1 million or 9% of revenue compared with operating income of 6.3% or 6.2% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Again, reflecting operating efficiencies related to the ongoing cost improvement initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA was $29.6 million for the current quarter or 39 point -- excuse me, 37.9% of revenue compared to $10.6 million or 10.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2015. Excluding the gains on the divestitures of $18.8 million this year, adjusted EBITDA would've been 13.8% of revenue for the first quarter. 
Looking at corporate, general and administrative expenses, CG&A. CG&A expenses for the first quarter of 2016 were $5.5 million or 3.9% of total company revenue compared to $4.8 million or 2.8% of company revenue for the comparable quarter and the prior year. CG&A expenses increased primarily due to higher R&D expenses related to new program awards announced in 2015 and onetime retirement charges of approximately $900,000, partially offset by approximately $700,000 and other cost-reduction initiatives. 
Now turning to backlog. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $564 million versus $546 million at the end of the fourth quarter, which reflects a significant increase in the military and space bookings. 
Liquidity and capital resources. We generated approximately $5.5 million of cash from operations in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $3.5 million in 2015. We remained diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. We used the net proceeds from divesting of Miltec and Pittsburgh of roughly $50 million to pay down debt, as Tony mentioned. And we continued toward our goal of delevering to targets of 2.25x to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA over the next few years. 
Capital expenditures were approximately $3.8 million in the first quarter, and we now expect CapEx to be in the $18 million to $22 million range for the full year as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year. 
In closing, we've taken decisive steps this year and last to rightsize our operations to reflect lower defense spending as well as focus on the core aerospace and defense markets we serve. Our margins illustrate the results of our actions taken thus far, and we believe further performance improvements should be forthcoming as the year progresses. Given our current backlog in demand trends, we anticipate higher growth in the second half, along with a stronger balance sheet, lower debt and streamlined operations, which should feel better returns heading into 2017. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

We're winning new business on some of the most well-known marquee platforms in the industry and so our backlog grow on the rebound across our military programs. 
Ducommun remains in unique position. We believe to provide advanced electronics and structural solutions in the aerospace, defense and high-technology markets. In addition, current macroeconomic's trends and commercial aerospace demand as well as platform transitions will benefit the company in the quarters and years to come. We continue to invest in innovative applications, aggressively manage our working capital and drive operating cash flow to strengthen the company. So we will position ourselves for faster growth and reduce our debt going forward. 
With that, Katherine, I would like to now turn the call over to questions, please."

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves, our Chief Financial Officer, to go through our financial results in detail. 
We are very happy to report that our second quarter showed benefits of many constructive changes that we've made in this past year from aggressively cutting costs and implementing supply chain initiatives to closing facilities, refinancing our debt and divesting non-core operations. Even in the face of the softness and certain elements of our military markets, we achieved 19.6% [ph] gross margin and posted earnings of $0.34 per diluted share. And we believe our strong performance will continue in the second half of 2016, and I will review that in a minute. 
Our balance sheet is strong, along with our backlog, and we're on track to further delever the company's balance sheet this year. The bottom line is that our overall financial performance continues to improve as does our growth profile, and we believe the company remains well-positioned for new business opportunities going forward. 
Now let me go through the addition of the -- give you some additional market color on certain end markets and programs and products. I'll start off with our commercial aerospace business. 
Our quarterly revenue once again was very solid at $66 million, near all-time record levels and slightly above our 2015 second quarter. Sales rose year-over-year on several large aircraft platforms, including with Airbus. This was partially offset by a decline in our helicopter business as well as lower regional and business jet sales. 
We also saw some timing delays in shipments for the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, but we expect these to be made up during the second half of 2016. 
It's worth noting that our Airbus content, which is still relatively small part of our business, now accounts for roughly 15% [ph] of our total commercial aerospace sales versus virtually nothing just 5 years ago. So we're quite pleased with our performance in this regard and expect to see additional awards and increased content in the quarters to come. 
In total, our commercial aerospace backlog stood at $239 million at the end of the second quarter, down from earlier this year due to seasonal adjustments and program order timing. 
Last year's second quarter backlog was also the lowest in 2015 at just $194 million. Given such timing issues, we expect the bookings in commercial aerospace to rise during the second half of 2016 because of our strong positions on the 737, 787 and 777 programs, along with our content on the Airbus A320, A350 and A330 platforms. 
We're also on track with regard to our facility investments to support the higher demand for our titanium composites and electronics product lines, and we're targeting new content where we are targeting new content and accelerated growth. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Revenue fell to $51 million this quarter from $77 million last year, which again reflects the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, along with a slowdown in military helicopter sales, due to timing issues and schedule adjustments. 
In addition, roughly $5 million of our year-over-year variance was tied to our new divestiture of Miltec, which we completed earlier in 2016 [ph]. 
So our results were definitely not a surprise. We anticipate higher military helicopter sales during the second half of 2016. We also expect stronger shipments of our radar racks during the remainder of the year on platform such as the F-15 and the F-18 aircraft. 
In fact, our overall defense technology of backlog grew to $209 million this quarter, the highest level in over 2 years, due to increased participation on missile platform and solid radar rack orders. 
Our total military and defense backlog now stands at a respectable $268 million. So even within the current environment, the timing remains well positioned for our electronics upgrades, cutting-edge missile platforms and new structural applications on some of the most popular platforms in the marketplace.
With that, I'd like to now turn over to Doug to review our financial results."

Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $134.4 million compared to $174.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year reflects $17.1 million and lower sales within the company's industrial end use markets and $25.8 million in lower sales within our military and space markets. The industrial decline was primarily due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation in January of this year and the closure of our Houston operation in December of 2015, both of which serving in non-aerospace markets. 
The military decline of nearly $26 [ph] million year-over-year reflects the Miltec divestiture and the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and pushed out some scheduled deliveries. 
Commercial aerospace revenue was roughly $66 [ph] million during the second quarter, up slightly year-over-year and near the record levels. The company's overall backlog rose from $537 million versus $524 million at this time last year. 
Orders had a nice uptick in orders for defense technologies, but the backlog rose to nearly $209 million. It's the highest level in over 2 years, as Tony mentioned. However, we saw a decline in our commercial aerospace backlog sequentially versus Q1, which was primarily related to just timing issues. 
Moving on to gross profit. Our gross margin 19.6% in the second quarter as compared to 17.8% last year's comparable quarter. This once again reflects improved product mix, the various cost initiatives we've undertaken over the past year, including supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. 
SG&A fell slightly year-over-year to $18.9 million from $20.4 million in 2015. This reflects our divestitures and cost cutting initiatives somewhat offset by some increased personnel costs and the timing of certain R&D costs related to new program wins. 
Operating income for the second quarter of 2016 was $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue compared to $10.8 million or 6.2% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the lower revenues.
Interest expense decreased to $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $6.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July 2015. 
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $1.5 million or 28% compared to $1.3 million or 42% for the comparable period last year. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the U.S. and federal research and development tax credit that was permanently extended on the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Going forward, the tax rates for the full year is still expected to be approximately 29%. 
We reported net income of $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share last year. The increase was primarily due the lower interest expense of approximately $4.5 million and the improved operating performance. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue compared to $19.7 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in '15. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our structural systems segment posted revenue of $60.7 [ph] million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $76.1 million in the prior year period. The period -- the decline was primarily due to $10.8 million in lower military and space sales, reflecting the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and pushed out some scheduled deliveries. 
Overall, the structure system revenue also was expected by $4.6 million decrease in commercial aerospace sales, and this relate to the timing of certain large airframe shipments and the wind down of a regional jet program this year -- excuse me, last year. 
Structural systems operating income for the second quarter was $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $6.9 million or 9% of revenue last year. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due the lower sales [indiscernible]. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 million for the current quarter or 10.7% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 13.8% of revenue last year. 
Now turning to the electronic segment. We posted revenue of $72.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $98.8 million in the prior period. 
Revenue from our industrial markets was down $17.1 million, mainly due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation and closure of our Houston facility. 
In addition, there was a $15 [ph] million decrease in military and space revenue, mainly due to our Miltec divestiture, along with the budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted both the fixed and helicopter platforms, as previously discussed. The impact of these items was partially offset by a $6.1 million increase in the segments commercial aerospace revenue where we continue to gain traction.
Electronic systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue compared to $7.7 million or 7.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2015 with a decrease in operating income again due to lower revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million for the quarter or 14.4% of revenue compared to 12.1% or 12.2% of revenue for the comparable quarter last year. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of '16 were $4.2 million or 3.2% of total revenue compared to $3.7 million or 2.1% of total revenue last year. 
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $6.6 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $14.1 million in 2015. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. 
We used -- we previously have used net proceeds from divesting the Miltec and Pittsburgh of approximately $55 [ph] million to pay down debt and continued towards our goal of delevering to targets of 2.25  to 2.5x debt to EBITDA over the next few [ph] years. While debt did not decrease this quarter, we expect to pay down another $10 million to $20 million of debt by fiscal year end. 
CapEx for this quarter was $3.8 million and we continue to expect CapEx to be approximately $18 million to $22 million for the full year as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year.
In closing, we're very pleased to see the fruits of our efforts in terms of higher performance and bottom line results from the cost-cutting measures taken over the past year, along with initiatives to exit non-core businesses, focus our growth strategy going forward. We expect higher levels of revenue in the second half along with that even better returns.
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, I wanted to once again say that we are pleased to see the ongoing transformation of our business and bottom line results, even with some changes in our end market requirements. 
The commercial aerospace industry remains strong. However, there is a degree of weakness that remains within the regional and business jet markets as well as in with the commercial helicopter market. 
But we are well positioned on some very solid platforms, including the 737 MAX and the A320neo. We have rightsized the company to better manage the varying production levels, and we are investing for growth in the next-generation titanium and composite technologies.

We continue to believe that the worst is behind us there. In addition, we've bolstered facilities and sold others having transformed the remaining organization into a leaner, more nimble and more results-driven enterprise. So the management team is upbeat about Ducommun and what our future holds. We've reduced the company's debt, strengthen our balance sheet, cut costs and focus our attention on the core markets where our technologies and capabilities have the highest impact.
Our continued focus will be on the growth of our business and on increasing our shareholder value. 
With that, Glenda, I'd like to turn the call open -- I'd like to open up the call for questions, please."

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves, our Chief Financial Officer, to go through our financial results in detail. 
We are very happy to report that our second quarter showed benefits of many constructive changes that we've made in this past year from aggressively cutting costs and implementing supply chain initiatives to closing facilities, refinancing our debt and divesting noncore operations. Even in the face of the softness of -- and certain elements of our military markets, we achieved 19.6% gross margins and posted earnings of $0.34 per diluted share. And we believe our strong performance will continue in the second half of 2016, and I will review that in a minute. 
Our balance sheet is strong along with our backlog, and we're on track to further delever the company's balance sheet this year. The bottom line is that our overall financial performance continues to improve as does our growth profile, and we believe the company remains well positioned for new business opportunities going forward. 
Now let me go through the addition of the -- give you some additional market color on certain end markets and programs and products. I'll start off with our commercial aerospace business, where quarterly revenue once again was very solid at $66 million, near all-time record levels and slightly above our 2015 first -- second quarter. Sales rose year-over-year on several large aircraft platforms, including with Airbus. This was partially offset by a decline in our helicopter business as well as lower regional and business jet sales. 
We also saw some timing delays in shipments for the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, but we expect these to be made up during the second half of 2016. 
It's worth noting that our Airbus content, which is still relatively small part of our business, now accounts for roughly 15% of our total commercial aerospace sales versus virtually nothing just 5 years ago. So we're quite pleased with our performance in this regard and expect to see additional awards and increased content in the quarters to come. 
In total, our commercial aerospace backlog stood at $239 million at the end of the second quarter, down from earlier this year due to seasonal adjustments and program order timing. 
Last year's second quarter backlog was also the lowest in 2015 at just $194 million. Given such timing issues, we expect the bookings in commercial aerospace to rise during the second half of 2016 because of our strong positions on the 737, 787 and 777 programs, along with our content on the Airbus A320, A350 and A330 platforms. 
We're also on track with regard to our facility investments to support the higher demand for our titanium, composites and electronics product lines, and we're targeting new content -- where we are in targeting new content and accelerated growth. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Revenue fell to $51 million this quarter from $77 million last year, which again reflects the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year along with a slowdown in military helicopter sales due to timing issues and schedule adjustments. 
In addition, roughly $5 million of our year-over-year variance was tied to our divestiture of Miltec, which we completed earlier in 2016. 
So our results were definitely not a surprise. We anticipate higher military helicopter sales during the second half of 2016. We also expect stronger shipments of our radar racks during the remainder of the year on platform such as the F-15 and the F-18 aircraft. In fact, our overall defense technology of backlog grew to nearly $209 million this quarter, the highest level in over 2 years due to increased participation on missile platforms and solid radar rack orders. 
Our total military and defense backlog now stands at a respectable $268 million. So even within the current environment, the timing remains well positioned for our electronics upgrades, cutting-edge missile platforms and new structural applications on some of the most popular platforms in the marketplace.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Doug for -- to review our financial results."

Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $134.4 million compared to $174.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year reflects $17.1 million in lower sales withi",1152,"Thank you, Tony, and good day to everybody. Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $134.4 million compared to $174.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year reflects $17.1 million in lower sales within the company's industrial end-use markets and $25.8 million in lower sales within our military and space markets. The industrial decline was primarily due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation in January of this year and the closure of our Houston operation in December of 2015, both of which serving in non-aerospace markets. 
The military decline of nearly $26 million year-over-year reflects the Miltec divestiture and the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and pushed out some scheduled deliveries. 
Commercial aerospace revenue was roughly $66 million during the second quarter, up slightly year-over-year and near the record levels. The company's overall backlog rose to $537 million versus $524 million at this time last year. 
Of course [ph], our nice uptick in orders for defense technologies, but the backlog rose to nearly $209 million. It's the highest level in over 2 years, as Tony mentioned. However, we saw a decline in our commercial aerospace backlog sequentially versus Q1, which was primarily related to just timing issues. 
Moving on to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.6% in the second quarter as compared to 17.8% in last year's comparable quarter. This, once again, reflects improved product mix, the various cost initiatives we've undertaken over the past year, including supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. 
SG&A fell slightly year-over-year to $18.9 million from $20.4 million in 2015. This reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives, somewhat offset by some increased personnel costs and the timing of certain R&D costs related to new program wins. 
Operating income for the second quarter of 2016 was $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue compared to $10.8 million or 6.2% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the lower revenues.
Interest expense decreased to $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $6.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July 2015. 
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $1.5 million or 28% compared to $1.3 million or 42% for the comparable period last year. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the U.S. and federal research and development tax credit that was permanently extended in the fourth quarter of 2015. Going forward, the tax rates for the full year is still expected to be approximately 29%. 
We reported net income of $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share last year. The increase was primarily due to the lower interest expense of approximately $4.5 million and the improved operating performance. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue compared to $19.7 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in '15. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $76.1 million in the prior year period. The period -- the decline was primarily due to $10.8 million in lower military and space sales, reflecting the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and pushed out some scheduled deliveries. Overall, the structure system revenue also was impacted by $4.6 million decrease in commercial aerospace sales, and this just relate to the timing of certain large airframe shipments and the wind down of a regional jet program this year -- excuse me, last year. 
Structural Systems operating income for the second quarter was $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $6.9 million or 9% of revenue last year. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to the lower sales growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 million for the current quarter or 10.7% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 13.8% of revenue last year. 
Now turning to the Electronic segment. We posted revenue of $72.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $98.8 million in the prior period. 
Revenue from our industrial markets was down $17.1 million, mainly due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation and closure of our Houston facility. 
In addition, there was a $15 million decrease in military and space revenue, mainly due to our Miltec divestiture along with the budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted both the fixed and helicopter platforms, as previously discussed. The impact of these items was partially offset by a $6.1 million increase in the segments commercial aerospace revenue where we continue to gain traction.
Electronic systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue compared to $7.7 million or 7.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2015 with a decrease in operating income, again, due to lower revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million for the quarter or 14.4% of revenue compared to 12.1% or 12.2% of revenue for the comparable quarter last year. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of '16 were $4.2 million or 3.2% of total revenue compared to $3.7 million or 2.1% of total revenue last year. 
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $6.6 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $14.1 million in 2015. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. 
We used -- we previously have used net proceeds from divesting the Miltec and Pittsburgh of approximately $55 million to pay down debt and continued towards our goal of delevering to targets of 2.25  to 2.5x debt to EBITDA over the next few years. While debt did not decrease this quarter, we expect to pay down another $10 million to $20 million of debt by fiscal year-end. 
CapEx for this quarter was $3.8 million, and we continue to expect CapEx to be approximately $18 million to $22 million for the full year as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year.
In closing, we're very pleased to see the fruits of our efforts in terms of higher performance and bottom line results from the cost-cutting measures taken over the past year, along with initiatives to exit noncore businesses, focus our growth strategy going forward. We expect higher levels of revenue in the second half, along with it, even better returns.
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, I wanted to, once again, say that we are pleased to see the ongoing transformation of our business and bottom line results, even with some changes in our end-market requirements. 
The commercial aerospace industry remains strong. However, there is a degree of weakness that remains within the regional and business jet markets as well as in with the commercial helicopter market. But we are well positioned on some very solid platforms, including the 737 MAX and the A320neo. We have rightsized the company to better manage the varying production levels, and we are investing for growth in the next-generation titanium and composite technologies. At the same time, we are seeing some stabilization in the defense market where our backlogs have risen. 
We continue to believe that the worst is behind us there. In addition, we've bolstered facilities and sold others having transformed the remaining organization into a leaner, more nimble and more results-driven enterprise. So the management team is upbeat about Ducommun and what our future holds. We've reduced the company's debt, strengthen our balance sheet, cut cost and focus our attention on the core markets where our technologies and capabilities have the highest impact. Our continued focus will be on the growth of our business and on increasing our shareholder value. 
With that, Glenda, I'd like to turn the call open -- or I'd like to open up the call for questions, please."

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves, our Chief Financial Officer, to go through our financial results in detail. 
We are very happy to report that our second quarter showed benefits of many constructive changes that we've made in this past year from aggressively cutting costs and implementing supply chain initiatives to closing facilities, refinancing our debt and divesting noncore operations. Even in the face of the softness of -- and certain elements of our military markets, we achieved 19.6% gross margins and posted earnings of $0.34 per diluted share. And we believe our strong performance will continue in the second half of 2016, and I will review that in a minute. 
Our balance sheet is strong along with our backlog, and we're on track to further delever the company's balance sheet this year. The bottom line is that our overall financial performance continues to improve as does our growth profile, and we believe the company remains well positioned for new business opportunities going forward. 
Now let me go through the addition of the -- give you some additional market color on certain end markets and programs and products. I'll start off with our commercial aerospace business, where quarterly revenue once again was very solid at $66 million, near all-time record levels and slightly above our 2015 first -- second quarter. Sales rose year-over-year on several large aircraft platforms, including with Airbus. This was partially offset by a decline in our helicopter business as well as lower regional and business jet sales. 
We also saw some timing delays in shipments for the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, but we expect these to be made up during the second half of 2016. 
It's worth noting that our Airbus content, which is still relatively a small part of our business, now accounts for roughly 15% of our total commercial aerospace sales versus virtually nothing just 5 years ago. So we're quite pleased with our performance in this regard and expect to see additional awards and increased content in the quarters to come. 
In total, our commercial aerospace backlog stood at $239 million at the end of the second quarter, down from earlier this year due to seasonal adjustments and program order timing. 
Last year's second quarter backlog was also the lowest in 2015 at just $194 million. Given such timing issues, we expect the bookings in commercial aerospace to rise during the second half of 2016 because of our strong positions on the 737, 787 and 777 programs, along with our content on the Airbus A320, A350 and A330 platforms. 
We're also on track with regard to our facility investments to support the higher demand for our titanium, composites and electronics product lines, and we're targeting new content -- where we are in targeting new content and accelerated growth. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Revenue fell to $51 million this quarter from $77 million last year, which again reflects the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year along with a slowdown in military helicopter sales due to timing issues and schedule adjustments. 
In addition, roughly $5 million of our year-over-year variance was tied to our divestiture of Miltec, which we completed earlier in 2016. 
So our results were definitely not a surprise. We anticipate higher military helicopter sales during the second half of 2016. We also expect stronger shipments of our radar racks during the remainder of the year on platform such as the F-15 and the F-18 aircraft. In fact, our overall defense technology of backlog grew to nearly $209 million this quarter, the highest level in over 2 years due to increased participation on missile platforms and solid radar rack orders. 
Our total military and defense backlog now stands at a respectable $268 million. So even within the current environment, the timing remains well positioned for our electronics upgrades, cutting-edge missile platforms and new structural applications on some of the most popular platforms in the marketplace.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Doug for -- to review our financial results."

Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $134.4 million compared to $174.8 million for the second quarter of 2015.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $134.4 million compared to $174.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year reflects $17.1 million in lower sales within the company's industrial end-use markets and $25.8 million in lower sales within our military and space markets. The industrial decline was primarily due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation in January of this year and the closure of our Houston operation in December of 2015, both of which serving in non-aerospace markets. 
The military decline of nearly $26 million year-over-year reflects the Miltec divestiture and the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and pushed out some scheduled deliveries. 
Commercial aerospace revenue was roughly $66 million during the second quarter, up slightly year-over-year and near the record levels. The company's overall backlog rose to $537 million versus $524 million at this time last year. 
Our core saw a nice uptick in orders for defense technologies, but the backlog rose to nearly $209 million. It's the highest level in over 2 years, as Tony mentioned. However, we saw a decline in our commercial aerospace backlog sequentially versus Q1, which was primarily related to just timing issues. 
Moving on to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.6% in the second quarter as compared to 17.8% in last year's comparable quarter. This, once again, reflects improved product mix, the various cost initiatives we've undertaken over the past year, including supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. 
SG&A fell slightly year-over-year to $18.9 million from $20.4 million in 2015. This reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives, somewhat offset by some increased personnel costs and the timing of certain R&D costs related to new program wins. 
Operating income for the second quarter of 2016 was $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue compared to $10.8 million or 6.2% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the lower revenues.
Interest expense decreased to $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $6.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July 2015. 
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $1.5 million or 28% compared to $1.3 million or 42% for the comparable period last year. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the U.S. and federal research and development tax credit that was permanently extended in the fourth quarter of 2015. Going forward, the tax rates for the full year is still expected to be approximately 29%. 
We reported net income of $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share last year. The increase was primarily due to the lower interest expense of approximately $4.5 million and the improved operating performance. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue compared to $19.7 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in '15. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $76.1 million in the prior year period. The period -- the decline was primarily due to $10.8 million in lower military and space sales, reflecting the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and pushed out some scheduled deliveries. Overall, the structure system revenue also was impacted by a $4.6 million decrease in commercial aerospace sales, and this just relate to the timing of certain large airframe shipments and the wind down of a regional jet program this year -- excuse me, last year. 
Structural Systems operating income for the second quarter was $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $6.9 million or 9% of revenue last year. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to the lower sales growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 million for the current quarter or 10.7% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 13.8% of revenue last year. 
Now turning to the Electronic segment. We posted revenue of $72.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $98.8 million in the prior period. 
Revenue from our industrial markets was down $17.1 million, mainly due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation and closure of our Houston facility. 
In addition, there was a $15 million decrease in military and space revenue, mainly due to our Miltec divestiture along with the budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted both the fixed and helicopter platforms, as previously discussed. The impact of these items was partially offset by a $6.1 million increase in the segments commercial aerospace revenue where we continue to gain traction.
Electronic systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue compared to $7.7 million or 7.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2015 with a decrease in operating income, again, due to lower revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million for the quarter or 14.4% of revenue compared to 12.1% or 12.2% of revenue for the comparable quarter last year. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of '16 were $4.2 million or 3.2% of total revenue compared to $3.7 million or 2.1% of total revenue last year. 
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $6.6 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $14.1 million in 2015. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. 
We used -- we previously have used net proceeds from divesting the Miltec and Pittsburgh of approximately $55 million to pay down debt and continued towards our goal of delevering to targets of 2.25  to 2.5x debt to EBITDA over the next few years. While debt did not decrease this quarter, we expect to pay down another $10 million to $20 million of debt by fiscal year-end. 
CapEx for this quarter was $3.8 million, and we continue to expect CapEx to be approximately $18 million to $22 million for the full year as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year.
In closing, we're very pleased to see the fruits of our efforts in terms of higher performance and bottom line results from the cost-cutting measures taken over the past year, along with initiatives to exit noncore businesses, focus our growth strategy going forward. We expect higher levels of revenue in the second half, along with it, even better returns.
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

Before turning the call over to questions, I wanted to, once again, say that we are pleased to see the ongoing transformation of our business and bottom line results, even with some changes in our end-market requirements. 
The commercial aerospace industry remains strong. However, there is a degree of weakness that remains within the regional and business jet markets as well as in with the commercial helicopter market. But we are well positioned on some very solid platforms, including the 737 MAX and the A320neo. We have rightsized the company to better manage the varying production levels, and we are investing for growth in the next-generation titanium and composite technologies. At the same time, we are seeing some stabilization in the defense market where our backlogs have risen. 
We continue to believe that the worst is behind us there. In addition, we've bolstered facilities and sold others having transformed the remaining organization into a leaner, more nimble and more results-driven enterprise. So the management team is upbeat about Ducommun and what our future holds. We've reduced the company's debt, strengthened our balance sheet, cut cost and focused our attention on the core markets where our technologies and capabilities have the highest impact.

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations, including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves, our Chief Financial Officer, to go through our financial results in detail. 
We are very happy to report that our second quarter showed benefits of many constructive changes that we've made in this past year from aggressively cutting costs and implementing supply chain initiatives to closing facilities, refinancing our debt and divesting noncore operations. Even in the face of the softness of -- and certain elements of our military markets, we achieved 19.6% gross margins and posted earnings of $0.34 per diluted share. And we believe our strong performance will continue in the second half of 2016, and I will review that in a minute. 
Our balance sheet is strong along with our backlog, and we're on track to further delever the company's balance sheet this year. The bottom line is that our overall financial performance continues to improve as does our growth profile, and we believe the company remains well positioned for new business opportunities going forward. 
Now let me go through the addition of the -- give you some additional market color on certain end markets and programs and products. I'll start off with our commercial aerospace business, where quarterly revenue once again was very solid at $66 million, near all-time record levels and slightly above our 2015 first -- second quarter. Sales rose year-over-year on several large aircraft platforms, including with Airbus. This was partially offset by a decline in our helicopter business as well as lower regional and business jet sales. 
We also saw some timing delays in shipments for the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, but we expect these to be made up during the second half of 2016. 
It's worth noting that our Airbus content, which is still relatively a small part of our business, now accounts for roughly 15% of our total commercial aerospace sales versus virtually nothing just 5 years ago. So we're quite pleased with our performance in this regard and expect to see additional awards and increased content in the quarters to come. 
In total, our commercial aerospace backlog stood at $239 million at the end of the second quarter, down from earlier this year due to seasonal adjustments and program order timing. 
Last year's second quarter backlog was also the lowest in 2015 at just $194 million. Given such timing issues, we expect the bookings in commercial aerospace to rise during the second half of 2016 because of our strong positions on the 737, 787 and 777 programs, along with our content on the Airbus A320, A350 and A330 platforms. 
We're also on track with regard to our facility investments to support the higher demand for our titanium, composites and electronics product lines, and we're targeting new content -- where we are in targeting new content and accelerated growth. 
Turning to our military and space sector. Revenue fell to $51 million this quarter from $77 million last year, which again reflects the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year along with a slowdown in military helicopter sales due to timing issues and schedule adjustments. 
In addition, roughly $5 million of our year-over-year variance was tied to our divestiture of Miltec, which we completed earlier in 2016. 
So our results were definitely not a surprise. We anticipate higher military helicopter sales during the second half of 2016. We also expect stronger shipments of our radar racks during the remainder of the year on platform such as the F-15 and the F-18 aircraft. In fact, our overall defense technology of backlog grew to nearly $209 million this quarter, the highest level in over 2 years due to increased participation on missile platforms and solid radar rack orders. 
Our total military and defense backlog now stands at a respectable $268 million. So even within the current environment, the timing remains well positioned for our electronics upgrades, cutting-edge missile platforms and new structural applications on some of the most popular platforms in the marketplace.
With that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Doug for -- to review our financial results."

Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $134.4 million compared to $174.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year reflects $17.1 million in lower sales withi",1153,"Thank you, Tony, and good day to everybody. Revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $134.4 million compared to $174.8 million for the second quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year reflects $17.1 million in lower sales within the company's industrial end-use markets and $25.8 million in lower sales within our military and space markets. The industrial decline was primarily due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation in January of this year and the closure of our Houston operation in December of 2015, both of which serving in non-aerospace markets. 
The military decline of nearly $26 million year-over-year reflects the Miltec divestiture and the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and pushed out some scheduled deliveries. 
Commercial aerospace revenue was roughly $66 million during the second quarter, up slightly year-over-year and near the record levels. The company's overall backlog rose to $537 million versus $524 million at this time last year. 
Our core saw a nice uptick in orders for defense technologies, but the backlog rose to nearly $209 million. It's the highest level in over 2 years, as Tony mentioned. However, we saw a decline in our commercial aerospace backlog sequentially versus Q1, which was primarily related to just timing issues. 
Moving on to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19.6% in the second quarter as compared to 17.8% in last year's comparable quarter. This, once again, reflects improved product mix, the various cost initiatives we've undertaken over the past year, including supply chain cost savings and other efficiency improvements. 
SG&A fell slightly year-over-year to $18.9 million from $20.4 million in 2015. This reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives, somewhat offset by some increased personnel costs and the timing of certain R&D costs related to new program wins. 
Operating income for the second quarter of 2016 was $7.3 million or 5.4% of revenue compared to $10.8 million or 6.2% of revenue in the comparable period last year. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the lower revenues.
Interest expense decreased to $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $6.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July 2015. 
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $1.5 million or 28% compared to $1.3 million or 42% for the comparable period last year. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the U.S. and federal research and development tax credit that was permanently extended in the fourth quarter of 2015. Going forward, the tax rates for the full year is still expected to be approximately 29%. 
We reported net income of $3.9 million or $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2016 compared to $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share last year. The increase was primarily due to the lower interest expense of approximately $4.5 million and the improved operating performance. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately $13.7 million or 10.3% of revenue compared to $19.7 million or 11.3% of revenue for the comparable period in '15. 
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $76.1 million in the prior year period. The period -- the decline was primarily due to $10.8 million in lower military and space sales, reflecting the program cancellations and budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted the company's fixed-wing and helicopter platforms and pushed out some scheduled deliveries. Overall, the structure system revenue also was impacted by a $4.6 million decrease in commercial aerospace sales, and this just relate to the timing of certain large airframe shipments and the wind down of a regional jet program this year -- excuse me, last year. 
Structural Systems operating income for the second quarter was $4.7 million or 7.8% of revenue compared to $6.9 million or 9% of revenue last year. The decrease in operating income and margin was primarily due to the lower sales growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $6.5 million for the current quarter or 10.7% of revenue compared to $10.5 million or 13.8% of revenue last year. 
Now turning to the Electronic segment. We posted revenue of $72.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 versus $98.8 million in the prior period. 
Revenue from our industrial markets was down $17.1 million, mainly due to the divestiture of our Pittsburgh operation and closure of our Houston facility. 
In addition, there was a $15 million decrease in military and space revenue, mainly due to our Miltec divestiture along with the budget changes we experienced last year, which impacted both the fixed and helicopter platforms, as previously discussed. The impact of these items was partially offset by a $6.1 million increase in the segments commercial aerospace revenue where we continue to gain traction.
Electronic systems posted operating income for the second quarter of $6.8 million or 9.3% of revenue compared to $7.7 million or 7.8% of revenue for the second quarter of 2015 with a decrease in operating income, again, due to lower revenue. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $10.5 million for the quarter or 14.4% of revenue compared to 12.1% or 12.2% of revenue for the comparable quarter last year. 
Corporate, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of '16 were $4.2 million or 3.2% of total revenue compared to $3.7 million or 2.1% of total revenue last year. 
Now turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $6.6 million of cash from operations in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $14.1 million in 2015. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect the historical seasonal patterns. 
We used -- we previously have used net proceeds from divesting the Miltec and Pittsburgh of approximately $55 million to pay down debt and continued towards our goal of delevering to targets of 2.25  to 2.5x debt to EBITDA over the next few years. While debt did not decrease this quarter, we expect to pay down another $10 million to $20 million of debt by fiscal year-end. 
CapEx for this quarter was $3.8 million, and we continue to expect CapEx to be approximately $18 million to $22 million for the full year as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms ramping up later this year.
In closing, we're very pleased to see the fruits of our efforts in terms of higher performance and bottom line results from the cost-cutting measures taken over the past year, along with initiatives to exit noncore businesses, focus our growth strategy going forward. We expect higher levels of revenue in the second half, along with it, even better returns.
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks. Tony?"

The commercial aerospace industry remains strong. However, there is a degree of weakness that remains within the regional and business jet markets as well as in with the commercial helicopter market. But we are well positioned on some very solid platforms, including the 737 MAX and the A320neo. We have rightsized the company to better manage the varying production levels, and we are investing for growth in the next-generation titanium and composite technologies. At the same time, we are seeing some stabilization in the defense market where our backlogs have risen. 
We continue to believe that the worst is behind us there. In addition, we've bolstered facilities and sold others having transformed the remaining organization into a leaner, more nimble and more results-driven enterprise. So the management team is upbeat about Ducommun and what our future holds. We've reduced the company's debt, strengthened our balance sheet, cut cost and focused our attention on the core markets where our technologies and capabilities have the highest impact. Our continued focus will be on the growth of our business and on increasing our shareholder value. 
With that, Glenda, I'd like to turn the call open -- or I'd like to open up the call for questions, please."

As we get more volume, it helps to cover that overhead. So I think we continue to see, certainly in the structures business, some nice momentum coming out of the end of last year sequentially through the first quarter into the second quarter and seeing that business, as we said in the past, getting back to that 8% to 9% operating income margin level that we know the business is capable of."

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color and after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves, to go through our financial results in detail.
The third quarter demonstrated our ability to continue on the core started over the past year in which we streamlined our operations, divested non-core businesses and cleaned up our balance sheet. We achieved 19% gross margins this quarter and earnings of $0.44 per diluted share, a solid performance given the lower revenue versus 2015, which speaks to our improved cost structure and enhance margin profile, and reduced interest expense. 
Revenue was lower year-over-year, mainly due to the closure of our Houston operations along with the divestiture of our Pitsburgh facility and Miltec. Net of these are core ongoing business was down just slightly this quarter versus 2015, as gains in commercial aerospace were offset by lower military sales. That being said, we believe that the military shipments timing, along with growth in the commercial aerospace platforms should drive overall revenue expansion in the fourth quarter and 2017. This is underscored by our strong backlog of $566 million at the end of Q3.
We also paid down $10 million of debt this quarter, adding to the $55 million eliminated earlier, this year. As we continue to strengthen our balance sheet to bolster our growth profile, and provide increased financial flexibility. We expect the reduced debt for that in the fourth quarter as Doug will review in the moment.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. I'll begin with our commercial aerospace business. We are pleased with the results we see plenty of room for additional growth. Quarterly revenue was $66 million in line with the second quarter, and roughly $4 million above the prior year period. Sales were solid across all areas of the business, with a nice uptick in our Airbus revenue. We did however experienced some timing delays with regard to shipments for the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, which we now expect will positively increase the fourth quarters top line. Our commercial aerospace backlog stood at $280 million at the end of this quarter, not only a record, but an increase of more than $40 million over Q2. We expect this backlog expand further based on our strong position on the Boeing 737 and 787 programs as well as the Airbus A320, A330, A350 platforms. We remain on track with investments to support higher demand for titanium, composites and electronics, particularly, on new platforms like the 737 Max and the A320neo. In support of this growth strategy, we're expanding up Kansas facility by approximately 70,000 square feet. The Parsons operation specializes in titanium thermoforming technology, and we expect demand to ramp up dramatically over the coming years, given the new applications on platforms with Spirit, Boeing, Airbus and go stream and also driven by our increase content per ship set.
Turning to our military and space sector revenue fell to $54 million this quarter from $70 million last quarter, last year, which reflects the Miltec divestiture as well as budget curtailment and changing platform requirements. Given our military revenue in Q2 of $51 million, we believe that we are at the base run rate for this side of our business, but expect to see sequential improvements next quarter as well as from 2017 reflecting higher sales from new and follow-on program awards this fiscal year. We anticipate stronger shipments of radar racks during the fourth quarter, and platform such as the F-15 and the F-18 along with higher missile system revenue and slightly better helicopter sales. 
Our military backlog remains relatively stable, just over $260 million, and we continue to target additional applications for our proprietary technologies and remain ready to address any demand changes that may take shape once the new administration takes place.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Doug to go through our financial results in detail."

The change in revenue year-over-year primarily reflects $18 million of lower sales within the co",1185,"Thank you, Tony, and good day to everybody. Revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $132.6 million compared to $161.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year primarily reflects $18 million of lower sales within the company's industrials end-use markets due to the divestiture of Pitsburgh, in January the closure of our Houston operation last December. We also saw a $15.6 million and lower revenue within the company's military and space markets, mainly due to the divestiture of the Miltec business in March, as well as some programs schedules slides and budget changes that reduced demand for certain platforms and pushed out deliveries. The impact of such items was partially offset by $4.5 million higher revenue in the company's commercial aerospace markets, reflecting added content on a variety of programs. Ducommun's backlog rose to $566 million, the highest ever excluding the divested operations, this was driven by a record-setting backlog in our commercial aerospace business and nearly $280 million, clearly, pointing to the strength of the market and our position in it. 
Moving to gross profit, our gross margin was 19% in the third quarter versus 12.4% in last year's comparable period. A higher gross margin was primarily due to the lack of $10 million forward loss reserve charge booked in 2015 related to a reasonable jet program. That said, the current year margin improvement also benefited from lower material costs as a percentage of sales, which decreased 2.1% year-over-year as a result of the company's ongoing supply chain initiatives and improved operating performance. 
SG&A fell in Q3 to $17.2 million from $21.2 million in 2015. And this reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives, as well as the decrease in compensation and benefit costs. Operating income for the third quarter of 2016 was $8.1 million or 6.1% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $1.2 million in the comparable period last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the higher gross profit and lower SG&A previously mentioned. Interest expense decreased to $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $3.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July of 2015.
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $1.2 million or 20% rate compared to a benefit of $6.9 million or 42% in the comparable period last year. The higher tax year-over-year reflects the impact in 2015 as a forward loss reserve charge I mentioned, as well as a loss on extinguishment of debt of nearly $12 million related to our refinancing last year. Going forward, the tax rates for the full year of 2016 is still expected to be approximately 29%.
We reported net income of $5 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share in the third quarter of '15. The increase in net income year-over-year primarily reflects the impact from the forward loss reserve charge and loss on extinguishment of debt previously mentioned, as well as lower interest expense. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $14.9 million or 11.2% of revenue compared to $6.6 million or 4.1% of revenue on a comparable period in 2015.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $64.2 million last year. The decline was primarily due to $3.4 million in lower military and space sales, reflecting the program schedule slides and budget changes, which impacted scheduled deliveries on certain fixed wing and helicopter platforms. Structural Systems operating income for the third quarter was $5.9 million or 9.7% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $6 million last year. The increase in operating income year-over-year, primarily reflects the 2015's $10 million forward loss reserve charge related to the reason jet program as previously mentioned. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.9 million for the current quarter or 14.6% of revenue compared to negative $3.3 million for the comparable quarter in the prior year, reflecting the issues already discussed. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment our Electronics Systems segment posted revenue of $71.6 million in the third quarter versus $97.5 million in the prior period. These results reflect an $18 million decrease across our industrial end-used markets due to the divestiture of the Pittsburgh facility January and closure of the Houston operation last December as I previously mentioned. In addition, Electronic Systems saw a $12.2 million year-over-year decline in military and space revenue reflecting the divestiture of Miltec in March, as well as general programs scheduled slides and budget changes, which reduce deliveries across several platforms. These negative factors will partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in commercial aerospace revenue, reflecting added content with existing customers. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $6.6 million or 9.2% of revenue compared to $8.6 million or 8.8% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower segment revenue, even as margins climbed reflecting improved product mix and operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.8 million for the current quarter or 13.3% of revenue compared to $13.3 million or 13.3% of revenue last year, reflecting the issues discussed. Corporate, general and administrative expenses, CGNA for the third quarter were $4.4 million or 3.3% of company revenues compared to $3.7 million or 2.3% of revenue last year. The increase in CGNA expenses were primarily due to higher compensation and benefit cost of approximately $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.4 million of cash from operations in the third quarter of 2016, compared to a use of cash of $5.5 million in 2015. We remain diligent effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect our historical seasonal patterns. We also paid down additional $10 million of debt this quarter, as Tony mentioned, and now, reduced our debt by $65 million, thus far in 2016. We expect to pay down approximately $10 million or more debt by the end of this year as we continued towards our goal of delivering to a target of 2 in a quarter to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2017. Capital expenditures were $5.1 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be in the approximately $18 million to $22 million range for the full year, as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms in 2017, as Tony mentioned. 
In closing, the quarter played out much as we expected, and benefited from many of the steps taken this past year to streamline our operations and focus our core business while enacting supply chain initiatives and tandem. We believe that future quarters so a higher revenue along with solid bottom line results, and will continue to pay down debt and strengthened the balance sheet, leaving us in good shape for 2017 and beyond. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks."

I wanted to add to Doug's last comment about the future of Ducommun. I'm obviously pleased with our overall performance this year, particularly, the bottom line results. We definitely see upside going forward, by streamlining our operation and focusing on the core competencies, we brought a real sense of stability to the company. We have excellent customer relations and due to our expertise and structural components, titanium assemblies and aerospace and electronics. We're on some of the best platforms in the industry, with years of backlog and build rates sector accelerate starting next year. As far we're investing in our Parsons Kansas facility, which we expect to provide an excellent return going forward. And on military side, we have cut cost to manage the current low run rate, but given that a defense spending can be rather unpredictable, we can rapidly expand production if necessary and are on some of the most enduring programs today, including the Blackhawk helicopter. Bottom line, is that our stronger balance sheet, solid backlog and rightsize operations. We built the company ready for the next phase of growth. We want to close 2016 on an up note, and believe 2017 will continue to the momentum that we have achieved. We have got great customers, excellent employees and we look forward to improving returns for our investors.

I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves to go through",686,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 Third Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves to go through our financial results in detail.
The third quarter demonstrated our ability to continue on the course charted over the past year in which we streamlined our operations, divested non-core businesses and cleaned up our balance sheet. We achieved 19% gross margins this quarter and earnings of $0.44 per diluted share, a solid performance given the lower revenue versus 2015, which speaks to our improved cost structure and enhanced margin profile and reduced interest expense. 
Revenue was lower year-over-year, mainly due to the closure of our Houston operations along with the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility and Miltec. Net of these, our core ongoing business was down just slightly this quarter versus 2015, as gains in commercial aerospace were offset by lower military sales. That being said, we believe that the military shipments' timing, along with growth in the commercial aerospace platforms should drive overall revenue expansion in the fourth quarter and 2017. This is underscored by our strong backlog of $566 million at the end of Q3.
We also paid down $10 million of debt this quarter, adding to the $55 million eliminated earlier this year as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet to bolster our growth profile and provide increased financial flexibility. We expect the reduced debt further in the fourth quarter as Doug will review in a moment.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. I'll begin with our Commercial Aerospace business. We are pleased with the results, but see plenty of room for additional growth. Quarterly revenue was $66 million in line with the second quarter, and roughly $4 million above the prior year period. Sales were solid across all areas of the business, with a nice uptick in our Airbus revenue. We did, however, experience some timing delays with regard to shipments for the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, which we now expect will positively increase the fourth quarter's top line. Our Commercial Aerospace backlog stood at $280 million at the end of this quarter, not only a record, but an increase of more than $40 million over Q2. We expect this backlog can expand further based on our strong position on the Boeing 737 and 787 programs as well as the Airbus A320, A330, A350 platforms. We remain on track with investments to support higher demand for titanium, composites and electronics, particularly, on new platforms like the 737 Max and the A320neo. In support of this growth strategy, we are expanding our Parsons, Kansas facility by approximately 70,000 square feet. The Parsons operation specializes in titanium thermoforming technology, and we expect demand to ramp up dramatically over the coming years, given the new applications on platforms with Spirit, Boeing, Airbus and Gulfstream and also driven by our increased content per ship set.
Turning to our Military and Space sector, revenue fell to $54 million this quarter from $70 million last quarter, or last year, which reflects the Miltec divestiture as well as budget curtailments and changing platform requirements. Given our military revenue in Q2 of $51 million, we believe that we are at the base run rate for this side of our business, but expect to see sequential improvements next quarter as well as in 2017 reflecting higher sales from new and follow-on program awards this fiscal year. We anticipate stronger shipments of radar racks during the fourth quarter on platforms such as the F-15 and the F-18 along with higher missile system revenue and slightly better helicopter sales. 
Our military backlog remains relatively stable, at just over $260 million, and we continue to target additional applications for our proprietary technologies and remain ready to address any demand changes that may take shape once the new administration takes place.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Doug to go through our financial results in detail."

Revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $132.6 million compared to $161.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year primarily reflects $18 million of lower sales within the company's industrials end-use market due to the divestiture of Pittsburgh in January, the closure of our Houston operation last December. We also saw a $15.6 million in lower revenue within the company's military and space markets, mainly due to the divestiture of the Miltec business in March, as well as some programs' schedules slides and budget changes that reduced demand for certain platforms and pushed out deliveries. The impact of such items was partially offset by $4.5 million higher revenue in the company's commercial aerospace markets, reflecting added content on a variety of programs. Ducommun's backlog rose to $566 million, the highest ever excluding the divested operations. This was driven by a record-setting backlog in our Commercial Aerospace business and nearly $280 million, clearly, pointing to the strength of the market and our position in it. 
Moving to gross profit, our gross margin was 19% in the third quarter versus 12.4% in last year's comparable period. The higher gross margin was primarily due to the lack of $10 million forward loss reserve charge booked in 2015 related to a reasonable jet program. That said, the current year margin improvement also benefited from lower material costs as a percentage of sales, which decreased 2.1% year-over-year as a result of the company's ongoing supply chain initiatives and improved operating performance. 
SG&A fell in Q3 to $17.2 million from $21.2 million in 2015. And this reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives, as well as the decrease in compensation and benefit costs. Operating income for the third quarter of 2016 was $8.1 million or 6.1% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $1.2 million in the comparable period last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the higher gross profit and lower SG&A previously mentioned. Interest expense decreased to $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $3.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July of 2015.
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $1.2 million or 20% rate compared to a benefit of $6.9 million or 42% in the comparable period last year. The higher tax year-over-year reflects the impact in 2015 as the forward loss reserve charge I mentioned, as well as a loss on extinguishment of debt of nearly $12 million related to our refinancing last year. Going forward, the tax rate for the full year of 2016 is still expected to be approximately 29%.
We reported net income of $5 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share in the third quarter of '15. The increase in net income year-over-year primarily reflects the impact from the forward loss reserve charge and loss on extinguishment of debt previously mentioned, as well as lower interest expense. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $14.9 million or 11.2% of revenue compared to $6.6 million or 4.1% of revenue in the comparable period in 2015.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $64.2 million last year. The decline was primarily due to $3.4 million in lower Military and Space sales, reflecting program schedule slides and budget changes, which impacted scheduled deliveries on certain fixed wing and helicopter platforms. Structural Systems operating income for the third quarter was $5.9 million or 9.7% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $6 million last year. The increase in operating income year-over-year, primarily reflects the 2015's $10 million forward loss reserve charge related to the regional jet program as previously mentioned. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.9 million for the current quarter or 14.6% of revenue compared to negative $3.3 million for the comparable quarter in the prior year, reflecting the issues already discussed. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronics Systems segment posted revenue of $71.6 million in the third quarter versus $97.5 million in the prior period. These results reflect an $18 million decrease across our industrial end-use markets due to the divestiture of the Pittsburgh facility January and closure of the Houston operation last December as I previously mentioned. In addition, Electronic Systems saw a $12.2 million year-over-year decline in Military and Space revenue reflecting the divestiture of Miltec in March, as well as general programs, scheduled slides and budget changes, which reduced deliveries across several platforms. These negative factors were partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in Commercial Aerospace revenue, reflecting added content with existing customers. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $6.6 million or 9.2% of revenue compared to $8.6 million or 8.8% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower segment revenue, even as margins climbed, reflecting improved product mix and operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.8 million for the current quarter or 13.3% of revenue compared to $13.3 million or 13.3% of revenue last year, reflecting the issues discussed. Corporate, general and administrative expenses, CGNA for the third quarter were $4.4 million or 3.3% of company revenue compared to $3.7 million or 2.3% of revenue last year. The increase in CGNA expenses were primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of approximately $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.4 million of cash from operations in the third quarter of 2016, compared to a use of cash of $5.5 million in 2015. We remained diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect our historical seasonal patterns. We also paid down an additional $10 million of debt this quarter, as Tony mentioned, and now have reduced our debt by $65 million, thus far in 2016. We expect to pay down approximately $10 million more debt by the end of this year as we continue towards our goal of delivering to a target of 2.25 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2017. Capital expenditures were $5.1 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be in the approximately $18 million to $22 million range for the full year, as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms in 2017, as Tony mentioned. 
In closing, the quarter played out much as we expected, and benefited from many of the steps taken this past year to streamline our operations and focus our core business while enacting supply chain initiatives in tandem. We believe that future quarters should show higher revenue along with solid bottom line results, and will continue to pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet, leaving us in good shape for 2017 and beyond. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks."

I wanted to add to Doug's last comments about the future of Ducommun. While I'm obviously pleased with our overall performance this year, particularly, the bottom line results, we definitely see upside going forward. By streamlining our operation and focusing on our core competencies, we brought a real sense of stability to the company. We have excellent customer relations and due to our expertise in structural components, titanium assemblies and aerospace and electronics. We're on some of the best platforms in the industry, with years of backlog and build rates set to accelerate starting next year. That's why we're investing in our Parsons, Kansas facility, which we expect to provide an excellent return going forward. On our military side, we've cut costs to manage the current low run rate, but given that a defense spending can be rather unpredictable, we can rapidly expand production if necessary and are on some of the most enduring programs today, including the Black Hawk helicopter. The bottom line is that our stronger balance sheet, solid backlog and rightsize operations -- we built the company ready for the next phase of growth. We want to close 2016 on an up note, and believe 2017 will continue to -- the momentum that we've achieved. We've got great customers, excellent employees and we look forward to improving returns for our investors.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 Third Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves to go through",687,"Thank you, Chris. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 Third Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves to go through our financial results in detail.
The third quarter demonstrated our ability to continue on the course charted over the past year in which we streamlined our operations, divested noncore businesses and cleaned up our balance sheet. We achieved 19% gross margins this quarter and earnings of $0.44 per diluted share, a solid performance given the lower revenue versus 2015, which speaks to our improved cost structure, enhanced margin profile and reduced interest expense. 
Revenue was lower year-over-year, mainly due to the closure of our Houston operations along with the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility and Miltec. Net of these, our core ongoing business was down just slightly this quarter versus 2015, as gains in commercial aerospace were offset by lower military sales. That being said, we believe that the military shipments' timing along with growth in the commercial aerospace platforms should drive overall revenue expansion in the fourth quarter and 2017. This is underscored by our strong backlog of $566 million at the end of Q3.
We also paid down $10 million of debt this quarter, adding to the $55 million eliminated earlier this year, as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet to bolster our growth profile and provide increased financial flexibility. We expect the reduce debt further in the fourth quarter, as Doug will review in a moment.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. I'll begin with our Commercial Aerospace business. We are pleased with the results but see plenty of room for additional growth. Quarterly revenue was $66 million, in line with the second quarter and roughly $4 million above the prior year period. Sales were solid across all areas of the business, with a nice uptick in our Airbus revenue. We did, however, experience some timing delays with regard to shipments for the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, which we now expect will positively increase the fourth quarter's top line. Our Commercial Aerospace backlog stood at $280 million at the end of this quarter, not only a record but an increase of more than $40 million over Q2. We expect this backlog can expand further based on our strong position on the Boeing 737 and 787 programs as well as the Airbus A320, A330 and A350 platforms. We remain on track with investments to support higher demand for titanium, composites and electronics, particularly on new platforms like the 737 Max and the A320neo. In support of this growth strategy, we are expanding our Parsons, Kansas, facility by approximately 70,000 square feet. The Parsons operation specializes in titanium thermoforming technology, and we expect demand to ramp up dramatically over the coming years, given the new applications on platforms with Spirit, Boeing, Airbus and Gulfstream and also driven by our increased content per ship set.
Turning to our Military and Space sector, revenue fell to $54 million this quarter from $70 million last quarter -- or last year, which reflects the Miltec divestiture as well as budget curtailments and changing platform requirements. Given our military revenue in Q2 of $51 million, we believe that we are at the base run rate for this side of our business but expect to see sequential improvements next quarter as well as in 2017, reflecting higher sales from new and follow-on program awards this fiscal year. We anticipate stronger shipments of radar racks during the fourth quarter on platforms such as the F-15 and the F-18 along with higher missile system revenue and slightly better helicopter sales. 
Our military backlog remains relatively stable at just over $260 million, and we continue to target additional applications for our proprietary technologies and remain ready to address any demand changes that may take shape once the new administration takes place.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Doug to go through our financial results in detail."

Revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $132.6 million compared to $161.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year primarily reflects $18 million of lower sales within the company's industrials end-use market due to the divestiture of Pittsburgh in January, the closure of our Houston operation last December. We also saw $15.6 million in lower revenue within the company's military and space markets, mainly due to the divestiture of the Miltec business in March as well as some programs  schedule slides and budget changes that reduced demand for certain platforms and pushed out deliveries. The impact of such items was partially offset by $4.5 million higher revenue in the company's commercial aerospace markets, reflecting added content on a variety of programs. Ducommun's backlog rose to $566 million, the highest ever excluding the divested operations. This was driven by a record-setting backlog in our Commercial Aerospace business of nearly $280 million, clearly pointing to the strength of the market and our position in it. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19% in the third quarter versus 12.4% in last year's comparable period. The higher gross margin was primarily due to the lack of a $10 million forward loss reserve charge booked in 2015 related to a regional jet program. That said, the current year margin improvement also benefited from lower material costs as a percentage of sales, which decreased 2.1% year-over-year as a result of the company's ongoing supply chain initiatives and improved operating performance. 
SG&A fell in Q3 to $17.2 million from $21.2 million in 2015. And this reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives as well as a decrease in compensation and benefit costs. Operating income for the third quarter of 2016 was $8.1 million or 6.1% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $1.2 million in the comparable period last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the higher gross profit and lower SG&A previously mentioned. Interest expense decreased to $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $3.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July of 2015.
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $1.2 million or 20% rate compared to a benefit of $6.9 million or 42% in the comparable period last year. The higher tax year-over-year reflects the impact in 2015 of the forward loss reserve charge I mentioned as well as a loss on extinguishment of debt of nearly $12 million related to our refinancing last year. Going forward, the tax rate for the full year of 2016 is still expected to be approximately 29%.
We reported net income of $5 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share in the third quarter of '15. The increase in net income year-over-year primarily reflects the impact from the forward loss reserve charge and loss on extinguishment of debt previously mentioned as well as lower interest expense. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $14.9 million or 11.2% of revenue compared to $6.6 million or 4.1% of revenue in the comparable period in 2015.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $64.2 million last year. The decline was primarily due to $3.4 million in lower Military and Space sales, reflecting program schedule slides and budget changes, which impacted scheduled deliveries on certain fixed-wing and helicopter platforms. Structural Systems operating income for the third quarter was $5.9 million or 9.7% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $6 million last year. The increase in operating income year-over-year, primarily reflects the 2015's $10 million forward loss reserve charge related to the regional jet program, as previously mentioned. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.9 million for the current quarter or 14.6% of revenue compared to negative $3.3 million for the comparable quarter in the prior year, reflecting the issues already discussed. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronics Systems segment posted revenue of $71.6 million in the third quarter versus $97.5 million in the prior period. These results reflect an $18 million decrease across our industrial end-use markets due to the divestiture of the Pittsburgh facility in January and closure of the Houston operation last December, as I previously mentioned. In addition, Electronic Systems saw a $12.2 million year-over-year decline in Military and Space revenue, reflecting the divestiture of Miltec in March as well as general programs schedule slides and budget changes, which reduced deliveries across several platforms. These negative factors were partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in Commercial Aerospace revenue, reflecting added content with existing customers. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $6.6 million or 9.2% of revenue compared to $8.6 million or 8.8% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower segment revenue, even as margins climbed, reflecting improved product mix and operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.8 million for the current quarter or 13.3% of revenue compared to $13.3 million or 13.3% of revenue last year, reflecting the issues discussed. Corporate, general and administrative expenses, CGNA, for the third quarter were $4.4 million or 3.3% of company revenue compared to $3.7 million or 2.3% of revenue last year. The increase in CGNA expenses were primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of approximately $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.4 million of cash from operations in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a use of cash of $5.5 million in 2015. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect our historical seasonal patterns. We also paid down an additional $10 million of debt this quarter, as Tony mentioned, and now have reduced our debt by $65 million thus far in 2016. We expect to pay down approximately $10 million more debt by the end of this year, as we continue towards our goal of delevering to a target of 2.25 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2017. Capital expenditures were $5.1 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be in the approximately $18 million to $22 million range for the full year, as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms in 2017, as Tony mentioned. 
In closing, the quarter played out much as we expected and benefited from many of the steps taken this past year to streamline our operations and focus our core business, while enacting supply chain initiatives in tandem. We believe that future quarters should show higher revenue along with solid bottom line results, and we'll continue to pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet, leaving us in good shape for 2017 and beyond. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks."

Before turning the call over to questions, I wanted to add to Doug's last comments about the future of Ducommun. While obviously pleased with our overall performance this year, particularly the bottom line results, we definitely see upside going forward. By streamlining our operation and focusing on our core competencies, we brought a real sense of stability to the company. We have excellent customer relations, and due to our expertise in structural components, titanium assemblies and aerospace electronics, we're on some of the best platforms in the industry, with years of backlog and build rates set to accelerate starting next year. That's why we're investing in our Parsons, Kansas, facility, which we expect to provide an excellent return going forward. On our military side, we've cut costs to manage the current low run rate. But given that defense spending can be rather unpredictable, we can rapidly expand production if necessary and are on some of the most enduring programs today, including the Black Hawk helicopter. The bottom line is that our stronger balance sheet, solid backlog and rightsize operations, we built the company ready for the next phase of growth. We want to close 2016 on an up note and believe 2017 will continue the momentum that we've achieved. We've got great customers, excellent employees and we look forward to improving returns for our investors.

And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 Third Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves to go through",687,"Thank you, Chris. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today for our 2016 Third Quarter Conference Call. I'll begin by providing an overview of our operations including some market color, after which I'll turn the call over to Doug Groves to go through our financial results in detail.
The third quarter demonstrated our ability to continue on the course charted over the past year in which we streamlined our operations, divested noncore businesses and cleaned up our balance sheet. We achieved 19% gross margins this quarter and earnings of $0.44 per diluted share, a solid performance given the lower revenue versus 2015, which speaks to our improved cost structure, enhanced margin profile and reduced interest expense. 
Revenue was lower year-over-year, mainly due to the closure of our Houston operations along with the divestiture of our Pittsburgh facility and Miltec. Net of these, our core ongoing business was down just slightly this quarter versus 2015, as gains in commercial aerospace were offset by lower military sales. That being said, we believe that the military shipments' timing along with growth in the commercial aerospace platforms should drive overall revenue expansion in the fourth quarter and 2017. This is underscored by our strong backlog of $566 million at the end of Q3.
We also paid down $10 million of debt this quarter, adding to the $55 million eliminated earlier this year, as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet to bolster our growth profile and provide increased financial flexibility. We expect the reduce debt further in the fourth quarter, as Doug will review in a moment.
Now let me provide some additional color on our end markets, products and programs. I'll begin with our Commercial Aerospace business. We are pleased with the results but see plenty of room for additional growth. Quarterly revenue was $66 million, in line with the second quarter and roughly $4 million above the prior year period. Sales were solid across all areas of the business, with a nice uptick in our Airbus revenue. We did, however, experience some timing delays with regard to shipments for the Boeing 737 and 787 platforms, which we now expect will positively increase the fourth quarter's top line. Our Commercial Aerospace backlog stood at $280 million at the end of this quarter, not only a record but an increase of more than $40 million over Q2. We expect this backlog can expand further based on our strong position on the Boeing 737 and 787 programs as well as the Airbus A320, A330 and A350 platforms. We remain on track with investments to support higher demand for titanium, composites and electronics, particularly on new platforms like the 737 Max and the A320neo. In support of this growth strategy, we are expanding our Parsons, Kansas, facility by approximately 70,000 square feet. The Parsons operation specializes in titanium thermoforming technology, and we expect demand to ramp up dramatically over the coming years, given the new applications on platforms with Spirit, Boeing, Airbus and Gulfstream and also driven by our increased content per ship set.
Turning to our Military and Space sector, revenue fell to $54 million this quarter from $70 million last quarter -- or last year, which reflects the Miltec divestiture as well as budget curtailments and changing platform requirements. Given our military revenue in Q2 of $51 million, we believe that we are at the base run rate for this side of our business but expect to see sequential improvements next quarter as well as in 2017, reflecting higher sales from new and follow-on program awards this fiscal year. We anticipate stronger shipments of radar racks during the fourth quarter on platforms such as the F-15 and the F-18 along with higher missile system revenue and slightly better helicopter sales. 
Our military backlog remains relatively stable at just over $260 million, and we continue to target additional applications for our proprietary technologies and remain ready to address any demand changes that may take shape once the new administration takes place.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Doug to go through our financial results in detail."
267761,404975062,1075489,"Ducommun Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Ducommun Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good day to everybody. Revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $132.6 million compared to $161.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year primarily reflects $18 million of lower sales within the co",1183,"Thank you, Tony, and good day to everybody. Revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $132.6 million compared to $161.7 million for the third quarter of 2015. The change in revenue year-over-year primarily reflects $18 million of lower sales within the company's industrials end-use market due to the divestiture of Pittsburgh in January, the closure of our Houston operation last December. We also saw $15.6 million in lower revenue within the company's military and space markets, mainly due to the divestiture of the Miltec business in March as well as some programs schedule slides and budget changes that reduced demand for certain platforms and pushed out deliveries. The impact of such items was partially offset by $4.5 million higher revenue in the company's commercial aerospace markets, reflecting added content on a variety of programs. Ducommun's backlog rose to $566 million, the highest ever excluding the divested operations. This was driven by a record-setting backlog in our Commercial Aerospace business of nearly $280 million, clearly pointing to the strength of the market and our position in it. 
Moving to gross profit. Our gross margin was 19% in the third quarter versus 12.4% in last year's comparable period. The higher gross margin was primarily due to the lack of a $10 million forward loss reserve charge booked in 2015 related to a regional jet program. That said, the current year margin improvement also benefited from lower material costs as a percentage of sales, which decreased 2.1% year-over-year as a result of the company's ongoing supply chain initiatives and improved operating performance. 
SG&A fell in Q3 to $17.2 million from $21.2 million in 2015. And this reflects our divestitures and cost-cutting initiatives as well as a decrease in compensation and benefit costs. Operating income for the third quarter of 2016 was $8.1 million or 6.1% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $1.2 million in the comparable period last year. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the higher gross profit and lower SG&A previously mentioned. Interest expense decreased to $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $3.4 million last year, primarily due to lower outstanding debt balances and reduced interest rates as a result of the company's refinancing in July of 2015.
Our effective income tax expense during the quarter was $1.2 million or 20% rate compared to a benefit of $6.9 million or 42% in the comparable period last year. The higher tax year-over-year reflects the impact in 2015 of the forward loss reserve charge I mentioned as well as a loss on extinguishment of debt of nearly $12 million related to our refinancing last year. Going forward, the tax rate for the full year of 2016 is still expected to be approximately 29%.
We reported net income of $5 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.86 per share in the third quarter of '15. The increase in net income year-over-year primarily reflects the impact from the forward loss reserve charge and loss on extinguishment of debt previously mentioned as well as lower interest expense. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2016 was $14.9 million or 11.2% of revenue compared to $6.6 million or 4.1% of revenue in the comparable period in 2015.
Now let me turn to the segment results. Our Structural Systems segment posted revenue of $60.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $64.2 million last year. The decline was primarily due to $3.4 million in lower Military and Space sales, reflecting program schedule slides and budget changes, which impacted scheduled deliveries on certain fixed-wing and helicopter platforms. Structural Systems operating income for the third quarter was $5.9 million or 9.7% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $6 million last year. The increase in operating income year-over-year, primarily reflects the 2015's $10 million forward loss reserve charge related to the regional jet program, as previously mentioned. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.9 million for the current quarter or 14.6% of revenue compared to negative $3.3 million for the comparable quarter in the prior year, reflecting the issues already discussed. 
Turning to the Electronic Systems segment. Our Electronics Systems segment posted revenue of $71.6 million in the third quarter versus $97.5 million in the prior period. These results reflect an $18 million decrease across our industrial end-use markets due to the divestiture of the Pittsburgh facility in January and closure of the Houston operation last December, as I previously mentioned. In addition, Electronic Systems saw a $12.2 million year-over-year decline in Military and Space revenue, reflecting the divestiture of Miltec in March as well as general programs schedule slides and budget changes, which reduced deliveries across several platforms. These negative factors were partially offset by a $4.3 million increase in Commercial Aerospace revenue, reflecting added content with existing customers. 
Electronic Systems posted operating income for the third quarter of $6.6 million or 9.2% of revenue compared to $8.6 million or 8.8% of revenue in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower segment revenue, even as margins climbed, reflecting improved product mix and operating efficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.8 million for the current quarter or 13.3% of revenue compared to $13.3 million or 13.3% of revenue last year, reflecting the issues discussed. Corporate, general and administrative expenses, CGNA, for the third quarter were $4.4 million or 3.3% of company revenue compared to $3.7 million or 2.3% of revenue last year. The increase in CGNA expenses were primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs of approximately $0.6 million. 
Turning to liquidity and capital resources. We generated $15.4 million of cash from operations in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a use of cash of $5.5 million in 2015. We remain diligent in effective working capital management and expect our net cash profile going forward to reflect our historical seasonal patterns. We also paid down an additional $10 million of debt this quarter, as Tony mentioned, and now have reduced our debt by $65 million thus far in 2016. We expect to pay down approximately $10 million more debt by the end of this year, as we continue towards our goal of delevering to a target of 2.25 to 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2017. Capital expenditures were $5.1 million in the quarter, and we expect CapEx to be in the approximately $18 million to $22 million range for the full year, as we continue to invest in new programs and prepare for the next-generation platforms in 2017, as Tony mentioned. 
In closing, the quarter played out much as we expected and benefited from many of the steps taken this past year to streamline our operations and focus our core business, while enacting supply chain initiatives in tandem. We believe that future quarters should show higher revenue along with solid bottom line results, and we'll continue to pay down debt and strengthen the balance sheet, leaving us in good shape for 2017 and beyond. 
I'll now turn it back over to Tony for his closing remarks."

Before turning the call over to questions, I wanted to add to Doug's last comments about the future of Ducommun. While obviously pleased with our overall performance this year, particularly the bottom line results, we definitely see upside going forward. By streamlining our operation and focusing on our core competencies, we brought a real sense of stability to the company. We have excellent customer relations, and due to our expertise in structural components, titanium assemblies and aerospace electronics, we're on some of the best platforms in the industry, with years of backlog and build rates set to accelerate starting next year. That's why we're investing in our Parsons, Kansas, facility, which we expect to provide an excellent return going forward. On our military side, we've cut costs to manage the current low run rate. But given that defense spending can be rather unpredictable, we can rapidly expand production if necessary and are on some of the most enduring programs today, including the Black Hawk helicopter. The bottom line is that our stronger balance sheet, solid backlog and rightsize operations, we built the company ready for the next phase of growth. We want to close 2016 on an up note and believe 2017 will continue the momentum that we've achieved. We've got great customers, excellent employees and we look forward to improving returns for our investors. 
With that, Christie, we'd now like to open it up for questions."
