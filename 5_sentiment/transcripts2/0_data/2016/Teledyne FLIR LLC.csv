With Todd and me today is our CFO, and Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Tom Merrill, Chief of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Shane Harrison. 
I'll start review the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $438 million, up 1% from the prior year, but up 3% on a constant-currency basis. Earnings per share were $0.51, which included the gain on an investment, restructuring charges and discrete tax charges. Adjusting for these items, earnings per share were $0.47, compared to an adjusted $0.45 in Q4 of 2014. 
Fourth quarter operating income, excluding restructuring charges, was $94 million, up 6% over the prior year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter grew 25% year-over-year. As a result of the strong order intake in Q4 in our government-oriented segments, we finished the year with total fourth quarter backlog of 604 million, representing 6% growth over the end of the third quarter and the highest level of backlog since 2008 where our U.S. Military business was very strong due to the REIT and bus program. In the quarter, we acquired details, which advanced security video management and video analytics solutions to expand FLIR Security business in the enterprise market. The impact of this transaction was not meaningful to our operating results for the quarter. 
Slide 4 shows the summary of the full year, where constant currency revenue growth of 6% help drive 10% growth and adjusted earnings per share as we realize significant operating leverage on our restructured cost basis.
Cash generation improved significantly with full year operating cash flow growing 22% over 2014 as better utilization of working capital added to the growth in net income. Backlog trends have been quite positive growing an 11% compound rate over the past 2 years. 
During 2015, we introduced over 20 new product platforms across our 6 segments. 8 of those products included a revolutionary Lepton micro camera core creating new product categories and enabling groundbreaking new price points and capabilities such as IGM or infrared guided measurement through a broader set of customers.
On Slide 5, you'll see our initial outlook for 2016. As a result of expected softness in many of our European markets and a higher expected effective tax rate for the year, we expect revenues to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion and earnings per share to be in a range of $1.60 to $1.70. This revenue represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of the between 3% and 9% when compared to the 2015 results, after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
We expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 26%, excluding any future discrete items. Increasing due to changes in effective foreign tax rates. While our government-oriented business segments had a strong order flow in Q4, we continue to be cautious on this front as our traditionally short cycle business can be event driven and is difficult to forecast.
Additionally, for the first quarter of 2016, we expect overall margins to be lower than the first quarter of 2015 due to product mix, a difficult comparable related to shipments to 1 Middle Eastern customer in the first quarter of 2015 and the nonrecurrence of corporate expense credits we received.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on March 4 to shareholders of record as of February 19. This represents a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.11 in 2015. 
I'll now hand the call over it to Amit to review fourth quarter financial results. Amit?"

The following discussion on pretax operating results for the fourth quarter and full year excludes restructuring expenses which totaled $0.3 million and $1.4 in 2015 million, and $1 million and $17 million in 2014, respectively",1129,"Thanks, Andy. Good morning. The following discussion on pretax operating results for the fourth quarter and full year excludes restructuring expenses which totaled $0.3 million and $1.4 in 2015 million, and $1 million and $17 million in 2014, respectively. 
On Slide 6, you'll see our fourth quarter financial results. Despite currency headwinds, our revenue, operating income, operating margins, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $438 million, an increase of 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our Security and Detection segments reported increases of 21% and 32%, respectively, in year-over-year revenue. 
Our surveillance, instruments OEM and emerging markets and Maritime segments, reported year-over-year declines of 5%, 5%, 2% and 10%, respectively. As we've noted earlier in the year, our Instruments and Maritime segments are most heavily impacted by currency fluctuations. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and OEM and emerging markets segment revenues would have been flat at year-over-year and Maritime would have shown a year-over-year decline of 4%, primarily due to a change in distribution channels and inventory reduction at a large retailer at year-end. Overall revenue would have shown a year-over-year increase of 3% on a constant-currency basis. 
Recently, revenue increase in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 30%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 4%, 10% and 23%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. Government increased by about $18 million or 22% and represented 23% of total revenue, compared to 19% in 2014. Consolidated fourth quarter gross margin was 47%, a 2 percentage point decrease compared to last year, primarily driven by weakness in the OEM and Emerging Market segment, related to the consolidation of our manufacturing facility to improve future efficiencies, as well as overall changes in segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates.
Operating income and margin has improved year-over-year despite adverse currency effects. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating margins, excluding restructuring charges, was 21%. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a nonoperating after-tax gain of approximately $12.7 million related to the sale of an investment that we had in a private technology company. We also reported a tax expense of $34.6 million which was $24.5 million higher than 2014, primarily due to $7.4 million of unfavorable discrete tax items, compared to prior year, when we benefited from the release of approximately $9.4 million of taxes earned. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $70.2 million, a slight decrease from last year and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.51 for both years. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the discrete tax items in the fourth quarter o both years and the current after-tax investment gain, adjusted net income was $65 million compared to $64.1 million in 2014 and adjusted EPS was $0.47 in 2015 compared to $0.45 in 2014.
We closed the year with cash of $472.8 million, a decrease of $52.6 million during the quarter. A strong operating cash flow was deployed towards investing and financing activity to improve shareholder value, including the acquisition of DVTEL that use $92 million of cash in the quarter. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter were $78.3 million or 112% of quarterly net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better capital working environment. In the quarter, we improved our cash conversion cycle by almost 20 days. 
We had capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the fourth quarter and returned $15.2 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We also spent $29.8 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our stock during the quarter under the two-year 15 million shares repurchase program that be announced in February of last year.
On Slide 7, you'll see our 2015 full year financial results. Similar to the fourth quarter, despite the headwinds, our full year revenue operating income, operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. 
For 2015, our revenue was $1,557 million, an increase of 2% compared to 2014. On a constant-currency basis, full year revenue would have been up approximately 6% year-over-year. Our Security and Detection segment reported year-over-year revenue increases of 27% and 34%, respectively. Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM and Emerging markets and Maritime segments reported year-over-year declines of 3%, 2%, 6% and 8%, respectively. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and Maritime segments would have shown year-over-year revenue improvement of 5% and 2%, respectively.
Regionally, revenue increase in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 12%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe, and Middle East and Africa revenue decline by 11%, 3% and 9%, respectively. Sales of the U.S. government was flat compared to 2014 and represented 20% of total revenues, consistent with last year. 
Full year gross margin decreased marginally compared to last year, explained by overall changes and segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rate. 2015 operating income and margin improved year-over-year, despite adverse currency effects. Our adjusted full year operating margin, excluding restructuring charges was 20%. 
For the full year, our as reported tax rate was 21%, compared to 20% in 2014. Adjusting for the restructuring charges, investment gain in discrete tax items, our 2015 tax rate was 23% compared to 24% in 2014. For the full year 2015, net income was $241.7 million, representing a 21% increase over of 2014. EPS of $1.72 for the full year 2015 compared to $1.39, a 24% increase year-over-year. Excluding restructuring charges, investment gains and discrete tax items for both years, adjusted net income was $220 million, compared to $203.8 million in 2014, an 8% improvement. And adjusted EPS was $1.56 in 2015, compared to $1.42 in 2014, a 10% improvement. 
For the full year, our operating cash flow was $275.8 million or 114% of full year net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. We have capital expenditures of $68.2 million in 2015 and returned $61.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends.
We also spent $123.2 million to repurchase a little more than 4 million shares during the year. In terms of capital deployment over the long-term, we plan to continue our organic investments, spending about 3% to 4% of revenue on capital expenditures and 8% to 10% of revenue on R&D. We intend to deploy 100% of our free cash flow going forward, maintaining a dividend payout ratio of about 25% to 30% of net income and using the remainder to fund M&A and share repurchases, depending on available opportunities and expected returns.
This concludes the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results. For me now told during the call to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our full year operational results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 4% and operating margin declined 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding restructuring charges, due primarily to costs incurred in the consolidation of our 4 primary OEM and emerging production and office buildings into a single multipurpose facility. We expect this facility consolidation to result in greater operating efficiency for the business. 
Moving to Slide 9, during the fourth quarter, Surveillance segment revenue declined 5% year-over-year to $150.7 million. In the prior year, we had significant amount of revenue coming out of are in integrated line of business segment remittitur COS, at the assistants deliveries and completion of a large order to Middle Eastern customer. The unfavorable impact of this comparison offset strength in our airborne, maritime and man portable lines of business. 
Surveillance segment operating income of $49.2 million increased 2% versus the prior year when excluding restructuring expenses. This represents a 220 basis point increase in operating margin, driven by reduced operating expenses. Surveillance backlog reduced slightly from Q3 to $309 million. Bookings of $142 million resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9x, and bookings growth of 28% over the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Full year 2015 bookings of $533 million represented our highest order flow since 2010 when the rate in Chiba's or Graham drafted. In January, Surveillance introduced our newest Personal Vision Systems product, the scout TK and health thermal binoculars. Targeted at outdoor enthusiasts, this county get man's Lipton 3 core and opens a new category in the market with its retail price of $599. 
Turning to Slide 10. The instrument segment saw a fourth quarter revenue declined of 5% compared to the prior-year Europe to $98.6 million. Excluding the effect of the stronger dollar, Instruments revenue was flat with the prior year. Test and measurement and science products performed well and weld the premium version of critic the maintenance products show a decline in part due to the delayed shipment of our new flagship T1K products until late in the quarter. 
Operating margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, increased 100 basis points to 35% and was within 20 basis points of the peak operating margins achieved in Q4 2012 as reduced operating expenses helped offset the top line softness. Also in January, the Instruments segment introduced their newest value-priced hand-held thermal spike hammer out, the TV 130 at the Consumer Electronics Show. Professionals and homeowners can use the TG 130 to pinpoint window and door drugs, using insulation, water damage and a multitude of other home and structural related problems. Based on our love time to micro quarter, the new handheld features a revolutionary price point of $249. 
On Slide 11, you'll see our Security operating results, strong revenue growth continued into segment, up 21% year-over-year, reaching $68.4 million. Large expanded product in the residential offerings drove top line growth that was dampened by operably soft shipment of cool thermal systems as Q4 of 2014 saw significant shipments of these products to a Middle Eastern customer. Security operating process profit was $9.2 million with margins declining 480 basis points, primarily driven by reduced gross margins due to product mix, as well as increased marketing spend. As Andy mentioned, we acquired DVTEL at the end of November, which strengthens clear security presence in the enterprise portion of the security market. This acquisition provides us with significant software capabilities, including sophisticated video analytics and robust video management systems or VNS. 
EMS systems are the central user interface for our video security systems, and are often the first decision in enterprise customers will make when defining an integrated video security solution. The DVTEL [indiscernible] 2 DMS will be integrated into the near command-and-control system suite and will form the backbone of the FLIR integrated video surveillance solution. 
The results for the OEM and emerging segment are shown on Slide 12. OEM and emerging fourth quarter revenue declined 2% versus last year to $49.2 million. Foreign-exchange headwinds and timing of orders for military customers negatively impacted shipments in the quarter. This was offset by growth in mobile products and our new unmanned aerial systems or UAS line of business. The UAS line of business was created in the second half of the year to enable commercially drones powerful thermal imaging solutions with the introduction of the FLIR view and the more recent announcement of our strategic collaboration with drone industry leader, DJI, and our first collaborative products is in the use XT, we are well underway to building this market. OEM and emerging operating margins declined 15% due to approximately $5 million in nonrecurring expenses related to the move to our new facility in semiconductor of the boundary in Santa Barbara. This new facility bring significant improvements to our production operations without a material increase in the business expense rate. OEM and emerging backlog grew nearly $25 million or 22% in the quarter as we received a significant amount of orders for our proved military quarters. 
Turning to Slide 13. Maritime segment revenues were $36 million, which were 10% below the prior year. Excluding the significant exposure Maritime house to the strong U.S. dollar revenue was down 4%. Maritime operating income was $600,000 in the quarter, down 800,000 from Q4 2014. Profitability was negatively impacted by both currency and competitive pricing pressures. 
In January, Raymarine introduced the first recreational class maritime saw additional radar to feature CHIRP technology, the one-time wireless sure radar. CHIRP is our reader technology that uses multiple compressed radar pulses and when combined with the FLIR's exclusive BTX separation technology the result is unsurpassed radar resolution. The compact size and weight of the quantum CHIRP sets a new standard for a solid-state radar and Wi-Fi connectivity for ease of installation. 
On Slide 14, you will see the Detection segment fourth quarter summary. Revenue was $34.7 million, which was up 32% over the prior year. The DR SKO program saw an uptick in deliveries, which help drive 52% revenue growth for the program while revenue from detections products grew 27% year-over-year. Detection operating profit in your the doubles, driven by product mix and product cost reduction. Detection backlog finished the year at $82 million. During Q4, we received another order from the U.S. Department of Defense for our DR SKO system, this 1 totaling $50 million for delivery through May 2017. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Detection's radiations line of business introduced the identifying R200. The R200 represents a new price point of latitude line of products and extending our reach in the wearable detector market while differentiating back part pride up with a rest radiological resolution and high identification possibilities. That concludes my summary of the fourth quarter. I'll now pass the call back over to Andy."

Profits and cash flow came in strong despite our modest top line growth. Backlog rose to levels not seen since 2008 when military combat operations were much higher than they are today. 
Looking back on 2015, we saw a 6% revenue growth rate, though it was masked by the stronger dollar. I'm very encouraged by the continued product innovation that we exhibited and introducing dozens of new products, many of which pushed new limits of performance and value. We leveraged our Lepton micro camera cord to create 8 nuclear branded products, that enable a much wider audience of users and directly address our barriers of price and awareness. During the year, we completed a companywide restructuring that has proven very beneficial to our operating efficiency and profitability. We made a meaningful acquisition that we intend to leverage to improve margins, expand our product suite and strengthen our continued growth in the video security space. And we executed on our commitment to investing in our marketing capabilities, which has resulted in tremendous growth and nearly every metric we use to track awareness and the power of our brands.

The general U.S. DoD environment for us, obviously has been improving, with a budget in place, I would say the procurement sentiment there is improving. And we saw a nice uptick in U.S. orders in Q4. The issue at this point though that's difficult to determine is how much of that was pent-up demand versus how much of it is run rate demand. As you know, our business is short cycle business. I think that the products that we have there are quite relevant to what's going on in the world today. The big wild card for us also for us, I would say, is the Middle Eastern business. That business more than the bookings and revenue standpoint for 2015 was down versus 2014. But it's an area that has tremendous amount of opportunity for us. Particularly if you look at our products in the area of border patrol and deployable systems and our Surveillance system. We are a leader there.

Instruments, we continue to increase the percentage of Lepton-based products that are being sold in Instruments. We actually were up to a little bit north of 60% of the total unit volume that we shipped in Q4, where Lepton-based products in Instruments. That said, we continue to build out the value add around instruments. So we launch that T1K during Q4 and began shipments of that very late in the quarter. So it didn't really have a big impact on revenue, but we'll start to see that will lead in Q1. In terms of regional performance in instruments, it's a story similar to the rest of the business, the Latin America region has been down very sharply. Europe has also been soft for us. We saw a nice growth come out of China and expect that to continue there. We've made investments in our distribution organization in China and have a very strong grandparent demand continues to be strong in China. And we also instruments, if we look at the front end of the business, saw a growth in Q4 and in the U.S. market and instruments. The other thing that's an opportunity and relative to supporting the margins and Instruments is the optical gas imaging business. That was soft for most of the year of 2015. We started to see a little bit of an uptick towards the end of the 2015. In the OGI business, and we've got a couple of regulations that are coming through with the EPA and EVM that will support the use of optical gas imaging technologies from a regulatory standpoint. So the draft regulations on that, that have been released and the margins on those products are quite good. I guess I'll just close at a last point is that the margins that we saw in Q4 probably aren't towards the peak of what we will see from that group, but anything that they are sustainable."

I think as the industrialization matures there, the concept of preventive maintenance is continuing to gain traction. We're moving out of applications, like the utility market which has historically been very strong for us into factories and industrial and process control applications in there. As I mentioned in the previous comments, we've invested fairly strongly in distribution and marketing capability in China. So during the course of 2015, we had a shift of resources from slower growth in EMEA and Latin America regions into China and are starting to see those investments pay off. Moving over to the oil and gas industry, certainly the oil prices have affected overall procurements for that segment with further optical gas imaging and our midrange instruments credits that are used for predictive. That said though, again, as I mentioned, previous comments, the draft regulations that are out from BPM and they have BOM going to favor the use of optical gas imaging. And I would expect in 2016 that we should see an uptick there, plus if you look at what's going on in the ELISA canyon with the natural gas leak there, most of the footage that's been shown a national TV are coming from our cameras illustrating the benefits of natural gas imaging for natural gas applications."

So I would say that the weakness that we're seeing in the commercial side is hitting both instruments and maritime, really looking at the quarter, Maritime was down more than instruments was. Instruments was actually flat to up slightly on a currency adjusted basis in Q4. The issue in the Instruments Bill would be around Europe, Europe and Latin America are the 2 markets that were soft from a bookings and revenue standpoint for us. As I've  mentioned previously, our response to that is two-fold. Number 1, shifting of resources both on the selling and marketing front out of slow growth markets into higher growth markets and the other issue is the continued cadence of the introduction of new products there. We've had a slew of I mentioned, 8 new Lepton products, most of those were in the instruments segment. They're getting very good traction in the markets. Just recently, Grainger national convention this week, earlier this week, and we were showing those product there and getting very strong interest from them. So I think that we're going to see unit volumes continue to grow in the Instruments business. And we believe that as we create these new categories for low-cost IGM basis, we're creating new in the process and those are people that are likely to move up the value latter over time as they see the value and efficacy that comes from thermal imaging."

I think that the technologies and concepts of intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, chemical detection are quite I think relevant today. And we're very well-positioned. And I think that our longer-term strategy of CDMQ, Commercially Developed military qualified, rapid response capability, the focus of the business to be more oriented towards a system solution-oriented business rather than just selling cameras. It's something that's quite relevant today and particularly as we look at opportunities in places like the Middle East, where some of the unrest there is driving demand for more control, security and surveillance-oriented solutions. As we add other capabilities, thinks like DVTEL, things like video analytics and more integrated solutions, our offerings become more attractive.

Book-to-bill drop a little below 1.0 in Q4, but as Tom mentioned in his comments, we saw a very nice growth in bookings.

We don't intend to -- what our flip of the pedal of the gas here in terms of the development of new products. One of the things that's nice about what we're doing in the business is to create system cores that aren't easy to integrate across the business. I mean, Lepton is a praise for an example. It's a product that someone can take and turn into a system very, very quickly. And this is an something that we've spoken again on the this call, but I think is an important vector for any OEM and emerging business, that in terms of driving the growth of Lepton outside of theory and our own organic lead develop products, we've been making Lepton available through a number of component suppliers. And we've been having a number of developer and hacker events to drive the overall awareness of the capabilities associated with Lepton and bring new OEMs into the fold with the product. And one of the key drivers in terms of enabling that capabilities that it's a system that's very easy to integrate. This is something that you can basically get power in an video out, if you use that conventional CMOS camera, interfaces, so it's very easy for someone who's familiar with working with conventional visible cameras to be also be able to move into the thermal domain with Lepton. So that plays a benefit back into our own business as well. And that's why you see it Lepton being enabled in our different segments. I mentioned this in previous calls, but this will certainly be a theme in 2016 but you'll see Lepton expand beyond the instrument segment, where there's been a fairly large focus. We also have new chorus plans for the business. Outside of Lepton. So there are other errors of this higher resolution products and cool products will be launched during the 2016 from our cores and components group that will ultimately have system-level products that will be designed around those cores from our other segments."

I'll start the review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $438 million, up 1% from the prior year, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $0.51, which included a gain on an investment, restructuring charges and discrete tax charges. Adjusting for these items, earnings per share were $0.47 compared to an adjusted $0.45 in Q4 of 2014. 
Fourth quarter operating income, excluding restructuring charges, was $94 million, up 6% over the prior year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter grew 25% year-over-year. As a result of the strong order intake in Q4 in our government-oriented segments, we finished the year with total 12-month order backlog of $604 million, representing 6% growth over the end of the third quarter and the highest level of backlog since 2008, when our U.S. Military business was very strong due to the RAID and G-BOSS programs. In the quarter, we acquired DVTEL, which adds advanced security video management and video analytics solution to expand FLIR's Security business in the enterprise market. The impact of this transaction was not meaningful to our operating results for the quarter. 
Slide 4 shows a summary of the full year, where constant currency revenue growth of 6% help drive 10% growth and adjusted earnings per share as we realize significant operating leverage on our restructured cost basis.
Cash generation improved significantly with full year operating cash flow growing 22% over 2014 as better utilization of working capital added to the growth in net income. Backlog trends have been quite positive, growing at 11% compound rate over the past 2 years. 
During 2015, we introduced over 20 new product platforms across our 6 segments. 8 of those products included a revolutionary Lepton micro camera core, creating new product categories and enabling groundbreaking new price points and capabilities such as IGM or infrared guided measurement through a broader set of customers.
On Slide 5, you'll see our initial outlook for 2016. As a result of expected softness in many of our European markets and a higher expected effective tax rate for the year, we expect revenues to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of between 3% and 9% when compared to the 2015 results, after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
We expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 26%, excluding any future discrete items, increasing due to changes in effective foreign tax rates. While our government-oriented business segments had a strong order flow in Q4, we continue to be cautious on this front as our traditionally short cycle business can be event-driven and is difficult to forecast.
Additionally, for the first quarter of 2016, we expect overall margins to be lower than the first quarter of 2015 due to product mix, a difficult comparable related to shipments to one Middle Eastern customer in the first quarter of 2015 and the nonreoccurrence of corporate expense credits we received.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on March 4 to shareholders of record as of February 19. This represents a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.11 in 2015. 
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review fourth quarter financial results. Amit?"

Good morning. The following discussion on pretax operating results for the fourth quarter and full year excludes restructuring expenses, which totaled $0.3 million and $1.4 million in 2015, and $1 million and $17 million in 2014, respectively. 
On Slide 6, you'll see our fourth quarter financial results. Despite currency headwinds, our revenue, operating income, operating margins, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $438 million, an increase of 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our Security and Detection segments reported increases of 21% and 32%, respectively, in year-over-year revenue. 
Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets and Maritime segments, reported year-over-year declines of 5%, 5%, 2% and 10%, respectively. As we've noted earlier in the year, our Instruments and Maritime segments are most heavily impacted by currency fluctuations. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and OEM & Emerging Markets segment revenues would have been flat year-over-year and Maritime would have shown a year-over-year decline of 4%, primarily due to a change in distribution channel and inventory reductions at a large retailer at year-end. Overall revenue would have shown a year-over-year increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. 
Recently, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 30%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 4%, 10% and 23%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. Government increased by about $18 million or 22% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 19% in 2014. Consolidated fourth quarter gross margin was 47%, a 2 percentage point decrease compared to last year, primarily driven by weakness in the OEM & Emerging Markets segment related to the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities to improve future efficiencies as well as overall changes in segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates.
Operating income and margin improved year-over-year despite adverse currency effect. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 21%. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a nonoperating after-tax gain of approximately $12.7 million related to the sale of an investment that we had in a private technology company. We also reported a tax expense of $34.6 million, which was $24.5 million higher than 2014, primarily due to $7.4 million of unfavorable discrete tax items compared to prior year, when we benefited from the release of approximately $9.4 million of tax reserves. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $70.2 million, a slight decrease from last year and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.51 for both years. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the discrete tax items in the fourth quarter of both years and the current year after-tax investment gain, adjusted net income was $65 million compared to $64.1 million in 2014, and adjusted EPS was $0.47 in 2015 compared to $0.45 in 2014.
We closed the year with cash of $472.8 million, a decrease of $52.6 million during the quarter. Strong operating cash flow was deployed towards the investing and financing activities to improve shareholder value, including the acquisition of DVTEL that used $92 million of cash in the quarter. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter were $78.3 million or 112% of quarterly net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. In the quarter, we improved our cash conversion cycle by almost 20 days. 
We had capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the fourth quarter and returned $15.2 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We also spent $29.8 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our stock during the quarter under the 2-year 15 million share repurchase program that we announced in February of last year.
On Slide 7, you'll see our 2015 full year financial results. Similar to the fourth quarter, despite the headwinds, our full year revenue, operating income, operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. 
For 2015, our revenue was $1,557,000,000, an increase of 2% compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, full year revenue would have been up approximately 6% year-over-year. Our Security and Detection segments reported year-over-year revenue increases of 27% and 34%, respectively. Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets and Maritime segments reported year-over-year declines of 3%, 2%, 6% and 8%, respectively. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and Maritime segments would have shown year-over-year revenue improvement of 5% and 2%, respectively.
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 12%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 11%, 3% and 9%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. government were flat compared with 2014 and represented 20% of total revenue, consistent with last year. 
Full year gross margin decreased marginally compared to last year, explained by overall changes and segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates. 2015 operating income and margin improved year-over-year, despite adverse currency effects. Our adjusted full year operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 20%. 
For the full year, our as reported tax rate was 21% compared to 20% in 2014. Adjusting for the restructuring charges, investment gain in discrete tax items, our 2015 tax rate was 23% compared to 24% in 2014. For the full year 2015, net income was $241.7 million, representing a 21% increase over 2014. EPS of $1.72 for the full year 2015 compared to $1.39, a 24% increase year-over-year. Excluding restructuring charges, the investment gain and discrete tax items for both years, adjusted net income was $220 million compared to $203.8 million in 2014, an 8% improvement. And adjusted EPS was $1.56 in 2015 compared to $1.42 in 2014, a 10% improvement. 
For the full year, our operating cash flow was $275.8 million or 114% of full year net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. We had capital expenditures of $68.2 million in 2015 and returned $61.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends.
We also spent $123.2 million to repurchase a little more than 4 million shares during the year. In terms of capital deployment over the long-term, we plan to continue our organic investments, spending about 3% to 4% of revenue on capital expenditures and 8% to 10% of revenue on R&D. We intend to deploy 100% of our free cash flow going forward, maintaining a dividend payout ratio of about 25% to 30% of net income and using the remainder to fund M&A and share repurchases, depending on available opportunities and expected returns.
This concludes the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our segment operating results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 4% and operating margin declined 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2014 excluding restructuring charges, due primarily to cost incurred in the consolidation of our 4 primary OEM & Emerging production and office buildings into a single multipurpose facility. We expect this facility consolidation to result in greater operating efficiency for the business. 
Moving to Slide 9, during the fourth quarter, Surveillance segment revenue declined 5% year-over-year to $150.7 million. In the prior year, we had significant amount of revenue coming out of our integrated systems line of business related to COSFPS system deliveries and the completion of a large order to a Middle Eastern customer. The unfavorable impact of this comparison offsets strength in our airborne, maritime and manned portable lines of business. 
Surveillance segment operating income of $49.2 million increased 2% versus the prior year when excluding restructuring expenses. This represents a 220 basis point increase in operating margin, driven by reduced operating expenses. Surveillance backlog reduced slightly from Q3 to $309 million. Bookings of $142 million resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9x, and bookings growth of 28% over the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Full year 2015 bookings of $533 million represented our highest order flow since 2010 when the rate in G-BOSS programs [indiscernible]. In January, Surveillance introduced our newest Personal Vision Systems product, the Scout TK, handheld thermal monocular. Targeted at outdoor enthusiasts, the Scout TK utilizes an advanced version of our Lepton 3 core and opens a new category in the market with its retail price of $599.
Turning to Slide 10. The Instruments segment saw a fourth quarter revenue decline of 5% compared to the prior year to $98.6 million. Excluding the effect of the stronger dollar, Instruments revenue was flat with the prior year. Test & Measurement and Science products performed well, while the premium portion of our Building & Predictive Maintenance products saw declines, in part due to the delayed shipment of our new flagship T1K product until late in the quarter. 
Operating margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, increased 100 basis points to 35% and was within 20 basis points of the peak operating margins achieved in Q4 2012, as reduced operating expenses helped offset the top line softness. Also in January, the Instruments segment introduced their newest value to price handheld thermal spot camera, the TG-130 at the Consumer Electronics Show. Professionals and homeowners can use the TG-130 to pinpoint window and door drafts, missing insulation, water damage and a multitude of other home and structural related problems. Based on our Lepton dual micro core, the new handheld features a revolutionary price point of $249. 
On Slide 11, you'll see our Security segment operating results. Strong revenue growth continued in the segment, up 21% year-over-year, reaching $68.4 million. Lorex-branded product and FLIR Residential offerings drove top line growth that was dampened by comparably soft shipment of cooled thermal systems as Q4 of 2014 saw significant shipments of these products to a Middle Eastern customer. Security operating profit was $9.2 million with margins declining 480 basis points, primarily driven by reduced gross margins due to product mix as well as increased marketing spend. 
As Andy mentioned, we acquired DVTEL at the end of November, which strengthens FLIR security's presence in the enterprise portion of the security market. This acquisition provides us with significant software capabilities, including sophisticated video analytics and robust video management systems or VMS. 
VMS systems are the central user interface for our video security system, and are often the first decision an enterprise customer will make when defining an integrated video security solution. The DVTEL Latitude VMS system will be integrated into the FLIR command and control software suite and will form the backbone of the FLIR integrated video surveillance solutions. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 12. OEM & Emerging's fourth quarter revenue declined 2% versus last year to $49.2 million. Foreign exchange headwinds and timing of orders for military customers negatively impacted shipments in the quarter. This was offset by growth in mobile products and our new unmanned aerial systems or UAS line of business. The UAS line of business was created in the second half of the year to enable commercial and consumer drones with powerful thermal imaging solutions with the introduction of the FLIR Vue and the more recent announcement of our strategic collaboration with drone industry leader, DJI, and our first collaborative product is Zenmuse XT. We are well on our way to building this market. OEM & Emerging operating margins declined 15% due to approximately $5 million in nonrecurring expenses related to the move to our new facility in semiconductor boundary in Santa Barbara. This new facility brings significant improvements to our production operations without a material increase in the business expense rate. OEM & Emerging backlog grew nearly $25 million or 22% in the quarter as we received significant amounts of orders for our pooled military corps. 
Turning to Slide 13. Maritime segment revenues were $36 million, which were 10% below the prior year. Excluding the significant exposure Maritime has with the strong U.S. dollar, revenue was down 4%. Maritime operating income was $600,000 in the quarter, down 800,000 from Q4 of 2014. Profitability was negatively impacted by both currency and competitive pricing pressures. 
In January, Raymarine introduced the first recreational class maritime solid state digital radar to feature CHIRP technology, the Quantum Wireless CHIRP Radar. CHIRP is a radar technology that uses multiple compressed radar pulses and when combined with FLIR's exclusive ATX target separation technology, the result is unsurpassed radar resolution. The compact size and weight of the Quantum CHIRP sets a new standard for solid state radars and features Wi-Fi connectivity for ease of installation. 
On Slide 14, you will see the Detection segments fourth quarter summary. Revenue was $34.7 million, which was up 32% over the prior year. The DR SKO program saw an uptick in deliveries, which helped drive 52% revenue growth for the program, while revenue from detections products grew 27% year-over-year. Detection operating profit nearly doubled, driven by product mix and product cost reductions. Detection backlog finished the year at $82 million. During Q4, we received another order from the U.S. Department of Defense for our DR SKO system, this one totaling $50 million for delivery through May 2017. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Detection's radiation line of business introduced the IdentiFINDER R200. The R200 represents a new price point in our radiation line of products, extending our reach into the wearable detector market while differentiating the product with high radiological resolution and identification capabilities. 
That concludes my summary of the segments fourth quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy."

Profits and cash flow came in strong despite our modest top line growth. Backlog rose to levels not seen since 2008 when military combat operations were much higher than they are today. 
Looking back on 2015, we saw a 6% revenue growth rate, though it was masked by the stronger dollar. I am very encouraged by the continued product innovation that we exhibited and introducing dozens of new products, many of which pushed new limits of performance and value. We leveraged our Lepton micro camera core to create 8 new FLIR branded products, that enable a much wider audience of users and directly address our barriers of price and awareness. 
During the year, we completed a company-wide restructuring that has proven very beneficial to our operating efficiency and profitability. We made a meaningful acquisition that we intend to leverage to improve margins, expand our product suite and strengthen our continued growth in the video security space. And we executed on our commitment to investing in our marketing capabilities, which has resulted in tremendous growth in nearly every metric we use to track awareness and the power of our brand. We're looking forward to 2016 as we continue with the quest to become the world's sixth sense.
That concludes our comments on the fourth quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open up the call for your questions."

And we saw a nice uptick in U.S. orders in Q4. The issue at this point, though, that's difficult to determine is how much of that was pent-up demand versus how much of it is run rate demand. As you know, our business is a short cycle business. I think that the products that we have there are quite relevant to what's going on in the world today. The big wild card for us also, I would say, is the Middle Eastern business. That business both on bookings and revenue standpoint for 2015 was down versus 2014, but it's an area that has tremendous amount of opportunity for us. Particularly if you look at our products in the area of border patrol and deployable systems and our Surveillance system, we're a leader there. We've got CDMQ product that we can respond with rather quickly to demand. And I see that as really being the wild card for us in 2016, but it's also an area that we have limited visibility.

Instruments, we continue to increase the percentage of Lepton-based product that are being sold in Instruments. We actually were up to a little bit north of 60% of the total unit volume that we shipped in Q4 were Lepton-based products in Instruments. That said, we continue to build out the value-add around Instruments. So we launched that T1K during Q4 and began shipments of that very late in the quarter. So it didn't really have a big impact on revenue, but we'll start to see that roll in, in Q1. In terms of regional performance in Instruments, it's a story similar to the rest of the business, the Latin America region has been down fairly sharply. Europe has also been soft for us. We saw a nice growth come out of China and expect that to continue there. We've made investments in our distribution organization in China and have a very strong brand there and demand continues to be strong in China. And we also -- Instruments, if we look at the front end of the business, saw growth in Q4 in the U.S. market in Instruments. The other thing that's an opportunity and relative to supporting the margins in Instruments is the Optical Gas Imaging business. That was soft for most of the year of 2015. We started to see a little bit of an uptick towards the end of 2015. In the OGI business, and we've got a couple of regulations that are coming through from the EPA and the BLM that will support the use of Optical Gas Imaging technologies from a regulatory standpoint, so the draft regulations on that, that have been released and the margins on those products are quite good. I guess I'd disclose that the last point is that the margins which we saw in Q4 probably aren't towards the peak of what we will see from that group, but I think that they are sustainable."

As I mentioned in the previous comments, we've invested fairly strongly in distribution and marketing capability in China. So during the course of 2015, we had a shift of resources from slower growth in EMEA and Latin America regions into China and we're starting to see those investments pay off. Moving over to the oil and gas industry, certainly, low oil prices have affected overall procurements from that segment, both in our Optical Gas Imaging and then our midrange instruments products that are used for predictive/preventive maintenance. That said though, again, as I mentioned on the previous comments, the draft regulations that are out from EPA and the BLM are going to favor the use of Optical Gas Imaging.

Really looking at the quarter, Maritime was down more than Instruments was. Instruments was actually flat to up slightly on a currency adjusted basis in Q4. The issue in the Instruments, though, would be around Europe. Europe and Latin America are the 2 markets that were soft from a bookings and revenue standpoint for us. As I mentioned previously, our response to that is twofold. Number one, shifting of resources, both on the selling and marketing front out of slow growth markets into higher growth markets and the other issue is the continued cadence of the introduction of new products there. We've had a slew of, I mentioned, 8 new Lepton products, most of those were in the Instruments segment. They're getting very good traction in the market. I was just recently at Grainger's national convention this week, earlier this week, and we were showing those product there and getting very strong interest from them. So I think that we're going to see unit volumes continue to grow in the Instruments business.

I think the overall economy, sure, will stimulate the -- both sales. The low gas pricing should be favorable. So those are some tailwinds that help. What's happening is that aggressive price. We have not been -- it's also the largest growing at this retail segment, this fish finding. It's an area we -- Raymarine. When we brought it, it was not participating. We created a product line called the Dragonfly. It's been well received. We're expanding that product line, so we should see some more growth there. The main theme, though, is creating these differentiated offerings so that we can capture share. And that's what we've been trying to do. And our offerings always have something a little bit special into them, as you look at the Dragonfly and its capabilities. Andy mentioned the world-class autopilot. The new CHIRP Radar is a solid state, lowest power, lightest weight, wireless for ease of installation. That's what's going to drive our growth and probably -- hopefully, just proportionate to the overall growth of the market. But that's how I would view that."

We think that the economic environment -- that the Instruments and Maritime probably have the biggest exposure to the economic environment at this point. And then as previously mentioned, the wild card here is really Surveillance, based on what we see in terms of world events. Again, we're very well positioned there. I think that the technologies of -- and concepts of intelligent surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, chemical detection, I think, are quite relevant today. And we're very well positioned. And I think that our longer-term strategy of CDMQ, Commercially Developed Military Qualified, rapid response capability, the focus of the business to be more oriented towards a system solution-oriented business rather than just selling cameras. It's something that's quite relevant today, and particularly as we look at opportunities in places like the Middle East, where some of the unrest there is driving demand for border control, security and surveillance-oriented solutions. As we add capability, things like DVTEL, things like video analytics and more integrated solutions, our offerings become more attractive.

We had a nice backlog build in Q4. We had book to bill in Q2 of 1.2, book to bill in Q3 of 1.2 on that business. Book to bill dropped a little bit below 1.0 in Q4, but as Tom mentioned in his comments, we saw a very nice growth in bookings. The issue that we have in that business, though, again, is determining how much of that was pent-up demand versus future run rate. As I mentioned before, the business is very well positioned at this point. I would say, the overall inquiry level in that business has had an uptick, and we've got some very nice irons in the fire for a medium term business with the U.S. DoD, but not yet decided.

The -- we've -- in -- late in 2015, we basically initiated 2 vectors into the commercial space. One of them was to create a line of products of our own that have the appropriate capabilities and price points that we think will -- that will help us gain quick inroads into the commercial space. And then importantly, the relationship, the strategic collaboration we created with DJI. We see a tremendous amount of opportunity that is going to come out of this. With the relationship with DJI, the Zenmuse XT compatible with both their Inspire and their Matrice  airframes, which the Inspire, in particular, is kind of the world leading airframe in terms of volume. And as you point out, as the commercial applications start to emerge, nighttime flying -- some regulatory issues around nighttime flying currently. But as those things start to resolve over time -- and importantly, in a lot of other vertical applications, not necessarily related to nighttime flying, but things like agricultural, building inspection, search and rescue, fire fighting, all of these things have strong value -- thermal brings a very, very strong value proposition to these phases.

I just want to mention a couple of things about FLIR FX and then I'll ask Travis perhaps to comment a little bit on it as well. But as he mentioned, FLIR FX has some unique features, RapidRecap being one of them that has been well-received by the market. It was really our first shot out of the cannon in the residential and consumer space. So certainly, we have things in the product pipeline that we will refine and broaden that product offering in 2016. The other issue is the fact that we've got the FLIR 1 in Apple channel. So it's in Apple stores. We have the outdoor version of the product in the Apple retail environment at this point and that's been gaining nice traction there. I think it's one of the nice nuances of the product is that we do offer an outdoor capability, which is fairly unique, and when you cover -- when you couple that outdoor capability together with a RapidRecap feature, it's really a pretty useful value proposition. Ultimately, though, that marketplace has the opportunity for the injection of low-cost thermal to improve the accuracy of detection, and we see it as a fairly rich space.

It's over 100, so it's -- particularly when you look in the Security segment, there are a lot of products that get launch there. But the -- I think the take home point was when we hvae a product platform and then there is a family tree of products that come off of that, that's what's important in terms of driving growth from a new product standpoint. We don't intend to -- but -- our foot off the pedal over the gas here in terms of the development of new products. One of the things that's nice about what we're doing in the business is to create system cores that are easy to integrate across the business. I mean, Lepton is a prime example. It's a product that someone can take and turn into a system very, very quickly. And this isn't something that we've spoken about yet on this call, but I think it's an important vector for the OEM & Emerging business. That in terms of driving the growth of Lepton outside of FLIR and our own organically developed products, we've been making Lepton available through a number of component suppliers. And we've been having a number of developer and hacker events to drive the overall awareness of the capabilities associated with Lepton and bring new OEMs into the fold of the product. And one of the key drivers in terms of enabling that capability is that it's a system that is very easy to integrate. This is something that you can basically get power in and video out, use as conventional CMOS camera interfaces. So it's very easy for someone who is familiar with -- working with conventional visible cameras to be able to also move into the thermal domain with Lepton. So that plays a benefit back into our own business as well. And that's why you see it -- Lepton being enabled in our different segments. I mentioned this in previous calls, but this will certainly be a theme in 2016 that you'll see Lepton expand beyond the Instrument segment, where there's been a fairly large focus. We also have new course planned for the business outside of Lepton. So there are other areas of business. Higher resolution products and cooled products will be launched during 2016 from our cores and components group that will ultimately have system-level products that will be designed around those cores from our other segments."

With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; Chief of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Shane Harrison. 
I'll start the review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $438 million, up 1% from the prior year, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $0.51, which included a gain on an investment, restructuring charges and discrete tax charges. Adjusting for these items, earnings per share were $0.47 compared to an adjusted $0.45 in Q4 of 2014. 
Fourth quarter operating income, excluding restructuring charges, was $94 million, up 6% over the prior year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter grew 25% year-over-year. As a result of the strong order intake in Q4 in our government-oriented segments, we finished the year with total 12-month order backlog of $604 million, representing 6% growth over the end of the third quarter and the highest level of backlog since 2008, when our U.S. Military business was very strong due to the RAID and G-BOSS programs. In the quarter, we acquired DVTEL, which adds advanced security video management and video analytics solution to expand FLIR's Security business in the enterprise market. The impact of this transaction was not meaningful to our operating results for the quarter. 
Slide 4 shows a summary of the full year, where constant currency revenue growth of 6% helped drive 10% growth in adjusted earnings per share as we realized significant operating leverage on our restructured cost basis.
Cash generation improved significantly, with full year operating cash flow growing 22% over 2014 as better utilization of working capital added to the growth in net income. Backlog trends have been quite positive, growing at an 11% compound rate over the past 2 years. 
During 2015, we introduced over 20 new product platforms across our 6 segments. Eight of those products included our revolutionary Lepton micro camera core, creating new product categories and enabling groundbreaking new price points and capabilities such as IGM, or infrared guided measurement, to a broader set of customers.
On Slide 5, you'll see our initial outlook for 2016. As a result of expected softness in many of our European markets and a higher expected effective tax rate for the year, we expect revenues to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of between 3% and 9% when compared to the 2015 results, after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
We expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 26%, excluding any future discrete items, increasing due to changes in effective foreign tax rates. While our government-oriented business segments had a strong order flow in Q4, we continue to be cautious on this front, as our traditionally short cycle business can be event driven and is difficult to forecast.
Additionally, for the first quarter of 2016, we expect overall margins to be lower than the first quarter of 2015 due to product mix, a difficult comparable related to shipments to one Middle Eastern customer in the first quarter of 2015 and the nonreoccurrence of corporate expense credits we received.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on March 4 to shareholders of record as of February 19. This represents a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.11 in 2015. 
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review fourth quarter financial results. Amit?"

The following discussion on pretax operating results for the fourth quarter and full year excludes restructuring expenses, which totaled $0.3 million and $1.4 million in 2015, and $1 million and $17 million in 2014, respectivel",1130,"Thanks, Andy. Good morning. The following discussion on pretax operating results for the fourth quarter and full year excludes restructuring expenses, which totaled $0.3 million and $1.4 million in 2015, and $1 million and $17 million in 2014, respectively. 
On Slide 6, you'll see our fourth quarter financial results. Despite currency headwinds, our revenue, operating income, operating margins, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $438 million, an increase of 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our Security and Detection segments reported increases of 21% and 32%, respectively, in year-over-year revenue. 
Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets and Maritime segments reported year-over-year declines of 5%, 5%, 2% and 10%, respectively. As we've noted earlier in the year, our Instruments and Maritime segments are most heavily impacted by currency fluctuations. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and OEM & Emerging Markets segment revenues would have been flat year-over-year, and Maritime would have shown a year-over-year decline of 4%, primarily due to a change in distribution channels and inventory reductions at a large retailer at year-end. Overall revenue would have shown a year-over-year increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. 
Recently, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 30%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 4%, 10% and 23%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. Government increased by about $18 million or 22% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 19% in 2014. Consolidated fourth quarter gross margin was 47%, a 2 percentage point decrease compared to last year, primarily driven by weakness in the OEM & Emerging Markets segment related to the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities to improve future efficiencies, as well as overall changes in segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates.
Operating income and margin improved year-over-year despite adverse currency effects. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 21%. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a nonoperating after-tax gain of approximately $12.7 million related to the sale of an investment that we had in a private technology company. We also reported a tax expense of $34.6 million, which was $24.5 million higher than 2014, primarily due to $7.4 million of unfavorable discrete tax items compared to prior year, when we benefited from the release of approximately $9.4 million of tax reserves. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $70.2 million, a slight decrease from last year, and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.51 for both years. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the discrete tax items in the fourth quarter of both years and the current year after-tax investment gain, adjusted net income was $65 million compared to $64.1 million in 2014, and adjusted EPS was $0.47 in 2015 compared to $0.45 in 2014.
We closed the year with cash of $472.8 million, a decrease of $52.6 million during the quarter. Our strong operating cash flow was deployed towards investing and financing activities to improve shareholder value, including the acquisition of DVTEL that used $92 million of cash in the quarter. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter were $78.3 million or 112% of quarterly net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. In the quarter, we improved our cash conversion cycle by almost 20 days. 
We had capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the fourth quarter and returned $15.2 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We also spent $29.8 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our stock during the quarter under the 2-year 15 million share repurchase program that we announced in February of last year.
On Slide 7, you'll see our 2015 full year financial results. Similar to the fourth quarter, despite the headwinds, our full year revenue, operating income, operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. 
For 2015, our revenue was $1,557,000,000, an increase of 2% compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, full year revenue would have been up approximately 6% year-over-year. Our Security and Detection segments reported year-over-year revenue increases of 27% and 34%, respectively. Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets and Maritime segments reported year-over-year declines of 3%, 2%, 6% and 8%, respectively. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and Maritime segments would have shown year-over-year revenue improvement of 5% and 2%, respectively.
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 12%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 11%, 3% and 9%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. government were flat compared with 2014 and represented 20% of total revenue, consistent with last year. 
Full year gross margin decreased marginally compared to last year, explained by overall changes in segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates. 2015 operating income and margin improved year-over-year, despite adverse currency effects. Our adjusted full year operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 20%. 
For the full year, our as reported tax rate was 21% compared to 20% in 2014. Adjusting for the restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items, our 2015 tax rate was 23% compared to 24% in 2014. For the full year of 2015, net income was $241.7 million, representing a 21% increase over 2014. EPS of $1.72 for the full year 2015 compared to $1.39, a 24% increase year-over-year. Excluding restructuring charges, the investment gain and discrete tax items for both years, adjusted net income was $220 million compared to $203.8 million in 2014, an 8% improvement. And adjusted EPS was $1.56 in 2015 compared to $1.42 in 2014, a 10% improvement. 
For the full year, our operating cash flow was $275.8 million or 114% of full year net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. We had capital expenditures of $68.2 million in 2015 and returned $61.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends.
We also spent $123.2 million to repurchase a little more than 4 million shares during the year. In terms of capital deployment over the long-term, we plan to continue our organic investments, spending about 3% to 4% of revenue on capital expenditures and 8% to 10% of revenue on R&D. We intend to deploy 100% of our free cash flow going forward, maintaining a dividend payout ratio of about 25% to 30% of net income and using the remainder to fund M&A and share repurchases, depending on available opportunities and expected returns.
This concludes the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our segment operating results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 4%, and operating margin declined 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding restructuring charges, due primarily to costs incurred in the consolidation of our 4 primary OEM & Emerging production and office buildings into a single multipurpose facility. We expect this facility consolidation to result in greater operating efficiency for the business. 
Moving to Slide 9, during the fourth quarter, Surveillance segment revenue declined 5% year-over-year to $150.7 million. In the prior year, we had significant amount of revenue coming out of our Integrated Systems line of business related to COSFPS system deliveries and the completion of a large order to a Middle Eastern customer. The unfavorable impacts of this comparison offset strength in our airborne, Maritime and manned portable lines of business. 
Surveillance segment operating income of $49.2 million increased 2% versus the prior year when excluding restructuring expenses. This represents a 220 basis point increase in operating margin, driven by reduced operating expenses. Surveillance backlog reduced slightly from Q3 to $309 million. Bookings of $142 million resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9x and bookings growth of 28% over the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Full year 2015 bookings of $533 million represented our highest order flow since 2010, when the RAID and G-BOSS programs were active. In January, Surveillance introduced our newest Personal Vision Systems product, the Scout TK Handheld Thermal monocular. Targeted at outdoor enthusiasts, the Scout TK utilizes an advanced version of our Lepton 3 core and opens a new category in the market with its retail price of $599.
Turning to Slide 10. The Instruments segment saw a fourth quarter revenue decline of 5% compared to the prior year to $98.6 million. Excluding the effect of the stronger dollar, Instruments revenue was flat with the prior year. Test & Measurement and Science products performed well, while the premium portion of our Building & Predictive Maintenance products saw declines, in part due to the delayed shipment of our new flagship T1K product until late in the quarter. 
Operating margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, increased 100 basis points to 35% and was within 20 basis points of the peak operating margin achieved in Q4 2012, as reduced operating expenses helped offset the top line softness. Also in January, the Instruments segment introduced their newest value priced handheld thermal spot camera, the TG-130, at the Consumer Electronics Show. Professionals and homeowners can use the TG-130 to pinpoint window and door drafts, missing insulation, water damage and a multitude of other home and structural related problems. Based on our Lepton 2.0 micro core, the new handheld features a revolutionary price point of $249. 
On Slide 11, you'll see our Security segment operating results. Strong revenue growth continued in the segment, up 21% year-over-year, reaching $68.4 million. Lorex-branded product and FLIR Residential offerings drove top line growth that was dampened by comparably soft shipment of cooled thermal systems as Q4 of 2014 saw significant shipments of these products to a Middle Eastern customer. Security operating profit was $9.2 million with margin declining 480 basis points, primarily driven by reduced gross margins due to product mix as well as increased marketing spend. 
As Andy mentioned, we acquired DVTEL at the end of November, which strengthens FLIR Security's presence in the enterprise portion of the security market. This acquisition provides us with significant software capabilities, including sophisticated video analytics and a robust video management systems, or VMS. 
VMS systems are the central user interface for a video security system, and are often the first decision an enterprise customer will make when defining an integrated video security solution. The DVTEL Latitude VMS system will be integrated into the FLIR command and control software suite and will form the backbone of the FLIR integrated video surveillance solutions. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 12. OEM & Emerging fourth quarter revenue declined 2% versus last year to $49.2 million. Foreign exchange headwinds and timing of orders from military customers negatively impacted shipments in the quarter. This was offset by growth in mobile products and our new unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, line of business. The UAS line of business was created in the second half of the year to enable commercial and consumer drones with powerful thermal imaging solutions. With the introduction of the FLIR Vue and the more recent announcement of our strategic collaboration with drone industry leader, DJI, and our first collaborative product, the Zenmuse XT, we are well on our way to building this market. OEM & Emerging operating margins declined 15% due to approximately $5 million in nonrecurring expenses related to the move to our new facility and semiconductor foundry in Santa Barbara. This new facility brings significant improvements to our production operations without a material increase in the business expense rate. OEM & Emerging backlog grew nearly $25 million or 22% in the quarter as we received a significant amount of orders for our cooled military cores. 
Turning to Slide 13. Maritime segment revenues were $36 million, which were 10% below the prior year. Excluding the significant exposure Maritime has to the strong U.S. dollar, revenue was down 4%. Maritime operating income was $600,000 in the quarter, down $800,000 from Q4 of 2014. Profitability was negatively impacted by both currency and competitive pricing pressures. 
In January, Raymarine introduced the first recreational class maritime solid state digital radar to feature CHIRP technology, the Quantum Wireless CHIRP Radar. CHIRP is a radar technology that uses multiple compressed radar pulses, and when combined with FLIR's exclusive ATX target separation technology, the result is unsurpassed radar resolution. The compact size and weight of the Quantum CHIRP sets a new standard for solid state radars and features Wi-Fi connectivity for ease of installation. 
On Slide 14, you will see the Detection segment's fourth quarter summary. Revenue was $34.7 million, which was up 32% over the prior year. The DR SKO program saw an uptick in deliveries, which helped drive 52% revenue growth for the program, while revenue from Detections products grew 27% year-over-year. Detection operating profit nearly doubled, driven by product mix and product cost reductions. Detection backlog finished the year at $82 million. During Q4, we received another order from the U.S. Department of Defense for our DR SKO system, this one totaling $50 million, for delivery through May 2017. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Detection's radiation line of business introduced the IdentiFINDER R200. The R200 represents a new price point in our radiation line of products, extending our reach into the wearable detector market while differentiating the product with high radiological resolution and identification capabilities. 
That concludes my summary of the segments fourth quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy."

Profits and cash flow came in strong despite our modest top line growth. Backlog rose to levels not seen since 2008, when military combat operations were much higher than they are today. 
Looking back on 2015, we saw a 6% revenue growth rate, though it was masked by the stronger dollar. I am very encouraged by the continued product innovation that we exhibited in introducing dozens of new products, many of which pushed new limits of performance and value. We leveraged our Lepton micro camera core to create 8 new FLIR branded products that enable a much wider audience of users and directly address our barriers of price and awareness. 
During the year, we completed a company-wide restructuring that has proven very beneficial to our operating efficiency and profitability. We made a meaningful acquisition that we intend to leverage to improve margins and expand our product suite and strengthen our continued growth in the video security space. And we executed on our commitment to investing in our marketing capabilities, which has resulted in tremendous growth in nearly every metric we use to track awareness and the power of our brand. We're looking forward to 2016, as we continue with the quest to become the world's sixth sense.

If we talk about range of outcomes, the first thing is what the environment looks like. The general U.S. DoD environment for us, obviously, has been improving with a budget in place, the -- I would say the procurement sentiment there is improving. And we saw a nice uptick in U.S. orders in Q4. The issue at this point, though, that's difficult to determine is how much of that was pent-up demand versus how much of it is run rate demand. As you know, our business is a short cycle business. I think that the products that we have there are quite relevant to what's going on in the world today. The big wild card for us also I would say is the Middle Eastern business. That business, both on a bookings and revenue standpoint for 2015 was down versus 2014, but it's an area that has tremendous amount of opportunity for us. Particularly if you look at our products in the area of border patrol and deployable systems in our Surveillance segment, we're a leader there. We've got CDMQ product that we can respond with rather quickly to demand. And I see that as really being the wild card for us in 2016, but it's also an area that we have limited visibility. So at this point, we've taken, I think, an approach that is prudent in terms of forecasting the business based on what we see today."

Instruments, we continue to increase the percentage of Lepton-based product that are being sold in Instruments. We actually were up to a little bit north of 60% of the total unit volume that was shipped in Q4 were Lepton-based products, in Instruments. That said, we continue to build out the value adder around Instruments. So we launched the T1K during Q4 and began shipments of that very late in the quarter. So it didn't really have a big impact on revenue, but we'll start to see that roll in, in Q1. In terms of regional performance in Instruments, it's a story similar to the rest of the business. The Latin America region has been down fairly sharply. Europe has also been soft for us. We saw nice growth come out of China and expect that to continue there. We've made investments in our distribution organization in China and have a very strong brand there, and demand continues to be strong in China. And we also -- Instruments, if we look at the front end of the business, saw growth in Q4 in the U.S. market in Instruments. The other thing that's an opportunity and relative to supporting the margins in Instruments is the Optical Gas Imaging business. That was soft for most of the year of 2015. We started to see a little bit of an uptick towards the end of 2015 in the OGI business. And we've got a couple of regulations that are coming through from the EPA and the BLM that will support the use of Optical Gas Imaging technologies from a regulatory standpoint, so the draft regulations on that, that have been released, and the margins on those products are quite good. I guess I'd just close with the last point is that the margins that you saw in Q4 probably aren't towards the peak of what we will see from that group, but I think that they are sustainable."

I think as the industrialization matures there, the concept of predictive/preventive maintenance is continuing to gain traction. We're moving out of applications like the utility market, which has historically been very strong for us, into factories and industrial and process control applications there. As I mentioned in the previous comments, we've invested fairly strongly in distribution and marketing capability in China. So during the course of 2015, we had a shift of resources from the slower growth EMEA and Latin America regions into China, and we're starting to see those investments pay off. Moving over to the oil and gas industry, certainly, low oil prices have affected overall procurements from that segment, both in our Optical Gas Imaging and in our midrange Instruments products that are used for predictive/preventive maintenance. That said though, again, as I mentioned on the previous comments, the draft regulations that are out from the EPA and the BLM are going to favor the use of Optical Gas Imaging. And I would expect that in 2016 we should see an uptick there, plus if you look at what's going on in the Aliso Canyon with the natural gas leak there, most of the footage that's been shown on national TV are coming from our cameras, illustrating the benefits of Optical Gas Imaging for natural gas applications."

Really, looking at the quarter, Maritime was down more than Instruments was. Instruments was actually flat to up slightly on a currency adjusted basis in Q4. The issue in Instruments, though, would be around Europe. Europe and Latin America are the 2 markets that were soft from a bookings and revenue standpoint for us. As I'd mentioned previously, our response to that is twofold. Number one, a shifting of resources, both on the selling and marketing front out, of slow growth markets into higher growth markets, and the other issue is the continued cadence of the introduction of new products there. We've had a slew of -- I mentioned 8 new Lepton products. Most of those were in the Instruments segment. They're getting very good traction in the market. I was just recently at Grainger's national convention this week, earlier this week, and we were showing those products there and getting very strong interest from them. So I think that we're going to see unit volumes continue to grow in the Instruments business. And we believe that as we create these new categories for low-cost IGM basis, we're creating new thermographers in the process, and those are people that are likely to move up the value ladder over time as they see the value and the efficacy that comes from thermal imaging."

We have not been -- it's also the largest growing at this retail segment, this fish finding. It's an area we -- Raymarine, when we brought it, was not participating. We've created a new product line called the Dragonfly. It's been well received. We're expanding that product line, so we should see some more growth there. The main thing, though, is creating these differentiated offerings so that we can capture share. And that's what we've been trying to do. And our offerings always have something a little bit special into them, as you look at the Dragonfly and its capabilities. Andy mentioned the world-class autopilot. The new CHIRP Radar that's solid state, lowest power, lightest weight, wireless for ease of installation.

And I think that our longer-term strategy of CDMQ, Commercially Developed Military Qualified, rapid response capability, the focus of the business to be more oriented towards a system solution-oriented business rather than just selling cameras is something that's quite relevant today.

As we add capability, things like DVTEL, things like video analytics and more integrated solutions, our offerings become more attractive.

There's been some, I guess, public data out there. Maybe it's $40 million or $50 million. But if the Security segment grows, it continues to grow at probably the faster rate and we layer on DVTEL, that seemingly is going to drive the majority of growth. I mean, it seems like the other businesses could be sort of flattish. I mean, can you give us any color in terms of organic growth, or even if -- I know you kind of talked around some of the puts and takes on Surveillance, but do we finally see year-over-year growth in that segment, given the more recent booking trends?"

But generally, I think your observations are largely in line with what our forecasts are at this point. The -- in Surveillance, we're being fairly measured in terms of our expectations for that business going forward. Again, just based on the visibility that we have in the business. We had a nice backlog build in Q4. We had book-to-bill in Q2 of 1.2, book-to-bill in Q3 of 1.2 on that business. Book-to-bill dropped a little bit below 1.0 in Q4, but as Tom mentioned in his comments, we saw a very nice growth in bookings. The issue that we have in that business, though, again, is determining how much of that was pent-up demand versus future run rate. As I mentioned before, the business is very well positioned at this point. I would say the overall inquiry level in that business has had an uptick, and we've got some very nice irons in the fire for a medium-term business with the U.S. DoD, but not yet decided. So we're taking, I think, a prudent view of that business, and we'll look to see how the year develops to revise our thinking on what the full year is going to look like from a growth standpoint in Surveillance."

The UAS marketplace is something that's been on our road map for quite a long time. We've been the major player in the military space for some time, but we're all watching this kind of explosion occurring in the commercial side, and there's really a lot of changes going on there now with respect to, as you point out, regulatory issues and new players coming online. The -- we've -- in -- late in 2015, we basically initiated 2 vectors into the commercial space. One of them was to create a line of products of our own that have the appropriate capabilities and price points that we think will -- that will help us gain quick inroads into the commercial space. And then importantly, the relationship, the strategic collaboration we created with DJI, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity that is going to come out of this. With the relationship with DJI, the Zenmuse XT compatible with both their Inspire and their Matrice airframes, which the Inspire in particular is kind of the world leading airframe in terms of volume. And as you point out, as the commercial applications start to emerge, nighttime flying -- there's some regulatory issues around nighttime flying currently, but as those things start to resolve over time. And importantly, in a lot of other vertical applications not necessarily related to nighttime flying, but things like agricultural, building inspection, search and rescue, fire fighting, all of these things have strong value -- thermal brings a very, very strong value proposition to these spaces. So we're pretty optimistic about where this is going to lead."

But as you mentioned, FLIR FX has some unique features, RapidRecap being one of them that has been well received by the market. It was really our first shot out of the cannon in the residential and consumer space. So certainly, we have things in the product pipeline that we will refine and broaden that product offering in 2016. The other issue is the fact that we've got the FLIR 1 in the Apple channel. So it's in Apple stores. We have the outdoor version of the product in the Apple retail environments at this point, and that's been gaining nice traction there. I think it's one of the nice nuances of the product is that we do offer an outdoor capability, which is fairly unique, and when you cover -- when you couple that outdoor capability together with the RapidRecap feature, it's really a pretty useful value proposition. Ultimately, though, that marketplace has the opportunity for the injection of low-cost thermal to improve the accuracy of detection, and we see it as a fairly rich space.

Literally, if you count up the number of SKUs that were launched, it's over 100. So it's, particularly when you look in the Security segment, there are a lot of products that get launched there. But the -- I think the take home point was when we have a product platform and then there is a family tree of products that come off of that, that's what's important in terms of driving growth from a new product standpoint. We don't intend to let our foot off the pedal of the gas here in terms of the development of new products. One of the things that's nice about what we're doing in the business is to create system cores that are easy to integrate across the business. I mean, Lepton is a prime example. It's a product that someone can take and turn into a system very, very quickly. And this isn't something that we've spoken about yet on this call, but I think it's an important vector for the OEM & Emerging business that in terms of driving the growth of Lepton outside of FLIR and our own organically developed products, we've been making Lepton available through a number of component suppliers. And we've been having a number of developer and hacker events to drive the overall awareness of the capabilities associated with Lepton and bring new OEMs into the fold with the product. And one of the key drivers in terms of enabling that capability is that it's a system that is very easy to integrate. This is something that you can basically get power in and video out, it uses conventional CMOS camera interfaces. So it's very easy for someone who is familiar with working with conventional visible cameras to be able to also move into the thermal domain with Lepton. So that plays a benefit back into our own business as well. And that's why you see it -- Lepton being enabled in our different segments. I mentioned this in previous calls, but this will certainly be a theme in 2016 that you'll see Lepton expand beyond the Instrument segment, where there's been a fairly large focus. We also have new cores planned for the business outside of Lepton. So there are other areas of this -- there's higher resolution products and cooled products will be launched during 2016 from our cores and components group that we'll ultimately have system-level products that will be designed around those cores from our other segments."

I'll start the review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $438 million, up 1% from the prior year, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $0.51, which included a gain on an investment, restructuring charges and discrete tax charges. Adjusting for these items, earnings per share were $0.47 compared to an adjusted $0.45 in Q4 of 2014. 
Fourth quarter operating income, excluding restructuring charges, was $94 million, up 6% over the prior year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter grew 25% year-over-year. As a result of the strong order intake in Q4 in our government-oriented segments, we finished the year with total 12-month order backlog of $604 million, representing 6% growth over the end of the third quarter and the highest level of backlog since 2008, when our U.S. Military business was very strong due to the RAID and G-BOSS programs. In the quarter, we acquired DVTEL, which adds advanced security video management and video analytics solution to expand FLIR's Security business in the enterprise market. The impact of this transaction was not meaningful to our operating results for the quarter. 
Slide 4 shows a summary of the full year, where constant currency revenue growth of 6% helped drive 10% growth in adjusted earnings per share as we realized significant operating leverage on our restructured cost basis.
Cash generation improved significantly, with full year operating cash flow growing 22% over 2014 as better utilization of working capital added to the growth in net income. Backlog trends have been quite positive, growing at an 11% compound rate over the past 2 years. 
During 2015, we introduced over 20 new product platforms across our 6 segments. Eight of those products included our revolutionary Lepton micro camera core, creating new product categories and enabling groundbreaking new price points and capabilities such as IGM, or infrared guided measurement, to a broader set of customers.
On Slide 5, you'll see our initial outlook for 2016. As a result of expected softness in many of our European markets and a higher expected effective tax rate for the year, we expect revenues to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of between 3% and 9% when compared to the 2015 results, after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
We expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 26%, excluding any future discrete items, increasing due to changes in effective foreign tax rates. While our government-oriented business segments had a strong order flow in Q4, we continue to be cautious on this front, as our traditionally short cycle business can be event driven and is difficult to forecast.
Additionally, for the first quarter of 2016, we expect overall margins to be lower than the first quarter of 2015 due to product mix, a difficult comparable related to shipments to one Middle Eastern customer in the first quarter of 2015 and the nonreoccurrence of corporate expense credits we received.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on March 4 to shareholders of record as of February 19. This represents a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.11 in 2015. 
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review fourth quarter financial results. Amit?"

Good morning. The following discussion on pretax operating results for the fourth quarter and full year excludes restructuring expenses, which totaled $0.3 million and $1.4 million in 2015, and $1 million and $17 million in 2014, respectively. 
On Slide 6, you'll see our fourth quarter financial results. Despite currency headwinds, our revenue, operating income, operating margins, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $438 million, an increase of 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our Security and Detection segments reported increases of 21% and 32%, respectively, in year-over-year revenue. 
Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets and Maritime segments reported year-over-year declines of 5%, 5%, 2% and 10%, respectively. As we've noted earlier in the year, our Instruments and Maritime segments are most heavily impacted by currency fluctuations. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and OEM & Emerging Markets segment revenues would have been flat year-over-year, and Maritime would have shown a year-over-year decline of 4%, primarily due to a change in distribution channels and inventory reductions at a large retailer at year-end. Overall revenue would have shown a year-over-year increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. 
Recently, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 30%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 4%, 10% and 23%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. Government increased by about $18 million or 22% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 19% in 2014. Consolidated fourth quarter gross margin was 47%, a 2 percentage point decrease compared to last year, primarily driven by weakness in the OEM & Emerging Markets segment related to the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities to improve future efficiencies, as well as overall changes in segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates.
Operating income and margin improved year-over-year despite adverse currency effects. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 21%. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a nonoperating after-tax gain of approximately $12.7 million related to the sale of an investment that we had in a private technology company. We also reported a tax expense of $34.6 million, which was $24.5 million higher than 2014, primarily due to $7.4 million of unfavorable discrete tax items compared to prior year, when we benefited from the release of approximately $9.4 million of tax reserves. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $70.2 million, a slight decrease from last year, and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.51 for both years. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the discrete tax items in the fourth quarter of both years and the current year after-tax investment gain, adjusted net income was $65 million compared to $64.1 million in 2014, and adjusted EPS was $0.47 in 2015 compared to $0.45 in 2014.
We closed the year with cash of $472.8 million, a decrease of $52.6 million during the quarter. Our strong operating cash flow was deployed towards investing and financing activities to improve shareholder value, including the acquisition of DVTEL that used $92 million of cash in the quarter. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter were $78.3 million or 112% of quarterly net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. In the quarter, we improved our cash conversion cycle by almost 20 days. 
We had capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the fourth quarter and returned $15.2 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We also spent $29.8 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our stock during the quarter under the 2-year 15 million share repurchase program that we announced in February of last year.
On Slide 7, you'll see our 2015 full year financial results. Similar to the fourth quarter, despite the headwinds, our full year revenue, operating income, operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. 
For 2015, our revenue was $1,557,000,000, an increase of 2% compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, full year revenue would have been up approximately 6% year-over-year. Our Security and Detection segments reported year-over-year revenue increases of 27% and 34%, respectively. Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets and Maritime segments reported year-over-year declines of 3%, 2%, 6% and 8%, respectively. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and Maritime segments would have shown year-over-year revenue improvement of 5% and 2%, respectively.
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 12%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 11%, 3% and 9%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. government were flat compared with 2014 and represented 20% of total revenue, consistent with last year. 
Full year gross margin decreased marginally compared to last year, explained by overall changes in segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates. 2015 operating income and margin improved year-over-year, despite adverse currency effects. Our adjusted full year operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 20%. 
For the full year, our as reported tax rate was 21% compared to 20% in 2014. Adjusting for the restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items, our 2015 tax rate was 23% compared to 24% in 2014. For the full year of 2015, net income was $241.7 million, representing a 21% increase over 2014. EPS of $1.72 for the full year 2015 compared to $1.39, a 24% increase year-over-year. Excluding restructuring charges, the investment gain and discrete tax items for both years, adjusted net income was $220 million compared to $203.8 million in 2014, an 8% improvement. And adjusted EPS was $1.56 in 2015 compared to $1.42 in 2014, a 10% improvement. 
For the full year, our operating cash flow was $275.8 million or 114% of full year net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. We had capital expenditures of $68.2 million in 2015 and returned $61.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends.
We also spent $123.2 million to repurchase a little more than 4 million shares during the year. In terms of capital deployment over the long-term, we plan to continue our organic investments, spending about 3% to 4% of revenue on capital expenditures and 8% to 10% of revenue on R&D. We intend to deploy 100% of our free cash flow going forward, maintaining a dividend payout ratio of about 25% to 30% of net income and using the remainder to fund M&A and share repurchases, depending on available opportunities and expected returns.
This concludes the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our segment operating results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 4%, and operating margin declined 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding restructuring charges, due primarily to costs incurred in the consolidation of our 4 primary OEM & Emerging production and office buildings into a single multipurpose facility. We expect this facility consolidation to result in greater operating efficiency for the business. 
Moving to Slide 9, during the fourth quarter, Surveillance segment revenue declined 5% year-over-year to $150.7 million. In the prior year, we had significant amount of revenue coming out of our Integrated Systems line of business related to COSFPS system deliveries and the completion of a large order to a Middle Eastern customer. The unfavorable impacts of this comparison offset strength in our airborne, Maritime and manned portable lines of business. 
Surveillance segment operating income of $49.2 million increased 2% versus the prior year when excluding restructuring expenses. This represents a 220 basis point increase in operating margin, driven by reduced operating expenses. Surveillance backlog reduced slightly from Q3 to $309 million. Bookings of $142 million resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9x and bookings growth of 28% over the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Full year 2015 bookings of $533 million represented our highest order flow since 2010, when the RAID and G-BOSS programs were active. In January, Surveillance introduced our newest Personal Vision Systems product, the Scout TK Handheld Thermal monocular. Targeted at outdoor enthusiasts, the Scout TK utilizes an advanced version of our Lepton 3 core and opens a new category in the market with its retail price of $599.
Turning to Slide 10. The Instruments segment saw a fourth quarter revenue decline of 5% compared to the prior year to $98.6 million. Excluding the effect of the stronger dollar, Instruments revenue was flat with the prior year. Test & Measurement and Science products performed well, while the premium portion of our Building & Predictive Maintenance products saw declines, in part due to the delayed shipment of our new flagship T1K product until late in the quarter. 
Operating margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, increased 100 basis points to 35% and was within 20 basis points of the peak operating margin achieved in Q4 2012, as reduced operating expenses helped offset the top line softness. Also in January, the Instruments segment introduced their newest value priced handheld thermal spot camera, the TG-130, at the Consumer Electronics Show. Professionals and homeowners can use the TG-130 to pinpoint window and door drafts, missing insulation, water damage and a multitude of other home and structural related problems. Based on our Lepton 2.0 micro core, the new handheld features a revolutionary price point of $249. 
On Slide 11, you'll see our Security segment operating results. Strong revenue growth continued in the segment, up 21% year-over-year, reaching $68.4 million. Lorex-branded product and FLIR Residential offerings drove top line growth that was dampened by comparably soft shipment of cooled thermal systems as Q4 of 2014 saw significant shipments of these products to a Middle Eastern customer. Security operating profit was $9.2 million with margin declining 480 basis points, primarily driven by reduced gross margins due to product mix as well as increased marketing spend. 
As Andy mentioned, we acquired DVTEL at the end of November, which strengthens FLIR Security's presence in the enterprise portion of the security market. This acquisition provides us with significant software capabilities, including sophisticated video analytics and a robust video management systems, or VMS. 
VMS systems are the central user interface for a video security system, and are often the first decision an enterprise customer will make when defining an integrated video security solution. The DVTEL Latitude VMS system will be integrated into the FLIR command and control software suite and will form the backbone of the FLIR integrated video surveillance solutions. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 12. OEM & Emerging fourth quarter revenue declined 2% versus last year to $49.2 million. Foreign exchange headwinds and timing of orders from military customers negatively impacted shipments in the quarter. This was offset by growth in mobile products and our new unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, line of business. The UAS line of business was created in the second half of the year to enable commercial and consumer drones with powerful thermal imaging solutions. With the introduction of the FLIR Vue and the more recent announcement of our strategic collaboration with drone industry leader, DJI, and our first collaborative product, the Zenmuse XT, we are well on our way to building this market. OEM & Emerging operating margins declined 15% due to approximately $5 million in nonrecurring expenses related to the move to our new facility and semiconductor foundry in Santa Barbara. This new facility brings significant improvements to our production operations without a material increase in the business expense rate. OEM & Emerging backlog grew nearly $25 million or 22% in the quarter as we received a significant amount of orders for our cooled military cores. 
Turning to Slide 13. Maritime segment revenues were $36 million, which were 10% below the prior year. Excluding the significant exposure Maritime has to the strong U.S. dollar, revenue was down 4%. Maritime operating income was $600,000 in the quarter, down $800,000 from Q4 of 2014. Profitability was negatively impacted by both currency and competitive pricing pressures. 
In January, Raymarine introduced the first recreational class maritime solid state digital radar to feature CHIRP technology, the Quantum Wireless CHIRP Radar. CHIRP is a radar technology that uses multiple compressed radar pulses, and when combined with FLIR's exclusive ATX target separation technology, the result is unsurpassed radar resolution. The compact size and weight of the Quantum CHIRP sets a new standard for solid state radars and features Wi-Fi connectivity for ease of installation. 
On Slide 14, you will see the Detection segment's fourth quarter summary. Revenue was $34.7 million, which was up 32% over the prior year. The DR SKO program saw an uptick in deliveries, which helped drive 52% revenue growth for the program, while revenue from Detections products grew 27% year-over-year. Detection operating profit nearly doubled, driven by product mix and product cost reductions. Detection backlog finished the year at $82 million. During Q4, we received another order from the U.S. Department of Defense for our DR SKO system, this one totaling $50 million, for delivery through May 2017. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Detection's radiation line of business introduced the IdentiFINDER R200. The R200 represents a new price point in our radiation line of products, extending our reach into the wearable detector market while differentiating the product with high radiological resolution and identification capabilities. 
That concludes my summary of the segments fourth quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy."

Profits and cash flow came in strong despite our modest top line growth. Backlog rose to levels not seen since 2008, when military combat operations were much higher than they are today. 
Looking back on 2015, we saw a 6% revenue growth rate, though it was masked by the stronger dollar. I am very encouraged by the continued product innovation that we exhibited in introducing dozens of new products, many of which pushed new limits of performance and value. We leveraged our Lepton micro camera core to create 8 new FLIR branded products that enable a much wider audience of users and directly address our barriers of price and awareness. 
During the year, we completed a company-wide restructuring that has proven very beneficial to our operating efficiency and profitability. We made a meaningful acquisition that we intend to leverage to improve margins and expand our product suite and strengthen our continued growth in the video security space. And we executed on our commitment to investing in our marketing capabilities, which has resulted in tremendous growth in nearly every metric we use to track awareness and the power of our brand. We're looking forward to 2016, as we continue with the quest to become the world's sixth sense.
That concludes our comments on the fourth quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open up the call for your questions."

If we talk about range of outcomes, the first thing is what the environment looks like. The general U.S. DoD environment for us, obviously, has been improving with a budget in place, the -- I would say the procurement sentiment there is improving. And we saw a nice uptick in U.S. orders in Q4. The issue at this point, though, that's difficult to determine is how much of that was pent-up demand versus how much of it is run rate demand. As you know, our business is a short cycle business. I think that the products that we have there are quite relevant to what's going on in the world today. The big wild card for us also I would say is the Middle Eastern business. That business, both on a bookings and revenue standpoint for 2015 was down versus 2014, but it's an area that has tremendous amount of opportunity for us. Particularly if you look at our products in the area of border patrol and deployable systems in our Surveillance segment, we're a leader there. We've got CDMQ product that we can respond with rather quickly to demand. And I see that as really being the wild card for us in 2016, but it's also an area that we have limited visibility. So at this point, we've taken, I think, an approach that is prudent in terms of forecasting the business based on what we see today."

Instruments, we continue to increase the percentage of Lepton-based product that are being sold in Instruments. We actually were up to a little bit north of 60% of the total unit volume that was shipped in Q4 were Lepton-based products, in Instruments. That said, we continue to build out the value adder around Instruments. So we launched the T1K during Q4 and began shipments of that very late in the quarter. So it didn't really have a big impact on revenue, but we'll start to see that roll in, in Q1. In terms of regional performance in Instruments, it's a story similar to the rest of the business. The Latin America region has been down fairly sharply. Europe has also been soft for us. We saw nice growth come out of China and expect that to continue there. We've made investments in our distribution organization in China and have a very strong brand there, and demand continues to be strong in China. And we also -- Instruments, if we look at the front end of the business, saw growth in Q4 in the U.S. market in Instruments. The other thing that's an opportunity and relative to supporting the margins in Instruments is the Optical Gas Imaging business. That was soft for most of the year of 2015. We started to see a little bit of an uptick towards the end of 2015 in the OGI business. And we've got a couple of regulations that are coming through from the EPA and the BLM that will support the use of Optical Gas Imaging technologies from a regulatory standpoint, so the draft regulations on that, that have been released, and the margins on those products are quite good. I guess I'd just close with the last point is that the margins that you saw in Q4 probably aren't towards the peak of what we will see from that group, but I think that they are sustainable."

I think as the industrialization matures there, the concept of predictive/preventive maintenance is continuing to gain traction. We're moving out of applications like the utility market, which has historically been very strong for us, into factories and industrial and process control applications there. As I mentioned in the previous comments, we've invested fairly strongly in distribution and marketing capability in China. So during the course of 2015, we had a shift of resources from the slower growth EMEA and Latin America regions into China, and we're starting to see those investments pay off. Moving over to the oil and gas industry, certainly, low oil prices have affected overall procurements from that segment, both in our Optical Gas Imaging and in our midrange Instruments products that are used for predictive/preventive maintenance. That said though, again, as I mentioned on the previous comments, the draft regulations that are out from the EPA and the BLM are going to favor the use of Optical Gas Imaging. And I would expect that in 2016 we should see an uptick there, plus if you look at what's going on in the Aliso Canyon with the natural gas leak there, most of the footage that's been shown on national TV are coming from our cameras, illustrating the benefits of Optical Gas Imaging for natural gas applications."

Really, looking at the quarter, Maritime was down more than Instruments was. Instruments was actually flat to up slightly on a currency adjusted basis in Q4. The issue in Instruments, though, would be around Europe. Europe and Latin America are the 2 markets that were soft from a bookings and revenue standpoint for us. As I'd mentioned previously, our response to that is twofold. Number one, a shifting of resources, both on the selling and marketing front out, of slow growth markets into higher growth markets, and the other issue is the continued cadence of the introduction of new products there. We've had a slew of -- I mentioned 8 new Lepton products. Most of those were in the Instruments segment. They're getting very good traction in the market. I was just recently at Grainger's national convention this week, earlier this week, and we were showing those products there and getting very strong interest from them. So I think that we're going to see unit volumes continue to grow in the Instruments business. And we believe that as we create these new categories for low-cost IGM basis, we're creating new thermographers in the process, and those are people that are likely to move up the value ladder over time as they see the value and the efficacy that comes from thermal imaging."

I think the overall economy, could sure -- will stimulate boat sales. The low gas pricing should be favorable. So those are some tailwinds that help. What's happening is that aggressive price. We have not been -- it's also the largest growing at this retail segment, this fish finding. It's an area we -- Raymarine, when we brought it, was not participating. We've created a new product line called the Dragonfly. It's been well received. We're expanding that product line, so we should see some more growth there. The main thing, though, is creating these differentiated offerings so that we can capture share. And that's what we've been trying to do. And our offerings always have something a little bit special into them, as you look at the Dragonfly and its capabilities. Andy mentioned the world-class autopilot. The new CHIRP Radar that's solid state, lowest power, lightest weight, wireless for ease of installation. That's what's going to drive our growth and probably -- just hopefully, disproportionate to the overall growth of the market. But that's how I would view that."

Obviously, we want to continue to make acquisitions that play to the strengths of our business, of our vertical integration, our Lepton capability, our sales and marketing capability.

We'll be moving much more toward above-the-line type activities in terms of advertising, driving awareness of homeowners who have maybe never been exposed to thermal imaging, looking at national PR opportunities for some of these products, as well as sort of the blocking and tackling and the lower funnel demand-generation activities, primarily again through digital means.

We think that the economic environment -- that Instruments and Maritime probably have the biggest exposure to the economic environment at this point. And then as previously mentioned, the wild card here is really Surveillance, based on what we see in terms of world events. Again, we're very well positioned there. I think that the technologies of and concepts of intelligent surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, chemical detection, I think, are quite relevant today. And we're very well positioned. And I think that our longer-term strategy of CDMQ, Commercially Developed Military Qualified, rapid response capability, the focus of the business to be more oriented towards a system solution-oriented business rather than just selling cameras is something that's quite relevant today. And particularly as we look at opportunities in places like the Middle East, where some of the unrest there is driving demand for more control Security and Surveillance-oriented solutions. As we add capability, things like DVTEL, things like video analytics and more integrated solutions, our offerings become more attractive. And I think that, that, from a trajectory standpoint, could lead to improved performance from the Surveillance segment. But again, it's just a bit difficult to predict at this point."

But generally, I think your observations are largely in line with what our forecasts are at this point. The -- in Surveillance, we're being fairly measured in terms of our expectations for that business going forward. Again, just based on the visibility that we have in the business. We had a nice backlog build in Q4. We had book-to-bill in Q2 of 1.2, book-to-bill in Q3 of 1.2 on that business. Book-to-bill dropped a little bit below 1.0 in Q4, but as Tom mentioned in his comments, we saw a very nice growth in bookings. The issue that we have in that business, though, again, is determining how much of that was pent-up demand versus future run rate. As I mentioned before, the business is very well positioned at this point. I would say the overall inquiry level in that business has had an uptick, and we've got some very nice irons in the fire for a medium-term business with the U.S. DoD, but not yet decided.

We've been the major player in the military space for some time, but we're all watching this kind of explosion occurring in the commercial side, and there's really a lot of changes going on there now with respect to, as you point out, regulatory issues and new players coming online. The -- we've -- in -- late in 2015, we basically initiated 2 vectors into the commercial space. One of them was to create a line of products of our own that have the appropriate capabilities and price points that we think will -- that will help us gain quick inroads into the commercial space. And then importantly, the relationship, the strategic collaboration we created with DJI, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity that is going to come out of this. With the relationship with DJI, the Zenmuse XT compatible with both their Inspire and their Matrice airframes, which the Inspire in particular is kind of the world leading airframe in terms of volume. And as you point out, as the commercial applications start to emerge, nighttime flying -- there's some regulatory issues around nighttime flying currently, but as those things start to resolve over time. And importantly, in a lot of other vertical applications not necessarily related to nighttime flying, but things like agricultural, building inspection, search and rescue, firefighting, all of these things have strong value -- thermal brings a very, very strong value proposition to these spaces. So we're pretty optimistic about where this is going to lead."

But as you mentioned, FLIR FX has some unique features, RapidRecap being one of them that has been well received by the market. It was really our first shot out of the cannon in the residential and consumer space. So certainly, we have things in the product pipeline that we will refine and broaden that product offering in 2016. The other issue is the fact that we've got the FLIR 1 in the Apple channel. So it's in Apple stores. We have the outdoor version of the product in the Apple retail environments at this point, and that's been gaining nice traction there. I think it's one of the nice nuances of the product is that we do offer an outdoor capability, which is fairly unique, and when you cover -- when you couple that outdoor capability together with the RapidRecap feature, it's really a pretty useful value proposition. Ultimately, though, that marketplace has the opportunity for the injection of low-cost thermal to improve the accuracy of detection, and we see it as a fairly rich space.

Literally, if you count up the number of SKUs that were launched, it's over 100. So it's, particularly when you look in the Security segment, there are a lot of products that get launched there. But the -- I think the take home point was when we have a product platform and then there is a family tree of products that come off of that, that's what's important in terms of driving growth from a new product standpoint. We don't intend to let our foot off the pedal of the gas here in terms of the development of new products. One of the things that's nice about what we're doing in the business is to create system cores that are easy to integrate across the business. I mean, Lepton is a prime example. It's a product that someone can take and turn into a system very, very quickly. And this isn't something that we've spoken about yet on this call, but I think it's an important vector for the OEM & Emerging business that in terms of driving the growth of Lepton outside of FLIR and our own organically developed products, we've been making Lepton available through a number of component suppliers. And we've been having a number of developer and hacker events to drive the overall awareness of the capabilities associated with Lepton and bring new OEMs into the fold with the product. And one of the key drivers in terms of enabling that capability is that it's a system that is very easy to integrate. This is something that you can basically get power in and video out, it uses conventional CMOS camera interfaces. So it's very easy for someone who is familiar with working with conventional visible cameras to be able to also move into the thermal domain with Lepton. So that plays a benefit back into our own business as well. And that's why you see it -- Lepton being enabled in our different segments. I mentioned this in previous calls, but this will certainly be a theme in 2016 that you'll see Lepton expand beyond the Instrument segment, where there's been a fairly large focus. We also have new cores planned for the business outside of Lepton. So there are other areas of this -- there's higher resolution products and cooled products will be launched during 2016 from our cores and components group that we'll ultimately have system-level products that will be designed around those cores from our other segments."

I'll start the review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $438 million, up 1% from the prior year, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $0.51, which included a gain on an investment, restructuring charges and discrete tax charges. Adjusting for these items, earnings per share were $0.47 compared to an adjusted $0.45 in Q4 of 2014. 
Fourth quarter operating income, excluding restructuring charges, was $94 million, up 6% over the prior year. Cash flow from operations for the quarter grew 25% year-over-year. As a result of the strong order intake in Q4 in our government-oriented segments, we finished the year with total 12-month order backlog of $604 million, representing 6% growth over the end of the third quarter and the highest level of backlog since 2008, when our U.S. Military business was very strong due to the RAID and G-BOSS programs. In the quarter, we acquired DVTEL, which adds advanced security video management and video analytics solution to expand FLIR's Security business in the enterprise market. The impact of this transaction was not meaningful to our operating results for the quarter. 
Slide 4 shows a summary of the full year, where constant currency revenue growth of 6% helped drive 10% growth in adjusted earnings per share as we realize significant operating leverage on our restructured cost basis.
Cash generation improved significantly, with full year operating cash flow growing 22% over 2014 as better utilization of working capital added to the growth in net income. Backlog trends have been quite positive, growing at an 11% compound rate over the past 2 years. 
During 2015, we introduced over 20 new product platforms across our 6 segments. Eight of those products included our revolutionary Lepton micro camera core, creating new product categories and enabling groundbreaking new price points and capabilities such as IGM, or infrared guided measurement, to a broader set of customers.
On Slide 5, you'll see our initial outlook for 2016. As a result of expected softness in many of our European markets and a higher expected effective tax rate for the year, we expect revenues to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of between 3% and 9% when compared to the 2015 results, after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
We expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 26%, excluding any future discrete items, increasing due to changes in effective foreign tax rates. While our government-oriented business segments had a strong order flow in Q4, we continue to be cautious on this front, as our traditionally short cycle business can be event driven and is difficult to forecast.
Additionally, for the first quarter of 2016, we expect overall margins to be lower than the first quarter of 2015 due to product mix, a difficult comparable related to shipments to one Middle Eastern customer in the first quarter of 2015 and the nonreoccurrence of corporate expense credits we received.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on March 4 to shareholders of record as of February 19. This represents a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.11 in 2015. 
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review fourth quarter financial results. Amit?"

The following discussion on pretax operating results for the fourth quarter and full year excludes restructuring expenses, which totaled $0.3 million and $1.4 million in 2015, and $1 million and $17 million in 2014, respectivel",1129,"Thanks, Andy. Good morning. The following discussion on pretax operating results for the fourth quarter and full year excludes restructuring expenses, which totaled $0.3 million and $1.4 million in 2015, and $1 million and $17 million in 2014, respectively. 
On Slide 6, you'll see our fourth quarter financial results. Despite currency headwinds, our revenue, operating income, operating margins, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $438 million, an increase of 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Our Security and Detection segments reported increases of 21% and 32%, respectively, in year-over-year revenue. 
Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets and Maritime segments reported year-over-year declines of 5%, 5%, 2% and 10%, respectively. As we've noted earlier in the year, our Instruments and Maritime segments are most heavily impacted by currency fluctuations. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and OEM & Emerging Markets segment revenues would have been flat year-over-year, and Maritime would have shown a year-over-year decline of 4%, primarily due to a change in distribution channel and inventory reductions at a large retailer at year-end. Overall revenue would have shown a year-over-year increase of 3% on a constant currency basis. 
Recently, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 30%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 4%, 10% and 23%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. Government increased by about $18 million or 22% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 19% in 2014. Consolidated fourth quarter gross margin was 47%, a 2 percentage point decrease compared to last year, primarily driven by weakness in the OEM & Emerging Markets segment related to the consolidation of our manufacturing facilities to improve future efficiencies as well as overall changes in segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates.
Operating income and margin improved year-over-year despite adverse currency effect. Our adjusted fourth quarter operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 21%. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a nonoperating after-tax gain of approximately $12.7 million related to the sale of an investment that we had in a private technology company. We also reported a tax expense of $34.6 million, which was $24.5 million higher than 2014, primarily due to $7.4 million of unfavorable discrete tax items compared to prior year, when we benefited from the release of approximately $9.4 million of tax reserves. 
Net income in the fourth quarter was $70.2 million, a slight decrease from last year, and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.51 for both years. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of the discrete tax items in the fourth quarter of both years and the current year after-tax investment gain, adjusted net income was $65 million compared to $64.1 million in 2014, and adjusted EPS was $0.47 in 2015 compared to $0.45 in 2014.
We closed the year with cash of $472.8 million, a decrease of $52.6 million during the quarter. A strong operating cash flow was deployed towards investing and financing activities to improve shareholder value, including the acquisition of DVTEL that used $92 million of cash in the quarter. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter were $78.3 million or 112% of quarterly net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. In the quarter, we improved our cash conversion cycle by almost 20 days. 
We had capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the fourth quarter and returned $15.2 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We also spent $29.8 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our stock during the quarter under the 2-year 15 million share repurchase program that we announced in February of last year.
On Slide 7, you'll see our 2015 full year financial results. Similar to the fourth quarter, despite the headwinds, our full year revenue, operating income, operating margin, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS all improved year-over-year. 
For 2015, our revenue was $1,557,000,000, an increase of 2% compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, full year revenue would have been up approximately 6% year-over-year. Our Security and Detection segments reported year-over-year revenue increases of 27% and 34%, respectively. Our Surveillance, Instruments, OEM & Emerging Markets and Maritime segments reported year-over-year declines of 3%, 2%, 6% and 8%, respectively. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and Maritime segments would have shown year-over-year revenue improvement of 5% and 2%, respectively.
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 5% and 12%, respectively. Canada and LatAm, Europe and Middle East and Africa revenue declined by 11%, 3% and 9%, respectively. Sales to the U.S. government were flat compared with 2014 and represented 20% of total revenue, consistent with last year. 
Full year gross margin decreased marginally compared to last year, explained by overall changes in segment mix and the negative impacts of changes in exchange rates. 2015 operating income and margin improved year-over-year, despite adverse currency effects. Our adjusted full year operating margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 20%. 
For the full year, our as reported tax rate was 21% compared to 20% in 2014. Adjusting for the restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items, our 2015 tax rate was 23% compared to 24% in 2014. For the full year 2015, net income was $241.7 million, representing a 21% increase over 2014. EPS of $1.72 for the full year 2015 compared to $1.39, a 24% increase year-over-year. Excluding restructuring charges, the investment gain and discrete tax items for both years, adjusted net income was $220 million compared to $203.8 million in 2014, an 8% improvement. And adjusted EPS was $1.56 in 2015 compared to $1.42 in 2014, a 10% improvement. 
For the full year, our operating cash flow was $275.8 million or 114% of full year net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management. We had capital expenditures of $68.2 million in 2015 and returned $61.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends.
We also spent $123.2 million to repurchase a little more than 4 million shares during the year. In terms of capital deployment over the long-term, we plan to continue our organic investments, spending about 3% to 4% of revenue on capital expenditures and 8% to 10% of revenue on R&D. We intend to deploy 100% of our free cash flow going forward, maintaining a dividend payout ratio of about 25% to 30% of net income and using the remainder to fund M&A and share repurchases, depending on available opportunities and expected returns.
This concludes the summary of our fourth quarter and full year results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our segment operating results on Slide 8. Fourth quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 4%, and operating margin declined 100 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2014, excluding restructuring charges, due primarily to cost incurred in the consolidation of our 4 primary OEM & Emerging production and office buildings into a single multipurpose facility. We expect this facility consolidation to result in greater operating efficiency for the business. 
Moving to Slide 9, during the fourth quarter, Surveillance segment revenue declined 5% year-over-year to $150.7 million. In the prior year, we had significant amount of revenue coming out of our Integrated Systems line of business related to COSFPS system deliveries and the completion of a large order to a Middle Eastern customer. The unfavorable impacts of this comparison offset strength in our airborne, Maritime and manned portable lines of business. 
Surveillance segment operating income of $49.2 million increased 2% versus the prior year when excluding restructuring expenses. This represents a 220 basis point increase in operating margin, driven by reduced operating expenses. Surveillance backlog reduced slightly from Q3 to $309 million. Bookings of $142 million resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 0.9x and bookings growth of 28% over the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Full year 2015 bookings of $533 million represented our highest order flow since 2010, when the RAID and G-BOSS programs were active. In January, Surveillance introduced our newest Personal Vision Systems product, the Scout TK Handheld Thermal monocular. Targeted at outdoor enthusiasts, the Scout TK utilizes an advanced version of our Lepton 3 core and opens a new category in the market with its retail price of $599.
Turning to Slide 10. The Instruments segment saw a fourth quarter revenue decline of 5% compared to the prior year to $98.6 million. Excluding the effect of the stronger dollar, Instruments revenue was flat with the prior year. Test & Measurement and Science products performed well, while the premium portion of our Building & Predictive Maintenance products saw declines, in part due to the delayed shipment of our new flagship T1K product until late in the quarter. 
Operating margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, increased 100 basis points to 35% and was within 20 basis points of the peak operating margin achieved in Q4 2012, as reduced operating expenses helped offset the top line softness. Also in January, the Instruments segment introduced their newest value priced handheld thermal spot camera, the TG-130, at the Consumer Electronics Show. Professionals and homeowners can use the TG-130 to pinpoint window and door drafts, missing insulation, water damage and a multitude of other home and structural related problems. Based on our Lepton 2.0 micro core, the new handheld features a revolutionary price point of $249. 
On Slide 11, you'll see our Security segment operating results. Strong revenue growth continued in the segment, up 21% year-over-year, reaching $68.4 million. Lorex-branded product and FLIR Residential offerings drove top line growth that was dampened by comparably soft shipment of cooled thermal systems as Q4 of 2014 saw significant shipments of these products to a Middle Eastern customer. Security operating profit was $9.2 million with margin declining 480 basis points, primarily driven by reduced gross margins due to product mix as well as increased marketing spend. 
As Andy mentioned, we acquired DVTEL at the end of November, which strengthens FLIR Security's presence in the enterprise portion of the security market. This acquisition provides us with significant software capabilities, including sophisticated video analytics and robust video management systems, or VMS. 
VMS systems are the central user interface for a video security system, and are often the first decision an enterprise customer will make when defining an integrated video security solution. The DVTEL Latitude VMS system will be integrated into the FLIR command and control software suite and will form the backbone of the FLIR integrated video surveillance solutions. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 12. OEM & Emerging fourth quarter revenue declined 2% versus last year to $49.2 million. Foreign exchange headwinds and timing of orders from military customers negatively impacted shipments in the quarter. This was offset by growth in mobile products and our new unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, line of business. The UAS line of business was created in the second half of the year to enable commercial and consumer drones with powerful thermal imaging solutions. With the introduction of the FLIR Vue and the more recent announcement of our strategic collaboration with drone industry leader, DJI, and our first collaborative product, the Zenmuse XT, we are well on our way to building this market. OEM & Emerging operating margins declined 15% due to approximately $5 million in nonrecurring expenses related to the move to our new facility and semiconductor foundry in Santa Barbara. This new facility brings significant improvements to our production operations without a material increase in the business expense rate. OEM & Emerging backlog grew nearly $25 million or 22% in the quarter as we received a significant amount of orders for our cooled military cores. 
Turning to Slide 13. Maritime segment revenues were $36 million, which were 10% below the prior year. Excluding the significant exposure Maritime has to the strong U.S. dollar, revenue was down 4%. Maritime operating income was $600,000 in the quarter, down $800,000 from Q4 of 2014. Profitability was negatively impacted by both currency and competitive pricing pressures. 
In January, Raymarine introduced the first recreational class maritime solid state digital radar to feature CHIRP technology, the Quantum Wireless CHIRP Radar. CHIRP is a radar technology that uses multiple compressed radar pulses, and when combined with FLIR's exclusive ATX target separation technology, the result is unsurpassed radar resolution. The compact size and weight of the Quantum CHIRP sets a new standard for solid state radars and features Wi-Fi connectivity for ease of installation. 
On Slide 14, you will see the Detection segment's fourth quarter summary. Revenue was $34.7 million, which was up 32% over the prior year. The DR SKO program saw an uptick in deliveries, which helped drive 52% revenue growth for the program, while revenue from Detections products grew 27% year-over-year. Detection operating profit nearly doubled, driven by product mix and product cost reductions. Detection backlog finished the year at $82 million. During Q4, we received another order from the U.S. Department of Defense for our DR SKO system, this one totaling $50 million, for delivery through May 2017. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Detection's radiation line of business introduced the IdentiFINDER R200. The R200 represents a new price point in our radiation line of products, extending our reach into the wearable detector market while differentiating the product with high radiological resolution and identification capabilities. 
That concludes my summary of the segments fourth quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy."

Profits and cash flow came in strong despite our modest top line growth. Backlog rose to levels not seen since 2008, when military combat operations were much higher than they are today. 
Looking back on 2015, we saw a 6% revenue growth rate, though it was masked by the stronger dollar. I am very encouraged by the continued product innovation that we exhibited in introducing dozens of new products, many of which pushed new limits of performance and value. We leveraged our Lepton micro camera core to create 8 new FLIR branded products that enable a much wider audience of users and directly address our barriers of price and awareness. 
During the year, we completed a company-wide restructuring that has proven very beneficial to our operating efficiency and profitability. We made a meaningful acquisition that we intend to leverage to improve margins and expand our product suite and strengthen our continued growth in the video security space. And we executed on our commitment to investing in our marketing capabilities, which has resulted in tremendous growth in nearly every metric we use to track awareness and the power of our brand.

And we saw a nice uptick in U.S. orders in Q4. The issue at this point, though, that's difficult to determine is how much of that was pent-up demand versus how much of it is run rate demand. As you know, our business is a short cycle business. I think that the products that we have there are quite relevant to what's going on in the world today. The big wild card for us also, I would say, is the Middle Eastern business. That business, both on a bookings and revenue standpoint for 2015 was down versus 2014, but it's an area that has tremendous amount of opportunity for us. Particularly if you look at our products in the area of border patrol and deployable systems in our Surveillance segment, we're a leader there. We've got CDMQ product that we can respond with rather quickly to demand. And I see that as really being the wild card for us in 2016, but it's also an area that we have limited visibility. So at this point, we've taken, I think, an approach that is prudent in terms of forecasting the business based on what we see today."

Instruments, we continue to increase the percentage of Lepton-based product that are being sold in Instruments. We actually were up to a little bit north of 60% of the total unit volume that was shipped in Q4 were Lepton-based products, in Instruments. That said, we continue to build out the value adder around Instruments. So we launched the T1K during Q4 and began shipments of that very late in the quarter. So it didn't really have a big impact on revenue, but we'll start to see that roll in, in Q1. In terms of regional performance in Instruments, it's a story similar to the rest of the business. The Latin America region has been down fairly sharply. Europe has also been soft for us. We saw nice growth come out of China and expect that to continue there. We've made investments in our distribution organization in China and have a very strong brand there, and demand continues to be strong in China. And we also -- Instruments, if we look at the front end of the business, saw growth in Q4 in the U.S. market in Instruments. The other thing that's an opportunity and relative to supporting the margins in Instruments is the Optical Gas Imaging business. That was soft for most of the year of 2015. We started to see a little bit of an uptick towards the end of 2015 in the OGI business. And we've got a couple of regulations that are coming through from the EPA and the BLM that will support the use of Optical Gas Imaging technologies from a regulatory standpoint, so the draft regulations on that, that have been released, and the margins on those products are quite good. I guess I'd just close with the last point is that the margins that you saw in Q4 probably aren't towards the peak of what we will see from that group, but I think that they are sustainable."

I think as the industrialization matures there, the concept of predictive/preventive maintenance is continuing to gain traction. We're moving out of applications like the utility market, which has historically been very strong for us, into factories and industrial and process control applications there. As I mentioned in the previous comments, we've invested fairly strongly in distribution and marketing capability in China. So during the course of 2015, we had a shift of resources from the slower growth EMEA and Latin America regions into China, and we're starting to see those investments pay off. Moving over to the oil and gas industry, certainly, low oil prices have affected overall procurements from that segment, both in our Optical Gas Imaging and in our midrange Instruments products that are used for predictive/preventive maintenance. That said though, again, as I mentioned on the previous comments, the draft regulations that are out from the EPA and the BLM are going to favor the use of Optical Gas Imaging. And I would expect in 2016 we should see an uptick there, plus if you look at what's going on in the Aliso Canyon with the natural gas leak there, most of the footage that's been shown on national TV are coming from our cameras, illustrating the benefits of Optical Gas Imaging for natural gas applications."

Really, looking at the quarter, Maritime was down more than Instruments was. Instruments was actually flat to up slightly on a currency adjusted basis in Q4. The issue in the -- in Instruments, though, would be around Europe. Europe and Latin America are the 2 markets that were soft from a bookings and revenue standpoint for us. As I'd mentioned previously, our response to that is twofold. Number one, a shifting of resources, both on the selling and marketing front out, of slow growth markets into higher growth markets, and the other issue is the continued cadence of the introduction of new products there. We've had a slew of -- I mentioned 8 new Lepton products. Most of those were in the Instruments segment. They're getting very good traction in the market. I was just recently at Grainger's national convention this week, earlier this week, and we were showing those products there and getting very strong interest from them. So I think that we're going to see unit volumes continue to grow in the Instruments business. And we believe that as we create these new categories for low-cost IGM basis, we're creating new thermographers in the process, and those are people that are likely to move up the value ladder over time as they see the value and the efficacy that comes from thermal imaging."

We've created a new product line called the Dragonfly. It's been well received. We're expanding that product line, so we should see some more growth there. The main thing, though, is creating these differentiated offerings so that we can capture share. And that's what we've been trying to do.

We expect to see continued growth in Security, continued growth in the Detection segment relative to the backlog there. We think that the economic environment -- that Instruments and Maritime probably have the biggest exposure to the economic environment at this point. And then as previously mentioned, the wild card here is really Surveillance, based on what we see in terms of world events. Again, we're very well positioned there. I think that the technologies of and concepts of intelligent surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, chemical detection, I think, are quite relevant today. And we're very well positioned. And I think that our longer-term strategy of CDMQ, Commercially Developed Military Qualified, rapid response capability, the focus of the business to be more oriented towards a system solution-oriented business rather than just selling cameras is something that's quite relevant today. And particularly as we look at opportunities in places like the Middle East, where some of the unrest there is driving demand for more control Security and Surveillance-oriented solutions. As we add capability, things like DVTEL, things like video analytics and more integrated solutions, our offerings become more attractive. And I think that, that, from a trajectory standpoint, could lead to improved performance from the Surveillance segment. But again, it's just a bit difficult to predict at this point."

But generally, I think your observations are largely in line with what our forecasts are at this point. The -- in Surveillance, we're being fairly measured in terms of our expectations for that business going forward. Again, just based on the visibility that we have in the business. We had a nice backlog build in Q4. We had book-to-bill in Q2 of 1.2, book-to-bill in Q3 of 1.2 on that business. Book-to-bill dropped a little bit below 1.0 in Q4, but as Tom mentioned in his comments, we saw a very nice growth in bookings. The issue that we have in that business, though, again, is determining how much of that was pent-up demand versus future run rate. As I mentioned before, the business is very well positioned at this point. I would say the overall inquiry level in that business has had an uptick, and we've got some very nice irons in the fire for a medium-term business with the U.S. DoD, but not yet decided. So we're taking, I think, a prudent view of that business, and we'll look to see how the year develops to revise our thinking on what the full year is going to look like from a growth standpoint in Surveillance."

We've been the major player in the military space for some time, but we're all watching this kind of explosion occurring in the commercial side, and there's really a lot of changes going on there now with respect to, as you point out, regulatory issues and new players coming online. The -- we've -- in -- late in 2015, we basically initiated 2 vectors into the commercial space. One of them was to create a line of products of our own that have the appropriate capabilities and price points that we think will -- that will help us gain quick inroads into the commercial space. And then importantly, the relationship, the strategic collaboration we created with DJI, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity that is going to come out of this. With the relationship with DJI, the Zenmuse XT compatible with both their Inspire and their Matrice airframes, which the Inspire in particular is kind of the world leading airframe in terms of volume. And as you point out, as the commercial applications start to emerge, nighttime flying -- there's some regulatory issues around nighttime flying currently, but as those things start to resolve over time. And importantly, in a lot of other vertical applications not necessarily related to nighttime flying, but things like agricultural, building inspection, search and rescue, firefighting, all of these things have strong value -- thermal brings a very, very strong value proposition to these spaces. So we're pretty optimistic about where this is going to lead."

But as you mentioned, FLIR FX has some unique features, RapidRecap being one of them that has been well received by the market. It was really our first shot out of the cannon in the residential and consumer space. So certainly, we have things in the product pipeline that we will refine and broaden that product offering in 2016. The other issue is the fact that we've got the FLIR 1 in the Apple channel. So it's in Apple stores. We have the outdoor version of the product in the Apple retail environments at this point, and that's been gaining nice traction there. I think it's one of the nice nuances of the product is that we do offer an outdoor capability, which is fairly unique, and when you cover -- when you couple that outdoor capability together with the RapidRecap feature, it's really a pretty useful value proposition. Ultimately, though, that marketplace has the opportunity for the injection of low-cost thermal to improve the accuracy of detection, and we see it as a fairly rich space. And it's really part of our product value ladder and our control the corner strategy. This forms the lower corner of the market. Travis, anything you want to add to the FX story?"

But the -- I think the take home point was when we have a product platform and then there is a family tree of products that come off of that, that's what's important in terms of driving growth from a new product standpoint. We don't intend to let our foot off the pedal of the gas here in terms of the development of new products. One of the things that's nice about what we're doing in the business is to create system cores that are easy to integrate across the business. I mean, Lepton is a prime example. It's a product that someone can take and turn into a system very, very quickly. And this isn't something that we've spoken about yet on this call, but I think it's an important vector for the OEM & Emerging business that in terms of driving the growth of Lepton outside of FLIR and our own organically developed products, we've been making Lepton available through a number of component suppliers. And we've been having a number of developer and hacker events to drive the overall awareness of the capabilities associated with Lepton and bring new OEMs into the fold with the product. And one of the key drivers in terms of enabling that capability is that it's a system that is very easy to integrate. This is something that you can basically get power in and video out, it uses conventional CMOS camera interfaces. So it's very easy for someone who is familiar with working with conventional visible cameras to be able to also move into the thermal domain with Lepton. So that plays a benefit back into our own business as well. And that's why you see it -- Lepton being enabled in our different segments. I mentioned this in previous calls, but this will certainly be a theme in 2016 that you'll see Lepton expand beyond the Instrument segment, where there's been a fairly large focus. We also have new cores planned for the business outside of Lepton. So there are other areas of this -- there's higher resolution products and cooled products will be launched during 2016 from our cores and components group that we'll ultimately have system-level products that will be designed around those cores from our other segments."

And I want to welcome everyone to FLIR's first quarter 2016 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President of Corporate  Development, Shane Harrison. 
I will start with a review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $379 million, up 10% from the prior year and up 12% on a constant-currency basis. Commercial product revenues grew 4% over the first quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 20%. 
Earnings per share were $0.01, which were negatively affected by a $40 [ph] million charge to establish reserves booked in the quarter primarily related to an excess profit ruling dispute between Belgium and the European Commission which Amit will discuss in more detail. 
Excluding these charges, earnings were $0.30 per share, which compares with $0.34 per share in the prior year. 
First quarter operating income was $57 million compared to $66 [ph] million in the prior year. As we mentioned in our outlook commentary last quarter, the first quarter of 2015 proved to be a difficult comparable as it was a quarter that had lower than normal corporate costs as well as our strongest gross margins in the past 3 years due to foreign exchange and a strong surveillance product mix.
Bookings of $379 million were the highest first quarter order intake we've seen in over 5 years. Backlog continues to grow, reaching $613 [ph] million, which is the highest level since 2008. 
Surveillance segment bookings grew 50% over the prior year driven by strong international orders. 
We introduced several new products since our last call, including the new bolt-on thermal camera core. This innovative new core is priced and has performance above our Lepton micro camera core and it features a powerful onboard processing capability enabled by a programmable, vision-processing unit. [indiscernible] features our latest 12-micron pixel design and is offered in VGA and qVGA resolutions with 15 different field-of-view options to choose from, each of which use internally produced optical components. [indiscernible] revolutionary size, weight and onboard processing power will open up new applications and uses for our technology given its versatility and low power consumption. 
On the Lepton front, we've been successfully integrated into 2 new OEM product platforms during the quarter. First  was the announcement of [indiscernible] cat-branded smartphone that will feature thermal imaging and FLIR proper app that will provide building professionals, electricians and first responders the ability to measure surface temperature from a distance, identify mechanical and electrical problems, spot moisture and missing insulation, see in total darkness or see through smoke. 
Second was Scott site, hands-free thermal imaging system from Scott Safety, which is the first headmounted thermal imaging system to have a micro display integrated inside the SEBA mask. Both of these products take full advantage of FLIR's industry-leading size, weight, power and cost capabilities.
Also on the firefighting front, we introduced 5 new FLIR branded firefighting solutions at the FDIC show last week. We continue to see strong market share gains in the fire market. 
On Slide 4, you will see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect revenue to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, and EPS to be in a range of $1.60 to $1.70 for the full year, excluding the impact of the tax reserve booked in Q1.
This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 9% when compared to 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
Given project -- product margin expectations for specific programs and surveillance, consolidated gross margins in the second quarter are expected to remain near Q1 levels. These programs are winding down and thus surveillance segment, as well as consolidated margins should improve in the second half of the year. We intend to be diligent in absorbing gross margin softness through operating cost management.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on June 3 to shareholders of record as of May 20. 
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the first quarter financial results. Amit?"

First quarter consolidated revenue was $379.5 million, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Currency continued to negatively impact the top line and particularly for the instruments and maritime segments, which to a lesser degree than we've experienced in the prior quarters. 
Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenue would have been up about 12% compared to prior year. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the Detection, Security, OEM and Emerging and Surveillance segment increasing 61%, 21%, 20% and 10%, respectively.
Maritime revenues improved 1% while Instrument experienced a 5% decline driven primarily by softness in the midrange of the building and predictive maintenance spot lines. On a currency adjusted basis, Maritime revenues would be up 5% and Instruments down 3%. 
Recently, revenue increased in all geographies except Europe, led by 78% [ph] growth in Canada, Latin America and 17% growth in the U.S.
Sales to the U.S. government increased $32 million or 61% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Consolidated first quarter gross margin was 47%, a 4 percentage point decline compared to last year primarily driven by product and segment mix changes, manufacturing cost absorption from inventory adjustments comparative pressures and security retail channels and nonreoccurrence of favorable exchange related gain from last year.
Operating expenses increased by $10 million or 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the addition of expenses related to the DVTel [ph] business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and some corporate expense credits that were recognized in 2015 and did not repeat in 2016.
Our operating margin sales from 19.1% [ph] in the first quarter of 2015 to 15.1% this year primarily due to the decline in our gross margin. Our tax expense in the first [ph] quarter was $54.5 million, which is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of 26% plus reserves for discrete tax items totaling $14 [ph] million. These reserves are primarily associated with the previously disclosed European Commission decision against the Belgian tax authorities.
The Belgian government is currently appealing the decision. The final exposure to FLIR, if any, is subject to the result of the appeal, other related litigation and any additional reductions that we maybe able to claim. The impact of these items have not been factored into our reserve. The company continues to comply with all tax laws and we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26% excluding any discrete tax items.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2016 totaled $1.1 million or $0.01 [ph] per fully diluted share. Excluding the discrete tax items, adjusted net income in the first quarter was $41.2 million, down 14% [ph] from last year, and adjusted EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.30 [ph] -- $0.34 in the first [ph] quarter of 2015. 
We closed the first quarter with cash of $510.6 million, an increase $37.8 million during the quarter primarily driven by operating cash flow. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $44.9 million or 109% of net income excluding discrete tax items.
We had capital expenditures of $10 million in the first quarter and recurrent $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter but we will continue to evaluate our opportunities to do so in subsequent quarters. 
This concludes the summary of our first quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our segment results on Slide 6. While revenue grew 10% during the quarter, first quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 5% as a result of higher operating expenses primarily from the DVTEL acquisition and lower product margins. 
Moving to Slide 7. During the first quarter, Surveillance segment revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $124.2 million. This growth was driven primarily by the manned portable and Maritime product lines.
Surveillance segment operating income of $35.2 million increased 17% [ph] versus the prior year driven largely by reductions in operating expenses. We expect Surveillance second quarter operating margins to be several points softer than the 28% seen in Q1 due to the mix of product deliveries we see in backlog. We do not expect this mix impact to continue throughout the balance of the year. 
Surveillance backlog increased from the end of 2015 to $314 [ph] million. As Andy stated, bookings of $137 million were the highest level seen for the first quarter since the [indiscernible] programs were active in the late 2000s. 
The first quarter book-to-bill ratio was a 1.1x and the 50% year-over-year bookings growth were driven by demand from customers in the Middle East and Asia. 
Turning to Slide 8. Instrument segment revenue declined 5%, or 3% on a constant-currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue of $79.4 million was negatively impacted by increased backlog during the quarter in comparison to a backlog reduction in Q1 of the prior year. In addition, we have not yet seen the recovery in the high-end building and preventive maintenance offerings, which comes from the recently introduced premium T1 [ph] key product. We are currently developing new projects to bolster our midrange building and preventive maintenance offering, which were also soft during the quarter. 
The volume products in our PPM and building line that were introduced over the last few years continue to do well during the quarter as did our OGI, Fire, Automation and science product lines. 
Instruments operating margin was 25%, a decline compared to the first quarter of 2015 as a result of increased operating expenses and higher production costs. Actions are being taken to return the segment's operating margin to its historic levels in the upper 20% range. Last week at the FDIC tradeshow, Instruments introduced 5 [ph] new products for the firefighting industry. The FLIR K33 and K53 are handheld [indiscernible], which offer the firefighter the simplicity of a single button operation but also provide 4-inch displays and FLIR's FSX technology. The KS6 is the first thermal camera designed [indiscernible] to provide better tactical awareness in directing firefighting activities. 
FLIR also introduced 2 versions of its aerial responder kit which provides firefighters and first responders a ready to fly terrain base system with powerful thermal imaging capabilities, enabling users to be able to assess a scene from an aerial perspective. 
On Slide 9 is our segment -- Security segment results. Revenue of $47.1 million was up 21% year-over-year. Visible Spectrum products grew nearly 4% but were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in our high-end, high margin thermal product deliveries. Thermal products are often sold into large installation projects that do not occur on a regular [indiscernible] which can cause lumpy thermal product revenue. 
Security operating profitability were lost in the quarter due to the gross margins pressure associated with price reductions for certain slower moving product inventory, product mix shift to lower-margin consumer offering and higher operating expenses primarily from the acquisition of DVTEL.  The DVTEL integration is ramping at a measured pace but we intend to realize meaningful synergies in the coming quarters. 
The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 10. OEM and Emerging first quarter revenue was up 20% over last year to $47.8 million. Growth was broad across the product lines with particular strength in [indiscernible] FLIR ONE and the new FLIR Vue drone-compatible camera product line. OEM in emerging operating profit was $10 million in the quarter with margins largely in line with the prior year. 
In April, OEM and Emerging announced [indiscernible] an important addition to its [indiscernible] core family of products. The powerful yet tiny will provide a smaller, less power consuming if highly advanced thermal camera core to both our OEM customers as well as internal teams.
Boson's use have an advanced system on-chip vector processor enables the FLIR XIR video processing algorithms for highly enhanced imaging quality with low power consumption. The Boson's internal processing capabilities are expandable, so customers can add software algorithms suitable for their specific needs. 
Since the end of last year, OEM and Emerging has added 2 significant new customers for its Lepton core, each with a particularly interesting thermal-enabled value proposition to their end users. The bulletproof announced the CAT S60 smartphone for the industrial and trade professional that features thermal imaging capability to empower these customers with the ability to preemptively identify jobsite issues before they become significant problems. And in April, Scott Safety announced the integration of Lepton into an SCVA face mask for firefighters, enabling firefighters to see through smoke and hot spots in a fully integrated hands-free way. 
Also during the first quarter, OEM and Emerging intelligent track systems business introduced the Lepton based [indiscernible]. The first thermal traffic camera featuring WiFi-tracking technology to provide traffic engineers with a differentiated, highly reliable solutions to protect vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians in an urban environments. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenue was $51.7 million, growing 1% over the prior year, 5% on a constant-currency basis. Maritime operating income was $5 million in the quarter, up 4% over the prior year. In February, Raymarine introduced the Dragonfly 7 Pro, the 7-inch version of the award-winning Dragonfly 5. The 7 Pro utilizes sound vision sonar with flight spectrum multifrequency technology, which creates underwater sonar imagery.
On Slide 13, you will see the Detection segment first quarter summary. Revenue was up 61% year-over-year to $29.3 million. Growth was seen across all Detection product lines with the DR SKO program growing significantly over the prior year due to the timing of shipments. The revenue increased at slightly higher gross margins and nearly unchanged level of operating expenses drove Detection operating profit growth of 200% over the prior year. Detection backlog finished the year at $97 million, an increase of $15 [ph] million from the end of 2015. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's first quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy"

Operating expense controls were not fully effective in making up the gross margin softness. We expect gross margins to return to the 48% to 50% range in the second half of the year and we intend to focus on operating costs as we navigate through the year. 
As demonstrated by the product launches discussed this morning, the innovation engine within the company is strong. This is driving a continued progression in the expansion of military, commercial and consumer markets. 
We are now fully integrated into our first smartphone, which has been a long-term objective to increase overall volume, build awareness and increase adoption.
We continue to innovate across all sensor performance years as shown with the evolving versions of Lepton and now the introduction of the revolutionary new Boson camera core. We've already begun developing next-generation FLIR branded products based on this advanced sensor.

To your point about what's happening with new products, we -- as we introduce new products, those products fully support the long-term objective gross margin objectives of the company, and I don't have any concern around that. The area where we see margin challenges is -- are primarily with -- in the Surveillance segment where we have some larger programs that were booked some time ago that are nearing their completion. And these are programs like the MSE program for the border patrol, and the program for the Coast Guard. And these are programs that were bid pretty aggressively early in the product development cycle and as a result have lower than corporate average margins and they pulled down the overall margins particularly of that segment. The good news about that strategy, though, is it establishes credibility for those products and allows us to sell those products much more effectively in international markets having the backing of major U.S. users behind them. And in those specific situations we're selling them internationally. They fully support the corporate overall gross margin objectives."

The first issue is that midrange of our product-value ladder, those are actually some of the oldest products that we have in our product value ladder. So from a product development standpoint, we've been very focused on low end. We've had tremendous success in there, this usually successful product for us following on the heels of our EX product range. And also the IGM test and measurement products that we have introduced and those are the traditional test and measurement products that have Lepton injected into them have been doing extremely well in the market. So we've got a very solid lower end as part of our corner of the strategy. Up on the other end of the spectrum and again to our control the corner strategy, we watched the T1K product. That's a product that's getting traction now. When you have a premium product like that, that is typically a product that's involved in a replacement cycle of equipment, the adoption rate of products like that tends to take longer than one would expect because it is capital allocation type of budgeting process that's required to purchase that product given its price point. But we're seeing that to start get traction. Midrange to the segment, which is our series and our TXXX series, those are products that are the oldest of the product portfolio. Their due for a refresh at this point. They're still quite competitive in the market, but I think that when you look at the feature set that are coming in advanced new products like the C2 and then the T1K at the other end of the spectrum, it's quite attractive to customers. And we'll see this feature sets and capabilities into that midrange product, those products are under development now and are expected to be out within the next 6 to 12 months and they will rebolster that midsection. We also expect that to go somewhat hand-in-hand with the large number of systems and users that we brought into the fold with those lower end products, are likely to be candidates for people who are going to want to upgrade to high-performance units after they've been using a product like a C2 or an in IGM product for years, so we've had a very good track record of moving people up the value ladder after they see the value proposition that comes from thermal imaging."

And here, we also have kind of a tough comp relative to last year. We -- the number of cool cameras that we sold in the Security segment in Q1 was down rather significantly versus Q1 of '15. And that's a business attempt to be kind of lumpy because they're going after these large infrastructure or enterprise class customers so they can be a bit lumpy. And when those projects do have a high concentration of those cool thermal cameras, there's a lot of margin in those. We did see growth of our uncooled thermal cameras during the quarter, but it was not enough to offset fairly significant decline as a result of lumpiness of the cool camera business. We think that the prospect, though, over the rest of the year, for the thermal business is quite good. The value proposition there is still quite strong and we continue to introduce new products in that space. And it really is a key thesis of the success of that business is to be successful in thermal and continue to drive thermal. And that's bolstered now by having the integration of a full video management system and our 360 C2 surveillance platform, the integration of those 3 things offers a much more turnkey solution for customers that are doing large-scale perimeter security applications."

The -- we see the gross margins manifest themselves lower when we have segment like Surveillance, which is normally pulling the overall margins up, have margins that are below our target average. And again, that happens when we have strong deliveries into a program, typically U.S. program of record by programm where we have lower than normal gross margins. So that's something we're watching very closely. But we continue to have the ability to bring in new business, to book and bill business, the international business that we bring into surveillance, as margins that is -- that are well above the average margin for the quarter so that these things offset each other. You're correct that when we integrate businesses like Security or Raymarine that have inherently lower gross margins and those businesses represent the larger percentage of total for FLIR that it can pull down the overall gross and operating margins for the business, and I think that, that's something that we can see coming from a fairway up. And in each of these businesses, we continue to make sure that we have products within those businesses, the thermal content products within those businesses that generate higher gross margins, that help to bring up the overall gross margins that business and offset the lower margins associated with the consumer and retail aspects of those business. I'd say a prime example is in the security space where we acquired DVTEL. We've integrated our 360 surveillance business. Those are 2 software-oriented businesses that can support much higher gross margins that will help to bring out the overall gross margin levels of the security business."

And it's possible that there maybe some pull forward from Q2 and that -- in those bookings that we have. The business is still a bit challenging to forecast in that space. And we've now seen a couple of back-to-back very strong quarters in terms of overall bookings growth. I think Q4 was up 26% in Surveillance, and Q1 was up 50%. And bookings, we're very pleased to see that, but the visibility is still a bit challenging on that front. The overall feel from the market is good. It seems like, more frequently than not, we've got new requirements that are coming in that weren't identified clearly in our forecast and I've been in that space before in my career. And it's a good indication that demand is increasing and of course, it's very much in line with how we operated the company. Our CDMQ model affords us the ability to be very responsive in a short period of time to urgent needs. And we're seeing more of that urgent need requirement.

This is an area that I mentioned in the prepared comments we feel we're doing quite well from a market share gain standpoint. And we're building on that success through the launch of 5 new products, that were launched at FDIC those 2 new handheld products, 1 dedicated product that announced at the top of a ladder-truck-ladder for aerial surveillance. And then 2 dJI drone-based products for drone-based aerial surveillance for firefighters which is becoming an increasingly popular tool to have at a fire scene. I think this is part of our strategy, it's one of our key 6 [ph] strategic pillars to identify and attack new viable markets. And firefighting is one. The market has been around for a while. The value proposition for thermal is incredibly strong there. We have a strong capability to create products and to innovate new products. And what we're doing is not only building the value ladder of handheld products to have not only the most attractive opening price point all the way through the upper corner to a very attractive and well priced NFPA system with our K65, but also to inject a couple of easy-to-use products in that and expand the overall product category by solving other problems that we're learning from firefighters, which really come around. We need to get an aerial view of what's going on in the fire scene and that can done both from a ladder and a UAV. So we feel that we should see that fire segment growth bolstered by the expansion of the applications within that segment. And that's been a key strategy for us as we work to offset some of the softness that we're seeing in the midrange of the product lying in instruments."

First  we talked about in the prepared comments, the 2 new OEMs we established with Lepton, one being the CAT phone and the second being the Scott site. Both of those are completely new applications. I don't see those as being cannibalizing. They offer completely new capabilities to those 2 OEMs. And I think that they will generate significant interest with other players in that market. So clearly, the launch of the CAT S60 phone number has got a number of other smartphone manufacturers looking at that. When that product gets launched and starts getting traction later this summer, we think that there will be other parties that are going to be serious about looking at that capability for inclusion into their devices as well. And similarly, when you look at firefighting, and SCBA is one of the most common pieces of the turnout here, and integrating a thermal imager directly into an SCBA offers ancillary capability that a lot of firefighters have been looking for, so we think that product concept is going to do well. 2 other areas that I'll mention, one is the introduction of Boson. So we've got a completely new core here, a core that has a very powerful system on-chip vector processor embedded in it that can host a number of different image improvement algorithms, automatic detection, artificial intelligence algorithms, and it's a system on-chip that also supports all the typical peripherals that you have in a handheld system display, battery control, USB, memory, those user interface, those kinds of things. So that will make it easier for people to create products around that core. And I think should drive future business for the OEM group. Also the fact that core is available with 15 different fields of views and 2 different resolutions. Gives a lot of flexibility to its system developers. And then the last thing that I'll mention is we continue to get traction in the OEM space with automotive. We've got Cadillac that's just began shipping units with CT 6. And it seems like it's getting good response. And we continue to have other auto manufacturers in the hopper there. It's been a slow go, getting traction with night vision, but its one that's gaining steam in terms of adoption rates."

And I want to welcome everyone to FLIR's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Shane Harrison. 
I will start with a review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $379 million, up 10% from the prior year and up 12% on a constant-currency basis. Commercial product revenues grew 4% over the first quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 20%. 
Earnings per share were $0.01, which were negatively affected by a $40 million charge to establish reserves booked in the quarter, primarily related to an excess profit ruling dispute between Belgium and the European Commission, which Amit will discuss in more detail. Excluding these charges, earnings were $0.30 per share, which compares with $0.34 per share in the prior year. 
First quarter operating income was $57 million compared to $66 million in the prior year. As we mentioned in our outlook commentary last quarter, the first quarter of 2015 proved to be a difficult comparable as it was a quarter that had lower-than-normal corporate costs as well as other strong -- as well as our strongest gross margins in the past 3 years due to foreign exchange and a strong surveillance product mix.
Bookings of $379 million were the highest first quarter order intake we've seen in over 5 years. Backlog continues to grow, reaching $613 million, which is the highest level since 2008. Surveillance segment bookings grew 50% over the prior year, driven by strong international orders. 
We introduced several new products since our last call, including the new Boson thermal camera core. This innovative new core is priced and has performance above our Lepton microcamera core, and it features a powerful onboard processing capabilities, enabled by a programmable, Movidius vision processing unit. Boson features our latest 12-micron pixel design and is offered in VGA and QVGA resolutions, with 15 different field-of-view options to choose from, each of which use internally produced optical components. Boson's revolutionary size, weight and onboard processing power will open up new applications and uses for our technology, given its versatility and low-power consumption. 
On the Lepton front, we've been successfully integrated into 2 new OEM product platforms during the quarter. First was the announcement of the ruggedized CAT-branded smartphone that will feature thermal imaging and a FLIR app that will provide building professionals, electricians and first responders the ability to measure surface temperature from a distance, identify mechanical and electrical problems, spot moisture and missing insulation, see in total darkness or see through smoke. 
Second was the Scott Sight, hands-free thermal imaging system from Scott Safety, which is the first head-mounted thermal imaging system to have a microdisplay integrated inside the SCBA mask. Both of these products take full advantage of Lepton's industry-leading size, weight, power and cost capabilities.
Also on the firefighting front, we introduced 5 new FLIR-branded firefighting solutions at the FDIC show last week. We continue to see strong market share gains in the fire market. 
On Slide 4, you will see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect revenue to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, and EPS to be in a range of $1.60 to $1.70 for the full year, excluding the impact of the tax reserve booked in Q1. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 9% when compared to 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
Given project -- product margin expectations for specific programs and surveillance, consolidated gross margins in the second quarter are expected to remain near Q1 levels. These programs are winding down, and thus, surveillance segment as well as consolidated margins should improve in the second half of the year. We intend to be diligent in absorbing gross margin softness through operating cost management.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on June 3 to shareholders of record as of May 20. 
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the first quarter financial results. Amit?"

First quarter consolidated revenue was $379.5 million, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Currency continued to negatively impact the top line and particularly, for the instruments and maritime segments, but to a lesser degree than we have experienced in prior quarters. 
Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenue would have been up about 12% compared to prior year. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the Detection, Security, OEM & Emerging and Surveillance segments, increasing 61%, 21%, 20% and 10%, respectively.
Maritime revenues improved 1% while Instruments experienced a 5% decline, driven primarily by softness in the midrange of the Building & Predictive Maintenance product lines. On a currency adjusted basis, Maritime revenues would be up 5% and Instruments down 3%. 
Recently, revenue increased in all geographies except Europe, led by 78% growth in Canada, Latin America and 17% growth in the U.S.  Sales to the U.S. government increased $32 million or 61% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Consolidated first quarter gross margin was 47%, a 4 percentage point decline compared to last year, primarily driven by product and segment mix changes, manufacturing cost absorption from inventory adjustments, comparative pressures and security retail channels and nonrecurrence of favorable exchange-related gain from last year.
Operating expenses increased by $10 million or 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and some corporate expense credits that were recognized in 2015 and did not repeat in 2016.
Our operating margin fell from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2015 to 15.1% this year, primarily due to the decline in our gross margin. Our tax expense in the first quarter was $54.5 million, which is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of 26%, plus reserves for discrete tax items totaling $40 million. These reserves are primarily associated with the previously disclosed European Commission decision against the Belgian tax authorities.
The Belgian government is currently appealing the decision. The final exposure to FLIR, if any, is subject to the result of the appeal, other related litigation and the determination of any additional deductions that we may be able to claim. The impact of these items have not been factored into our reserve. The company continues to comply with all tax laws, and we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%, excluding any discrete tax items.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2016 totaled $1.1 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share. Excluding the discrete tax items, adjusted net income in the first quarter was $41.2 million, down 14% from last year, and adjusted EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.30 -- $0.34 in the first quarter of 2015. 
We closed the first quarter with cash of $510.6 million, an increase of $37.8 million during the quarter, primarily driven by operating cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $44.9 million or 109% of net income, excluding the discrete tax items.
We had capital expenditures of $10 million in the first quarter and returned $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter, but we will continue to evaluate our opportunities to do so in subsequent quarters. 
This concludes the summary of our first quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our segment results on Slide 6. While revenue grew 10% during the quarter, first quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 5% as a result of higher operating expenses, primarily from the DVTEL acquisition and lower product margins. 
Moving to Slide 7. During the first quarter, Surveillance segment revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $124.2 million. This growth was driven primarily by the Man Portable and Maritime product lines.
Surveillance segment operating income of $35.2 million increased 17% versus the prior year, driven largely by reductions in operating expenses. We expect Surveillance second quarter operating margins to be several points softer than the 28% seen in Q1 due to the mix of product deliveries we see in backlog. We do not expect this mix impact to continue throughout the balance of the year. Surveillance backlog increased from the end of 2015 to $314 million. As Andy stated, bookings of $137 million were the highest level seen for the first quarter since the RAID and G-BOSS programs were active in the late 2000s. 
The first quarter book-to-bill ratio was a 1.1x, and the 50% year-over-year bookings growth were driven by demand from customers in the Middle East and Asia. 
Turning to Slide 8. Instruments segment revenue declined 5%, or 3% on a constant-currency basis, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue of $79.4 million was negatively impacted by increased backlog during the quarter in comparison to a backlog reduction in Q1 of the prior year. In addition, we have not yet seen the recovery in the high-end Building & Predictive Maintenance offerings, which should come from the recently introduced premium T1K product. We are currently developing new products to bolster our midrange Building & Predictive Maintenance offering, which were also soft during the quarter. 
The volume products in our PPM and building line that were introduced over the last few years continue to do well during the quarter, as did our OGI, fire, automation and science product lines. 
Instruments operating margin was 25%, a decline compared to the first quarter of 2015 as a result of increased operating expenses and higher production costs. Actions are being taken to return the segment's operating margin to its historic levels in the upper 20% range. 
Last week at the FDIC tradeshow, Itrade shownstruments introduced 5 new products for the firefighting industry. The FLIR K33 and K53 are handheld TICs, which offer the firefighter the simplicity of a single-button operation, but also provide 4-inch displays and FLIR's FSX technology. The KF6 is the first thermal camera designed mounting on fire engine ladders to provide better tactical awareness in directing firefighter activities. FLIR also introduced 2 versions of its aerial responder kit, which provides firefighters and first responders a ready-to-fly drone-based system with powerful thermal imaging capabilities, enabling users to be able to assess a scene from an aerial perspective. 
On Slide 9 is our segment -- Security segment results. Revenue of $47.1 million was up 21% year-over-year. Visible spectrum products grew nearly 40% but were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in our high-end, high-margin thermal product deliveries. Thermal products are often sold into large installation projects that do not occur on a regular cadence, which can cause lumpy thermal product revenue. 
Security operating profitability fell to a lost in the quarter due to the gross margin's pressure associated with price reductions for certain slower-moving Lorex product inventory, a product mix shift to lower-margin consumer offering and higher operating expenses, primarily from the acquisition of DVTEL. The DVTEL integration is ramping at a measured pace, but we intend to realize meaningful synergies in the coming quarters. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 10. OEM & Emerging first quarter revenue was up 20% over last year to $47.8 million. Growth was broad across the product lines, with particular strength in uncooled cored, FLIR ONE and the new FLIR Vue drone-compatible camera product line. OEM & Emerging operating profit was $10 million in the quarter, with margins largely in line with the prior year. 
In April, OEM & Emerging announced Boson, an important addition to its uncooled core family of products. The powerful yet tiny Boson will provide a smaller, less power consuming and highly advanced thermal camera core to both our OEM customers as well as our internal teams.  Boson's use of an advanced system-on-chip vector processor enables the FLIR XIR video processing algorithms for highly enhanced image quality with low power consumption. The Boson's internal processing capabilities are expandable, so customers can add software and algorithms suitable for their specific needs. 
Since the end of last year, OEM & Emerging has added 2 significant new customers for its Lepton core, each with a particularly interesting thermal-enabled value proposition to their end users. The Bullitt group announced the CAT S60 ruggedized smartphone for the industrial and trade professional that features thermal imaging capability to empower these customers with the ability to preemptively identify job site issues before they become significant problems. And in April, Scott Safety announced the integration of Lepton into an SCBA facemask for firefighters, enabling firefighters to see through smoke and find hot spots in a fully integrated and hands-free way. 
Also during the first quarter, OEM & Emerging intelligent traffic systems business introduced the Lepton-based TrafiOne, the first thermal traffic camera featuring WiFi-tracking technology to provide traffic engineers with a differentiated, highly reliable solution to detect vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians in an urban environment.
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenue was $51.7 million, growing 1% over the prior year, 5% on a constant-currency basis. Maritime operating income was $5 million in the quarter, up 4% over the prior year. In February, Raymarine introduced the Dragonfly 7 Pro, the 7-inch version of the award-winning Dragonfly 5. The 7 Pro utilizes DownVision sonar with wide-spectrum CHIRP multifrequency transmission technology, which creates photo-like underwater sonar imagery.
On Slide 13, you will see the Detection segment's first quarter summary. Revenue was up 61% year-over-year to $29.3 million. Growth was seen across all Detection product lines with the DR SKO program growing significantly over the prior year due to the timing of shipments. The revenue increased at slightly higher gross margins and a nearly unchanged level of operating expense drove Detection operating profit growth of 200% over the prior year. Detection backlog finished the year at $97 million, an increase of $15 million from the end of 2015. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's first quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy"

As demonstrated by the product launches discussed this morning, the innovation engine within the company is strong. This is driving a continued progression in the expansion of military, commercial and consumer markets. 
We are now fully integrated into our first smartphone, which has been a long-term objective to increase overall volume, build awareness and increase adoption. We continue to innovate across all sensor performance tiers as shown with the evolving versions of Lepton and now the introduction of the revolutionary new Boson camera core.

There are some price effects in the Security segment where we're facing stronger competition there, but it's a small piece of the puzzle. To your point about what's happening with new products, we -- as we introduce new products, those products fully support the long-term objective -- gross margin objectives of the company, and I don't have a concern around that. The area where we see margin challenges is -- are primarily with -- in the Surveillance segment, where we have some larger programs that were booked some time ago that are nearing their completion, and these are programs like the MSC program for the U.S. Border Patrol and the PB-EOS program for the Coast Guard. And these are programs that were bid pretty aggressively early in the product development cycle and as a result have lower than corporate average margins, and they pulled down the overall margins particularly of that segment. The good news about that strategy, though, is it establishes credibility for those products and allows us to sell those products much more effectively in international markets, having the backing of major U.S. users behind them. And in those specific situations, we're selling them internationally. They fully support the corporate overall gross margin objectives."

The first issue is that midrange of our product-value ladder, those are actually some of the oldest products that we have in our product-value ladder. So from a product development standpoint, we've been very focused on the low end. We've had tremendous success there. The C2 has been a hugely successful product for us, following on the heels of our Ex product range. And also the IGM test and measurement products that we have introduced, and those are the traditional test and measurement products that have Lepton injected into them, have been doing extremely well in the market. So we've got a very solid lower end as part of our Control the Corners strategy. Up on the other end of the spectrum and, again, to our Control the Corners strategy, we launched our T1K product. That's a product that's just getting traction now. When you have a premium product like that, that is typically a product that's involved in a replacement cycle of capital equipment, the adoption rate of products like that tends to take longer than one would expect, because it is capital allocation-type of budgeting process that's required to purchase that product given its price point. But we're seeing that start to get traction. And the midrange of the segment, which is our Exx-Series and our Txxx-Series, those are products that are the oldest of the product portfolio. Their due for a refresh at this point. They're still quite competitive in the market, but I think that when you look at the feature set that are coming in advanced new products like the C2 and then the T1K at the other end of the spectrum, it's quite attractive to customers. And we'll see blend those feature sets and capabilities into that midrange product. Those products are under development now and are expected to be out within the next 6 to 12 months, and they will rebolster that midsection. We also expect that to go somewhat hand-in-hand with the large number of systems and users that we brought into the fold, and those lower end products are likely to be candidates for people who are going to want to upgrade to higher-performance units after they've been using a product like a C2 or an IGM product for years, so we've had a very good track record of moving people up the value ladder after they see the value proposition that comes from thermal imaging."

And here, we also have kind of a tough comp relative to last year. We -- the number of cooled cameras that we sold in the Security segment in Q1 was down rather significantly versus Q1 of '15. And that's a business attempt to be kind of lumpy because you're going after these large infrastructure or enterprise class customers, and they can be a bit lumpy. And when those projects do have a high concentration of cooled thermal cameras, there's a lot of margin in those. We did see growth in our uncooled thermal cameras during the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the fairly significant decline as a result of lumpiness of the cooled camera business. We think that the prospect, though, over the rest of the year, for the thermal business is quite good. The value proposition there is still quite strong, and we continue to introduce new products in that space. And it really is a key thesis of the success of that business is to be successful in thermal and continue to drive thermal. And that's bolstered now by having the integration of a full video management system and our 360 C2 surveillance platform. The integration of those 3 things offers a much more turnkey solution for customers that are doing large-scale perimeter security applications."

So that's something that we're watching very closely. But we continue to have the ability to bring in new business, the book-and-bill business, the international business that we bring into Surveillance has margins that is -- that are well above the average margin for the quarter, so that these things offset each other. You're correct that when we integrate businesses like Security or Raymarine that have inherently lower gross margins, and those businesses represent a larger percentage of the total for FLIR, that it can pull down the overall gross and operating margins for the business. And I think that, that's something that we can see coming from a fair way off. And in each of those businesses, we continue to make sure that we have products within those businesses, the thermal content products within those businesses that generate higher gross margins, that help to bring up the overall gross margins of that business and offset the lower margins associated with the consumer and retail aspects of those business.

And again, we said Q2 Surveillance margins will be down again as a result of us wrapping up a couple of programs that we've got in there. There are still 3 programs that are ongoing that have lower-than-average gross margins, and these are programs that have been around for quite some time that are just in a sort of high-cadence delivery phase right now. And we've got to run those through the system, and they're going to pull overall gross margins down. I do want to underscore, though, the strong benefit that comes from programs like that because of the credibility that comes from being on these rather significant U.S. platforms. It really drives a very strong credibility for those same products in international markets."

And it's possible that there may be some pull forward from Q2 in that -- in those bookings that we have. The business is still a bit challenging to forecast in that space. And we've now seen a couple of back-to-back very strong quarters in terms of overall bookings growth. I think Q4 was up 26% in Surveillance, and Q1 was up 50% in bookings. And we're very pleased to see that, but the visibility is still a bit challenging on that front. The overall feel from the market is good. It seems like, more frequently than not, we've got new requirements that are coming in that weren't identified clearly in our forecast, and I've been in that space before in my career. And it's a good indication that demand is increasing. And of course, it's very much in line with how we operated the company. Our CDMQ model affords us ability to be very responsive in a short period of time to urgent needs. And we're seeing more of that urgent need requirement. So as a result of that, I think we're being conservative in terms of how we're looking at what the bookings look like for Q2 for Surveillance, if there was a significant pull forward from Q2 into Q1, but I would also say that there's potentially upside in that regard."

Well, starting with the firefighting space, I mean, this is an area where I mentioned in the prepared comments that we feel that we're doing quite well from a gross --  from a market share gain standpoint. And we're building on that success through the launch of 5 new products that were launched at FDIC. Those are 2 new handheld products, 1 new dedicated product that mounts at the top of a ladder-truck ladder for aerial surveillance. And then 2 DJI drone-based products for drone-based aerial surveillance for firefighters, which is becoming an increasingly popular tool to have at a fire scene. I think this is part of our strategy. It's one of our key 6 strategic pillars to identify and attack new viable markets. And firefighting is one. The market has been around for a while. The value proposition of thermal is incredibly strong there. We have a strong capability to create products and to innovate new products. And what we're doing here is not only building the value ladder of handheld products to have not only the most attractive opening price point all the way through the upper corner to a very attractive and well-priced NFPA system with our K65, but also to inject a couple of easy-to-use products in that and expand the overall product category by solving other problems that we're learning from firefighters, which really come around. We need to get an aerial view of what's going on in the fire scene, and that can be done both from a ladder and a UAV. So we feel that we should see that fire segment's growth bolstered by the expansion of new applications within that segment. And that's been a key strategy for us as we work to offset some of the softness that we're seeing in the midrange of the product lying in Instruments."

First, we talked about in the prepared comments, the 2 new OEMs that we have established with Lepton, one being the CAT phone and the second being the Scott Sight. Both of those are completely new applications. I don't see those as being cannibalizing. They offer completely new capabilities to those 2 OEMs. And I think that they will generate significant interest with other players in that market. So clearly, the launch of the CAT S60 phone has gotten a number of other smartphone manufacturers looking at that. And when that product gets launched and starts getting traction later this summer, we think that there will be other parties that are going to be serious about looking at that capability for inclusion into their devices as well. And similarly, when you look at firefighting, and SCBA is one of the most common pieces of the turnout here, and integrating a thermal imager directly into an SCBA offers an ancillary capability that a lot of firefighters have been looking for. So we think that, that product concept is going to do well. 2 other areas that I'll mention, one is the introduction of Boson. So we've got a completely new core here, a core that has a very powerful system-on-chip vector processor embedded in it that can host a number of different image improvement algorithms, automatic detection, artificial intelligence algorithms. And it's a system-on-chip that also supports all the typical peripherals that you have in a handheld system display, battery control, USB, memory, those user interface, those kinds of things. So that will make it easier for people to create products around that core, and I think should drive future business for the OEM group. Also the fact that, that core is available with 15 different fields of views and 2 different resolutions gives a lot of flexibility to system developers. And then the last thing that I'll mention is we continue to get traction in the OEM space with automotive. We've got Cadillac that just began shipping units with CT6. And it seems like it's getting a good response, and we continue to have other auto manufacturers in the hopper there. So it's been a slow go, getting traction with night vision, but it's one that is gaining steam in terms of its adoption rates."

Also, the development of the Boson core with its embedded vector processor -- vision processor that is inside that unit, we can develop algorithms for that for video analytics and artificial intelligence that can be applied across multiple segments within FLIR. And that is something that -- we've got a team that is solely focused on that. It's been a long-term vision here at FLIR. It was part of the reason that we bought Traficon.

And I want to welcome everyone to FLIR's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Shane Harrison. 
I will start with a review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $379 million, up 10% from the prior year and up 12% on a constant-currency basis. Commercial product revenues grew 4% over the first quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 20%. 
Earnings per share were $0.01, which were negatively affected by a $40 million charge to establish reserves booked in the quarter, primarily related to an excess profit ruling dispute between Belgium and the European Commission, which Amit will discuss in more detail. Excluding these charges, earnings were $0.30 per share, which compares with $0.34 per share in the prior year. 
First quarter operating income was $57 million compared to $66 million in the prior year. As we mentioned in our outlook commentary last quarter, the first quarter of 2015 proved to be a difficult comparable as it was a quarter that had lower-than-normal corporate costs as well as other strong -- as well as our strongest gross margins in the past 3 years due to foreign exchange and a strong surveillance product mix.
Bookings of $379 million were the highest first quarter order intake we've seen in over 5 years. Backlog continues to grow, reaching $613 million, which is the highest level since 2008. Surveillance segment bookings grew 50% over the prior year, driven by strong international orders. 
We introduced several new products since our last call, including the new Boson thermal camera core. This innovative new core is priced and has performance above our Lepton microcamera core, and it features a powerful onboard processing capabilities, enabled by a programmable, Movidius vision processing unit. Boson features our latest 12-micron pixel design and is offered in VGA and QVGA resolutions, with 15 different field-of-view options to choose from, each of which use internally produced optical components. Boson's revolutionary size, weight and onboard processing power will open up new applications and uses for our technology, given its versatility and low-power consumption. 
On the Lepton front, we've been successfully integrated into 2 new OEM product platforms during the quarter. First was the announcement of the ruggedized CAT-branded smartphone that will feature thermal imaging and a FLIR app that will provide building professionals, electricians and first responders the ability to measure surface temperature from a distance, identify mechanical and electrical problems, spot moisture and missing insulation, see in total darkness or see through smoke. 
Second was the Scott Sight, hands-free thermal imaging system from Scott Safety, which is the first head-mounted thermal imaging system to have a microdisplay integrated inside the SCBA mask. Both of these products take full advantage of Lepton's industry-leading size, weight, power and cost capabilities.
Also on the firefighting front, we introduced 5 new FLIR-branded firefighting solutions at the FDIC show last week. We continue to see strong market share gains in the fire market. 
On Slide 4, you will see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect revenue to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, and EPS to be in a range of $1.60 to $1.70 for the full year, excluding the impact of the tax reserve booked in Q1. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 9% when compared to 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
Given project -- product margin expectations for specific programs and surveillance, consolidated gross margins in the second quarter are expected to remain near Q1 levels. These programs are winding down, and thus, surveillance segment as well as consolidated margins should improve in the second half of the year. We intend to be diligent in absorbing gross margin softness through operating cost management.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on June 3 to shareholders of record as of May 20. 
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the first quarter financial results. Amit?"

First quarter consolidated revenue was $379.5 million, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Currency continued to negatively impact the top line and particularly, for the instruments and maritime segments, but to a lesser degree than we have experienced in prior quarters. 
Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenue would have been up about 12% compared to prior year. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the Detection, Security, OEM & Emerging and Surveillance segments, increasing 61%, 21%, 20% and 10%, respectively.
Maritime revenues improved 1% while Instruments experienced a 5% decline, driven primarily by softness in the midrange of the Building & Predictive Maintenance product lines. On a currency adjusted basis, Maritime revenues would be up 5% and Instruments down 3%. 
Recently, revenue increased in all geographies except Europe, led by 78% growth in Canada, Latin America and 17% growth in the U.S.  Sales to the U.S. government increased $32 million or 61% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Consolidated first quarter gross margin was 47%, a 4 percentage point decline compared to last year, primarily driven by product and segment mix changes, manufacturing cost absorption from inventory adjustments, comparative pressures and security retail channels and nonrecurrence of favorable exchange-related gain from last year.
Operating expenses increased by $10 million or 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and some corporate expense credits that were recognized in 2015 and did not repeat in 2016.
Our operating margin fell from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2015 to 15.1% this year, primarily due to the decline in our gross margin. Our tax expense in the first quarter was $54.5 million, which is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of 26%, plus reserves for discrete tax items totaling $40 million. These reserves are primarily associated with the previously disclosed European Commission decision against the Belgian tax authorities.
The Belgian government is currently appealing the decision. The final exposure to FLIR, if any, is subject to the result of the appeal, other related litigation and the determination of any additional deductions that we may be able to claim. The impact of these items have not been factored into our reserve. The company continues to comply with all tax laws, and we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%, excluding any discrete tax items.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2016 totaled $1.1 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share. Excluding the discrete tax items, adjusted net income in the first quarter was $41.2 million, down 14% from last year, and adjusted EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.30 -- $0.34 in the first quarter of 2015. 
We closed the first quarter with cash of $510.6 million, an increase of $37.8 million during the quarter, primarily driven by operating cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $44.9 million or 109% of net income, excluding the discrete tax items.
We had capital expenditures of $10 million in the first quarter and returned $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter, but we will continue to evaluate our opportunities to do so in subsequent quarters. 
This concludes the summary of our first quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our segment results on Slide 6. While revenue grew 10% during the quarter, first quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 5% as a result of higher operating expenses, primarily from the DVTEL acquisition and lower product margins. 
Moving to Slide 7. During the first quarter, Surveillance segment revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $124.2 million. This growth was driven primarily by the Man Portable and Maritime product lines.
Surveillance segment operating income of $35.2 million increased 17% versus the prior year, driven largely by reductions in operating expenses. We expect Surveillance second quarter operating margins to be several points softer than the 28% seen in Q1 due to the mix of product deliveries we see in backlog. We do not expect this mix impact to continue throughout the balance of the year. Surveillance backlog increased from the end of 2015 to $314 million. As Andy stated, bookings of $137 million were the highest level seen for the first quarter since the RAID and G-BOSS programs were active in the late 2000s. 
The first quarter book-to-bill ratio was a 1.1x, and the 50% year-over-year bookings growth were driven by demand from customers in the Middle East and Asia. 
Turning to Slide 8. Instruments segment revenue declined 5%, or 3% on a constant-currency basis, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue of $79.4 million was negatively impacted by increased backlog during the quarter in comparison to a backlog reduction in Q1 of the prior year. In addition, we have not yet seen the recovery in the high-end Building & Preventive (sic) [ Predictive ] Maintenance offerings, which should come from the recently introduced premium T1K product. We are currently developing new products to bolster our midrange Building & Preventive (sic) [ Predictive ] Maintenance offering, which were also soft during the quarter. 
The volume products in our PPM and building line that were introduced over the last few years continue to do well during the quarter, as did our OGI, fire, automation and science product lines. 
Instruments operating margin was 25%, a decline compared to the first quarter of 2015 as a result of increased operating expenses and higher production costs. Actions are being taken to return the segment's operating margin to its historic levels in the upper 20% range. 
Last week at the FDIC tradeshow, Instruments introduced 5 new products for the firefighting industry. The FLIR K33 and K53 are handheld TICs, which offer the firefighter the simplicity of a single-button operation, but also provide 4-inch displays and FLIR's FSX technology. The KF6 is the first thermal camera designed mounting on fire engine ladders to provide better tactical awareness in directing firefighter activities. FLIR also introduced 2 versions of its aerial responder kit, which provides firefighters and first responders a ready-to-fly drone-based system with powerful thermal imaging capabilities, enabling users to be able to assess a scene from an aerial perspective. 
On Slide 9 is our segment -- Security segment results. Revenue of $47.1 million was up 21% year-over-year. Visible spectrum products grew nearly 40% but were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in our high-end, high-margin thermal product deliveries. Thermal products are often sold into large installation projects that do not occur on a regular cadence, which can cause lumpy thermal product revenue. 
Security operating profitability fell to a loss in the quarter due to the gross margin's pressure associated with price reductions for certain slower-moving Lorex product inventory, a product mix shift to lower-margin consumer offering and higher operating expenses, primarily from the acquisition of DVTEL. The DVTEL integration is ramping at a measured pace, but we intend to realize meaningful synergies in the coming quarters. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 10. OEM & Emerging first quarter revenue was up 20% over last year to $47.8 million. Growth was broad across the product lines, with particular strength in Uncooled Cores, FLIR ONE and the new FLIR Vue drone-compatible camera product line. OEM & Emerging operating profit was $10 million in the quarter, with margins largely in line with the prior year. 
In April, OEM & Emerging announced Boson, an important addition to its Uncooled Core family of products. The powerful yet tiny Boson will provide a smaller, less power consuming and highly advanced thermal camera core to both our OEM customers as well as our internal teams.  Boson's use of an advanced system-on-chip vector processor enables the FLIR XIR video processing algorithms for highly enhanced image quality with low power consumption. The Boson's internal processing capabilities are expandable, so customers can add software and algorithms suitable for their specific needs. 
Since the end of last year, OEM & Emerging has added 2 significant new customers for its Lepton core, each with a particularly interesting thermal-enabled value proposition to their end users. The Bullitt group announced the CAT S60 ruggedized smartphone for the industrial and trade professional that features thermal imaging capability to empower these customers with the ability to preemptively identify job site issues before they become significant problems. And in April, Scott Safety announced the integration of Lepton into an SCBA facemask for firefighters, enabling firefighters to see through smoke and find hot spots in a fully integrated and hands-free way. 
Also during the first quarter, OEM & Emerging intelligent traffic systems business introduced the Lepton-based TrafiOne, the first thermal traffic camera featuring WiFi-tracking technology to provide traffic engineers with a differentiated, highly reliable solution to detect vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians in an urban environment.
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenue was $51.7 million, growing 1% over the prior year, 5% on a constant-currency basis. Maritime operating income was $5 million in the quarter, up 4% over the prior year. In February, Raymarine introduced the Dragonfly 7 Pro, the 7-inch version of the award-winning Dragonfly 5. The 7 Pro utilizes DownVision sonar with wide-spectrum CHIRP multifrequency transmission technology, which creates photo-like underwater sonar imagery.
On Slide 13, you will see the Detection segment's first quarter summary. Revenue was up 61% year-over-year to $29.3 million. Growth was seen across all Detection product lines with the DR SKO program growing significantly over the prior year due to the timing of shipments. The revenue increased at slightly higher gross margins and a nearly unchanged level of operating expense drove Detection operating profit growth of 200% over the prior year. Detection backlog finished the year at $97 million, an increase of $15 million from the end of 2015. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's first quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy"

While revenues met our expectation of 10% growth, profit margins did not. Gross margins were impacted by a number of factors that we feel are temporary. Operating expense controls were not fully effective in making up the gross margin softness. We expect gross margins to return to the 48% to 50% range in the second half of the year, and we intend to focus on operating costs as we navigate through the year. 
As demonstrated by the product launches discussed this morning, the innovation engine within the company is strong. This is driving a continued progression in the expansion of military, commercial and consumer markets. 
We are now fully integrated into our first smartphone, which has been a long-term objective to increase overall volume, build awareness and increase adoption. We continue to innovate across all sensor performance tiers as shown with the evolving versions of Lepton and now the introduction of the revolutionary new Boson camera core. We've already begun developing next-generation FLIR-branded products based on this advanced sensor.

So what you're seeing here is not an effect of aggressive discounting to get sales to happen. There are some price effects in the Security segment where we're facing stronger competition there, but it's a small piece of the puzzle. To your point about what's happening with new products, we -- as we introduce new products, those products fully support the long-term objective -- gross margin objectives of the company, and I don't have a concern around that. The area where we see margin challenges is -- are primarily within the Surveillance segment, where we have some larger programs that were booked some time ago that are nearing their completion, and these are programs like the MSC program for the U.S. Border Patrol and the PB-EOS program for the Coast Guard. And these are programs that were bid pretty aggressively early in the product development cycle and as a result have lower than corporate average margins, and they pull down the overall margins particularly of that segment. The good news about that strategy, though, is it establishes credibility for those products and allows us to sell those products much more effectively in international markets, having the backing of major U.S. users behind them. And in those specific situations where we're selling them internationally they fully support the corporate overall gross margin objectives."

When you have a premium product like that, that is typically a product that's involved in a replacement cycle of capital equipment, the adoption rate of products like that tends to take longer than one would expect, because it is capital allocation-type of budgeting process that's required to purchase that product given its price point. But we're seeing that start to get traction. And the midrange of the segment, which is our Exx-Series and our Txxx-Series, those are products that are the oldest of the product portfolio. Their due for a refresh at this point. They're still quite competitive in the market, but I think that the -- you look at the feature sets that are coming in advanced new products like the C2 and then the T1K at the other end of the spectrum, it's quite attractive to customers. And we'll see blend those feature sets and capabilities into that midrange product. Those products are under development now and are expected to be out within the next 6 to 12 months, and they will rebolster that midsection. We also expect that to go somewhat hand-in-hand with the large number of systems and users that we brought into the fold at those lower end products are likely to be candidates for people who are going to want to upgrade to higher-performance units after they've been using a product like a C2 or an IGM product for year or so. We've had a very good track record of moving people up the value ladder after they see the value proposition that comes from thermal imaging."

The products, from a brand standpoint, had been well integrated at this point and are represented on the website as such. And from a technical standpoint, the compatibility links that were necessary between the FLIR professional and thermal visible products and the DVTEL video management system have all been put in place and tested at this point.

So we saw a mix shift to the consumer offering, so that was one impact. We also did have some onetime events related to moving some of the slower-moving inventory that we saw in the channel in the Lorex, and we wanted to deal with it early in the product life cycle rather than waiting till later when it could become a much larger issue. So we dealt with it. It's been done. And so that was kind of a onetime piece. So those 2 were the major pieces that impacted the gross margin in Security."

And here, we also had kind of a tough comp relative to last year. We -- the number of cooled cameras that we sold in the Security segment in Q1 was down rather significantly versus Q1 of '15. And that's a business that tends to be kind of lumpy because you're going after these large infrastructure or enterprise class customers, and they can be a bit lumpy. And when those projects do have a high concentration of cooled thermal cameras, there's a lot of margin in those. We did see growth in our uncooled thermal cameras during the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the fairly significant decline as a result of lumpiness of the cooled camera business. We think that the prospect, though, over the rest of the year, for the thermal business is quite good. The value proposition there is still quite strong, and we continue to introduce new products in that space. And it really is a key thesis of the success of that business is to be successful in thermal and continue to drive thermal. And that's bolstered now by having the integration of a full video management system and our 360 C2 surveillance platform. The integration of those 3 things offers a much more turnkey solution for customers that are doing large-scale perimeter security applications."

The -- we see the gross margins manifest themselves lower when we have a segment like Surveillance, which is normally pulling the overall margins up, have margins that are below our target average. And again, that happens when we have strong deliveries into a program, typically U.S. program of record type program where we have lower than normal gross margins. So that's something that we're watching very closely. But we continue to have the ability to bring in new business, the book-and-bill business, the international business that we bring into Surveillance has margins that is -- that are well above the average margin for the quarter, so that these things offset each other. You're correct that when we integrate businesses like Security or Raymarine that have inherently lower gross margins, and those businesses represent a larger percentage of the total for FLIR, that it can pull down the overall gross and operating margins for the business. And I think that, that's something that we can see coming from a fair way off. And in each of those businesses, we continue to make sure that we have products within those businesses, the thermal content products within those businesses that generate higher gross margins, that help to bring up the overall gross margins of that business and offset the lower margins associated with the consumer and retail aspects of those business. I'd say a prime example is in the Security space where we acquired DVTEL, we've integrated our 360 Surveillance business. Those are 2 software-oriented businesses that can support much higher gross margins that will help to bring up the overall gross margin levels for the Security business."

And we're very pleased to see that, but the visibility is still a bit challenging on that front. The overall feel from the market is good. It seems like, more frequently than not, we've got new requirements that are coming in that weren't identified clearly in our forecast, and I've been in that space before in my career. And it's a good indication that demand is increasing. And of course, it's very much in line with how we operated the company. Our CDMQ model affords us ability to be very responsive in a short period of time to urgent needs. And we're seeing more of that urgent need requirement.

Well, starting with the firefighting space, I mean, this is an area where I mentioned in the prepared comments that we feel that we're doing quite well from a gross --  from a market share gain standpoint.

Those are 2 new handheld products, 1 new dedicated product that mounts at the top of a ladder-truck ladder for aerial surveillance and then 2 DJI drone-based products for drone-based aerial surveillance for firefighters, which is becoming an increasingly popular tool to have at a fire scene. I think this is part of our strategy. It's one of our key 6 strategic pillars to identify and attack new viable markets. And firefighting is one. The market has been around for a while. The value proposition of thermal is incredibly strong there. We have a strong capability to create products and to innovate new products. And what we're doing here is not only building the value ladder of handheld products to have not only the most attractive opening price point all the way through the upper corner to a very attractive and well-priced NFPA system with our K65, but also to inject a couple of easy-to-use products in that and expand the overall product category by solving other problems that we're learning from firefighters, which really come around we need to get an aerial view of what's going on in the fire scene, and that can be done both from a ladder and a UAV. So we feel that we should see that fire segment's growth bolstered by the expansion of new applications within that segment.

So clearly, the launch of the CAT S60 phone has gotten a number of other smartphone manufacturers looking at that. And when that product gets launched and starts getting traction later this summer, we think that there will be other parties that are going to be serious about looking at that capability for inclusion into their devices as well. And similarly, when you look at firefighting, and SCBA is one of the most common pieces of the turnout gear, and integrating a thermal imager directly into an SCBA offers a hands-free capability that a lot of firefighters have been looking for. So we think that, that product concept is going to do well. 
Two other areas that I'll mention, one is the introduction of Boson. So we've got a completely new core here, a core that has a very powerful system-on-chip vector processor embedded in it that can host a number of different image improvement algorithms, automatic detection, artificial intelligence algorithms. And it's a system-on-chip that also supports all the typical peripherals that you have in a handheld system display, battery control, USB, memory, those -- user interface, those kinds of things. So that will make it easier for people to create products around that core, and I think should drive future business for the OEM group. Also the fact that, that core is available with 15 different fields of views and 2 different resolutions gives a lot of flexibility to system developers. 
And then the last thing that I'll mention is we continue to get traction in the OEM space with automotive. We've got Cadillac that's just began shipping units with CT6. And it seems like it's getting a good response, and we continue to have other auto manufacturers in the hopper there. So it's been a slow go, getting traction with night vision, but it's one that is gaining steam in terms of its adoption rates."

And we're actively doing that. Also, the development of the Boson core with its embedded vector processor -- vision processor that is inside that unit, we can develop algorithms for that for video analytics and artificial intelligence that can be applied across multiple segments within FLIR. And that is something that -- we've got a team that is solely focused on that. It's been a long-term vision here at FLIR. It was part of the reason that we bought Traficon. We also got additional video analytics capability with the acquisition of DVTEL with the former ioi image assets there. And it's still early days in terms of what we will be showing from a video analytics standpoint. But we believe that the broad spectrum of products being offered in Surveillance, Instruments, Maritime, Security and even Detection can benefit from those enhanced capabilities that will run onboard this low-power core."

And I want to welcome everyone to FLIR's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Shane Harrison. 
I will start with a review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $379 million, up 10% from the prior year and up 12% on a constant-currency basis. Commercial product revenues grew 4% over the first quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 20%. 
Earnings per share were $0.01, which were negatively affected by a $40 million charge to establish reserves booked in the quarter, primarily related to an excess profit ruling dispute between Belgium and the European Commission, which Amit will discuss in more detail. Excluding these charges, earnings were $0.30 per share, which compares with $0.34 per share in the prior year. 
First quarter operating income was $57 million compared to $66 million in the prior year. As we mentioned in our outlook commentary last quarter, the first quarter of 2015 proved to be a difficult comparable as it was a quarter that had lower-than-normal corporate costs as well as other strong -- as well as our strongest gross margins in the past 3 years due to foreign exchange and a strong surveillance product mix.
Bookings of $379 million were the highest first quarter order intake we've seen in over 5 years. Backlog continues to grow, reaching $613 million, which is the highest level since 2008. Surveillance segment bookings grew 50% over the prior year, driven by strong international orders. 
We introduced several new products since our last call, including the new Boson thermal camera core. This innovative new core is priced and has performance above our Lepton microcamera core, and it features a powerful onboard processing capabilities, enabled by a programmable, Movidius vision processing unit. Boson features our latest 12-micron pixel design and is offered in VGA and QVGA resolutions, with 15 different field-of-view options to choose from, each of which use internally produced optical components. Boson's revolutionary size, weight and onboard processing power will open up new applications and uses for our technology, given its versatility and low-power consumption. 
On the Lepton front, we've been successfully integrated into 2 new OEM product platforms during the quarter. First was the announcement of the ruggedized CAT-branded smartphone that will feature thermal imaging and a FLIR app that will provide building professionals, electricians and first responders the ability to measure surface temperature from a distance, identify mechanical and electrical problems, spot moisture and missing insulation, see in total darkness or see through smoke. 
Second was the Scott Sight, hands-free thermal imaging system from Scott Safety, which is the first head-mounted thermal imaging system to have a microdisplay integrated inside the SCBA mask. Both of these products take full advantage of Lepton's industry-leading size, weight, power and cost capabilities.
Also on the firefighting front, we introduced 5 new FLIR-branded firefighting solutions at the FDIC show last week. We continue to see strong market share gains in the fire market. 
On Slide 4, you will see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect revenue to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, and EPS to be in a range of $1.60 to $1.70 for the full year, excluding the impact of the tax reserve booked in Q1. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 9% when compared to 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.
Given project -- product margin expectations for specific programs and surveillance, consolidated gross margins in the second quarter are expected to remain near Q1 levels. These programs are winding down, and thus, surveillance segment as well as consolidated margins should improve in the second half of the year. We intend to be diligent in absorbing gross margin softness through operating cost management.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on June 3 to shareholders of record as of May 20. 
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the first quarter financial results. Amit?"

First quarter consolidated revenue was $379.5 million, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Currency continued to negatively impact the top line and particularly, for the instruments and maritime segments, but to a lesser degree than we have experienced in prior quarters. 
Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenue would have been up about 12% compared to prior year. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the Detection, Security, OEM & Emerging and Surveillance segments, increasing 61%, 21%, 20% and 10%, respectively.
Maritime revenues improved 1% while Instruments experienced a 5% decline, driven primarily by softness in the midrange of the Building & Predictive Maintenance product lines. On a currency adjusted basis, Maritime revenues would be up 5% and Instruments down 3%. 
Recently, revenue increased in all geographies except Europe, led by 78% growth in Canada, Latin America and 17% growth in the U.S. Sales to the U.S. government increased $32 million or 61% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2015. 
Consolidated first quarter gross margin was 47%, a 4 percentage point decline compared to last year, primarily driven by product and segment mix changes, manufacturing cost absorption from inventory adjustments, comparative pressures and security retail channels and nonrecurrence of favorable exchange-related gain from last year.
Operating expenses increased by $10 million or 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and some corporate expense credits that were recognized in 2015 and did not repeat in 2016.
Our operating margin fell from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2015 to 15.1% this year, primarily due to the decline in our gross margin. Our tax expense in the first quarter was $54.5 million, which is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of 26%, plus reserves for discrete tax items totaling $40 million. These reserves are primarily associated with the previously disclosed European Commission decision against the Belgian tax authorities.
The Belgian government is currently appealing the decision. The final exposure to FLIR, if any, is subject to the result of the appeal, other related litigation and the determination of any additional deductions that we may be able to claim. The impact of these items have not been factored into our reserve. The company continues to comply with all tax laws, and we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%, excluding any discrete tax items.
Net earnings for the first quarter of 2016 totaled $1.1 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share. Excluding the discrete tax items, adjusted net income in the first quarter was $41.2 million, down 14% from last year, and adjusted EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.30 -- $0.34 in the first quarter of 2015. 
We closed the first quarter with cash of $510.6 million, an increase of $37.8 million during the quarter, primarily driven by operating cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $44.9 million or 109% of net income, excluding the discrete tax items.
We had capital expenditures of $10 million in the first quarter and returned $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter, but we will continue to evaluate our opportunities to do so in subsequent quarters. 
This concludes the summary of our first quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

You will see a summary of our segment results on Slide 6. While revenue grew 10% during the quarter, first quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 5% as a result of higher operating expenses, primarily from the DVTEL acquisition and lower product margins. 
Moving to Slide 7. During the first quarter, Surveillance segment revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $124.2 million. This growth was driven primarily by the Man Portable and Maritime product lines.
Surveillance segment operating income of $35.2 million increased 17% versus the prior year, driven largely by reductions in operating expenses. We expect Surveillance second quarter operating margins to be several points softer than the 28% seen in Q1 due to the mix of product deliveries we see in backlog. We do not expect this mix impact to continue throughout the balance of the year. Surveillance backlog increased from the end of 2015 to $314 million. As Andy stated, bookings of $137 million were the highest level seen for the first quarter since the RAID and G-BOSS programs were active in the late 2000s. 
The first quarter book-to-bill ratio was a 1.1x, and the 50% year-over-year bookings growth were driven by demand from customers in the Middle East and Asia. 
Turning to Slide 8. Instruments segment revenue declined 5%, or 3% on a constant-currency basis, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue of $79.4 million was negatively impacted by increased backlog during the quarter in comparison to a backlog reduction in Q1 of the prior year. In addition, we have not yet seen the recovery in the high-end Building & Preventive Maintenance (sic) [ Building & Predictive Maintenance ] offerings, which should come from the recently introduced premium T1K product. We are currently developing new products to bolster our midrange Building & Preventive Maintenance offering, which were also soft during the quarter. 
The volume products in our PPM and building line that were introduced over the last few years continue to do well during the quarter, as did our OGI, fire, automation and science product lines. 
Instruments operating margin was 25%, a decline compared to the first quarter of 2015 as a result of increased operating expenses and higher production costs. Actions are being taken to return the segment's operating margin to its historic levels in the upper 20% range. 
Last week at the FDIC tradeshow, Instruments introduced 5 new products for the firefighting industry. The FLIR K33 and K53 are handheld TICs, which offer the firefighter the simplicity of a single-button operation, but also provide 4-inch displays and FLIR's FSX technology. The KF6 is the first thermal camera designed mounting on fire engine ladders to provide better tactical awareness in directing firefighter activities. FLIR also introduced 2 versions of its aerial responder kit, which provides firefighters and first responders a ready-to-fly drone-based system with powerful thermal imaging capabilities, enabling users to be able to assess a scene from an aerial perspective. 
On Slide 9 is our segment -- Security segment results. Revenue of $47.1 million was up 21% year-over-year. Visible spectrum products grew nearly 40% but were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in our high-end, high-margin thermal product deliveries. Thermal products are often sold into large installation projects that do not occur on a regular cadence, which can cause lumpy thermal product revenue. 
Security operating profitability fell to a loss in the quarter due to the gross margin's pressure associated with price reductions for certain slower-moving Lorex product inventory, a product mix shift to lower-margin consumer offering and higher operating expenses, primarily from the acquisition of DVTEL. The DVTEL integration is ramping at a measured pace, but we intend to realize meaningful synergies in the coming quarters. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 10. OEM & Emerging first quarter revenue was up 20% over last year to $47.8 million. Growth was broad across the product lines, with particular strength in Uncooled Cores, FLIR ONE and the new FLIR Vue drone-compatible camera product line. OEM & Emerging operating profit was $10 million in the quarter, with margins largely in line with the prior year. 
In April, OEM & Emerging announced Boson, an important addition to its Uncooled Core family of products. The powerful yet tiny Boson will provide a smaller, less power consuming and highly advanced thermal camera core to both our OEM customers as well as our internal teams. Boson's use of an advanced system-on-chip vector processor enables the FLIR XIR video processing algorithms for highly enhanced image quality with low power consumption. The Boson's internal processing capabilities are expandable, so customers can add software and algorithms suitable for their specific needs. 
Since the end of last year, OEM & Emerging has added 2 significant new customers for its Lepton core, each with a particularly interesting thermal-enabled value proposition to their end users. The Bullitt group announced the CAT S60 ruggedized smartphone for the industrial and trade professional that features thermal imaging capability to empower these customers with the ability to preemptively identify job site issues before they become significant problems. And in April, Scott Safety announced the integration of Lepton into an SCBA facemask for firefighters, enabling firefighters to see through smoke and find hot spots in a fully integrated and hands-free way. 
Also during the first quarter, OEM & Emerging intelligent traffic systems business introduced the Lepton-based TrafiOne, the first thermal traffic camera featuring WiFi-tracking technology to provide traffic engineers with a differentiated, highly reliable solution to detect vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians in an urban environment.
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenue was $51.7 million, growing 1% over the prior year, 5% on a constant-currency basis. Maritime operating income was $5 million in the quarter, up 4% over the prior year. In February, Raymarine introduced the Dragonfly 7 Pro, the 7-inch version of the award-winning Dragonfly 5. The 7 Pro utilizes DownVision sonar with wide-spectrum CHIRP multifrequency transmission technology, which creates photo-like underwater sonar imagery.
On Slide 13, you will see the Detection segment's first quarter summary. Revenue was up 61% year-over-year to $29.3 million. Growth was seen across all Detection product lines with the DR SKO program growing significantly over the prior year due to the timing of shipments. The revenue increased at slightly higher gross margins and a nearly unchanged level of operating expense drove Detection operating profit growth of 200% over the prior year. Detection backlog finished the year at $97 million, an increase of $15 million from the end of 2015. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's first quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy"

While revenues met our expectation of 10% growth, profit margins did not. Gross margins were impacted by a number of factors that we feel are temporary. Operating expense controls were not fully effective in making up the gross margin softness. We expect gross margins to return to the 48% to 50% range in the second half of the year, and we intend to focus on operating costs as we navigate through the year. 
As demonstrated by the product launches discussed this morning, the innovation engine within the company is strong. This is driving a continued progression in the expansion of military, commercial and consumer markets. 
We are now fully integrated into our first smartphone, which has been a long-term objective to increase overall volume, build awareness and increase adoption. We continue to innovate across all sensor performance tiers as shown with the evolving versions of Lepton and now the introduction of the revolutionary new Boson camera core. We've already begun developing next-generation FLIR-branded products based on this advanced sensor.

So what you're seeing here is not an effect of aggressive discounting to get sales to happen. There are some price effects in the Security segment where we're facing stronger competition there, but it's a small piece of the puzzle. To your point about what's happening with new products, we -- as we introduce new products, those products fully support the long-term objective -- gross margin objectives of the company, and I don't have a concern around that. The area where we see margin challenges is -- are primarily within the Surveillance segment, where we have some larger programs that were booked some time ago that are nearing their completion, and these are programs like the MSC program for the U.S. Border Patrol and the PB-EOS program for the Coast Guard. And these are programs that were bid pretty aggressively early in the product development cycle and as a result have lower than corporate average margins, and they pull down the overall margins particularly of that segment. The good news about that strategy, though, is it establishes credibility for those products and allows us to sell those products much more effectively in international markets, having the backing of major U.S. users behind them. And in those specific situations where we're selling them internationally they fully support the corporate overall gross margin objectives."

The first issue is that midrange of our product-value ladder, those are actually some of the oldest products that we have in our product-value ladder. So from a product development standpoint, we've been very focused on the low end. We've had tremendous success there. The C2 has been a hugely successful product for us, following on the heels of our Ex product range. And also the IGM test and measurement products that we have introduced, and those are the traditional test and measurement products that have Lepton injected into them, have been doing extremely well in the market. So we've got a very solid lower end as part of our Control the Corners strategy. Up on the other end of the spectrum and, again, to our Control the Corners strategy, we launched our T1K product. That's a product that's just getting traction now. When you have a premium product like that, that is typically a product that's involved in a replacement cycle of capital equipment, the adoption rate of products like that tends to take longer than one would expect, because it is capital allocation-type of budgeting process that's required to purchase that product given its price point. But we're seeing that start to get traction. And the midrange of the segment, which is our Exx-Series and our Txxx-Series, those are products that are the oldest of the product portfolio. Their due for a refresh at this point. They're still quite competitive in the market, but I think that the -- you look at the feature sets that are coming in advanced new products like the C2 and then the T1K at the other end of the spectrum, it's quite attractive to customers. And we'll see blend those feature sets and capabilities into that midrange product. Those products are under development now and are expected to be out within the next 6 to 12 months, and they will rebolster that midsection. We also expect that to go somewhat hand-in-hand with the large number of systems and users that we brought into the fold at those lower end products are likely to be candidates for people who are going to want to upgrade to higher-performance units after they've been using a product like a C2 or an IGM product for year or so.

And it was at the time when, as Andy mentioned, a bit of distraction in the integration of the thermal team with the DVTEL team, and we had a bit lower on the thermal side. So we saw a mix shift to the consumer offering, so that was one impact. We also did have some onetime events related to moving some of the slower-moving inventory that we saw in the channel in the Lorex, and we wanted to deal with it early in the product life cycle rather than waiting till later when it could become a much larger issue. So we dealt with it. It's been done. And so that was kind of a onetime piece. So those 2 were the major pieces that impacted the gross margin in Security."

And here, we also had kind of a tough comp relative to last year. We -- the number of cooled cameras that we sold in the Security segment in Q1 was down rather significantly versus Q1 of '15. And that's a business that tends to be kind of lumpy because you're going after these large infrastructure or enterprise class customers, and they can be a bit lumpy. And when those projects do have a high concentration of cooled thermal cameras, there's a lot of margin in those. We did see growth in our uncooled thermal cameras during the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the fairly significant decline as a result of lumpiness of the cooled camera business. We think that the prospect, though, over the rest of the year, for the thermal business is quite good. The value proposition there is still quite strong, and we continue to introduce new products in that space. And it really is a key thesis of the success of that business is to be successful in thermal and continue to drive thermal. And that's bolstered now by having the integration of a full video management system and our 360 C2 surveillance platform. The integration of those 3 things offers a much more turnkey solution for customers that are doing large-scale perimeter security applications."

The -- we see the gross margins manifest themselves lower when we have a segment like Surveillance, which is normally pulling the overall margins up, have margins that are below our target average. And again, that happens when we have strong deliveries into a program, typically U.S. program of record type program where we have lower than normal gross margins. So that's something that we're watching very closely. But we continue to have the ability to bring in new business, the book-and-bill business, the international business that we bring into Surveillance has margins that is -- that are well above the average margin for the quarter, so that these things offset each other. You're correct that when we integrate businesses like Security or Raymarine that have inherently lower gross margins, and those businesses represent a larger percentage of the total for FLIR, that it can pull down the overall gross and operating margins for the business. And I think that, that's something that we can see coming from a fair way off. And in each of those businesses, we continue to make sure that we have products within those businesses, the thermal content products within those businesses that generate higher gross margins, that help to bring up the overall gross margins of that business and offset the lower margins associated with the consumer and retail aspects of those business. I'd say a prime example is in the Security space where we acquired DVTEL, we've integrated our 360 Surveillance business. Those are 2 software-oriented businesses that can support much higher gross margins that will help to bring up the overall gross margin levels for the Security business."

And we've now seen a couple of back-to-back very strong quarters in terms of overall bookings growth. I think Q4 was up 26% in Surveillance, and Q1 was up 50% in bookings. And we're very pleased to see that, but the visibility is still a bit challenging on that front. The overall feel from the market is good. It seems like, more frequently than not, we've got new requirements that are coming in that weren't identified clearly in our forecast, and I've been in that space before in my career. And it's a good indication that demand is increasing. And of course, it's very much in line with how we operated the company. Our CDMQ model affords us ability to be very responsive in a short period of time to urgent needs. And we're seeing more of that urgent need requirement.

Well, starting with the firefighting space, I mean, this is an area where I mentioned in the prepared comments that we feel that we're doing quite well from a gross -- from a market share gain standpoint. And we're building on that success through the launch of 5 new products that were launched at FDIC. Those are 2 new handheld products, 1 new dedicated product that mounts at the top of a ladder-truck ladder for aerial surveillance and then 2 DJI drone-based products for drone-based aerial surveillance for firefighters, which is becoming an increasingly popular tool to have at a fire scene. I think this is part of our strategy. It's one of our key 6 strategic pillars to identify and attack new viable markets. And firefighting is one. The market has been around for a while. The value proposition of thermal is incredibly strong there. We have a strong capability to create products and to innovate new products. And what we're doing here is not only building the value ladder of handheld products to have not only the most attractive opening price point all the way through the upper corner to a very attractive and well-priced NFPA system with our K65, but also to inject a couple of easy-to-use products in that and expand the overall product category by solving other problems that we're learning from firefighters, which really come around we need to get an aerial view of what's going on in the fire scene, and that can be done both from a ladder and a UAV. So we feel that we should see that fire segment's growth bolstered by the expansion of new applications within that segment. And that's been a key strategy for us as we work to offset some of the softness that we're seeing in the midrange of the product lying in Instruments."

First, we talked about in the prepared comments, the 2 new OEMs that we have established with Lepton, one being the CAT phone and the second being the Scott Sight. Both of those are completely new applications. I don't see those as being cannibalizing. They offer completely new capabilities to those 2 OEMs. And I think that they will generate significant interest with other players in that market. So clearly, the launch of the CAT S60 phone has gotten a number of other smartphone manufacturers looking at that. And when that product gets launched and starts getting traction later this summer, we think that there will be other parties that are going to be serious about looking at that capability for inclusion into their devices as well. And similarly, when you look at firefighting, and SCBA is one of the most common pieces of the turnout gear, and integrating a thermal imager directly into an SCBA offers a hands-free capability that a lot of firefighters have been looking for. So we think that, that product concept is going to do well. 
Two other areas that I'll mention, one is the introduction of Boson. So we've got a completely new core here, a core that has a very powerful system-on-chip vector processor embedded in it that can host a number of different image improvement algorithms, automatic detection, artificial intelligence algorithms. And it's a system-on-chip that also supports all the typical peripherals that you have in a handheld system display, battery control, USB, memory, those -- user interface, those kinds of things. So that will make it easier for people to create products around that core, and I think should drive future business for the OEM group. Also the fact that, that core is available with 15 different fields of views and 2 different resolutions gives a lot of flexibility to system developers. 
And then the last thing that I'll mention is we continue to get traction in the OEM space with automotive. We've got Cadillac that's just began shipping units with CT6. And it seems like it's getting a good response, and we continue to have other auto manufacturers in the hopper there. So it's been a slow go, getting traction with night vision, but it's one that is gaining steam in terms of its adoption rates."

With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singh; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison. 
I'll start to review the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $403 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 1% over second quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 5%. Year-to-date, government products revenues are up 12% over the first 6 months of 2015.
On the commercial side, softness in our Instruments and Security segments was only partially offset by growth in our Emerging and Maritime product lines. Deliveries of cooled and uncooled thermal camera recorders and [indiscernible] systems and Man-Portable products helped drive the growth in government products. However, both the NFC and Man-Portable products carry relatively low margins.
Earnings per share were $0.33, which were negatively affected by a $2 million write-down in the carrying value of a minority equity investment we hold in a third-party company. Excluding this nonoperating expense, earnings were $0.34 per share. While gross margins were pressured by unusual product mix and somewhat elevated manufacturing costs, we improved our operating margin by 110 basis points over the first quarter of this year. 
Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 17% year-over-year to $629 million, as we saw 9% growth in overall orders versus the prior year. This is our highest backlog balance since 2008, which was the height of our activity for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 19% over the balance of the end of Q2 2015. 
On the new products front, the Surveillance segment introduced the new Star SAFIRE 380-HLDc at the Farnborough [ph] Airshow this month. The 380-HLDc is our latest variance of the 380-HDC Gimbel platform that adds laser designation capability to this highly differentiated, compact, airborne EO/IR system. Surveillance also announced the new LTV-X all-terrain key mobile surveillance vehicle, which has onboard FLIR nimble multisensor as well as our new R6SS beamforming, long-distance ground radar.
And also during the quarter, the Instruments segment introduced the latest infrared-guided measurement, or IGM, Test & Measurement product, the DM284 all-in-one digital multi-gear. 
During the second quarter, we completed a couple of financing transactions that will allow us to have more capability and flexibility in our capital deployment strategies. We expanded our revolving credit facility to $500 million and issued $425 million of new publicly traded notes, the proceeds of which have been used to repay our existing $250 million of notes and increase our U.S. cash balance.
We also completed the acquisition of sporting and tactical scopes business, Armasight, which will strengthen our presence in both the recreational and military weapon sites and scopes market. Armasight did not impact our second quarter results and is not expected to meaningfully impact EPS during 2016, but we do expect to see acceleration under the FLIR brand as well as profit synergies in 2017, as the business leverages our brand and vertical integration in the thermal space.
On Slide 4, you'll see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. Based on the profit margin seen in the first half of the year, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65 for the full year, excluding any charges related to cost-reduction initiatives in the second half and the tax reserve and investment write-down booked in the first half. This represents revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items. 
We expect to see improved margins in the second half, driven by favorable product mix changes, targeted price increases and reductions in manufacturing and SG&A costs. These changes are expected to result in overall gross margin improvement of approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on September 2 to shareholders of record as of August 19.
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the second quarter financial results. Amit?"

Consolidated revenue was $403 million, a 2% increase compared to the second quarter of 2015. Overall impact of exchange rate changes on revenue and operating income was minor. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the OEM and Emerging, Maritime, Security and Surveillance segments, increasing 23%, 6%, 6% and 5%, respectively. 
Instrument and Detection revenues declined by 14% and 2%, respectively. 
Reasonably, revenue increased in the U.S., Middle East and Africa and Asia by 9%, 10% and 3%, respectively, while it declined in Europe by 12% and in Canada and LatAm by 9%. 
Sales to the U.S. government increased $24 million or 32% and represented 25% of total revenue compared to 19% in the second quarter of 2015.
Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 46%, 273 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to changes in product mix, manufacturing costs under absorption and additional costs associated with the ramp-up of our low-cost IR lens capability. As a result of cost control measures, operating expenses reduced by $1 million year-over-year despite the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business. Our operating margins fell from 18% to 16% as a result of the decline in gross margin, partially offset by operating expense reduction.
We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 25%, excluding any discrete tax items. And our second quarter tax expense was $14.5 million. 
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2016 totaled $45.4 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Excluding the impact of a minority investment write-down of $2 million, adjusted net income was $47.4 million and adjusted EPS was $0.34 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2015. 
We closed the second quarter with cash of $903 million, an increase of $393 million during the quarter, primarily driven by proceeds from the debt refinancing and strong operating cash flow.
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $81.7 million or 173% of adjusted net income, driven by improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. Accounts receivables and inventory improved during the quarter, resulting in a lower quarter-over-quarter cash conversion cycle. 
During the quarter, we acquired Armasight for $41 million and had capital expenditures of $10.9 million. We repurchased 950,000 shares for $29.7 million and returned another $16.6 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. 
Our cash balance increased as a result of the $425 million of new debt, $250 million of which was earmarked for repayment of our previous notes, which was settled in early July. 
This concludes the summary of our second quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

Slide 6 shows a summary of our second quarter segment results. While 4 of our 6 segments achieved good growth during the quarter, overall growth was hampered by softness in our Instruments and Detection segments. Segment-level profit was down 9%, as we saw gross margin headwinds due to product mix, under absorption of manufacturing costs and acquisition-related intangible amortization. 
Moving to Slide 7, which covers the Surveillance segment. Second quarter revenue for Surveillance was $113.4 million, up 5% over the second quarter of 2015. Increased revenue from the MSU program, Man Portable product line and Personal Vision Systems product line each contributed to the growth. Delays related to export licensing requirements created a headwind to this growth during the quarter. 
Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $26.1 million, which was down slightly from the prior year, while operating margins declined due to an unusual product mix in the quarter, a significant amount of MSC shipments as well as large deliveries of a certain Man Portable product each came at lower-than-normal margins for the segment. Based on our backlog, we expect shipments in this product to be lower in the second half, while shipments of higher-margin products should help bring Surveillance operating margins back to the high 20s. 
Surveillance backlog increased $27 million from the end of Q1 to $341 million and is up 19% from 1 year ago. Strong order flow from international customers, including ones in Latin America, Asia and Europe, helped add to the backlog. 
Additionally, the acquisition of Armasight and the delay in getting certain export license increased our backlog. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 in the second quarter, which was the fourth time in the last 5 quarters the book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1. As Andy mentioned, during the second quarter, we acquired Armasight, a leading night vision and thermal tactical scopes company. The addition of Armasight's product line and management team will provide us with meaningful scaling and additional capabilities in the hunting, outdoors and military scope space. As we integrate our existing PBS and military scopes business with Armasight, we have renamed the combined business FLIR Outdoor and Tactical Systems, or OTS, which will be reported within the Surveillance segment going forward. 
During the second quarter, Surveillance introduced 3 new products, as shown on Slide 8. At the Farmborough Airshow, we showcased our new 3 DHL DC EO/IR system that features HD thermal and visible imaging and precision laser designation capability and a low profile form factor. By integrating laser designation capability into this form factor, which offers improved [indiscernible] lens, the 380 HLD brings laser designation capability to aircraft that were previously unable to perform this crucial role. Our radar team introduced the R6SS portable ground radar that uses advanced -- utilizes advanced digital beam forming to enable dissection tracking of people from up to 15 kilometers away. Also launched this quarter was Surveillance's new integrated vehicle system, the LTV-X. The LTV-X is a compact, modular, four-wheel vehicle that features our tax clear to ADHD multispectral Campbell, the R6SS radar and onboard command control software. The product offers a turn-key, highly transportable solution for advanced order, surveillance and reconnaissance. 
On Slide 9, you'll see a summary of the Instruments segment. Revenue declined 14% compared to the prior year to $78.1 million. Significant MERS-related sales in Asia and a communicated price increase in Europe each drove higher shipments in Q2 of last year, which created a difficult comparison for Instruments in the second quarter of this year -- while we continue to see very good growth in firefighting and automation lines of business, it was not enough to fully offset the relative declines in the other businesses, including continued weakness in the plant and predictive maintenance line of products. The softness in the PPM product line related to mid-range products was partially offset by strong sales in the recently introduced high-end T1K product. 
Instruments operating profit was $19.1 million or 25% of the revenue in the quarter. In the manufacturing overhead, investments in development of low-cost molded infrared lens production capability and reduced operating leverage related to lower revenue level contributed to the relatively low margins. We expect that margin improvement initiatives implemented in Q3 will allow Instruments to return to second half operating margins in the 30% range, which is customary for the back half of the year. 
During the second quarter, Instruments introduced the DM284, our latest IGM Test & Measurement tool. With this digital multimeter, we have integrated our [indiscernible] thermal camera to create a differentiated version of an everyday tool that electricians use, allowing them to now visualize temperature anomalies and other electrical problems that are not visible to the naked eye. 
On Slide 10 is our Security segment's results. Security second quarter revenue is $63.4 million, was up 6% over the prior year. Growth in enterprise-class products was offset by lower sales of thermal products versus difficult comparable in the prior year, where we saw significant shipments of high-end, long-range, cooled camera system. 
Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, up significantly over Q1 of this year yet below the prior year. Gross margins were largely in line with last year. However, increased operating expenses and intangible amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down pricing. We are taking costs out of the Security segment as we rightsize this operation. 
During the quarter, Security segment acquired the assets of Innovative Security Designs, or ISD. ISD provides advanced security hardware and software solution to the enterprise security market. While not meaningful from a financial standpoint, the acquisition has strategic importance and that we have brought onboard a very experienced engineering team that will add significant capabilities and knowledge of the company to help with our innovation of advanced solutions for the security industry. 
The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM and Emerging second quarter revenue was $57 million, increasing 23% over last year. Strong growth occurred in our IR camera course as well as our FLIR ONE and FLIR drone sales continue to grow significantly. OEM and Emerging operating profit was $16.1 million in the quarter, increasing 53% over the prior year and reaching 28% operating margin at increased revenue resulted in meaningful operating leverage benefit. 
During the second quarter, OEM and Emerging introduced a new version of the popular View series of thermal cameras for commercial drones. The View Pro R is a radiometric thermal camera that enables drone operators with the ability to accurately measure temperature remotely down to the individual pixel level as well as import images into our FLIR tools application for detailed analysis from reporting. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenues were $55.2 million, representing 6% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of radars, thermal cameras and multifunction displays drove the revenue growth. The Marine variant of our Scout TK handheld monocular was introduced in the quarter and was well-received by the market. 
Maritime operating income was $6.7 million in the quarter, reaching 12% operating margin in the segment's seasonal high quarter. Our recent inventory improvement initiatives showed good results in Maritime segment, as our ending second quarter balance was down $10 million versus Q1 and down $3 million compared to the last year. 
Maritime introduced several new products during the quarter, including the R17 release of Raymarine's lighthouse operating system for multi-function displays, which incorporates advanced dock-to-dock autorouting capability for builders as well as sonar-enabled mapping. Raymarine introduced 2 HD visible cameras, the CAM 210 and CAM 220, which enabled boaters to monitor their boats and keep themselves and their passenger safe on the water. Also introduced was the new Raymarine Evolution R4 autopilot. The Evolution R4 brings advanced patent for an correction capabilities to its adaptive core, in addition to increased accuracy and tracking away plan. 
The Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 13. Detection second quarter revenue was down 2% year-over-year to $35.7 million. The timing of deliveries under our DSK orders can result in quarter-to-quarter variability, and in the second quarter of last year, we shipped the most units the program began, causing a difficult comparable for the quarter. 
All of Detection's other product lines grew year-over-year to mostly offset the decline in DR SKO. Unchanged gross margins, combined with reduced operating expenses, resulted in over 2 percentage points of operating margin improvement. 
Detection finished the second quarter with $74 million of backlog, declining $23 million since Q1 due to shipments under the DRS KO order. 
That concludes my summary of the segment second quarter. I will hand the call back over to Andy."

Delays related to our license and processes for international customers pushed approximately $20 million of revenue under the second half of the year. In the back half of the year, we expect to see revenue growth rates that exceed what we was seen during the second quarter. Supporting this was year-over-year bookings growth of 9% in the second quarter, resulting in the highest backlog we've seen in nearly 8 years. 
We expect to enhance both our gross and operating margin in the second half as well. Recent margin degradation is the by-product of successes in certain lower-margin business lines, temporary product mix headwinds in Surveillance and increased manufacturing costs. As stated earlier, we intend to improve our operating efficiency and cost structure to bring our margins back in line. 
Including the benefits from our margin improvement initiatives and the expectation of a more usual product mix in Surveillance, we expect to see gross margins to improve by approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter. 
Sensor volumes increased considerably during the second quarter. Success in selling Lepton camera course to OEMs and success of our own branded Lepton-based products that helped drive 200% growth in the number of Lepton units produced compared to last year. While we're working diligently to build relationships with high-volume OEMs, this volume ramp is helping to reduce the cost to manufacture all of our uncooled sensors. 
Our long-term strategy of being the World's Sixth Sense is centered on innovating advanced sensing technologies that some people needs for safety, Security, process efficiency and environmental preservation.
When we look at our core technologies thermal sensing, the runway in front of us remains very long. Price and awareness continue to be barriers the we are gradually overcoming. We have a strong presence in many existing markets but continues to be focused on developing new application and use cases to drive overall growth in both awareness and utilization of the technology. 
Our sensor costs continue to come down, allowing us to expand in the overall customer base while maintaining our margins. We remain focused on building our product suite, distribution channels and overall product solutions in a way that utilizes our capital efficiently while creating strong returns for our shareholders. 
That concludes our comments on the second quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open up for your questions. Operator?"

I mean, number one was really the headline revenue there. The revenue was lower than we expected. We had a difficult comp, as Tom mentioned in his prepared comments, that we had executed a price increase last year that pulled some orders from Q3 into Q2 last year. The other issue that occurred last year is we had a little over $4 million of bookings and -- both bookings and shipments last year that were related to the MERS outbreak in Korea that did not reoccur this year. So that the lower revenue resulted in lower overall absorption manufacturing overheads in the Instruments business. The other thing, there were a couple of other things going on there. We have had an ongoing investment in new optics capability in -- that's centered in the Instruments business. We fundamentally have 3 optics technologies that the company wafer-scale optics, molded optics and diamond point turn optics. And we have a fairly concentrated investment effort going on in the molded side to be able to reduce our own molded [indiscernible] optics in the future, and those will be used across the business segments. So 5 out of the 6 segments will utilize those optics going forward. And the expenses in that area were a little bit higher than anticipated and not fully absorbed by the operation.

So I'll talk about -- first about the thermal end of the business. That is a business that is still very much in its infancy. The value proposition for thermal cameras in the security space is quite strong as it significantly improves the accuracy of video analytics-based system. We've introduced some new products in that space just recently, our SCID series, which is the first product that we've introduced that has fully integrated edge-based video analytic capability that's very quick and easy to set up and quite reliable from an accuracy standpoint. That really brings a differentiated value proposition to outdoor perimeter security applications, leveraging the capabilities of thermal imaging. In Q2, we changed some of our export licensing processes to refine those, and that resulted in the delay in obtaining some export license, and that manifested itself in the Security segment, to some degree, in the Instruments segment, more so in the Surveillance segment. And as a result, that pushed some deliveries from Q2 into the second half, and that was manifested in the Security-based revenues. And that again pertains only to thermal products. In the visible space, the competition there has increased. And as we've seen some of the larger Chinese suppliers enter the markets directly, that has put some pressure on margins as a result of increased competition. Our strategy there is to offer more enterprise-class products, that will be supported by the DVTEL integration. Also in that space, we believe that over the long term, the opportunity to offer integrated thermal and visible products, or hybrid product as we call them, will give us a differentiated solutions that will not only be unique but also have the ability to generate higher margins than traditional visual products."

We have a business today that is part of Surveillance that we call PVS, Personal Vision Systems. And that is a tactical scopes and site business. The products that we've launched there are products that were designed to create new opening price points in that market. So we have typically been the price leader in that space. And also in our Surveillance business, though we have some higher-end, more CDMQ-oriented tactical scopes insight. And Armasight, in the thermal space, actually kind of fills in the gap between those 2 product ranges, between our true consumer and a military product with products that are more prosumer and paramilitary-oriented. The other thing that Armasight has is a fairly large business of enhanced night vision products. So these are a combination of I squared technology, Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 I squared technology and also low-light CCD and CMOS-based products. The opportunity here, I think, is quite good for 2 reasons. Number one is the outdoor hunting market, nighttime operations of outdoor hunting is increasing. And also the interest in digitally-based scopes and sites is going up, both with availability of lower-cost thermal technology and the availability of lower-cost, lowlight visible technology. So Armasight really brings a capability to us, particularly in the lowlight visible space and I squared space, but also, will allow us to create more of a Center of Excellence and provide some scale to the business around that tactical outdoor scopes and sites area. So we're pretty excited about this space. It's a growing space. We also see the international market as a pretty strong opportunity for us as most of Armasight's sales our U.S.-based at this point.

And that will be utilized both for stationary systems and for mobile systems. So this is also technology that we've deployed in the new LTV-X product that Tom mentioned earlier that was launched in the Surveillance space. That level of capability of having a true C2 layer on top of a VMS is something that really not many people are offering in the market today, and I think we're going to have a very unique product offering there, in particular, for the markets where we are particularly strong, which is the outdoor perimeter surveillance markets.

So there's 3 -- we divide the market and we talk about it in 3 ways. We have kind of the consumer business. We have a small business, or SMB, and the enterprise class. And the consumer business is highly competitive. The differentiation is relatively low. We have very good product. The amount of inventory we hold, it moves almost in the quarter we receive it. So it's not a large inventory balance. That's pretty competitive on price. It's a very high-volume business, and I think that's not where we're focusing. SMB is a business where Andy mentioned, we're seeing the major Chinese manufacturers entering competing primarily on price again there are certain things we can add a little more differentiated, differentiation participate in that business, but again, not the focus. What Andy was referencing a center market is the enterprise where we can create differentiated products and solutions, the ability to have of the margins and add as much stronger. The importance of thermal and end-to-end solution is stronger. And so that's where we are focusing our efforts. And that's where we can achieve the superior margins, and that shift towards enterprise products will improve the margins for the business overall."

But just as a point of reference, axis, which does go toward the enterprise segment also and pulled out of the SMB and small business area has tried to cast about a 6% to 7% growth rate for that enterprise area.

And they're actually quite applicable. There are really 2 fundamental technologies there that can be used elsewhere, and those are the VMS technology and the cloud-based technologies that the DVTEL engineering team is working on. Those are applicable. The cloud-based technology's fundamentally applicable across each of our segments, and the VMS technology can be utilized in Surveillance, in Maritime. And of course, towards the being used in the Security segment. The opportunity for having high-level integrated VMS system tied together with the C2 system and then backed up with cloud Axis capability is something that's quite attractive for boaters, for example, in terms of being able to keep an eye on what's going on in the boat, both while at buoyage and while the boat is at harbor. And also in the Surveillance segment, at the end of the day, what we do in the Surveillance segment is we provide IFR capabilities across a variety of platforms. And the ability to both record and disseminate that information is becoming increasingly important, and that's fundamentally what the Security segment capabilities will bring to the other segments."

From a cost standpoint, we think we're properly leverage there, so we don't see -- we don't expect to see the significant change in margin. I think the big question here, and I'm sure everybody is talking about this, is what will the impact be on the EU in total. We're currently expecting our European revenues to be flat with H1. We actually had some aberrations last year. H1 was stronger than H2 from a European revenue standpoint. And this year, we're going to that we believe that, that will that flatten out. Last year, we saw that delta primarily because of the fact that we have price increases in a few of the segments in Q2 last year, and it pulled orders from H2 into H1.

But I don't want to go into that level of fidelity on unit volumes. But I can tell you a couple of important factors here. In terms of the number of thermal imaging cameras that are being flown on drones, both commercial and military today, I mean, we nominate that space by a long shot. And we've not only had a relationship with DJI, but we have a relationship with several of the other leading commercial drone manufacturers today. In fact, most commercial drones that are being flown today with thermal cameras on them are being flown with either the FLIR Vue Pro-R or the DJI FLIR that used XT. Growth in that business has been quite strong, and the penetration is extraordinarily low. As a percentage of the total number of commercial drones that are being sold today, it's still quite a small number, but we expect that to continue to growth through 3 potential initiatives here. One is this product expansion line. So we're expanding the product offering there to be beyond the current product offering, which is primarily [indiscernible] based. So we'll be adding Lepton-based platforms as well. We've just added radiometric capability, which is remote temperature measurement capability in the FLIR Vue Pro-R, and that will get expanded across other manufacturers as well. So temperature measurements can be done. And the third issue is the back-end software processing. So at the end of the day, these drones get cameras in the air, and the camera images -- the cameras capture images, but ultimately what you do with those images is really where the value gets delivered. So the ability to create 3D or mosaics and have those be radiometrically calibrated are important characteristics for that market, and we've been working very aggressively, both independently and with partners, to develop that capability. And we'll have more to talk about that during second half of the year."

With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison. 
I'll start to review the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $403 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 1% over second quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 5%. Year-to-date, government products revenues are up 12% over the first 6 months of 2015.
On the commercial side, softness in our Instruments and Security segments was only partially offset by growth in our Emerging and Maritime product lines. Deliveries of cooled and uncooled thermal camera recorders, NFC systems and Man-Portable products help drive the growth in government products. However, both the NFC and Man-Portable products carry relatively low margins.
Earnings per share were $0.33, which were negatively affected by a $2 million write-down in the carrying value of a minority equity investment we hold in a third-party company. Excluding this nonoperating expense, earnings were $0.34 per share. While gross margins were pressured by unusual product mix and somewhat elevated manufacturing costs, we improved our operating margin by 110 basis points over the first quarter of this year. 
Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 17% year-over-year to $629 million, as we saw 9% growth in overall orders versus the prior year. This is our highest backlog balance since 2008, which was the height of our activity for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 19% over the balance at the end of Q2 2015. 
On the new products front, the Surveillance segment introduced the new Star SAFIRE 380-HLDc at the Farnborough Airshow this month. The 380-HLDc is our latest variant of the 380-HDC Gimbel platform that adds laser designation capability to this highly differentiated, compact, airborne EO/IR system. Surveillance also announced the new LTV-X all-terrain turn-key mobile surveillance vehicle, which has onboard attack FLIR nimble multisensor as well as our new R6SS beamforming, long-distance ground radar.
And also during the quarter, the Instruments segment introduced the latest infrared-guided measurement, or IGM, Test & Measurement product, the DM284 all-in-one digital multimeter.
During the second quarter, we completed a couple of financing transactions that will allow us to have more capability and flexibility in our capital deployment strategies. We expanded our revolving credit facility to $500 million and issued $425 million of new publicly traded notes, the proceeds of which have been used to repay our existing $250 million of notes and increase our U.S. cash balance.
We also completed the acquisition of sporting and tactical scopes business, Armasight, which will strengthen our presence in both the recreational and military weapon sites and scopes markets. Armasight did not impact our second quarter results and is not expected to meaningfully impact EPS during 2016, but we do expect to see acceleration under the FLIR brand as well as profit synergies in 2017, as the business leverages our brand and vertical integration in the thermal space.
On Slide 4, you'll see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. Based on the profit margin seen in the first half of the year, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65 for the full year, excluding any charges related to cost-reduction initiatives in the second half and the tax reserve and investment write-down booked in the first half. This represents revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items. 
We expect to see improved margins in the second half, driven by favorable product mix changes, targeted price increases and reductions in manufacturing and SG&A costs. These changes are expected to result in overall gross margin improvement of approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on September 2 to shareholders of record as of August 19.
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the second quarter financial results. Amit?"

Consolidated revenue was $403 million, a 2% increase compared to the second quarter of 2015. Overall impact of exchange rate changes on revenue and operating income was minor. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the OEM and Emerging, Maritime, Security and Surveillance segments, increasing 23%, 6%, 6% and 5%, respectively. 
Instrument and Detection revenues declined by 14% and 2%, respectively. 
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S., Middle East and Africa and Asia by 9%, 10% and 3%, respectively, while it declined in Europe by 12% and in Canada and LatAm by 9%. 
Sales to the U.S. government increased $24 million or 32% and represented 25% of total revenue compared to 19% in the second quarter of 2015.
Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 46%, 273 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to changes in product mix, manufacturing costs under absorption and additional costs associated with the ramp-up of our low-cost IR lens capability. As a result of cost control measures, operating expenses reduced by $1 million year-over-year despite the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business. Our operating margins fell from 18% to 16% as a result of the decline in gross margin, partially offset by operating expense reduction.
We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 25%, excluding any discrete tax items. And our second quarter tax expense was $14.5 million. 
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2016 totaled $45.4 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Excluding the impact of a minority investment write-down of $2 million, adjusted net income was $47.4 million and adjusted EPS was $0.34 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2015. 
We closed the second quarter with cash of $903 million, an increase of $393 million during the quarter, primarily driven by proceeds from the debt refinancing and strong operating cash flow.
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $81.7 million or 173% of adjusted net income, driven by improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. Accounts receivables and inventory improved during the quarter, resulting in a lower quarter-over-quarter cash conversion cycle. 
During the quarter, we acquired Armasight for $41 million and had capital expenditures of $10.9 million. We repurchased 950,000 shares for $29.7 million and returned another $16.6 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. 
Our cash balance increased as a result of the $425 million of new debt, $250 million of which was earmarked for repayment of our previous notes, which was settled in early July. 
This concludes the summary of our second quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

Slide 6 shows a summary of our second quarter segment results. While 4 of our 6 segments achieved good growth during the quarter, overall growth was hampered by softness in our Instruments and Detection segments. Segment-level operating profit was down 9%, as we saw gross margin headwinds due to product mix, under-absorption of manufacturing costs and acquisition-related intangible amortization. 
Moving to Slide 7, which covers the Surveillance segment. Second quarter revenue for Surveillance was $113.4 million, up 5% over the second quarter of 2015. Increased revenue from the MSU program, Man Portable product line and Personal Vision Systems product line each contributed to the growth. Delays related to export licensing requirements created a headwind to this growth during the quarter. 
Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $26.1 million, which was down slightly from the prior year, while operating margins declined due to an unusual product mix in the quarter, a significant amount of MSC shipments as well as large deliveries of a certain Man Portable product each came at lower-than-normal margins for the segment. Based on our backlog, we expect shipments of these products to be lower in the second half, while shipments of higher-margin products should help bring Surveillance operating margins back to the high 20s. 
Surveillance backlog increased $27 million from the end of Q1 to $341 million and is up 19% from 1 year ago. Strong order flow from international customers, including ones in Latin America, Asia and Europe, helped add to the backlog. 
Additionally, the acquisition of Armasight and the delay in getting certain export license further increased our backlog. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 in the second quarter, which was the fourth time in the last 5 quarters the book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1. As Andy mentioned, during the second quarter, we acquired Armasight, a leading night vision and thermal tactical scopes company. The addition of Armasight's product line and management team will provide us with meaningful scaling and additional capabilities in the hunting, outdoors and military scope space. As we integrate our existing PBS and military scopes business with Armasight, we have renamed the combined business FLIR Outdoor and Tactical Systems, or OTS, which will be reported within the Surveillance segment going forward. 
During the second quarter, Surveillance introduced 3 new products, as shown on Slide 8. At the Farnborough Airshow, we showcased our new 380-HLDc gimbaled EO/IR system that features HD thermal and visible imaging and precision laser designation capability in a low profile form factor. By integrating laser designation capability into this form factor, which offers improved ground clearance, the 380 HLDc brings laser designation capability to aircraft that were previously unable to perform this crucial role. Our radar team introduced the R6SS portable ground radar that uses advanced -- utilizes advanced digital beam forming to enable detection, tracking of people from up to 15 kilometers away. Also launched this quarter was Surveillance's new integrated vehicle system, the LTV-X. The LTV-X is a compact, modular, four-wheel vehicle that features our attack FLIR 280-HD multispectral gimbal, the R6SS radar and onboard command and control software. The product offers a turnkey, highly transportable solution for advanced border, surveillance and reconnaissance. 
On Slide 9, you'll see a summary of the Instruments segment. Revenue declined 14% compared to the prior year to $78.1 million. Significant MERS-related sales in Asia and a communicated price increase in Europe each drove higher shipments in Q2 of last year, which created a difficult comparison for Instruments in the second quarter of this year -- while we continue to see very good growth in firefighting and automation lines of business, it was not enough to fully offset the relative declines in the other businesses, including continued weakness in the plant and predictive maintenance line of products. The softness in the PPM product line related to mid-range products was partially offset by strong sales in the recently introduced high-end T1K product. 
Instruments operating profit was $19.1 million or 25% of the revenue in the quarter. Manufacturing overhead, investments in the development of low-cost molded infrared lens production capability and reduced operating leverage related to lower revenue levels contributed to the relatively low margins. We expect that margin improvement initiatives implemented in Q3 will allow Instruments to return to second half operating margins in the 30% range, which is customary for the back half of the year. 
During the second quarter, Instruments introduced the DM284, our latest IGM Test & Measurement tool. With this digital multimeter, we have integrated our Lepton thermal camera to create a differentiated version of an everyday tool that electricians use, allowing them to now visualize temperature anomalies and other electrical problems that are not visible to the naked eye. 
On Slide 10 is our Security segment's results. Security second quarter revenue is $63.4 million, was up 6% over the prior year. Growth in enterprise-class products was offset by lower sales of thermal products versus difficult comparable in the prior year, where we saw significant shipments of high-end, long-range, cooled camera system. 
Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, up significantly over Q1 of this year yet below the prior year. Gross margins were largely in line with last year. However, increased operating expenses and intangible amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability. We are taking costs out of the Security segment as we rightsize this operation. 
During the quarter, Security segment acquired the assets of Innovative Security Designs, or ISD. ISD provides advanced security hardware and software solutions to the enterprise security market. While not meaningful from a financial standpoint, the acquisition has strategic importance and that we have brought onboard a very experienced engineering team that will add significant capabilities and knowledge to the company to help with our innovation of advanced solutions for the security industry. 
The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM and Emerging second quarter revenue was $57 million, increasing 23% over last year. Strong growth occurred in our IR camera course as well as our FLIR ONE and FLIR drone camera sales continue to grow significantly. OEM and Emerging operating profit was $16.1 million in the quarter, increasing 53% over the prior year and reaching 28% operating margin at increased revenue resulted in meaningful operating leverage benefit. 
During the second quarter, OEM and Emerging introduced a new version of the popular View series of thermal cameras for commercial drones. The View Pro R is a radiometric thermal camera that enables drone operators with the ability to accurately measure temperature remotely down to the individual pixel level as well as import images into our FLIR tools application for detailed analysis from reporting. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenues were $55.2 million, representing 6% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of radars, thermal cameras and multifunction displays drove the revenue growth. The Marine variant of our Scout TK handheld monocular was introduced in the quarter and was well-received by the market. 
Maritime operating income was $6.7 million in the quarter, reaching 12% operating margin in the segment's seasonal high quarter. Our recent inventory improvement initiatives showed good results in Maritime segment, as our ending second quarter balance was down $10 million versus Q1 and down $3 million compared to the last year. 
Maritime introduced several new products during the quarter, including the R17 release of Raymarine's lighthouse operating system for multi-function displays, which incorporates advanced dock-to-dock autorouting capability for boaters as well as sonar-enabled mapping. Raymarine introduced 2 HD visible cameras, the CAM 210 and CAM220, which enabled boaters to monitor their boats and keep themselves and their passenger safe on the water. Also introduced was the new Raymarine Evolution R4 autopilot. The Evolution R4 brings advanced patented wind correction capabilities to its adaptive core, in addition to increased accuracy and tracking away points. 
The Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 13. Detection second quarter revenue was down 2% year-over-year to $35.7 million. The timing of deliveries under our DR SKO orders can result in quarter-to-quarter variability, and in the second quarter of last year, we shipped the most units since the program began, causing a difficult comparable for the quarter. 
All of Detection's other product lines grew year-over-year to mostly offset the decline in DR SKO. Unchanged gross margins, combined with reduced operating expenses, resulted in over 2 percentage points of operating margin improvement. 
Detection finished the second quarter with $74 million of backlog, declining $23 million since Q1 due to shipments under the DR SKO order. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's second quarter. I will now hand the call back to Andy."

Delays related to our license and processes for international customers pushed approximately $20 million of revenue under the second half of the year. In the back half of the year, we expect to see revenue growth rates that exceed what we've seen during the second quarter. Supporting this was year-over-year bookings growth of 9% in the second quarter, resulting in the highest backlog we've seen in nearly 8 years. 
We expect to enhance both our gross and operating margins in the second half as well. Recent margin degradation is the by-product of successes in certain lower-margin business lines, temporary product mix headwinds in Surveillance and increased manufacturing costs. As stated earlier, we intend to improve our operating efficiency and cost structure to bring our margins back in line. 
Including the benefits from our margin improvement initiative and the expectation of a more usual product mix in Surveillance, we expect to see gross margins to improve by approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter. 
Sensor volumes increased considerably during the second quarter. Success in selling Lepton camera course to OEMs and success of our own branded Lepton-based products that helped drive 200% growth in the number of Lepton units produced compared to last year. While we're working diligently to build relationships with high-volume OEMs, this volume ramp is helping to reduce the cost to manufacture all of our uncooled sensors. 
Our long-term strategy of being the World's Sixth Sense is centered on innovating advanced sensing technologies that solve people needs for safety, security, process efficiency and environmental preservation.
When we look at our core technology of thermal sensing, the runway in front of us remains very long. Price and awareness continue to be barriers the we are gradually overcoming. We have a strong presence in many existing markets but continue to be focused on developing new applications and use cases to drive overall growth in both awareness and utilization of the technology. 
Our sensor costs continue to come down, allowing us to expand the overall customer base while maintaining our margins. We remain focused on building our product suite, distribution channels and overall product solutions in a way that utilizes our capital efficiently while creating strong returns for our shareholders.

I mean, number one was really the headline revenue there. The revenue was lower than we expected. We had a difficult comp, as Tom mentioned in his prepared comments, that we had executed a price increase last year that pulled some orders from Q3 into Q2 last year. The other issue that occurred last year is we had a little over $4 million of bookings and -- both bookings and shipments last year that were related to the MERS outbreak in Korea that did not reoccur this year. So that the lower revenue resulted in lower overall absorption manufacturing overheads in the Instruments business. The other thing, there were a couple of other things going on there. We have had an ongoing investment in new optics capability in -- that's centered in the Instruments business. We fundamentally have 3 optics technologies at the company wafer-scale optics, molded optics and diamond-point turned optics. And we have a fairly concentrated investment effort going on in the molded side to be able to produce our own molded chalcoginate optics in the future, and those will be used across the business segments. So 5 out of the 6 of the segments will utilize those optics going forward. And the expenses in that area were a little bit higher than anticipated and not fully absorbed by the operation.

So I'll talk about -- first about the thermal end of the business. That is a business that is still very much in its infancy. The value proposition for thermal cameras in the security space is quite strong as it significantly improves the accuracy of video analytics-based system. We've introduced some new products in that space just recently, our FC-ID series, which is the first product that we've introduced that has fully integrated edge-based video analytic capability that's very quick and easy to set up and quite reliable from an accuracy standpoint. That really brings a differentiated value proposition to outdoor perimeter security applications, leveraging the capabilities of thermal imaging. In Q2, we changed some of our export licensing processes to refine those, and that resulted in the delay in obtaining some export license, and that manifested itself in the Security segment, to some degree, in the Instrument segment, and more so in the Surveillance segment. And as a result, that pushed some deliveries from Q2 into the second half, and that was manifested in the Security-based revenues. And that again pertains only to thermal products. In the visible space, the competition there has increased. And as we've seen some of the larger Chinese suppliers enter the markets directly, that has put some pressure on margins as a result of increased competition. Our strategy there is to offer more enterprise-class products, and that will be supported by the DVTEL integration. Also in that space, we believe that over the long term, the opportunity to offer integrated thermal and visible products, or hybrid products as we call them, will give us a differentiated solution that will not only be unique but also have the ability to generate higher margins than traditional visual products."

So about $30 million working capital improvement in the quarter. A lot of it is, again, driven by special initiatives on connecting faster. And on inventory, I'll let Tom speak to that in a minute. Overall, our cash conversion cycle improved by 13 days, and we expect to continue that same trend going into the second half. Inventory turns also improved slightly from 2.1 to 2.2.

And we're seeing traction with all those things, and we're pleased with the success. In fact, we expect further progress in the current quarter because, as Andy mentioned, there were certain things that hampered some of our revenue at the end of the quarter, so we had some finished goods inventory that we expect to flow through in the current quarter. And then overtime, we'll see just more -- not a significant of improvement, but continued improvement because these are long-term programs that we'll be working on."

We have a business today that is part of Surveillance that we call PVS, Personal Vision Systems. And that is a tactical scopes and site business. The products that we've launched there are products that were designed to create new opening price points in that market. So we have typically been the price leader in that space. And also in our Surveillance business, though we have some higher-end, more CDMQ-oriented tactical scopes and sites. And Armasight, in the thermal space, actually kind of fills in the gap between those 2 product ranges, between our true consumer and a military product with products that are more prosumer and paramilitary-oriented. The other thing that Armasight has is a fairly large business of enhanced night vision products. So these are a combination of  I Squared technology, Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 I Squared technology and also low-light CCD and CMOS-based products. The opportunity here, I think, is quite good for 2 reasons. Number one is the outdoor hunting market, nighttime operations of outdoor hunting is increasing. And also the interest in digitally-based scopes and sites is going up, both with the availability of lower-cost thermal technology and the availability of lower-cost, lowlight visible technology. So Armasight really brings a capability to us, particularly in the lowlight visible space and I Squared space, but also, will allow us to create more of a Center of Excellence and provide some scale to the business around that tactical outdoor scopes and sites area. So we're pretty excited about this space. It's a growing space. We also see the international market as a pretty strong opportunity for us as most of Armasight's sales are U.S.-based at this point. And we've got a little bit larger footprint internationally that we can leverage their products through."

So we have a group that's called 360 Surveillance that was part of our Surveillance group. And we have moved them out of the Surveillance group into the Security group at the beginning of this year. And fundamentally, what it does is it creates a full end-to-end solution between a network of visible and thermal security cameras, combined together with radar, ground-based sensors, with a video management system, and then 360 brings in that top-down view of the C2 system. And that will be utilized both for stationary systems and for mobile systems. So this is also technology that we've deployed in the new LTV-X product that Tom mentioned earlier that was launched in the Surveillance space. That level of capability of having a true C2 layer on top of a VMS is something that really not many people are offering in the market today, and I think we're going to have a very unique product offering there, in particular, for the markets where we are particularly strong, which is sort of the outdoor perimeter surveillance markets.

SMB is a business where Andy mentioned, we're seeing the major Chinese manufacturers enter and competing primarily on price, again there are certain things we can add, a little more differentiation, and we're participating in that business, but as again, not the focus. What Andy was referencing is that third market, it's the enterprise where we can create differentiated products and solution, the ability to have healthy margins and that is much stronger.

Those are applicable. The cloud-based technology is fundamentally applicable across each of our segments, and the VMS technology can be utilized in Surveillance, in Maritime, and of course, it's already being used in the Security segment. The opportunity for having high-level integrated VMS system tied together with the C2 system and then backed up with cloud access capability is something that is quite attractive for boaters, for example, in terms of being able to keep an eye on what's going on in a boat, both while at voyage and while the boat is at harbor. And also in the Surveillance segment, at the end of the day, what we do in the Surveillance segment is we provide ISR capabilities across a variety of platforms. And the ability to both record and disseminate that information is becoming increasingly important, and that's fundamentally what the Security segment capabilities will bring to the other segments."

And then as we previously mentioned, the U.S. government-oriented revenue was up 32%. In terms of Brexit, our exposure there is not terribly significant. Our total revenues in GBP are less than 4%. From a cost standpoint, we think we're properly leveraged there, so we don't see that we'll -- we don't expect to see a significant change in margin. I think the big question here, and I'm sure everybody is talking about this, is what will the impact be on the EU in total. We're currently expecting our European revenues to be flat with H1. We actually had some aberrations last year. H1 was stronger than H2 from a European revenue standpoint. And this year, we're going to -- we believe that, that will -- that will flatten out. Last year, we saw that delta primarily because of the fact that we had price increases in a few of the segments in Q2 of last year, and it pulled orders from H2 into H1. And this year, we won't see that recur."

But I don't want to go to that level of fidelity on unit volumes. But I can tell you a couple of important factors here. In terms of the number of thermal imaging cameras that are being flown on drones, both commercial and military today, I mean, we dominate that space by a long shot. And we not only had a relationship with DJI, but we have a relationship with several of the other leading commercial drone manufacturers today. In fact, most commercial drones that are being flown today with thermal cameras on them are being flown with either the FLIR Vue Pro-R or the DJI-FLIR Zenmuse XT. Growth in that business has been quite strong, and the penetration is extraordinarily low. As a percentage of the total number of commercial drones that are being sold today, it's still quite a small number, but we expect that to continue to grow through 3 potential initiatives here. One is this product expansion line. So we're expanding the product offering there to be beyond the current product offering, which is primarily tower-based. So we'll be adding in Lepton-based platforms as well. We've just added radiometric capability, which is remote temperature measurement capability in the FLIR Vue Pro-R, and that will get expanded across other manufacturers as well. So temperature measurements can be done. And the third issue is the back-end software processing. So at the end of the day, these drones get the cameras in the air, and the camera images -- the cameras capture images, but ultimately what you do with those images is really where the value gets delivered. So the ability to create 3D orthomosaics and have those be radiometrically calibrated are important characteristics for that market, and we've been working very aggressively, both independently and with partners, to develop that capability. And we'll have more to talk about that during the second half of the year."

With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison. 
I'll start to review the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $403 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 1% over second quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 5%. Year-to-date, government products revenues are up 12% over the first 6 months of 2015.
On the commercial side, softness in our Instruments and Security segments was only partially offset by growth in our Emerging and Maritime product lines. Deliveries of cooled and uncooled thermal camera recorders, NFC systems and Man-Portable products help drive the growth in government products. However, both the NFC and Man-Portable products carry relatively low margins.
Earnings per share were $0.33, which were negatively affected by a $2 million write-down in the carrying value of a minority equity investment we hold in a third-party company. Excluding this nonoperating expense, earnings were $0.34 per share. While gross margins were pressured by unusual product mix and somewhat elevated manufacturing costs, we improved our operating margin by 110 basis points over the first quarter of this year. 
Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 17% year-over-year to $629 million, as we saw 9% growth in overall orders versus the prior year. This is our highest backlog balance since 2008, which was the height of our activity for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 19% over the balance at the end of Q2 2015. 
On the new products front, the Surveillance segment introduced the new Star SAFIRE 380-HLDc at the Farnborough Airshow this month. The 380-HLDc is our latest variant of the 380-HDC Gimbel platform that adds laser designation capability to this highly differentiated, compact, airborne EO/IR system. Surveillance also announced the new LTV-X all-terrain turn-key mobile surveillance vehicle, which has onboard attack FLIR nimble multisensor as well as our new R6SS beamforming, long-distance ground radar.
And also during the quarter, the Instruments segment introduced the latest infrared-guided measurement, or IGM, Test & Measurement product, the DM284 all-in-one digital multimeter.
During the second quarter, we completed a couple of financing transactions that will allow us to have more capability and flexibility in our capital deployment strategies. We expanded our revolving credit facility to $500 million and issued $425 million of new publicly traded notes, the proceeds of which have been used to repay our existing $250 million of notes and increase our U.S. cash balance.
We also completed the acquisition of sporting and tactical scopes business, Armasight, which will strengthen our presence in both the recreational and military weapon sights and scopes markets. Armasight did not impact our second quarter results and is not expected to meaningfully impact EPS during 2016, but we do expect to see acceleration under the FLIR brand as well as profit synergies in 2017, as the business leverages our brand and vertical integration in the thermal space.
On Slide 4, you'll see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. Based on the profit margin seen in the first half of the year, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65 for the full year, excluding any charges related to cost-reduction initiatives in the second half and the tax reserve and investment write-down booked in the first half. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items. 
We expect to see improved margins in the second half, driven by favorable product mix changes, targeted price increases and reductions in manufacturing and SG&A costs. These changes are expected to result in an overall gross margin improvement of approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on September 2 to shareholders of record as of August 19.
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the second quarter financial results. Amit?"

Consolidated revenue was $403 million, a 2% increase compared to the second quarter of 2015. Overall impact of exchange rate changes on revenue and operating income was minor. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the OEM and Emerging, Maritime, Security and Surveillance segments, increasing 23%, 6%, 6% and 5%, respectively. 
Instrument and Detection revenues declined by 14% and 2%, respectively. 
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S., Middle East and Africa and Asia by 9%, 10% and 3%, respectively, while it declined in Europe by 12% and in Canada and LatAm by 9%. 
Sales to the U.S. government increased $24 million or 32% and represented 25% of total revenue compared to 19% in the second quarter of 2015.
Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 46%, 273 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to changes in product mix, manufacturing costs under absorption and additional costs associated with the ramp-up of our low-cost IR lens capability. As a result of cost control measures, operating expenses reduced by $1 million year-over-year despite the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business. Our operating margins fell from 18% to 16% as a result of the decline in gross margin, partially offset by operating expense reduction.
We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 25%, excluding any discrete tax items. And our second quarter tax expense was $14.5 million. 
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2016 totaled $45.4 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Excluding the impact of a minority investment write-down of $2 million, adjusted net income was $47.4 million and adjusted EPS was $0.34 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2015. 
We closed the second quarter with cash of $903 million, an increase of $393 million during the quarter, primarily driven by proceeds from the debt refinancing and strong operating cash flow.
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $81.7 million or 173% of adjusted net income, driven by improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. Accounts receivables and inventory improved during the quarter, resulting in a lower quarter-over-quarter cash conversion cycle. 
During the quarter, we acquired Armasight for $41 million and had capital expenditures of $10.9 million. We repurchased 950,000 shares for $29.7 million and returned another $16.6 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. 
Our cash balance increased as a result of the $425 million of new debt, $250 million of which was earmarked for repayment of our previous notes, which was settled in early July. 
This concludes the summary of our second quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

Slide 6 shows a summary of our second quarter segment results. While 4 of our 6 segments achieved good growth during the quarter, overall growth was hampered by softness in our Instruments and Detection segments. Segment-level operating profit was down 9%, as we saw gross margin headwinds due to product mix, under-absorption of manufacturing costs and acquisition-related intangible amortization. 
Moving to Slide 7, which covers the Surveillance segment. Second quarter revenue for Surveillance was $113.4 million, up 5% over the second quarter of 2015. Increased revenue from the MSC program, Man Portable product line and Personal Vision Systems product line each contributed to the growth. Delays related to export licensing requirements created a headwind to this growth during the quarter. 
Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $26.1 million, which was down slightly from the prior year, while operating margins declined due to an unusual product mix in the quarter. The significant amount of the MSC shipments as well as large deliveries of a certain Man Portable product each came at lower-than-normal margins for the segment. Based on our backlog, we expect shipments of these products to be lower in the second half, while shipments of higher-margin products should help bring Surveillance operating margins back to the high 20s. 
Surveillance backlog increased $27 million from the end of Q1 to $341 million and is up 19% from 1 year ago. Strong order flow from international customers, including ones in Latin America, Asia and Europe, helped add to the backlog. 
Additionally, the acquisition of Armasight and the delay in getting certain export licenses further increased our backlog. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 in the second quarter, which was the fourth time in the last 5 quarters the book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1. As Andy mentioned, during the second quarter, we acquired Armasight, a leading night vision and thermal tactical scopes company. The addition of Armasight's product line and management team will provide us with meaningful scaling and additional capabilities in the hunting, outdoors and military scope space. As we integrate our existing PBS and military scopes business with Armasight, we have renamed the combined business FLIR Outdoor and Tactical Systems, or OTS, which will be reported within the Surveillance segment going forward. 
During the second quarter, Surveillance introduced 3 new products, as shown on Slide 8. At the Farnborough Airshow, we showcased our new 380-HLDc gimbaled EO/IR system that features HD thermal and visible imaging and precision laser designation capability in a low-profile form factor. By integrating laser designation capability into this form factor, which offers improved ground clearance, the 380 HLDc brings laser designation capability to aircraft that were previously unable to perform this crucial role. Our radar team introduced the R6SS portable ground radar that uses advanced -- utilizes advanced digital beam forming to enable detection, tracking of people from up to 15 kilometers away. Also launched this quarter was Surveillance's new integrated vehicle system, the LTV-X. The LTV-X is a compact, modular, four-wheel vehicle that features our attack FLIR 280-HD multispectral gimbal, the R6SS radar and onboard command and control software. The product offers a turnkey, highly transportable solution for advanced border, surveillance and reconnaissance. 
On Slide 9, you'll see a summary of the Instruments segment. Revenue declined 14% compared to the prior year to $78.1 million. Significant MERS-related sales in Asia and a communicated price increase in Europe each drove higher shipments in Q2 of last year, which created a difficult comparison for Instruments in the second quarter of this year. While we continue to see very good growth in firefighting and automation lines of business, it was not enough to fully offset the relative declines in the other businesses, including continued weakness in the plant and predictive maintenance line of products. The softness in the PPM product line related to mid-range products was partially offset by strong sales in the recently introduced high-end T1K product. 
Instruments operating profit was $19.1 million or 25% of the revenue in the quarter. Manufacturing overhead, investments in the development of low-cost molded infrared lens production capability and reduced operating leverage related to lower revenue levels contributed to the relatively low margins. We expect that margin improvement initiatives implemented in Q3 will allow Instruments to return to second half operating margins in the 30% range, which is customary for the back half of the year. 
During the second quarter, Instruments introduced the DM284, our latest IGM Test & Measurement tool. With this digital multimeter, we have integrated our Lepton thermal camera to create a differentiated version of an everyday tool that electricians use, allowing them to now visualize temperature anomalies and other electrical problems that are not visible to the naked eye. 
On Slide 10 is our Security segment's results. Security's second quarter revenue of $63.4 million was up 6% over the prior year. Growth in enterprise-class products was offset by lower sales of thermal products versus a difficult comparable in the prior year, where we saw significant shipments of high-end, long-range, cooled camera system. 
Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, up significantly over Q1 of this year yet below the prior year. Gross margins were largely in line with last year. However, increased operating expenses and intangible amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability. We are taking costs out of the Security segment as we rightsize this operation. 
During the quarter, Security segment acquired the assets of Innovative Security Designs, or ISD. ISD provides advanced security hardware and software solutions to the enterprise security market. While not meaningful from a financial standpoint, the acquisition has strategic importance and that we have brought onboard a very experienced engineering team that will add significant capabilities and knowledge to the company to help with our innovation of advanced solutions for the security industry. 
The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM and Emerging's second quarter revenue was $57 million, increasing 23% over last year. Strong growth occurred in our IR camera recorders as well as our FLIR ONE and FLIR drone camera sales continue to grow significantly. OEM and Emerging operating profit was $16.1 million in the quarter, increasing 53% over the prior year and reaching 28% operating margin as increased revenue resulted in meaningful operating leverage benefit. 
During the second quarter, OEM and Emerging introduced a new version of the popular View series of thermal cameras for commercial drones. The View Pro R is a radiometric thermal camera that enables drone operators with the ability to accurately measure temperature remotely down to the individual pixel level as well as import images into our FLIR tools application for detailed analysis from reporting. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenues were $55.2 million, representing 6% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of radars, thermal cameras and multifunction displays drove the revenue growth. The Marine variant of our Scout TK handheld monocular was introduced in the quarter and was well-received by the market. 
Maritime operating income was $6.7 million in the quarter, reaching 12% operating margin in the segment's seasonal high quarter. Our recent inventory improvement initiatives showed good results in Maritime segment, as our ending second quarter balance was down $10 million versus Q1 and down $3 million compared to the last year. 
Maritime introduced several new products during the quarter, including the R17 release of Raymarine's lighthouse operating system for multi-function displays, which incorporates advanced dock-to-dock autorouting capability for boaters as well as sonar-enabled mapping. Raymarine introduced 2 HD visible cameras, the CAM 210 and CAM220, which enable boaters to monitor their boats and keep themselves and their passenger safe on the water. Also introduced was the new Raymarine Evolution R4 autopilot. The Evolution R4 brings advanced patented wind correction capabilities to its adaptive core, in addition to increased accuracy and tracking away points. 
The Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 13. Detection's second quarter revenue was down 2% year-over-year to $35.7 million. The timing of deliveries under our DR SKO orders can result in quarter-to-quarter variability, and in the second quarter of last year, we shipped the most units since the program began, causing a difficult comparable for the quarter. 
All of Detection's other product lines grew year-over-year to mostly offset the decline in DR SKO. Unchanged gross margins, combined with reduced operating expenses, resulted in over 2 percentage points of operating margin improvement. 
Detection finished the second quarter with $74 million of backlog, declining $23 million since Q1 due to shipments under the DR SKO order. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's second quarter. I will now hand the call back to Andy."

Delays related to our license and processes for international customers pushed approximately $20 million of revenue into the second half of the year. In the back half of the year, we expect to see revenue growth rates that exceed what we've seen during the second quarter. Supporting this was year-over-year bookings growth of 9% in the second quarter, resulting in the highest backlog we've seen in nearly 8 years. 
We expect to enhance both our gross and operating margins in the second half as well. Recent margin degradation is the by-product of successes in certain lower-margin business lines, temporary product mix headwinds in Surveillance and increased manufacturing costs. As stated earlier, we intend to improve our operating efficiency and cost structure to bring our margins back in line. 
Including the benefits from our margin improvement initiative and the expectation of a more usual product mix in Surveillance, we expect to see gross margins to improve by approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter. 
Sensor volumes increased considerably during the second quarter. Success in selling Lepton camera recorders to OEMs and success of our own branded Lepton-based products that helped drive 200% growth in the number of Lepton units produced compared to last year. While we're working diligently to build relationships with high-volume OEMs, this volume ramp is helping to reduce the cost to manufacture all of our uncooled sensors. 
Our long-term strategy of being the World's Sixth Sense is centered on innovating advanced sensing technologies that solve people needs for safety, security, process efficiency and environmental preservation.
When we look at our core technology of thermal sensing, the runway in front of us remains very long. Price and awareness continue to be barriers the we are gradually overcoming. We have a strong presence in many existing markets but continue to be focused on developing new applications and use cases to drive overall growth in both awareness and utilization of the technology. 
Our sensor costs continue to come down, allowing us to expand the overall customer base while maintaining our margins. We remain focused on building our product suite, distribution channels and overall product solutions in a way that utilizes our capital efficiently while creating strong returns for our shareholders. 
That concludes our comments on the second quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open the call up for your questions. Operator?"

I mean, number one was really the headline revenue there. The revenue was lower than we expected. We had a difficult comp, as Tom mentioned in his prepared comments, that we had executed a price increase last year that pulled some orders from Q3 into Q2 last year. The other issue that occurred last year is we had a little over $4 million of bookings and -- both bookings and shipments last year that were related to the MERS outbreak in Korea that did not reoccur this year so that the lower revenue resulted in lower overall absorption manufacturing overheads in the Instruments business. The other thing -- there were a couple of other things going on there. We have had an ongoing investment in new optics capability in -- that's centered in the Instruments business. We fundamentally have 3 optics technologies at the company wafer-scale optics, molded optics and diamond-point turned optics. And we have a fairly concentrated investment effort going on in the molded side to be able to produce our own molded chalcoginate optics in the future, and those will be used across the business segments. So 5 out of the 6 of the segments will utilize those optics going forward. And the expenses in that area are a little bit higher than anticipated and not fully absorbed by the operation.

So I'll talk about -- first about the thermal end of the business. That is a business that is still very much in its infancy. The value proposition for thermal cameras in the security space is quite strong as it significantly improves the accuracy of video analytics-based system. We've introduced some new products in that space just recently, our FC-ID series, which is the first product that we've introduced that has fully integrated edge-based video analytic capability that's very quick and easy to set up and quite reliable from an accuracy standpoint. That really brings a differentiated value proposition to outdoor perimeter security applications, leveraging the capabilities of thermal imaging. In Q2, we changed some of our export licensing processes to refine those, and that resulted in the delay in obtaining some export license, and that manifested itself in the Security segment, to some degree in the Instrument segment and more so in the Surveillance segment. And as a result, that pushed some deliveries from Q2 into the second half, and that was manifested in the Security-based revenues. And that again pertains only to thermal products. In the visible space, the competition there has increased. And as we've seen some of the larger Chinese suppliers enter the markets directly, that has put some pressure on margins as a result of increased competition. Our strategy there is to offer more enterprise-class products, and that will be supported by the DVTEL integration. Also in that space, we believe that over the long term, the opportunity to offer integrated thermal and visible products, or hybrid products, as we call them, will give us a differentiated solution that will not only be unique but also have the ability to generate higher margins than traditional visual products."

We have a business today that is part of Surveillance that we call PVS, Personal Vision Systems. And that is a tactical scopes and sight business. The products that we've launched there are products that were designed to create new opening price points in that market. So we have typically been the price leader in that space. And also in our Surveillance business, though, we have some higher-end, more CDMQ-oriented tactical scopes and sites. And Armasight, in the thermal space, actually kind of fills in the gap between those 2 product ranges, between our true consumer and a military product with products that are more prosumer and paramilitary-oriented. The other thing that Armasight has is a fairly large business of enhanced night vision products. So these are a combination of I Squared technology, Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 I Squared technology and also low-light CCD and CMOS-based products. The opportunity here, I think, is quite good for 2 reasons. Number one is the outdoor hunting market, nighttime operations of outdoor hunting is increasing. And also the interest in digitally based scopes and sights is going up, both with the availability of lower-cost thermal technology and the availability of lower-cost, lowlight visible technology. So Armasight really brings a capability to us, particularly in the lowlight visible space and I Squared space, but also will allow us to create more of a Center of Excellence and provide some scale to the business around that tactical outdoor scopes and sights area. So we're pretty excited about this space. It's a growing space. We also see the international market as a pretty strong opportunity for us as most of Armasight's sales are U.S.-based at this point.

So there's 3 -- we divide the market and we talk about it in 3 ways. We have kind of the consumer business. We have a small business, or SMB, and the enterprise class. And the consumer business is highly competitive. The differentiation is relatively low. We have very good product. The amount of inventory we hold moves almost in the quarter we receive it. So it's not a large inventory balance. That's pretty competitive on price. It's a very high-volume business, and I think that's not where we're focusing. SMB is the business where Andy mentioned we're seeing the major Chinese manufacturers enter and competing primarily on price, again there are certain things we can add, a little more differentiation, and we're participating in that business, but is, again, not the focus. What Andy was referencing is that third market, it's the enterprise where we can create differentiated products and solution, the ability to have healthy margins and that is much stronger. The importance of thermal and an end-to-end solution is stronger. And so that's where we are focusing our efforts. And that's where we can achieve the superior margins, and that shift towards the enterprise products will improve the margins for the business overall."

So I'm wondering, with regard to DVTEL, above and beyond the amortization issue, what -- and above the command and control issue potential there, what can you do to essentially get the sales force -- get individual sales forces from other divisions to start using the technology that DVTEL can bring so it's not -- because it's not just a high-end VMS or camera company, it obviously is a technology company that could be used across various division lines?

And they're actually quite applicable. There are really 2 fundamental technologies there that can be used elsewhere, and those are the VMS technology and the cloud-based technologies that the DVTEL engineering team is working on. Those are applicable. The cloud-based technology is fundamentally applicable across each of our segments, and the VMS technology can be utilized in Surveillance, in Maritime, and of course it's already being used in the Security segment. The opportunity for having a high-level integrated VMS system tied together with the C2 system and then backed up with cloud access capability is something that is quite attractive for boaters, for example, in terms of being able to keep an eye on what's going on in a boat, both while at voyage and while the boat is at the harbor. And also in the Surveillance segment, at the end of the day, what we do in the Surveillance segment is we provide ISR capabilities across a variety of platforms. And the ability to both record and disseminate that information is becoming increasingly important, and that's fundamentally what the Security segment capabilities will bring to the other segments."

From a cost standpoint, we think we're properly leveraged there, so we don't see that we'll -- we don't expect to see a significant change in margin. I think the big question here, and I'm sure everybody is talking about this, is what will the impact be on the EU in total. We're currently expecting our European revenues to be flat with H1. We actually had some aberrations last year. H1 was stronger than H2 from a European revenue standpoint. And this year, we're going to -- we believe that, that will -- that will flatten out.

In fact, most commercial drones that are being flown today with thermal cameras on them are being flown with either the FLIR Vue Pro-R or the DJI-FLIR Zenmuse XT. Growth in that business has been quite strong, and the penetration is extraordinarily low. As a percentage of the total number of commercial drones that are being sold today, it's still quite a small number, but we expect that to continue to grow through 3 potential initiatives here. One is this product expansion line. So we're expanding the product offering there to be beyond the current product offering, which is primarily Tau based. So we'll be adding in Lepton-based platforms as well. We've just added radiometric capability, which is remote temperature measurement capability, in the FLIR Vue Pro-R, and that will get expanded across other manufacturers as well. So temperature measurements can be done. And the third issue is the back-end software processing. So at the end of the day, these drones get the cameras in the air, and the camera images -- the cameras capture images, but ultimately what you do with those images is really where the value gets delivered. So the ability to create 3D orthomosaics and have those be radiometrically calibrated are important characteristics for that market, and we've been working very aggressively, both independently and with partners, to develop that capability. And we'll have more to talk about that during the second half of the year."

With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison. 
I'll start to review the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $403 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 1% over second quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 5%. Year-to-date, government products revenues are up 12% over the first 6 months of 2015.
On the commercial side, softness in our Instruments and Security segments was only partially offset by growth in our Emerging and Maritime product lines. Deliveries of cooled and uncooled thermal camera recorders, NFC systems and Man-Portable products help drive the growth in government products. However, both the NFC and Man-Portable products carry relatively low margins.
Earnings per share were $0.33, which were negatively affected by a $2 million write-down in the carrying value of a minority equity investment we hold in a third-party company. Excluding this nonoperating expense, earnings were $0.34 per share. While gross margins were pressured by unusual product mix and somewhat elevated manufacturing costs, we improved our operating margin by 110 basis points over the first quarter of this year. 
Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 17% year-over-year to $629 million, as we saw 9% growth in overall orders versus the prior year. This is our highest backlog balance since 2008, which was the height of our activity for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 19% over the balance at the end of Q2 2015. 
On the new products front, the Surveillance segment introduced the new Star SAFIRE 380-HLDc at the Farnborough Airshow this month. The 380-HLDc is our latest variant of the 380-HDC Gimbel platform that adds laser designation capability to this highly differentiated, compact, airborne EO/IR system. Surveillance also announced the new LTV-X all-terrain turn-key mobile surveillance vehicle, which has onboard attack FLIR nimble multisensor as well as our new R6SS beamforming, long-distance ground radar.
And also during the quarter, the Instruments segment introduced the latest infrared-guided measurement, or IGM, Test & Measurement product, the DM284 all-in-one digital multimeter.
During the second quarter, we completed a couple of financing transactions that will allow us to have more capability and flexibility in our capital deployment strategies. We expanded our revolving credit facility to $500 million and issued $425 million of new publicly traded notes, the proceeds of which have been used to repay our existing $250 million of notes and increase our U.S. cash balance.
We also completed the acquisition of sporting and tactical scopes business, Armasight, which will strengthen our presence in both the recreational and military weapon sights and scopes markets. Armasight did not impact our second quarter results and is not expected to meaningfully impact EPS during 2016, but we do expect to see acceleration under the FLIR brand as well as profit synergies in 2017, as the business leverages our brand and vertical integration in the thermal space.
On Slide 4, you'll see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. Based on the profit margin seen in the first half of the year, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65 for the full year, excluding any charges related to cost-reduction initiatives in the second half and the tax reserve and investment write-down booked in the first half. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items. 
We expect to see improved margins in the second half, driven by favorable product mix changes, targeted price increases and reductions in manufacturing and SG&A costs. These changes are expected to result in an overall gross margin improvement of approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter.
We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on September 2 to shareholders of record as of August 19.
I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the second quarter financial results. Amit?"

Consolidated revenue was $403 million, a 2% increase compared to the second quarter of 2015. Overall impact of exchange rate changes on revenue and operating income was minor. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the OEM and Emerging, Maritime, Security and Surveillance segments, increasing 23%, 6%, 6% and 5%, respectively. 
Instrument and Detection revenues declined by 14% and 2%, respectively. 
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S., Middle East and Africa and Asia by 9%, 10% and 3%, respectively, while it declined in Europe by 12% and in Canada and LatAm by 9%. 
Sales to the U.S. government increased $24 million or 32% and represented 25% of total revenue compared to 19% in the second quarter of 2015.
Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 46%, 273 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to changes in product mix, manufacturing costs under absorption and additional costs associated with the ramp-up of our low-cost IR lens capability. As a result of cost control measures, operating expenses reduced by $1 million year-over-year despite the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business. Our operating margins fell from 18% to 16% as a result of the decline in gross margin, partially offset by operating expense reduction.
We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 25%, excluding any discrete tax items. And our second quarter tax expense was $14.5 million. 
Net earnings for the second quarter of 2016 totaled $45.4 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Excluding the impact of a minority investment write-down of $2 million, adjusted net income was $47.4 million and adjusted EPS was $0.34 compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2015. 
We closed the second quarter with cash of $903 million, an increase of $393 million during the quarter, primarily driven by proceeds from the debt refinancing and strong operating cash flow.
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $81.7 million or 173% of adjusted net income, driven by improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. Accounts receivables and inventory improved during the quarter, resulting in a lower quarter-over-quarter cash conversion cycle. 
During the quarter, we acquired Armasight for $41 million and had capital expenditures of $10.9 million. We repurchased 950,000 shares for $29.7 million and returned another $16.6 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. 
Our cash balance increased as a result of the $425 million of new debt, $250 million of which was earmarked for repayment of our previous notes, which was settled in early July. 
This concludes the summary of our second quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"
327408,369842388,1014674,"FLIR Systems, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Teledyne FLIR LLC","Executives","Thank you, Amit.

Slide 6 shows a summary of our second quarter segment results. While 4 of our 6 segments achieved good growth during the quarter, overall growth was hampered by softness in our Instruments and Detection segments. Segment-level operating profit was down 9%, as we saw gross margin headwinds due to product mix, under-absorption of manufacturing costs and acquisition-related intangible amortization. 
Moving to Slide 7, which covers the Surveillance segment. Second quarter revenue for Surveillance was $113.4 million, up 5% over the second quarter of 2015. Increased revenue from the MSC program, Man Portable product line and Personal Vision Systems product line each contributed to the growth. Delays related to export licensing requirements created a headwind to this growth during the quarter. 
Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $26.1 million, which was down slightly from the prior year, while operating margins declined due to an unusual product mix in the quarter. The significant amount of the MSC shipments as well as large deliveries of a certain Man Portable product each came at lower-than-normal margins for the segment. Based on our backlog, we expect shipments of these products to be lower in the second half, while shipments of higher-margin products should help bring Surveillance operating margins back to the high 20s. 
Surveillance backlog increased $27 million from the end of Q1 to $341 million and is up 19% from 1 year ago. Strong order flow from international customers, including ones in Latin America, Asia and Europe, helped add to the backlog. 
Additionally, the acquisition of Armasight and the delay in getting certain export licenses further increased our backlog. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.1 in the second quarter, which was the fourth time in the last 5 quarters the book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1. As Andy mentioned, during the second quarter, we acquired Armasight, a leading night vision and thermal tactical scopes company. The addition of Armasight's product line and management team will provide us with meaningful scaling and additional capabilities in the hunting, outdoors and military scope space. As we integrate our existing PBS and military scopes business with Armasight, we have renamed the combined business FLIR Outdoor and Tactical Systems, or OTS, which will be reported within the Surveillance segment going forward. 
During the second quarter, Surveillance introduced 3 new products, as shown on Slide 8. At the Farnborough Airshow, we showcased our new 380-HLDc gimbaled EO/IR system that features HD thermal and visible imaging and precision laser designation capability in a low-profile form factor. By integrating laser designation capability into this form factor, which offers improved ground clearance, the 380 HLDc brings laser designation capability to aircraft that were previously unable to perform this crucial role. Our radar team introduced the R6SS portable ground radar that uses advanced -- utilizes advanced digital beam forming to enable detection, tracking of people from up to 15 kilometers away. Also launched this quarter was Surveillance's new integrated vehicle system, the LTV-X. The LTV-X is a compact, modular, four-wheel vehicle that features our attack FLIR 280-HD multispectral gimbal, the R6SS radar and onboard command and control software. The product offers a turnkey, highly transportable solution for advanced border, surveillance and reconnaissance. 
On Slide 9, you'll see a summary of the Instruments segment. Revenue declined 14% compared to the prior year to $78.1 million. Significant MERS-related sales in Asia and a communicated price increase in Europe each drove higher shipments in Q2 of last year, which created a difficult comparison for Instruments in the second quarter of this year. While we continue to see very good growth in firefighting and automation lines of business, it was not enough to fully offset the relative declines in the other businesses, including continued weakness in the plant and predictive maintenance line of products. The softness in the PPM product line related to mid-range products was partially offset by strong sales in the recently introduced high-end T1K product. 
Instruments operating profit was $19.1 million or 25% of the revenue in the quarter. Manufacturing overhead, investments in the development of low-cost molded infrared lens production capability and reduced operating leverage related to lower revenue levels contributed to the relatively low margins. We expect that margin improvement initiatives implemented in Q3 will allow Instruments to return to second half operating margins in the 30% range, which is customary for the back half of the year. 
During the second quarter, Instruments introduced the DM284, our latest IGM Test & Measurement tool. With this digital multimeter, we have integrated our Lepton thermal camera to create a differentiated version of an everyday tool that electricians use, allowing them to now visualize temperature anomalies and other electrical problems that are not visible to the naked eye. 
On Slide 10 is our Security segment's results. Security's second quarter revenue of $63.4 million was up 6% over the prior year. Growth in enterprise-class products was offset by lower sales of thermal products versus a difficult comparable in the prior year, where we saw significant shipments of high-end, long-range, cooled camera system. 
Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, up significantly over Q1 of this year yet below the prior year. Gross margins were largely in line with last year. However, increased operating expenses and intangible amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability. We are taking costs out of the Security segment as we rightsize this operation. 
During the quarter, Security segment acquired the assets of Innovative Security Designs, or ISD. ISD provides advanced security hardware and software solutions to the enterprise security market. While not meaningful from a financial standpoint, the acquisition has strategic importance and that we have brought onboard a very experienced engineering team that will add significant capabilities and knowledge to the company to help with our innovation of advanced solutions for the security industry. 
The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM and Emerging's second quarter revenue was $57 million, increasing 23% over last year. Strong growth occurred in our IR camera recorders as well as our FLIR ONE and FLIR drone camera sales continue to grow significantly. OEM and Emerging operating profit was $16.1 million in the quarter, increasing 53% over the prior year and reaching 28% operating margin as increased revenue resulted in meaningful operating leverage benefit. 
During the second quarter, OEM and Emerging introduced a new version of the popular View series of thermal cameras for commercial drones. The View Pro R is a radiometric thermal camera that enables drone operators with the ability to accurately measure temperature remotely down to the individual pixel level as well as import images into our FLIR tools application for detailed analysis from reporting. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenues were $55.2 million, representing 6% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of radars, thermal cameras and multifunction displays drove the revenue growth. The Marine variant of our Scout TK handheld monocular was introduced in the quarter and was well-received by the market. 
Maritime operating income was $6.7 million in the quarter, reaching 12% operating margin in the segment's seasonal high quarter. Our recent inventory improvement initiatives showed good results in Maritime segment, as our ending second quarter balance was down $10 million versus Q1 and down $3 million compared to the last year. 
Maritime introduced several new products during the quarter, including the R17 release of Raymarine's lighthouse operating system for multi-function displays, which incorporates advanced dock-to-dock autorouting capability for boaters as well as sonar-enabled mapping. Raymarine introduced 2 HD visible cameras, the CAM 210 and CAM220, which enable boaters to monitor their boats and keep themselves and their passenger safe on the water. Also introduced was the new Raymarine Evolution R4 autopilot. The Evolution R4 brings advanced patented wind correction capabilities to its adaptive core, in addition to increased accuracy and tracking away points. 
The Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 13. Detection's second quarter revenue was down 2% year-over-year to $35.7 million. The timing of deliveries under our DR SKO orders can result in quarter-to-quarter variability, and in the second quarter of last year, we shipped the most units since the program began, causing a difficult comparable for the quarter. 
All of Detection's other product lines grew year-over-year to mostly offset the decline in DR SKO. Unchanged gross margins, combined with reduced operating expenses, resulted in over 2 percentage points of operating margin improvement. 
Detection finished the second quarter with $74 million of backlog, declining $23 million since Q1 due to shipments under the DR SKO order. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's second quarter. I will now hand the call back to Andy."

Delays related to our license and processes for international customers pushed approximately $20 million of revenue into the second half of the year. In the back half of the year, we expect to see revenue growth rates that exceed what we've seen during the second quarter. Supporting this was year-over-year bookings growth of 9% in the second quarter, resulting in the highest backlog we've seen in nearly 8 years. 
We expect to enhance both our gross and operating margins in the second half as well. Recent margin degradation is the by-product of successes in certain lower-margin business lines, temporary product mix headwinds in Surveillance and increased manufacturing costs. As stated earlier, we intend to improve our operating efficiency and cost structure to bring our margins back in line. 
Including the benefits from our margin improvement initiative and the expectation of a more usual product mix in Surveillance, we expect to see gross margins to improve by approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter. 
Sensor volumes increased considerably during the second quarter. Success in selling Lepton camera recorders to OEMs and success of our own branded Lepton-based products that helped drive 200% growth in the number of Lepton units produced compared to last year. While we're working diligently to build relationships with high-volume OEMs, this volume ramp is helping to reduce the cost to manufacture all of our uncooled sensors. 
Our long-term strategy of being the World's Sixth Sense is centered on innovating advanced sensing technologies that solve people needs for safety, security, process efficiency and environmental preservation.
When we look at our core technology of thermal sensing, the runway in front of us remains very long. Price and awareness continue to be barriers the we are gradually overcoming. We have a strong presence in many existing markets but continue to be focused on developing new applications and use cases to drive overall growth in both awareness and utilization of the technology. 
Our sensor costs continue to come down, allowing us to expand the overall customer base while maintaining our margins. We remain focused on building our product suite, distribution channels and overall product solutions in a way that utilizes our capital efficiently while creating strong returns for our shareholders. 
That concludes our comments on the second quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open the call up for your questions. Operator?"

I mean, number one was really the headline revenue there. The revenue was lower than we expected. We had a difficult comp, as Tom mentioned in his prepared comments, that we had executed a price increase last year that pulled some orders from Q3 into Q2 last year. The other issue that occurred last year is we had a little over $4 million of bookings and -- both bookings and shipments last year that were related to the MERS outbreak in Korea that did not reoccur this year so that the lower revenue resulted in lower overall absorption manufacturing overheads in the Instruments business. The other thing -- there were a couple of other things going on there. We have had an ongoing investment in new optics capability in -- that's centered in the Instruments business. We fundamentally have 3 optics technologies at the company wafer-scale optics, molded optics and diamond-point turned optics. And we have a fairly concentrated investment effort going on in the molded side to be able to produce our own molded chalcoginate optics in the future, and those will be used across the business segments. So 5 out of the 6 of the segments will utilize those optics going forward. And the expenses in that area are a little bit higher than anticipated and not fully absorbed by the operation.

So I'll talk about -- first about the thermal end of the business. That is a business that is still very much in its infancy. The value proposition for thermal cameras in the security space is quite strong as it significantly improves the accuracy of video analytics-based system. We've introduced some new products in that space just recently, our FC-ID series, which is the first product that we've introduced that has fully integrated edge-based video analytic capability that's very quick and easy to set up and quite reliable from an accuracy standpoint. That really brings a differentiated value proposition to outdoor perimeter security applications, leveraging the capabilities of thermal imaging. In Q2, we changed some of our export licensing processes to refine those, and that resulted in the delay in obtaining some export license, and that manifested itself in the Security segment, to some degree in the Instrument segment and more so in the Surveillance segment. And as a result, that pushed some deliveries from Q2 into the second half, and that was manifested in the Security-based revenues. And that again pertains only to thermal products. In the visible space, the competition there has increased. And as we've seen some of the larger Chinese suppliers enter the markets directly, that has put some pressure on margins as a result of increased competition. Our strategy there is to offer more enterprise-class products, and that will be supported by the DVTEL integration. Also in that space, we believe that over the long term, the opportunity to offer integrated thermal and visible products, or hybrid products, as we call them, will give us a differentiated solution that will not only be unique but also have the ability to generate higher margins than traditional visual products."

We have a business today that is part of Surveillance that we call PVS, Personal Vision Systems. And that is a tactical scopes and sight business. The products that we've launched there are products that were designed to create new opening price points in that market. So we have typically been the price leader in that space. And also in our Surveillance business, though, we have some higher-end, more CDMQ-oriented tactical scopes and sites. And Armasight, in the thermal space, actually kind of fills in the gap between those 2 product ranges, between our true consumer and a military product with products that are more prosumer and paramilitary-oriented. The other thing that Armasight has is a fairly large business of enhanced night vision products. So these are a combination of I Squared technology, Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 I Squared technology and also low-light CCD and CMOS-based products. The opportunity here, I think, is quite good for 2 reasons. Number one is the outdoor hunting market, nighttime operations of outdoor hunting is increasing. And also the interest in digitally based scopes and sights is going up, both with the availability of lower-cost thermal technology and the availability of lower-cost, lowlight visible technology. So Armasight really brings a capability to us, particularly in the lowlight visible space and I Squared space, but also will allow us to create more of a Center of Excellence and provide some scale to the business around that tactical outdoor scopes and sights area. So we're pretty excited about this space. It's a growing space. We also see the international market as a pretty strong opportunity for us as most of Armasight's sales are U.S.-based at this point. And we've got a little bit larger footprint internationally that we can leverage their products through."

So we have a group that's called 360 Surveillance that was part of our Surveillance group. And we have moved them out of the Surveillance group into the Security group at the beginning of this year. And fundamentally, what it does is it creates a full end-to-end solution between a network of visible and thermal security cameras, combined together with radar, ground-based sensors, with a video management system, and then 360 brings in that top-down view of the C2 system. And that will be utilized both for stationary systems and for mobile systems. So this is also technology that we've deployed in the new LTV-X product that Tom mentioned earlier that was launched in the Surveillance space. That level of capability of having a true C2 layer on top of a VMS is something that really not many people are offering in the market today, and I think we're going to have a very unique product offering there, in particular, for the markets where we are particularly strong, which is sort of the outdoor perimeter surveillance markets.

SMB is the business where Andy mentioned we're seeing the major Chinese manufacturers enter and competing primarily on price, again there are certain things we can add, a little more differentiation, and we're participating in that business, but is, again, not the focus. What Andy was referencing is that third market, it's the enterprise where we can create differentiated products and solution, the ability to have healthy margins and that is much stronger.

The cloud-based technology is fundamentally applicable across each of our segments, and the VMS technology can be utilized in Surveillance, in Maritime, and of course it's already being used in the Security segment. The opportunity for having a high-level integrated VMS system tied together with the C2 system and then backed up with cloud access capability is something that is quite attractive for boaters, for example, in terms of being able to keep an eye on what's going on in a boat, both while at voyage and while the boat is at the harbor. And also in the Surveillance segment, at the end of the day, what we do in the Surveillance segment is we provide ISR capabilities across a variety of platforms.

And that's just lumpy. We have a very competitive product line there, but it's -- those programs tend to be lumpier than the normal cadence of uncooled cameras in the Security space."

From a cost standpoint, we think we're properly leveraged there, so we don't see that we'll -- we don't expect to see a significant change in margin. I think the big question here, and I'm sure everybody is talking about this, is what will the impact be on the EU in total. We're currently expecting our European revenues to be flat with H1. We actually had some aberrations last year. H1 was stronger than H2 from a European revenue standpoint. And this year, we're going to -- we believe that, that will -- that will flatten out. Last year, we saw that delta primarily because of the fact that we had price increases in a few of the segments in Q2 of last year, and it pulled orders from H2 into H1.

But I don't want to go to that level of fidelity on unit volumes. But I can tell you a couple of important factors here. In terms of the number of thermal imaging cameras that are being flown on drones, both commercial and military today, I mean, we dominate that space by a long shot. And we not only had a relationship with DJI, but we have a relationship with several of the other leading commercial drone manufacturers today. In fact, most commercial drones that are being flown today with thermal cameras on them are being flown with either the FLIR Vue Pro-R or the DJI-FLIR Zenmuse XT. Growth in that business has been quite strong, and the penetration is extraordinarily low. As a percentage of the total number of commercial drones that are being sold today, it's still quite a small number, but we expect that to continue to grow through 3 potential initiatives here. One is this product expansion line. So we're expanding the product offering there to be beyond the current product offering, which is primarily Tau based. So we'll be adding in Lepton-based platforms as well. We've just added radiometric capability, which is remote temperature measurement capability, in the FLIR Vue Pro-R, and that will get expanded across other manufacturers as well. So temperature measurements can be done. And the third issue is the back-end software processing. So at the end of the day, these drones get the cameras in the air, and the camera images -- the cameras capture images, but ultimately what you do with those images is really where the value gets delivered. So the ability to create 3D orthomosaics and have those be radiometrically calibrated are important characteristics for that market, and we've been working very aggressively, both independently and with partners, to develop that capability. And we'll have more to talk about that during the second half of the year."

With Todd and me today is our CFO; Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and SVP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison. I will start the review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. 
This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $405 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 10% over the third quarter of 2015 and Government product revenues grew 2%. Driving the year-over-year growth in commercial products where the newly acquired products from DVTEL and Armasight, strength in fire and PPM building products and increased Lepton core sales. On the government product side, increased deliveries of military thermal camera cores, land-based imaging systems and Man Portable systems were partially offset by slower activity from our airborne gimbaled products. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.43, which were negatively affected by a $2 million charge we took in the quarter for the expected cost to remedy product quality issues that were identified with certain of our SkyWatch surveillance towers that are in the field. Excluding this charge to cost of goods, earnings were $0.44 per share. This represents 10% growth in EPS versus the third quarter of 2015 when you adjust out that discrete tax benefit we saw last year of $0.12 per diluted share. 
Growth and operating profit margin from third quarter improved significantly on a sequential basis, up 170 and 380 basis points, respectively, compared to Q2 of 2016. Stronger product mix and better absorption of overhead cost help increased gross margin, while lower OpEx spending drove further improvement in our operating margin. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $89 million, our highest quarterly cash flow from operations since 2013. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow has grown 9% over the first 9 months of 2015, the result of our focus on improving our accounts receivable collection and controlling inventory levels. 
Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 13% year-over-year to $644 million, our highest since 2008 and our fifth straight quarter where we've shown sequential growth in backlog. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 16% over the balance at the end of Q3 2015. 
On the new products front, the Instruments segment launched a new and improved A35 and A65 thermal temperature sensors for continuous monitoring and automation systems. The Security segment released the newest version of Latitude enterprise Class VMS software. And our OEM and Emerging segments traffic business introduced the RFX F [ph] thermal sensor for passenger, train and railcar applications. And just a couple of weeks ago, the Detection segment introduced the new R100 personal radiation detector. 
On October 3, we announced our agreement to acquire Point Grey Research. You'll see on Slide 4 a summary of the transaction and the business. Point Grey, which is based in Vancouver, BC, is a global leader in developing and selling machine vision cameras. These are advanced visible imaging cameras and solutions used in industrial automation systems, people carrying systems, medical diagnostic equipment, intelligent traffic systems, military and the defense products and advanced mapping systems. We are enthusiastic about the potential of this transaction as we feel machine vision and retail people counting are very attractive end markets and are 2 largely underpenetrated applications spaces for thermal imaging. Point Grey will provide us a scalable platform, from which to grow the business and integrate our thermal technology. 
Thermal imaging provides a differentiated data set for a wide range of machine vision applications to include the ability to remotely measure temperature, accurately analyze thermal pattern and see-through factory obscurants including smoke, dust and steam. Common applications include monitoring welding, drying, filling, molding, curing and extruding processes as well as a range of food processing and nondestructive testing applications. Additionally, thermal technology can improve people counting solutions giving the ability to accurately detect, track and quantify living beings in a wide range of environmental conditions. 
Point Grey's product and the selling strategy is very similar to our OEM camera core business and that itself camera modules on a B2B basis to makers of imaging and automation systems and as such, the business is expected to be a very strategic fit for our OEM and emerging  segment. We look forward to bringing about Point Grey team onboard in getting started on innovating the next generation of machine vision solutions. 
We expect to close the transaction during the fourth quarter and the acquisition price of approximately $253 million will be funded by our current foreign cash balances. While we're not discussing the financials of Point Grey specifically, we do expect transaction-related costs to negatively impact FLIR's fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.01 per share. However, we expect the acquisition to be accretive in 2017 and thereafter. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion and an EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, excluding the SkyWatch cost, the impact of the potential acquisition of Point Grey, the Q2 investment write-down and certain discrete tax items. This outlook represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results after adjusting for to exclude the 2016 restructuring charges, investment grain and discrete tax items. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on December 2 to shareholders of record as of November 18.

Sales in the U.S. Government increased $33 million or 42% and represented 28% of total revenue compared to 21% in the third quarter of 2015. In this quarter, we recorded a charge of $2 million with certain expected costs to remediate previously disclosed product quality issues associated with our SkyWatch surveillance towers. We have not yet completed our analysis of all affected units that might require such remediation. As we gather more information and finalize our assessments, this charge likely increase. 
Consolidated second quarter gross margins was 47%, 10 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the charge for SkyWatch repairs partially offset by favorable segment mix. 
Gross margin improved 170 basis points sequentially compared to second quarter, primarily driven by improvements in the Surveillance and Instruments segment. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 20%, 6 basis points better than last year despite the $2 million SkyWatch repair charge mentioned earlier. 
Our third quarter tax expense was $16.6 million. We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 24%, excluding certain discrete tax items. 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $58.6 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share. Third quarter 2015 net income of $73.1 million was aided by $17.4 million favorable discrete tax items related to the release of a previously reported tax reserve.  Excluding the impact of the SkyWatch repair charge, adjusted EPS for third quarter of 2016 was $0.44 compared to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2015, a 10% year-over-year improvement. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter increased 20% from year ago levels to $88.6 million or 151% of net income, driven by continued improvement in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. 
Our days sales outstanding and days inventory on hand improved year-over-year driving an improved cash converting cycle. 
Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.8 million significantly reduced from the higher levels a year ago when were in the midst of consolidating our manufacturing facilities in Santa Barbara. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $36.3 million and returned another $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We repaid the entire $250 million principal amount of maturing notes in early July. With these repayment, and the second quarter issuance of the $425 million, 5-year notes and the upsizing of our credit facility to $500 million, we have completed the implementation of our previously communicated capital strategy. 
We've increased our gross leverage ratio from 1 turn to about 1.4 turns while maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment grade rating. We've also increased our liquidity, lowered our rated average cost of capital, lowered our interest rate an increased our borrowing flexibility. 
We closed the second quarter with cash of $677.7 million. We intend to use our foreign cash balances to fund the potential acquisition of Point Grey in the fourth quarter. This will include the summary of third quarter financial results. 
Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

All segments, except Securities, showed higher revenues than the prior year. Segment level operating profit was up 8% as a result of the top line growing 6%, a steady gross margin and improved operating leverage. 
Moving to Slide 8 to cover the Surveillance segment third quarter revenue was, for Surveillance, was $136.4 million, up 4% over the third quarter 2015. Increased revenues from land and Man-Portable products as well as from the new Outdoor and Tactical Systems line of business each contributed to the growth, while our gimbaled products show decline on a difficult comparable to the prior year that included significant rate and program shipments. Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $38.4 million, which was down slightly from the prior year. However, if the SkyWatch cost are excluded from the results, then Surveillance's operating profit would have grown slightly. Compared to the second quarter this year, Surveillance operating margins improved 520 basis points as product mix returned to normal levels. Surveillance backlog increased to $22 million from the end of Q2 to $363 million and is up 16% from 1 year ago. 
Strong follow-on orders from U.S. and Middle East programs help drive the growth in backlog. 
Surveillance segment book to bill ratio was 1.2 in the quarter, which was the fifth time in the last 6 quarters that book-to-bill has been above 1.0. 
On Slide 9, you'll see a summary of the Instruments segment results. Revenue increased 11% as compared to the third quarter of 2015 to $82.7 million. The success of our new T1K premium handheld camera help our planned predictive maintenance and building product line grow over 20% year-over-year. Instruments firefighting line of products continues to gain traction in the market growing revenue $0.70 -- 70% [ph] over the prior year. Additionally, 
FLIR branded test and measurement products grew 60% over the prior year. Many of the FLIR Test & Measurement products now feature our infrared-guided measurement, or IGM technology, that is uniquely enabled by our Lepton camera core. 
Instruments operating profit in the third quarter grew 25% over the prior year to $27 million or 33% of revenue. Gross margins were equal to last year, and SCX [ph] expenses declined slightly to improve operating margins. On a sequential-quarter basis, operating margin improved by over 8 percentage points as a result of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost-containment initiatives. 
During the third quarter, Instruments introduced upgraded versions of the A35 and A65 thermal imaging temperature sensors. The new sensors, which are used for advanced process control, quality assurance, condition monitoring and fire prevention feature our more robust housing, higher vibration tolerance, new field of view options and extended temperature ranges. The sensors feature leading digital communications standards, including vision compatibility and cam protocols for seamless integration with existing customer systems. 
On Slide 10, you will see the Securities segment results. Securities third quarter revenue of $56.4 million was down 5% compared to last year's third quarter. Reduced shipments of consumer grade Lorex security bundles created a significant headwind to segment performance. Partially offsetting this, retail softness was higher enterprise class product revenue and 13% growth in thermal security cameras. 
Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, well below the prior year. While, gross margins were slightly better than last year, increased operating expenses and amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability. 
During the third quarter, we reduced Securities segment operating expense by 8%, and we continue to work to find cost improvement opportunities in the Securities segment. 
In September, the Security segment released the latest version of the enterprise class latitude video management system. This latest release adds communication protocols with all FLIR thermal security cameras and recorders support for interacting and cell-based motion detection support of FLIR cameras. This Latitude software solution enables our customers to be able to integrate large sites of up to 10,000 cameras and to control [indiscernible] or all of them with one user-friendly software interface. 
The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM and Emerging third quarter revenue was $62.7 million, increasing 22% over the prior year. Growth was seen in nearly every product line with particularly strong results from military grade thermal camera recorders. Lepton core also should significant strength with delivery to OEM customers for products such as the [indiscernible]. And the FLIR ONE [indiscernible] continues to perform well with revenue growing 131% compared to the prior year. OEM and Emerging operating profit also reached an all-time high for the quarter, increasing 40% over the prior year to $19.9 million. 
During the third quarter, OEM and Emerging intelligent traffic system line of business introduced the [indiscernible] sensor for realtime car monitoring. This new product integrates a thermal and visible camera to provide passenger and cargo train operators the ability to pre-emergently detect fires with advanced software algorithms running on the thermal datastream as well as enable the monitoring of railcar activity. 
Also during the quarter, one of our OEM customer snap-on tools introduced a Lepton-based handheld thermal imager that is specifically designed for automotive diagnostics and utilizes advanced software to help mechanics and technicians easily detect engine, HVAC and electrical issues in the car. 
As Andy mentioned, we recently announced that we have agreed to acquire Point Grey Research. Once completed, the acquired business will become the Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business within our OEM and Emerging segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenues were $40.6 million, representing 4% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of thermal cameras drove the revenue growth. Maritime operating income was $2.4 million in the quarter, representing a 6% operating margin in the segment's seasonally low quarter. Operating income grew 29% over the prior year as lower operating expenses helped operating leverage. 
The Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 13. Detection's third quarter revenue was up 2% year-over-year to $26.4 million as DR SKO shipments were up slightly over the prior year, offset by year-over-year decline in explosives product revenue. During the quarter, Detection's largest ever order for radiation products, a $9 million order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for our R300 personal radiation detector. Consistent gross margin combined with reduced operating expenses resulted in a 26% growth in operating income year-over-year. 
Detection finished the third quarter with $68 million of backlog, declining $6 million since Q2 due primarily to shipments under previously received large DR SKO orders. 
Two weeks ago, Detection introduced the R100 personal radiation detector. The R100 is a new entry-level price point for detection radiation product line. And is the industry's only IP67-certified and American National standard Institute drop test compliant personal radiation detector. It is [indiscernible] detector for used by first responders, law-enforcement, military and security personnel and features an integrated Bluetooth radio for sending reports wirelessly to Central command. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's third quarter. I'll pass the call back over to Andy."

In terms of a long-term outlook, there are a couple of things to consider. I would see that from an international perspective, we can expect to see continued demand there as there's continued political unrest internationally and our systems are very well received for ISR applications and border control applications. From the U.S. perspective, there's still a question mark about what happens relative to the continuing resolution that sets to expire on December 9 of this year. So that's a bit harder for us to predict in terms of what the budget situation is going to look like. We're hopeful that Congress can seek a successful budget resolution and that, that situation resolved for us and for the nation.

Those products are catching on and doing quite well now. So we felt very strong growth in the FLIR brand of Test & Measurement product line, most of those products are IGM Lepton-based products. The second thing we talked about was that we moved from the low and to the high end of our product range, and we refreshed that with the product recall the T1K. So that's in production and shipping nicely during the quarter, and we saw a very good uptake there in our PPM and building business and that was largely driven by traction that we saw with that T1K product. We've been nesting for the last quarter's that we've been or midrange product value ladder. It's a fairly long-term development and is scheduled to launch in early 2017 and that certainly will help to drive growth on that segment.

And we expect over time though as the thermal products get traction and take on a larger portion of the total unit sales in that space that the margin will move up into the double-digit range. The traction for thermal products in the security space continues to be quite good, and the margins both gross and operating there are quite good. It's just that the visible piece of that business is very competitive space. The total demand in China has been declining and as result of that, it's forced many of the large Chinese suppliers to look elsewhere for business and that comes more into the spaces that we compete in."

We're quite judicious in making those cuts, particularly after you do an acquisition, I think there are opportunities to set the business up to run more efficiently, and that's fundamentally what we've done. I would say that FLIR has a pretty long and demonstrated history of managing operating expenses to a prescribed model for business segment. And fundamentally, that's what we've done here. We have a specific model that prescribes how much money we spend on R&D and selling, marketing and G&A. In this particular case, we look at this business and what it's likely revenue projections are and brought those expenses in line with that model. Again, in terms of the long-term predictability of the business, I think we've got a pretty good track record of managing expenses to the top line of our individual segments, and we're comfortable at this point that the expenses have been rightsized in this business and particularly looking at the product pipeline that we've got in place right now, we are much more confident that we can deliver the results in the coming quarters."

We also have our own line of products, the FLIR View and FLIR View Pro products are direct products that can be connected to a wide variety of drones that are on the market. And we also have a vector into that market through our OEM channel, so there are people that are integrating both our [indiscernible] cameras and our Lepton cameras directly into those drones and there are some that are actually under development right now that will get launch in the next quarter or 2. So overall, it's a market server excited about. We think it presents quite a large opportunity, and it's one that is very, very thinly penetrated. I will remind you though that the concept of putting thermal cameras on drones is something that we've been involved in for quite some time. I think today's unquestionably, we are the world's leading supplier of uncooled cameras that are flying on drones through our partnership with where do us been using our calmer tailored for many years know, primarily in the military space.

The strategy here in terms of creating IGM products, for example, is not only to provide thermal imaging into the hands of a much broader audience, and I would say a different type of demographic than we have historically been selling to in the plant predictive maintenance space that we're reaching to more to technician level and putting infrared at their fingertips sort of on a daily basis instead of a specialized tools. I firmly believe that those people are going to see the volume in the technology and some percentage of them are going to want to have higher fidelity, higher resolution, higher accuracy, but a distance capability, better reporting capability that will come from the mid-range products. We've also been extended product line in terms of going after specific vertical applications think firefighting, like gas imaging, like continuous monitoring, permanently installed systems, things like that. And again, there -- the introduction of a product using IGM shows people the power of thermal imaging, and they we choose to then pursue it with a specialized product that's been addressed a specific application the be much greater level of detail and accuracy."

With Todd and me today is our CFO; Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and SVP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison. I will start the review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. 
This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $405 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 10% over the third quarter of 2015 and Government product revenues grew 2%. Driving the year-over-year growth in commercial products where the newly acquired products from DVTEL and Armasight, strength in fire and PPM building products and increased Lepton core sales. On the government product side, increased deliveries of military thermal camera cores, land-based imaging systems and Man Portable systems were partially offset by slower activity from our airborne gimbal products. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.43, which were negatively affected by a $2 million charge we took in the quarter for the expected cost to remedy product quality issues that were identified with certain of our SkyWatch surveillance towers that are in the field. Excluding this charge to cost of goods, earnings were $0.44 per share. This represents 10% growth in EPS versus the third quarter of 2015 when you adjust out the discrete tax benefit we saw last year of $0.12 per diluted share. 
Growth and operating profit margin from the third quarter improved significantly on a sequential basis, up 170 and 380 basis points, respectively, compared to Q2 of 2016. Stronger product mix and better absorption of overhead cost helped increase gross margin, while lower OpEx spending drove further improvement in our operating margin. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $89 million, our highest quarterly cash flow from operations since 2013. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow has grown 9% over the first 9 months of 2015, the result of our focus on improving our accounts receivable collection and controlling inventory levels. 
Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 13% year-over-year to $644 million, our highest since 2008 and our fifth straight quarter where we've shown sequential growth in backlog. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 16% over the balance at the end of Q3 2015. 
On the new product front, the Instruments segment launched a new and improved A35 and A65 thermal temperature sensors for continuous monitoring and automation systems. The Security segment released the newest version of Latitude enterprise-class VMS software. And our OEM and Emerging segments traffic business introduced the RSX-F thermal sensor for passenger train and railcar applications. And just a couple of weeks ago, the Detection segment introduced the new R100 personal radiation detector. 
On October 3, we announced our agreement to acquire Point Grey Research. You'll see on Slide 4 a summary of the transaction and the business. Point Grey, which is based in Vancouver, BC, is a global leader in developing and selling machine vision cameras. These are advanced visible imaging cameras and solutions used in industrial automation systems, people counting systems, medical diagnostic equipment, intelligent traffic systems, military and the defense products and advanced mapping systems. We are enthusiastic about the potential of this transaction as we feel machine vision and retail people counting are very attractive end markets and are 2 largely underpenetrated application spaces for thermal imaging. Point Grey will provide us a scalable platform, from which to grow the business and integrate our thermal technology. 
Thermal imaging provides a differentiated data set for a wide range of machine vision applications to include the ability to remotely measure temperature, accurately analyze thermal patterns and see-through factory obscurants including smoke, dust and steam. Common applications include monitoring welding, drying, sealing, molding, curing and extruding processes as well as a range of food processing and nondestructive testing applications. Additionally, thermal technology can improve people counting solutions giving us ability to accurately detect, track and quantify living beings in a wide range of environmental conditions. 
Point Grey's product and the selling strategy is very similar to our OEM camera core's business and that itself camera modules on a B2B basis to makers of imaging and automation systems and as such, the business is expected to be a very strategic fit for our OEM and emerging segment. We look forward to bringing the Point Grey team aboard and getting started on innovating the next generation of machine vision solutions. 
We expect to close the transaction during the fourth quarter and the acquisition price of approximately $253 million will be funded by our current foreign cash balances. While we're not discussing the financials of Point Grey specifically, we do expect transaction-related costs to negatively impact FLIR's fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.01 per share. However, we expect the acquisition to be accretive in 2017 and thereafter. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.60 billion and $1.65 billion and an EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, excluding the SkyWatch cost, the impact of the potential acquisition of Point Grey, the Q2 investment write-down and certain discrete tax items. This outlook represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results after adjusting for to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on December 2 to shareholders of record as of November 18.

Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia by 6%, 9%, 12% and 11%, respectively, while a decline in Canada, LatAm by 19%. 
Sales in the U.S. Government increased $33 million or 42% and represented 28% of total revenue compared to 21% in the third quarter of 2015. In this quarter, we recorded a charge of $2 million with certain expected costs to remediate previously disclosed product quality issues associated with our SkyWatch surveillance towers. We have not yet completed our analysis of all affected units that might require such remediation. As we gather more information and finalize our assessment, this charge will likely increase. 
Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 47%, 10 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the charge for SkyWatch repairs partially offset by favorable segment mix.
Gross margin improved a 170 basis points sequentially compared to second quarter, primarily driven by improvements in the Surveillance and Instruments segment. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 20%, 6 basis points better than last year despite the $2 million SkyWatch repair charge mentioned earlier. 
Our third quarter tax expense was $16.6 million. We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 24%, excluding certain discrete tax items. 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $58.6 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share. Third quarter 2015 net income of $73.1 million was aided by $17.4 million favorable discrete tax items related to the release of a previously reported tax reserve. Excluding the impact of the SkyWatch repair charge, adjusted EPS for third quarter of 2016 was $0.44 compared to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2015, a 10% year-over-year improvement. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter increased 20% from year ago levels to $88.6 million or 151% of net income, driven by continued improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. 
Our days sales outstanding and days inventory on hand improved year-over-year driving an improved cash converting cycle. 
Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.8 million significantly reduced from the higher levels a year ago when we were in the midst of consolidating our manufacturing facilities in Santa Barbara. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $36.3 million and returned another $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We repaid the entire $250 million principal amount of maturing notes in early July. With this repayment, and the second quarter issuance of the $425 million, 5-year notes and the upsizing of our credit facility to $500 million, we have completed the implementation of our previously communicated capital strategy. 
We've increased our gross leverage ratio from 1 turn to about 1.4 turns while maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment grade rating. We've also increased our liquidity, lowered our rated average cost of capital, lowered our interest rate and increased our borrowing flexibility. 
We closed the second quarter with cash of $677.7 million. We intend to use our foreign cash balances to fund the potential acquisition of Point Grey in the fourth quarter. This concludes the summary of third quarter financial results. 
Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

All segments, except Securities, showed higher revenues than the prior year. Segment level operating profit was up 8% as a result of the top line growing 6%, a steady gross margin and improved operating leverage. 
Moving to Slide 8 to cover the Surveillance segment third quarter revenue was -- for Surveillance, was $136.4 million, up 4% over the third quarter 2015. Increased revenues from land and Man-Portable products as well as from the new Outdoor and Tactical Systems line of business, each contributed to the growth, while our gimbal products show decline on a difficult comparable to the prior year that included significant rate and met the right[ph]  Program shipments. Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $38.4 million, which was down slightly from the prior year. However, if the SkyWatch cost are excluded from the results, then Surveillance's operating profit would have grown slightly. Compared to the second quarter this year, Surveillance operating margins improved 520 basis points as product mix returned to normal levels. Surveillance backlog increased to $22 million from the end of Q2 to $363 million and is up 16% from 1 year ago. 
Strong follow-on orders from U.S. and Middle East programs helped drive the growth in backlog. 
Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 in the quarter, which was the fifth time in the last 6 quarters that book-to-bill has been above 1.0. 
On Slide 9, you'll see a summary of the Instruments segment results. Revenue increased 11% as compared to the third quarter of 2015 to $82.7 million. The success of our new T1K premium handheld camera helped our planned predictive maintenance and building product line grow over 20% year-over-year. Instruments firefighting line of product continues to gain traction in the market growing revenue 77% [ph] over the prior year. 
Additionally, FLIR branded test and measurement products grew 60% over the prior year. Many of the FLIR Test & Measurement products now feature our infrared-guided measurement, or IGM technology, that is uniquely enabled by our Lepton camera core. 
Instruments operating profit in the third quarter grew 25% over the prior year to $27 million or 33% of revenue. Gross margins were equal to last year, and SGA expenses declined slightly to improve operating margins. On a sequential-quarter basis, operating margin improved by over 8 percentage points as a result of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost-containment initiatives. 
During the third quarter, Instruments introduced upgraded versions of the A35 and A65 thermal imaging temperature sensors. The new sensors, which are used for advanced process control, quality assurance, condition monitoring and fire prevention feature our more robust housing, higher vibration tolerance, new field of view options and extended temperature ranges. The sensors feature leading digital communications standards, including GigE vision compatibility and GenICam protocols for seamless integration with existing customer systems. 
On Slide 10, you will see the Securities segment results. Securities third quarter revenue of $56.4 million was down 5% compared to last year's third quarter. Reduced shipments of consumer grade Lorex security bundles created a significant headwind to segment performance. Partially offsetting this, retail softness was higher enterprise-class product revenue and 13% growth in thermal security cameras. 
Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, well below the prior year. While, gross margins were slightly better than last year, increased operating expenses and amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability. 
During the third quarter, we reduced Securities segment operating expense by 8%, and we continue to work to find cost improvement opportunities in the Securities segment. 
In September, the Security segment released the latest version of the enterprise-class Latitude Video Management System. This latest release adds communication protocols with all FLIR thermal security cameras and recorders support for pan/tilt zoom tracking and cell-based motion detection support of FLIR's Quasar cameras. This Latitude software solution enables our customers to be able to integrate large sites of up to 10,000 cameras and to control and monitor all of them with one user-friendly software interface. 
The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM and Emerging third quarter revenue was $62.7 million, increasing 22% over the prior year. Growth was seen in nearly every product line with particularly strong results from military grade thermal camera cores. Lepton cores also should significant strength with delivery to OEM customers for products such as the Cat phone. And the FLIR ONE mobile accessory continues to perform well with revenue growing 131% compared to the prior year. OEM and Emerging operating profit also reached an all-time high for the quarter, increasing 40% over the prior year to $19.9 million. 
During the third quarter, OEM and Emerging's intelligent traffic system line of business introduced the RSX-F sensor for railcar monitoring. This new product integrates a thermal and visible camera to provide passenger and cargo train operators, the ability to pre-emergently detect fires with advanced software algorithms running on the thermal datastream as well as enable the monitoring of railcar activity. 
Also during the quarter, one of our OEM customer Snap-on tools introduced a Lepton-based handheld thermal imager that is specifically designed for automotive diagnostics and utilizes advanced software to help mechanics and technicians easily detect engine, HVAC and electrical issues in the car. 
As Andy mentioned, we recently announced that we have agreed to acquire Point Grey Research. Once completed, the acquired business will become the Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business within our OEM and Emerging segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenues were $40.6 million, representing 4% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of thermal cameras drove the revenue growth. Maritime operating income was $2.4 million in the quarter, representing a 6% operating margin in the segment's seasonally low quarter. Operating income grew 29% over the prior year as lower operating expenses helped operating leverage. 
The Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 13. Detection's third quarter revenue was up 2% year-over-year to $26.4 million as DRSKO shipments were up slightly over the prior year, offset by year-over-year decline in explosives product revenue. During the quarter, Detection booked it's largest ever order for a radiation product, a $9 million order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for our R300 personal radiation detector. Consistent gross margins combined with reduced operating expenses resulted in a 26% growth in operating income year-over-year. 
Detection finished the third quarter with $68 million of backlog, declining $6 million since Q2 due primarily to shipments under previously received large DRSKO orders. 
Two weeks ago, Detection introduced the R100 personal radiation detector. The R100 is a new entry-level price point for Detections radiation product line. And is the industry's only IP67-certified and American National Standards Institute drop test compliant personal radiation detector. It is a Belt-worn detector for used by first responders, law-enforcement, military and security personnel and features an integrated Bluetooth radio for sending reports wirelessly to Central command. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's third quarter. I'll pass the call back over to Andy."

In terms of a long-term outlook, there are a couple of things to consider. I would say, that from an international perspective, we can expect to see continued demand there as there's continued political unrest internationally and our systems are very well received for ISR applications and border control applications. From the U.S. perspective, there's still a question mark about what happens relative to the continuing resolution that is set to expire on December 9 of this year. So that's a bit harder for us to predict in terms of what the budget situation is going to look like. We're hopeful that Congress can seek a successful budget resolution and get that situation resolved for us and for the nation. We are also, as we've mentioned on previous calls, our business is more of the short cycle oriented business, which makes it a bit more difficult for us to forecast.

It's a combination of things, Pete. One of the things that we talked about previously is that we have spent quite a bit of time focusing on the low end product offering in the Instruments segment and creating the IGM product line, also creating some other Lepton-based products since the lower spectrum of the Instruments product range. Those products are catching on and doing quite well now. So we felt very strong growth in the FLIR brand of Test & Measurement product line, most of those products are IGM Lepton-based products.
The second thing we talked about was that we moved from the low end all the way to the high end of our product range, and we refreshed that with the product we call the T1K. So that's in production and shipping nicely during the quarter, and we saw a very good uptick there in our PPM and Building business and that was largely driven by traction that we saw with that T1K product. We've been messaging for the last few quarter's that we've been working on the midrange of our product value ladder. It's a fairly long-term development and is scheduled to launch in early 2017 and that certainly will help to drive growth on that segment. The one other thing that we've done in that segment is we also are selling FLIR ONE through the Instruments industrial channels and that's separate channel relative to our retail pursuits with that product, and that's been helping to get traction as well. The combination of both the FLIR ONE and the IGM products are, I think, very helpful in the market as they not only introduced the FLIR brand but they fundamentally create new demographers in the market, which we hope over time would be looking to move up the value ladder with higher capability instruments that we call inside with the launch of the new mid-range products."

The customer over there -- that's the manufacturer of the phone has actually come back, and reordered a subsequent order ahead of their initial forecast for the year. So the demands are exceeding their expectations. They are also extending their channels for the distribution of the product.
So I think frankly, it is actually still early days to really understand what the total traction is going to be for the phone. We've also seen the introduction of that phone generate interest with other rugged handset and tablet manufacturers. So we're fairly optimistic that we should be able to see other platforms adopt the technology."

It's a very competitive space, but it's a very large space with a lot of opportunity. So we're going to be in an investment phase for at least the next 12 months in that business. And we expect over time though as the thermal products get traction and take on a larger portion of the total unit sales in that space that the margin will move up into the double-digit range. 
The traction for thermal products in the security space continues to be quite good, and the margins both gross and operating there are quite good. It's just that the visible piece of that business is very competitive space. The total demand in China has been declining and as a result of that, it's forced many of the large Chinese suppliers to look elsewhere for business and that comes more into the spaces that we compete in."

We're quite judicious in making those cuts, particularly after you do an acquisition, I think there are opportunities to set the business up to run more efficiently, and that's fundamentally what we've done. I would say that FLIR has a pretty long and demonstrated history of managing operating expenses to a prescribed model for business segment. And fundamentally, that's what we've done here. We have a specific model that prescribes how much money we spend on R&D and selling, marketing and G&A. In this particular case, we've looked at this business and what it's likely revenue projections are and brought those expenses in line with that model.
Again, in terms of the long-term predictability of the business, I think we've got a pretty good track record of managing expenses to the top line of our individual segments, and we're comfortable at this point that the expenses have been rightsized in this business and particularly looking at the product pipeline that we've got in place right now, we are much more confident that we can deliver the results in the coming quarters."

We talked about it a little bit during the last call as well. At the end of the day, there are an awful lot of applications for thermal cameras where the application is better served as the camera is in the air. And a drone, of course, is an ideal platform to make that happen. Our partnership with DJI has been going quite well. So that's one of the vectors that we have to the market. So we're doing customized products for DJI and the first of which was those on the market right now, it is the Zenmuse XT, and that's been selling quite well. We also have our own line of products, the FLIR Vue and Vue Pro and Vue Pro R products are direct products that can be connected to a wide variety of drones that are on the market.
And we also have a vector into that market through our OEM channel, so there are people that are integrating both our Tau cameras and our Lepton cameras directly into those drones and there are some that are actually under development right now that will get launched in the next quarter or 2. So overall, it's a market that we are very excited about. We think it presents quite a large opportunity, and it's one that is very, very thinly penetrated. I will remind you though that the concept of putting thermal cameras on drones is something that we've been involved in for quite some time. I think today, unquestionably, we are the world's leading supplier of uncooled cameras that are flying on drones through our partnership with AeroVironment who has been using our camera payloads for many years now, primarily in the military space. But we do see a consumer and industrial applications sets a very nice opportunity going forward."

There's also continues to be an opportunity for thermal in that market and that the primary application of these products is to alert people when their activities going on in the camera field of view, and it's very difficult to do that reliably using only a visible sensor as the input source.
And we know from our experiences in this business that thermal provides a much more accurate and valid data stream, and it really ties to the acquisition of Point Grey where Point Grey has the business, in the people counting space, primarily oriented at retail analytics, where we believe that we can utilize technology and processing capabilities that Point Grey has developed, augment that with thermal and create solutions for specific verticals within the consumer security market that we feel will be differentiated and defensible."

With that said, I do want to underscore what Tom said. The strategy here in terms of creating IGM products, for example, is not only to provide thermal imaging into the hands of a much broader audience, and I would say a different type of demographic than we have historically been selling to in the plant predictive maintenance space that we're reaching to more to a technician level and putting infrared at their fingertips, sort of, on a daily basis instead of as a specialized tools. I firmly believe that those people are going to see the value in the technology and some percentage of them are going to want to have higher fidelity, higher resolution, higher accuracy, better distance capability, better reporting capability that will come from the mid-range products. We've also been extended product line in terms of going after specific vertical applications like firefighting, like gas imaging, like continuous monitoring, permanently installed systems, things like that. And again, there -- the introduction of a product using IGM shows people the power of thermal imaging, and they we choose to then pursue it with a specialized product that addresses that specific application with a much greater level of detail and accuracy."

With Todd and me today is our CFO; Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and SVP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison. I will start the review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. 
This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $405 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 10% over the third quarter of 2015 and Government product revenues grew 2%. Driving the year-over-year growth in commercial products were the newly acquired products from DVTEL and Armasight, strength in fire and PPM building products and increased Lepton core sales. 
On the government product side, increased deliveries of military thermal camera cores, land-based imaging systems and Man Portable systems were partially offset by slower activity from our airborne gimbal products. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.43, which were negatively affected by a $2 million charge we took in the quarter for the expected cost to remedy product quality issues that were identified with certain of our SkyWatch surveillance towers that are in the field. Excluding this charge to cost of goods, earnings were $0.44 per share. This represents 10% growth in EPS versus the third quarter of 2015, when you adjust out the discrete tax benefit we saw last year of $0.12 per diluted share. 
Growth and operating profit margins in the third quarter improved significantly on a sequential basis, up 170 and 380 basis points, respectively, compared to Q2 of 2016. Stronger product mix and better absorption of overhead cost helped increase gross margin, while lower OpEx spending drove further improvement in our operating margin. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $89 million, our highest quarterly cash flow from operations since 2013. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow has grown 9% over the first 9 months of 2015, the result of our focus on improving our accounts receivable collection and controlling inventory levels. 
Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 13% year-over-year to $644 million, our highest since 2008 and our fifth straight quarter where we've shown sequential growth in backlog. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 16% over the balance at the end of Q3 2015. 
On the new product front, the Instruments segment launched a new and improved A35 and A65 thermal temperature sensors for continuous monitoring and automation systems. The Security segment released the newest version of Latitude enterprise-class VMS software. And our OEM & Emerging segments traffic business introduced the RSX-F thermal sensor for passenger train and railcar applications. And just a couple of weeks ago, the Detection segment introduced the new R100 personal radiation detector. 
On October 3, we announced our agreement to acquire Point Grey Research. You'll see on Slide 4 a summary of the transaction and the business. Point Grey, which is based in Vancouver, BC, is a global leader in developing and selling machine vision cameras. These are advanced visible imaging cameras and solutions used in industrial automation systems, people counting systems, medical diagnostic equipment, intelligent traffic systems, military and the defense products and advanced mapping systems. We are enthusiastic about the potential of this transaction as we feel machine vision and retail people counting are very attractive end markets and are 2 largely underpenetrated application spaces for thermal imaging. Point Grey will provide us a scalable platform, from which to grow the business and integrate our thermal technology. 
Thermal imaging provides a differentiated data set for a wide range of machine vision applications to include the ability to remotely measure temperature, accurately analyze thermal patterns and see-through factory obscurants including smoke, dust and steam. Common applications include monitoring welding, drying, sealing, molding, curing and extruding processes as well as a range of food processing and nondestructive testing applications. Additionally, thermal technology can improve people counting solutions giving us ability to accurately detect, track and quantify living beings in a wide range of environmental conditions. 
Point Grey's product and the selling strategy is very similar to our OEM camera core's business, in that itself camera modules on a B2B basis to makers of imaging and automation systems and as such, the business is expected to be a very strategic fit for our OEM & Emerging segment. We look forward to bringing the Point Grey team aboard and getting started on innovating the next generation of machine vision solutions. 
We expect to close the transaction during the fourth quarter and the acquisition price of approximately $253 million will be funded by our current foreign cash balances. While we're not discussing the financials of Point Grey specifically, we do expect transaction-related costs to negatively impact FLIR's fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.01 per share. However, we expect the acquisition to be accretive in 2017 and thereafter. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.60 billion and $1.65 billion and an EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, excluding the SkyWatch cost, the impact of the potential acquisition of Point Grey, the Q2 investment write-down and certain discrete tax items. This outlook represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on December 2 to shareholders of record as of November 18. 
I'll now ask Amit to review the third quarter financial results. Amit?"

On Slide 6, you'll see our third quarter financial results. Consolidated revenue was $405 million, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. The largest drivers of revenue growth came from the OEM & Emerging and Instruments segmen",593,"Thanks, Andy. On Slide 6, you'll see our third quarter financial results. Consolidated revenue was $405 million, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. The largest drivers of revenue growth came from the OEM & Emerging and Instruments segment, increasing 22% and 11%, respectively. Security segment revenue declined by 5%. 
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia by 6%, 9%, 12% and 11%, respectively, while it declined in Canada, LatAm by 19%. 
Sales to the U.S. Government increased $33 million or 42% and represented 28% of total revenue compared to 21% in the third quarter of 2015. In this quarter, we recorded a charge of $2 million with certain expected costs to remediate previously disclosed product quality issues associated with our SkyWatch surveillance towers. We have not yet completed our analysis of all affected units that might require such remediation. As we gather more information and finalize our assessment, this charge will likely increase. 
Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 47%, 10 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the charge for SkyWatch repairs partially offset by favorable segment mix.
Gross margin improved a 170 basis points sequentially compared to second quarter, primarily driven by improvements in the Surveillance and Instruments segment. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 20%, 6 basis points better than last year despite the $2 million SkyWatch repair charge mentioned earlier. 
Our third quarter tax expense was $16.6 million. We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 24%, excluding certain discrete tax items. 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $58.6 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share. Third quarter 2015 net income of $73.1 million was aided by $17.4 million favorable discrete tax items related to the release of a previously recorded tax reserve. Excluding the impact of the SkyWatch repair charge, adjusted EPS for third quarter of 2016 was $0.44 compared to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2015, a 10% year-over-year improvement. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter increased 20% from year ago levels to $88.6 million or 151% of net income, driven by continued improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. 
Our days sales outstanding and days inventory on hand improved year-over-year driving an improved cash converting cycle. 
Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.8 million significantly reduced from the higher levels a year ago when we were in the midst of consolidating our manufacturing facilities in Santa Barbara. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $36.3 million and returned another $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We repaid the entire $250 million principal amount of maturing notes in early July. With this repayment, and the second quarter issuance of the $425 million, 5-year notes and the upsizing of our credit facility to $500 million, we have completed the implementation of our previously communicated capital strategy. 
We've increased our gross leverage ratio from 1 turn to about 1.4 turns while maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment grade rating. We've also increased our liquidity, lowered our weighted average cost of capital, lowered our interest rate and increased our borrowing flexibility. 
We closed the second quarter with cash of $677.7 million. We intend to use our foreign cash balances to fund the potential acquisition of Point Grey in the fourth quarter. This concludes the summary of our third quarter financial results. 
Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

Slide 7 is a summary of the third quarter results by segment. All segments, except Security, showed higher revenues than the prior year. Segment level operating profit was up 8% as a result of the top line growing 6%, a steady gross margi",1177,"Thank you, Amit. Slide 7 is a summary of the third quarter results by segment. All segments, except Security, showed higher revenues than the prior year. Segment level operating profit was up 8% as a result of the top line growing 6%, a steady gross margin and improved operating leverage. 
Moving to Slide 8 to cover the Surveillance segment third quarter revenue was -- for Surveillance, was $136.4 million, up 4% over the third quarter 2015. Increased revenues from land and Man-Portable products as well as from the new Outdoor and Tactical Systems line of business, each contributed to the growth, while our gimbal products showed decline on a difficult comparable to the prior year that included significant RAID and MEDEVAC Program shipments. 
Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $38.4 million, which was down slightly from the prior year. However, if the SkyWatch cost are excluded from the results, then Surveillance's operating profit would have grown slightly. Compared to the second quarter of this year, Surveillance operating margins improved 520 basis points as product mix returned to normal levels. 
Surveillance backlog increased to $22 million from the end of Q2 to $363 million and is up 16% from 1 year ago. Strong follow-on orders from U.S. and Middle East programs helped drive the growth in backlog. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 in the quarter, which was the fifth time in the last 6 quarters that book-to-bill has been above 1.0. 
On Slide 9, you will see a summary of the Instruments segment results. Revenue increased 11% as compared to the third quarter of 2015 to $82.7 million. The success of our new T1K premium handheld camera helped our planned predictive maintenance and building product line grow over 20% year-over-year. Instruments firefighting line of product continues to gain traction in the market growing revenue 77% over the prior year. 
Additionally, FLIR branded Test & Measurement products grew 60% over the prior year. Many of the FLIR Test & Measurement products now feature our infrared-guided measurement, or IGM technology, that is uniquely enabled by our Lepton camera core. 
Instruments operating profit in the third quarter grew 25% over the prior year to $27 million or 33% of revenue. Gross margins were equal to last year, and SGA expenses declined slightly to improve operating margins. On a sequential-quarter basis, operating margin improved by over 8 percentage points as a result of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost-containment initiatives. 
During the third quarter, Instruments introduced upgraded versions of the A35 and A65 thermal imaging temperature sensors. The new sensors, which are used for advanced process control, quality assurance, condition monitoring and fire prevention feature our more robust housing, higher vibration tolerance, new field of view options and extended temperature ranges. The sensors feature leading digital communications standards, including GigE vision compatibility and GenICam protocols for seamless integration with existing customer systems. 
On Slide 10, you will see the Security segment results. Security's third quarter revenue of $56.4 million was down 5% compared to last year's third quarter. Reduced shipments of consumer grade Lorex security bundles created a significant headwind to segment performance. Partially offsetting this, retail softness was higher enterprise-class product revenue and 13% growth in thermal security cameras. 
Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, well below the prior year. While, gross margins were slightly better than last year, increased operating expenses and amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability. 
During the third quarter, we reduced Security segment operating expense by 8%, and we continue to work to find cost improvement opportunities in the Securities segment. 
In September, the Security segment released the latest version of the enterprise-class Latitude Video Management System. This latest release adds communication protocols with all FLIR thermal security cameras and recorders support for pan/tilt zoom tracking and cell-based motion detection support of FLIR's Quasar cameras. This Latitude software solution enables our customers to be able to integrate large sites of up to 10,000 cameras and to control and monitor all of them with one user-friendly software interface. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM & Emerging third quarter revenue was $62.7 million, increasing 22% over the prior year. Growth was seen in nearly every product line with particularly strong results from military grade thermal camera cores. Lepton cores also showed significant strength with delivery to OEM customers for products such as the Cat phone. And the FLIR ONE mobile accessory continues to perform well with revenue growing 131% compared to the prior year. OEM & Emerging operating profit also reached an all-time high for the quarter, increasing 40% over the prior year to $19.9 million. 
During the third quarter, OEM & Emerging's intelligent traffic system line of business introduced the RSX-F sensor for railcar monitoring. This new product integrates a thermal and visible camera to provide passenger and cargo train operators, the ability to pre-emergently detect fires with advanced software algorithms running on the thermal datastream as well as enable the monitoring of railcar activity. 
Also during the quarter, one of our OEM customer Snap-on tools introduced a Lepton-based handheld thermal imager that is specifically designed for automotive diagnostics and utilizes advanced software to help mechanics and technicians easily detect engine, HVAC and electrical issues in a car. 
As Andy mentioned, we recently announced that we have agreed to acquire Point Grey Research. Once completed, the acquired business will become the Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business within our OEM & Emerging segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenues were $40.6 million, representing 4% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of thermal cameras drove the revenue growth. Maritime operating income was $2.4 million in the quarter, representing a 6% operating margin in the segment's seasonally low quarter. Operating income grew 29% over the prior year as lower operating expenses helped operating leverage. 
The Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 13. Detection's third quarter revenue was up 2% year-over-year to $26.4 million as DRSKO shipments were up slightly over the prior year, offset by year-over-year decline in explosives product revenue. 
During the quarter, Detection booked its largest ever order for a radiation product, a $9 million order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for our R300 personal radiation detector. Consistent gross margins combined with reduced operating expenses resulted in a 26% growth in operating income year-over-year. 
Detection finished the third quarter with $68 million of backlog, declining $6 million since Q2 due primarily to shipments under previously received large DRSKO orders. 
Two weeks ago, Detection introduced the R100 personal radiation detector. The R100 is a new entry-level price point for our Detection's radiation product line. And is the industry's only IP67-certified and American National Standards Institute drop test compliant personal radiation detector. It is a Belt-worn detector for use by first responders, law-enforcement, military and security personnel and features an integrated Bluetooth radio for sending reports wirelessly to Central command. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's third quarter. I'll pass the call back over to Andy."

From a backlog standpoint, we've seen growth coming from our international customers. So in subsequent quarters, I think you'll see a higher concentration of international systems shipments. In terms of a long-term outlook, there are a couple of things to consider. I would say, that from an international perspective, we can expect to see continued demand there as there's continued political unrest internationally and our systems are very well received for ISR applications and border control applications. From the U.S. perspective, there's still a question mark about what happens relative to the continuing resolution that is set to expire on December 9 of this year. So that's a bit harder for us to predict in terms of what the budget situation is going to look like. We're hopeful that Congress can seek a successful budget resolution and get that situation resolved for us and for the nation. We're also -- as we've mentioned on previous calls, our business is more of the short cycle oriented business, which makes it a bit more difficult for us to forecast.

One of the things that we talked about previously is that we have spent quite a bit of time focusing on the low end product offering in the Instruments segment and creating the IGM product line, also creating some other Lepton-based products at the lower spectrum of the Instruments product range. Those products are catching on and doing quite well now. So we saw very strong growth in the FLIR branded Test & Measurement product line. Most of those products are IGM Lepton-based products.
The second thing we talked about was that we moved from the low end all the way to the high end of our product range, and we refreshed that with the product we call the T1K. So that's in production and shipping nicely during the quarter, and we saw a very good uptick there in our PPM and Building business and that was largely driven by traction that we saw with that T1K product. We've been messaging for the last few quarters that we've been working on the midrange of our product value ladder. It's a fairly long-term development and is scheduled to launch in early 2017 and that certainly will help to drive growth on that segment. The one other thing that we've done in that segment is we also are selling FLIR ONE through the Instruments industrial channels and that's separate channel relative to our retail pursuits with that product, and that's been helping to get traction as well. The combination of both the FLIR ONE and the IGM products are, I think, very helpful in the market as they not only introduced the FLIR brand but they fundamentally create new thermographers in the market, which we hope over time would be looking to move up the value ladder with higher capability instruments that we coincide with the launch of the new mid-range products."

So the revenue -- organic revenue growth for the company was a little over 2%, and then moving over to the Lepton-based question. Lepton has been doing quite well. Total growth in Lepton sensors that were shipped were up over 200%. And then we've got quite a broad range, I think we're approaching almost 20 products now internally that are using Lepton. And really quite a broad array of products externally that are using Lepton. Tom mentioned in his prepared comments that one of our OEM partners, Snap-on tools has launched a product that is specifically focused at automotive mechanics for automotive maintenance applications. We also launched a product last quarter with Scott fire and Safety and that's a firefighting product where the camera is embedded in the SCBA, breathing apparatus mask.
So there's been a number of applications out there that we've been serving with Lepton externally. And also we mentioned a couple on this call, we're quite excited about the products that have been launched in the traffic space, there actually had been 2 new products that we launched in the traffic space. One is for railcar monitoring and the other is a Lepton-based product that is designed to be used at crosswalks. So we think the opportunity set there is really quite large and our manufacturing base for Lepton has been ramping quite rapidly. And, of course, we've got a high volume of units that have been shipped and are going into the Cat phone as well. So we're quite pleased with a way that business is developing."

The customer there -- that's the manufacturer of the phone has actually come back, and reordered a subsequent order ahead of their initial forecast for the year. So the demands are exceeding their expectations. They're also expanding their channels for the distribution of the product.
So I think frankly, it's actually still early days to really understand what the total traction is going to be for the phone. We've also seen the introduction of that phone generate interest with other rugged handset and tablet manufacturers. So we're fairly optimistic that we should be able to see other platforms adopt the technology."

They're going to be single-digit margins for some time, as we develop the platform, integrate DVTEL and ultimately, inject low-cost thermal technology into those products. It's a very competitive space, but it's a very large space with a lot of opportunity. So we're going to be in an investment phase for at least the next 12 months in that business. And we expect over time though as the thermal products get traction and take on a larger portion of the total unit sales in that space that the margin will move up into the double-digit range. 
The traction for thermal products in the security space continues to be quite good, and the margins both gross and operating there are quite good. It's just that the visible piece of that business is very competitive space. The total demand in China has been declining and as a result of that, it's forced many of the large Chinese suppliers to look elsewhere for business and that comes more into the spaces that we compete in."

We're quite judicious in making those cuts, particularly after you do an acquisition, I think there are opportunities to set the business up to run more efficiently, and that's fundamentally what we've done. I would say that FLIR has a pretty long and demonstrated history of managing operating expenses through a prescribed model for business segment. And fundamentally, that's what we've done here. We have a specific model that prescribes how much money we spend on R&D and selling, marketing and G&A. In this particular case, we've looked at this business and what its likely revenue projections are and brought those expenses in line with that model.
Again, in terms of the long-term predictability of the business, I think we've got a pretty good track record of managing expenses to the top line of our individual segments, and we're comfortable at this point that the expenses have been rightsized in this business and particularly looking at the product pipeline that we've got in place right now, we are much more confident that we can deliver the results in the coming quarters."

We talked about it a little bit during the last call as well. At the end of the day, there are an awful lot of applications for thermal cameras where the application is better served as the camera's in the air. And a drone, of course, is an ideal platform to make that happen. Our partnership with DJI has been going quite well. So that's one of the vectors that we have to the market. So we're doing customized product for DJI and the first of which of those is on the market right now, it's the Zenmuse XT, and that's been selling quite well. We also have our own line of products, the FLIR Vue and Vue Pro and Vue Pro R products are direct products that can be connected to a wide variety of drones that are on the market.
And we also have a vector into that market through our OEM channels. So there are people that are integrating both our Tau cameras and our Lepton cameras directly into those drones and there are some that are actually under development right now that will get launched in the next quarter or 2. So overall, it's a market that we're very excited about. We think it presents quite a large opportunity, and it's one that is very, very thinly penetrated. I will remind you though that the concept of putting thermal cameras on drones is something that we've been involved in for quite some time. I think today, unquestionably, we are the world's leading supplier of uncooled cameras that are flying on drones through our partnership with AeroVironment who has been using our camera payloads for many years now, primarily in the military space. But we do see consumer and industrial applications as a very nice opportunity going forward."

There's also continues to be an opportunity for thermal in that market and that the primary application of these products is to alert people when there are activities going on in the camera field of view, and it's very difficult to do that reliably using only a visible sensor as the input source.
And we know from our experiences in this business that thermal provides a much more accurate and valid data stream. And it really ties to the acquisition of Point Grey where Point Grey has the business in the people counting space, primarily oriented at retail analytics, where we believe that we can utilize technology and processing capabilities that Point Grey has developed, augment that with thermal and create solution for specific verticals within the consumer security market that we feel will be differentiated and defensible."

With that said, I do want to underscore what Tom said. The strategy here in terms of creating IGM products, for example, is not only to provide thermal imaging into the hands of a much broader audience, and I would say a different type of demographic than we have historically been selling to in the plant predictive maintenance space that we're reaching to more to a technician level and putting infrared at their fingertips, sort of, on a daily basis instead of as a specialized tools. I firmly believe that those people are going to see the value in the technology and some percentage of them are going to want to have higher fidelity, higher resolution, higher accuracy, better distance capability, better recording capability that will come from the mid-range products. We've also been extended product line in terms of going after specific vertical applications like firefighting, like gas imaging, like continuous monitoring, permanently installed systems, things like that. And again, there -- the introduction of a product using IGM shows people the power of thermal imaging, and they may choose to then pursue it with a specialized product that addresses that specific application with a much greater level of detail and accuracy."

With Todd and me today is our CFO; Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and SVP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison. I will start the review of the quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. 
This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $405 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 10% over the third quarter of 2015 and Government product revenues grew 2%. Driving the year-over-year growth in commercial products were the newly acquired products from DVTEL and Armasight, strength in fire and PPM building products and increased Lepton core sales. 
On the government product side, increased deliveries of military thermal camera cores, land-based imaging systems and Man Portable systems were partially offset by slower activity from our airborne gimbal products. 
Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.43, which were negatively affected by a $2 million charge we took in the quarter for the expected cost to remedy product quality issues that were identified with certain of our SkyWatch surveillance towers that are in the field. Excluding this charge to cost of goods, earnings were $0.44 per share. This represents 10% growth in EPS versus the third quarter of 2015, when you adjust out the discrete tax benefit we saw last year of $0.12 per diluted share. 
Growth and operating profit margins in the third quarter improved significantly on a sequential basis, up 170 and 380 basis points, respectively, compared to Q2 of 2016. Stronger product mix and better absorption of overhead cost helped increase gross margin, while lower OpEx spending drove further improvement in our operating margin. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $89 million, our highest quarterly cash flow from operations since 2013. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow has grown 9% over the first 9 months of 2015, the result of our focus on improving our accounts receivable collection and controlling inventory levels. 
Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 13% year-over-year to $644 million, our highest since 2008 and our fifth straight quarter where we've shown sequential growth in backlog. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 16% over the balance at the end of Q3 2015. 
On the new product front, the Instruments segment launched a new and improved A35 and A65 thermal temperature sensors for continuous monitoring and automation systems. The Security segment released the newest version of Latitude enterprise-class VMS software. And our OEM & Emerging segments traffic business introduced the RSX-F thermal sensor for passenger train and railcar applications. And just a couple of weeks ago, the Detection segment introduced the new R100 personal radiation detector. 
On October 3, we announced our agreement to acquire Point Grey Research. You'll see on Slide 4 a summary of the transaction and the business. Point Grey, which is based in Vancouver, BC, is a global leader in developing and selling machine vision cameras. These are advanced visible imaging cameras and solutions used in industrial automation systems, people counting systems, medical diagnostic equipment, intelligent traffic systems, military and the defense products and advanced mapping systems. We are enthusiastic about the potential of this transaction as we feel machine vision and retail people counting are very attractive end markets and are 2 largely underpenetrated application spaces for thermal imaging. Point Grey will provide us a scalable platform, from which to grow the business and integrate our thermal technology. 
Thermal imaging provides a differentiated data set for a wide range of machine vision applications to include the ability to remotely measure temperature, accurately analyze thermal patterns and see-through factory obscurants including smoke, dust and steam. Common applications include monitoring welding, drying, sealing, molding, curing and extruding processes as well as a range of food processing and nondestructive testing applications. Additionally, thermal technology can improve people counting solutions giving us ability to accurately detect, track and quantify living beings in a wide range of environmental conditions. 
Point Grey's product and the selling strategy is very similar to our OEM camera core's business, in that itself camera modules on a B2B basis to makers of imaging and automation systems and as such, the business is expected to be a very strategic fit for our OEM & Emerging segment. We look forward to bringing the Point Grey team aboard and getting started on innovating the next generation of machine vision solutions. 
We expect to close the transaction during the fourth quarter and the acquisition price of approximately $253 million will be funded by our current foreign cash balances. While we're not discussing the financials of Point Grey specifically, we do expect transaction-related costs to negatively impact FLIR's fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.01 per share. However, we expect the acquisition to be accretive in 2017 and thereafter. 
On Slide 5, you'll see our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.60 billion and $1.65 billion and an EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, excluding the SkyWatch cost, the impact of the potential acquisition of Point Grey, the Q2 investment write-down and certain discrete tax items. This outlook represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on December 2 to shareholders of record as of November 18. 
I'll now ask Amit to review the third quarter financial results. Amit?"

On Slide 6, you'll see our third quarter financial results. Consolidated revenue was $405 million, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. The largest drivers of revenue growth came from the OEM & Emerging and Instruments segmen",593,"Thanks, Andy. On Slide 6, you'll see our third quarter financial results. Consolidated revenue was $405 million, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. The largest drivers of revenue growth came from the OEM & Emerging and Instruments segment, increasing 22% and 11%, respectively. Security segment revenue declined by 5%. 
Regionally, revenue increased in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia by 6%, 9%, 12% and 11%, respectively, while it declined in Canada, LatAm by 19%. 
Sales to the U.S. Government increased $33 million or 42% and represented 28% of total revenue compared to 21% in the third quarter of 2015. In this quarter, we recorded a charge of $2 million with certain expected costs to remediate previously disclosed product quality issues associated with our SkyWatch surveillance towers. We have not yet completed our analysis of all affected units that might require such remediation. As we gather more information and finalize our assessment, this charge will likely increase. 
Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 47%, 10 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the charge for SkyWatch repairs partially offset by favorable segment mix.
Gross margin improved a 170 basis points sequentially compared to second quarter, primarily driven by improvements in the Surveillance and Instruments segment. 
Our operating margin for the quarter was 20%, 6 basis points better than last year despite the $2 million SkyWatch repair charge mentioned earlier. 
Our third quarter tax expense was $16.6 million. We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 24%, excluding certain discrete tax items. 
Net earnings for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $58.6 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share. Third quarter 2015 net income of $73.1 million was aided by $17.4 million favorable discrete tax items related to the release of a previously recorded tax reserve. Excluding the impact of the SkyWatch repair charge, adjusted EPS for third quarter of 2016 was $0.44 compared to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2015, a 10% year-over-year improvement. 
Our cash flow from operations for the quarter increased 20% from year ago levels to $88.6 million or 151% of net income, driven by continued improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. 
Our days sales outstanding and days inventory on hand improved year-over-year driving an improved cash converting cycle. 
Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.8 million significantly reduced from the higher levels a year ago when we were in the midst of consolidating our manufacturing facilities in Santa Barbara. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $36.3 million and returned another $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We repaid the entire $250 million principal amount of maturing notes in early July. With this repayment, and the second quarter issuance of the $425 million, 5-year notes and the upsizing of our credit facility to $500 million, we have completed the implementation of our previously communicated capital strategy. 
We've increased our gross leverage ratio from 1 turn to about 1.4 turns while maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment grade rating. We've also increased our liquidity, lowered our weighted average cost of capital, lowered our interest rate and increased our borrowing flexibility. 
We closed the second quarter with cash of $677.7 million. We intend to use our foreign cash balances to fund the potential acquisition of Point Grey in the fourth quarter. This concludes the summary of our third quarter financial results. 
Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?"

Slide 7 is a summary of the third quarter results by segment. All segments, except Security, showed higher revenues than the prior year. Segment level operating profit was up 8% as a result of the top line growing 6%, a steady gross margi",1177,"Thank you, Amit. Slide 7 is a summary of the third quarter results by segment. All segments, except Security, showed higher revenues than the prior year. Segment level operating profit was up 8% as a result of the top line growing 6%, a steady gross margin and improved operating leverage. 
Moving to Slide 8 to cover the Surveillance segment third quarter revenue was -- for Surveillance, was $136.4 million, up 4% over the third quarter 2015. Increased revenues from land and Man-Portable products as well as from the new Outdoor and Tactical Systems line of business, each contributed to the growth, while our gimbal products showed decline on a difficult comparable to the prior year that included significant RAID and MEDEVAC Program shipments. 
Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $38.4 million, which was down slightly from the prior year. However, if the SkyWatch cost are excluded from the results, then Surveillance's operating profit would have grown slightly. Compared to the second quarter of this year, Surveillance operating margins improved 520 basis points as product mix returned to normal levels. 
Surveillance backlog increased to $22 million from the end of Q2 to $363 million and is up 16% from 1 year ago. Strong follow-on orders from U.S. and Middle East programs helped drive the growth in backlog. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 in the quarter, which was the fifth time in the last 6 quarters that book-to-bill has been above 1.0. 
On Slide 9, you will see a summary of the Instruments segment results. Revenue increased 11% as compared to the third quarter of 2015 to $82.7 million. The success of our new T1K premium handheld camera helped our planned predictive maintenance and building product line grow over 20% year-over-year. Instruments firefighting line of product continues to gain traction in the market growing revenue 77% over the prior year. 
Additionally, FLIR branded Test & Measurement products grew 60% over the prior year. Many of the FLIR Test & Measurement products now feature our infrared-guided measurement, or IGM technology, that is uniquely enabled by our Lepton camera core. 
Instruments operating profit in the third quarter grew 25% over the prior year to $27 million or 33% of revenue. Gross margins were equal to last year, and SGA expenses declined slightly to improve operating margins. On a sequential-quarter basis, operating margin improved by over 8 percentage points as a result of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost-containment initiatives. 
During the third quarter, Instruments introduced upgraded versions of the A35 and A65 thermal imaging temperature sensors. The new sensors, which are used for advanced process control, quality assurance, condition monitoring and fire prevention feature our more robust housing, higher vibration tolerance, new field of view options and extended temperature ranges. The sensors feature leading digital communications standards, including GigE vision compatibility and GenICam protocols for seamless integration with existing customer systems. 
On Slide 10, you will see the Security segment results. Security's third quarter revenue of $56.4 million was down 5% compared to last year's third quarter. Reduced shipments of consumer grade Lorex security bundles created a significant headwind to segment performance. Partially offsetting this, retail softness was higher enterprise-class product revenue and 13% growth in thermal security cameras. 
Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, well below the prior year. While, gross margins were slightly better than last year, increased operating expenses and amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability. 
During the third quarter, we reduced Security segment operating expense by 8%, and we continue to work to find cost improvement opportunities in the Securities segment. 
In September, the Security segment released the latest version of the enterprise-class Latitude Video Management System. This latest release adds communication protocols with all FLIR thermal security cameras and recorders support for pan/tilt zoom tracking and cell-based motion detection support of FLIR's Quasar cameras. This Latitude software solution enables our customers to be able to integrate large sites of up to 10,000 cameras and to control and monitor all of them with one user-friendly software interface. 
The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on Slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM & Emerging third quarter revenue was $62.7 million, increasing 22% over the prior year. Growth was seen in nearly every product line with particularly strong results from military grade thermal camera cores. Lepton cores also showed significant strength with delivery to OEM customers for products such as the Cat phone. And the FLIR ONE mobile accessory continues to perform well with revenue growing 131% compared to the prior year. OEM & Emerging operating profit also reached an all-time high for the quarter, increasing 40% over the prior year to $19.9 million. 
During the third quarter, OEM & Emerging's intelligent traffic system line of business introduced the RSX-F sensor for railcar monitoring. This new product integrates a thermal and visible camera to provide passenger and cargo train operators, the ability to pre-emergently detect fires with advanced software algorithms running on the thermal datastream as well as enable the monitoring of railcar activity. 
Also during the quarter, one of our OEM customer Snap-on tools introduced a Lepton-based handheld thermal imager that is specifically designed for automotive diagnostics and utilizes advanced software to help mechanics and technicians easily detect engine, HVAC and electrical issues in a car. 
As Andy mentioned, we recently announced that we have agreed to acquire Point Grey Research. Once completed, the acquired business will become the Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business within our OEM & Emerging segment. 
Turning to Slide 12. Maritime segment revenues were $40.6 million, representing 4% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of thermal cameras drove the revenue growth. Maritime operating income was $2.4 million in the quarter, representing a 6% operating margin in the segment's seasonally low quarter. Operating income grew 29% over the prior year as lower operating expenses helped operating leverage. 
The Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 13. Detection's third quarter revenue was up 2% year-over-year to $26.4 million as DRSKO shipments were up slightly over the prior year, offset by year-over-year decline in explosives product revenue. 
During the quarter, Detection booked its largest ever order for a radiation product, a $9 million order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for our R300 personal radiation detector. Consistent gross margins combined with reduced operating expenses resulted in a 26% growth in operating income year-over-year. 
Detection finished the third quarter with $68 million of backlog, declining $6 million since Q2 due primarily to shipments under previously received large DRSKO orders. 
Two weeks ago, Detection introduced the R100 personal radiation detector. The R100 is a new entry-level price point for our Detection's radiation product line. And is the industry's only IP67-certified and American National Standards Institute drop test compliant personal radiation detector. It is a Belt-worn detector for use by first responders, law-enforcement, military and security personnel and features an integrated Bluetooth radio for sending reports wirelessly to Central command. 
That concludes my summary of the segment's third quarter. I'll pass the call back over to Andy."

In terms of a long-term outlook, there are a couple of things to consider. I would say, that from an international perspective, we can expect to see continued demand there as there's continued political unrest internationally and our systems are very well received for ISR applications and border control applications. From the U.S. perspective, there's still a question mark about what happens relative to the continuing resolution that is set to expire on December 9 of this year. So that's a bit harder for us to predict in terms of what the budget situation is going to look like. We're hopeful that Congress can seek a successful budget resolution and get that situation resolved for us and for the nation.

It's a combination of things, Pete. One of the things that we talked about previously is that we have spent quite a bit of time focusing on the low end product offering in the Instruments segment and creating the IGM product line, also creating some other Lepton-based products at the lower spectrum of the Instruments product range. Those products are catching on and doing quite well now. So we saw very strong growth in the FLIR branded Test & Measurement product line. Most of those products are IGM Lepton-based products. The second thing we talked about was that we moved from the low end all the way to the high end of our product range, and we refreshed that with the product we call the T1K. So that's in production and shipping nicely during the quarter, and we saw a very good uptick there in our PPM and Building business and that was largely driven by traction that we saw with that T1K product. We've been messaging for the last few quarters that we've been working on the midrange of our product value ladder. It's a fairly long-term development and is scheduled to launch in early 2017 and that certainly will help to drive growth on that segment. The one other thing that we've done in that segment is we also are selling FLIR ONE through the Instruments industrial channels and that's separate channel relative to our retail pursuits with that product, and that's been helping to get traction as well. The combination of both the FLIR ONE and the IGM products are, I think, very helpful in the market as they not only introduced the FLIR brand but they fundamentally create new thermographers in the market, which we hope over time would be looking to move up the value ladder with higher capability instruments that we coincide with the launch of the new mid-range products."

Total growth in Lepton sensors that were shipped were up over 200%. And then we've got quite a broad range, I think we're approaching almost 20 products now internally that are using Lepton. And really quite a broad array of products externally that are using Lepton. Tom mentioned in his prepared comments that one of our OEM partners, Snap-on tools has launched a product that is specifically focused at automotive mechanics for automotive maintenance applications. We also launched a product last quarter with Scott fire and Safety and that's a firefighting product where the camera is embedded in the SCBA, breathing apparatus mask. So there's been a number of applications out there that we've been serving with Lepton externally. And also we mentioned a couple on this call, we're quite excited about the products that have been launched in the traffic space, there actually had been 2 new products that we launched in the traffic space. One is for railcar monitoring and the other is a Lepton-based product that is designed to be used at crosswalks. So we think the opportunity set there is really quite large and our manufacturing base for Lepton has been ramping quite rapidly. And of course, we've got a high volume of units that have been shipped and are going into the Cat phone as well. So we're quite pleased with a way that business is developing."

The customer there -- that's the manufacturer of the phone has actually come back, and reordered a subsequent order ahead of their initial forecast for the year. So the demands are exceeding their expectations. They're also expanding their channels for the distribution of the product. So I think frankly, it's actually still early days to really understand what the total traction is going to be for the phone. We've also seen the introduction of that phone generate interest with other rugged handset and tablet manufacturers.

They're going to be single-digit margins for some time, as we develop the platform, integrate DVTEL and ultimately, inject low-cost thermal technology into those products. It's a very competitive space, but it's a very large space with a lot of opportunity. So we're going to be in an investment phase for at least the next 12 months in that business. And we expect over time though as the thermal products get traction and take on a larger portion of the total unit sales in that space that the margin will move up into the double-digit range. The traction for thermal products in the security space continues to be quite good, and the margins both gross and operating there are quite good. It's just that the visible piece of that business is very competitive space. The total demand in China has been declining and as a result of that, it's forced many of the large Chinese suppliers to look elsewhere for business and that comes more into the spaces that we compete in."

We're quite judicious in making those cuts, particularly after you do an acquisition, I think there are opportunities to set the business up to run more efficiently, and that's fundamentally what we've done. I would say that FLIR has a pretty long and demonstrated history of managing operating expenses through a prescribed model for business segment. And fundamentally, that's what we've done here. We have a specific model that prescribes how much money we spend on R&D and selling, marketing and G&A. In this particular case, we've looked at this business and what its likely revenue projections are and brought those expenses in line with that model. Again, in terms of the long-term predictability of the business, I think we've got a pretty good track record of managing expenses to the top line of our individual segments, and we're comfortable at this point that the expenses have been rightsized in this business and particularly looking at the product pipeline that we've got in place right now, we are much more confident that we can deliver the results in the coming quarters."

We talked about it a little bit during the last call as well. At the end of the day, there are an awful lot of applications for thermal cameras where the application is better served as the camera's in the air. And a drone, of course, is an ideal platform to make that happen. Our partnership with DJI has been going quite well. So that's one of the vectors that we have to the market. So we're doing customized product for DJI and the first of which of those is on the market right now, it's the Zenmuse XT, and that's been selling quite well. We also have our own line of products, the FLIR Vue and Vue Pro and Vue Pro R products are direct products that can be connected to a wide variety of drones that are on the market. And we also have a vector into that market through our OEM channels. So there are people that are integrating both our Tau cameras and our Lepton cameras directly into those drones and there are some that are actually under development right now that will get launched in the next quarter or 2. So overall, it's a market that we're very excited about. We think it presents quite a large opportunity, and it's one that is very, very thinly penetrated. I will remind you though that the concept of putting thermal cameras on drones is something that we've been involved in for quite some time. I think today, unquestionably, we are the world's leading supplier of uncooled cameras that are flying on drones through our partnership with AeroVironment who has been using our camera payloads for many years now, primarily in the military space. But we do see consumer and industrial applications as a very nice opportunity going forward."

It's about maintaining the retail channels that we have in place, and creating products that are differentiated and easy to use. There's also continues to be an opportunity for thermal in that market and that the primary application of these products is to alert people when there are activities going on in the camera field of view, and it's very difficult to do that reliably using only a visible sensor as the input source. And we know from our experiences in this business that thermal provides a much more accurate and valid data stream. And it really ties to the acquisition of Point Grey where Point Grey has the business in the people counting space, primarily oriented at retail analytics, where we believe that we can utilize technology and processing capabilities that Point Grey has developed, augment that with thermal and create solution for specific verticals within the consumer security market that we feel will be differentiated and defensible."

With that said, I do want to underscore what Tom said. The strategy here in terms of creating IGM products, for example, is not only to provide thermal imaging into the hands of a much broader audience, and I would say a different type of demographic than we have historically been selling to in the plant predictive maintenance space that we're reaching to more to a technician level and putting infrared at their fingertips, sort of, on a daily basis instead of as a specialized tools. I firmly believe that those people are going to see the value in the technology and some percentage of them are going to want to have higher fidelity, higher resolution, higher accuracy, better distance capability, better recording capability that will come from the mid-range products. We've also been extended product line in terms of going after specific vertical applications like firefighting, like gas imaging, like continuous monitoring, permanently installed systems, things like that. And again, there -- the introduction of a product using IGM shows people the power of thermal imaging, and they may choose to then pursue it with a specialized product that addresses that specific application with a much greater level of detail and accuracy."
