Good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. 2015 was another successful and productive year for Regeneron. EYLEA delivered expressive global growth, and we received approval for and launch Praluent, which is indicated in the U.S. as an agent to diet and maximum tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical cardiovascular disease who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. We made significant advances in our late-stage pipeline, submitting a biological license application, or BLA, for sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis and advancing Phase III clinical development for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis and asthma. In 2015, we also advanced 2 new antibodies into Phase III. Regeneron 2222 for the prevention of SingTel virus or RSV infection and our anti-NGF body for osteoarthritis pain. 
We've also advanced our early-stage pipeline with progress across multiple therapeutic areas, including retinal diseases, cancer, infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases. 
Turning to EYLEA performance. EYLEA is now the market-leading brand in anti- VEGF therapy for retinal disease in the United States and continue to exhibit strong growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide. We saw approximately 54% growth year-over-year in the U.S., with sales of $2.68 billion. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA sales were approximately $4.1 billion for the full year. 
For the full year 2016, we estimate U.S. EYLEA net sales to grow approximately 20% over full year 2015 U.S. net sales. We are focused on maintaining our leadership in the retinal space. We are continuing clinical development with EYLEA where we have ongoing combination programs with PDGF and with Ang2 and are pursuing important additional indications for EYLEA that George will review later in the 
call. Turning out to Praluent. We're proud to first PCSK9 inhibitor to the market in the United States for patients with uncontrolled LDL cholesterol, which was approved and launch in July of last year. We are still in the early stages of this launch and have been working diligently to provide broad access to eligible patients and educated physicians and patients in order to increase adoption. Bob Terifay will provide some additional metrics on how the launch is progressing. Our mission at Regeneron for 25-plus years has been to consistently and repeatedly bring important new medicines to patients in need, and we feel that we are well-positioned to deliver on this mission with our innovative pipeline. Building on last year's approval of Praluent, we anticipate at least 1 approval each year for the coming years. In 2016, we anticipate the approval of sarilumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Our breakthrough product, dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, is progressing and expect to report top line Phase III data and submitted BLA in the U.S. during this year. Beyond dupilumab, we have a rapidly developing late- and early-stage pipeline that now consist of 13 product candidates that were all discovered by the scientists at Regeneron. And we expect to put additional candidates into the clinic this year. George will provide some perspective on this during his remarks. 
In summary, we are in the midst of a very exciting time with Regeneron with many important events anticipated in 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay, and then by Bob Landry."

As Len said, 2015 was a very successful and exciting year for R&D at Regeneron. I would like to begin with EYLEA. Diabetic retinopathy is the common cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes and as a result of microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina. When left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can progress sometimes acute vision loss. While EYLEA is a very medical retinopathy would diabetic macular edema, or DME, we believe that it could benefit much broader patient population diabetic retinopathy who do not have no proof anti-VEGF therapy. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year we plan to initiate, Phase III study of EYLEA in patients with non-diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. The National Institute of Health will also independently investigate the potential role of anti-VEGF therapy in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This study called, will be sponsored by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network or DRCR and will compare EYLEA Titian in phases with severe, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. 
Protocol W is expected to begin in the first quarter. A Phase II study of EYLEA in combination with our antibody delivered a powerful related injection macular degeneration, or Wet AMD, is ongoing, and we expect some top line data from the study by year-end. This program has been granted fast track designation by the FDA. Data from the Phase I study of EYLEA in combination with antibody, delivered co- formulated injection, which was presented just last week at the conference. This data show that the combination of EYLEA with and well tolerated with patients with AMD and patients with DMD. We plan to initiate Phase II studies that will include both this patient population in the first half of the year. 
As Len mentioned, our Praluent launch is underway, and you'll hear further details from Bob Terifay on the commercial front. Our 18,000-patient outcomes trial is ongoing, and we expect the first interim analysis, which will utility later this year based upon 50% of the expected events from the trial. Also, what a potential to have our second interim analysis, which occurs after 75% of the targeted primary event that have accrued by the end of this year. And this interim analysis overwhelming efficacy and fertility. As we previously disclosed, analysis with a hazard ratio of 0.802, favoring Praluent, as well as consistency across subgroups and regions, positive for secondary implants including all mortality and no cardiovascular mortality. These last points are all important as we do not want to unblind a trial early because its efficacy in the primary endpoint at the cost of not reaching significant and important secondary endpoints. 
In addition to the outcomes trial, we plan to submit a supplemental BLA in the first half of the year with the Praluent mostly dosing regiment. 
Turning now to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor for rheumatoid arthritis. The regulatory submissions accepted by the FDA and has been granted an action date of October 30, 2016. The Phase III MONARCH trial, which is a superiority study of sarilumab monotherapy versus alirocumab, which fully enrolled and we expect top line data from this study in the first half of 2016. A European regulatory submission for sarilumab is expected to be made in the second half of 2016. I share enthusiasm for dupilumab, our IL-4-13 pathway blocking antibody, which is currently in Phase III clinical studies in asthma and in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis where it's been granted breakthrough designation. We because there are no FDA approved systemic therapy for adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We expect  to report top line data from the Phase III atopic dermatitis study, solo 1, solo 2 and in the first half of this year, which will complete rolling DLS submission in the second half of the year. Approximately 1,700-patient pivotal Phase III study of dupilumab in asthma is also in order. We also continued to explore other indications for dupilumab, which is nasal polyps and the eosinophilic esophagitis as well as other allergic or IL-4-13 mediated diseases. 
Our Nerve Growth Factor antibody or NGF antibody, , is another late-stage pipeline candidate. Pain is one of the leading reasons that patients visit their doctors, and osteoarthritis is one of the major source of the pain in adults, particularly older adults. The increase in use of prescription to treat pains has led to a growing epidemic of drug addiction and overdose-related fatalities as well as other opioid-related side effects. 
Blocking NGF has already shown the ability to improve pain compared to placebo or active such as nonsterile anti-inflammatory drugs or in Phase II and Phase III trials. We now have a clear path forward from the FDA and will be starting with 10,000-patient long-term treatment Phase II clinical study of dupilumab in the first half of the year. We anticipate reporting data from the 16-week study in osteoarthritis pain in the first half of the year. In our early-stage pipeline, we plan to share data from our Phase I/II study of , our antibody to ANGPTL3 with from the first half as well as data from our ongoing immuno-oncology program such as our PD-1 program and the CD20 by CD3 by specific program. We have obviously been very busy in production. In fact, this year, we expect to submit a record number of IND, and we look forward to sharing more details with you as these programs move into the clinic. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

Fourth quarter 2015 was a productive one for Regeneron. We continue to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We also made substantial",813,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter 2015 was a productive one for Regeneron. We continue to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We also made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent or alirocumab, among U.S. payors. In addition, the European launch for Praluent commenced. 
Starting with EYLEA. Fourth quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the fourth quarter were $746 million. Full year, U.S. EYLEA sales were $2.68 billion, which represented 54% year-over-year growth. A survey of 201 U.S. retinal specialists, who evaluated their reported usage of VEGF inhibitors in the fourth quarter 2015, indicates that EYLEA continues to be the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents in all of our labeled indications. In terms of market share treated eyes. Importantly, the market share of treated eyes for EYLEA and DME is roughly double that for and similar to that to off-label 
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the fourth quarter were $7 million, which understates the actual position in patient demand. As we reminded you last quarter, we anticipate that it would take some time for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, as well as strict utilization management criteria, we continue to expect a gradual uptake. In response to potential delays and formulary reimbursement decisions, we're offering free product to appropriate patients consistent with our labeled indication. We are waiting an insurance coverage position. These delays uptake in commercial sales reporting. 
For example, much of Medicare part D are government pay patients are receiving pre-drug spending formulary coverage, which is expected later in the quarter. So performance cannot be solely judged on sales or filled prescriptions. As a reminder, the reimbursement environment is complex and is carefully managed by payers. Our goal has been to ensure the payers and health care providers understand the value that Praluent can offer the patients. And to that end, we have been and are still actively engaged in discussions with payers. There are approximately 240 million lives in the United States that have a drug benefit covered by commercial insurance or Medicare part D plans. Published decisions have already been made for approximately 90% of these lives. However, implementation is ongoing, and we expect continued rollout of the coverage over the next several months. Overall, for approximately 50% of the recovered lives, a single PCSK9 antibody has been chosen an exclusive of preferred physician. In this exclusive of preferred cases, we estimate that Praluent was chosen for about 60% of the lives. The preference for Praluent was particularly evident in the Medicare Part D decisions. In Medicare, 80% of the lives have a single PCSK9 antibody in an exclusive or preferred position. For these exclusive or preferred Medicare Part B lives, Praluent was selected approximately 95% of the time. We believe these Medicare coverage decisions are particularly important because a major indication for Praluent is for patients with history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and these patients tend to be older. According to our estimates, about 28% of statin patients in the United States are Medicare Part B patients. We're pleased to see that Praluent is resonating well with payers. As plans begin to activate the coverage, we anticipate a potential uptake in prescription volume. Importantly, almost 90% of all prescriptions processed by the hub are for our lower 75-milligram every-other-week dose. As a reminder, and our Phase III clinical studies, the vast majority of Praluent patients achieve their LDL-cholesterol goals with 75 milligrams every-other-week dose. We continue our efforts to educate both patients and physicians on the benefits of using PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September, with product available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. 
In the fourth quarter, we submitted a BLA for U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin 6 or IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries were made -- will be made over time. We also continue to pay for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor in 2017. We've recently informed Sanofi of our intent to co-promote dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions will be made at a later date. Next month, we will have a significant presence in the American College -- or American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology meeting in Los Angeles and the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in Washington, DC. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."

Overall, we are please with the full year performance Regeneron delivered in 2015. For the full year 2015, we earned $12.07 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion. This",1277,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are please with the full year performance Regeneron delivered in 2015. For the full year 2015, we earned $12.07 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion. This represents a year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS with net income of 21% and 19%, respectively, for the full year 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2015, non-GAAP net income per diluted share increased 1% to $2.83 versus fourth quarter of 2014 and non-GAAP net income of $327 million was unchanged versus fourth quarter of 2014. Regeneron's 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based opposition expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of convertible notes during 2015 and adjustment for income taxes. Non-GAAP income tax expense is based upon cash, income tax paid or payable for 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $1.1 billion and $4.1 billion for the full year 2015, which represented year-over-year growth of 37% for the 3 months and 46% for the full year. Net product sales were $750 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $2.69 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to $522 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1.75 billion for the full year of 2014. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $746 million in the fourth quarter and $2.68 billion in 2015, compared to $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1.74 billion for the full year of 2014, which represents an increase of 44% and 54%, respectively. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributary inventory levels as compared to the third quarter 2015. And overall, a slight decrease in comparison to the fourth quarter 2014 but remains within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range. As Len mentioned earlier, our U.S. EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full year 2016  over 2015 is approximately 20%. x U.S. EYLEA sales were $413 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $297 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, representing a 39% increase on a reported basis. x U.S. EYLEA sales for the full year of 2015 were $1.41 billion compared to $1.04 billion for 2014, representing a 36% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 54% for the 3 months and 58% for the full year 2015. Product revenues from x U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $140 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States and $467 million for the full year 2015. Total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter was $165 million and $580 million for the full year 2015. 
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $166 million for the fourth quarter and $759 million for the full year 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $96 million for the full year 2015 was $240 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. 
Netting with these losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our partner, Sanofi, of $7 million for the fourth quarter 2015 and $11 million for the full year of 2015. Recall that Praluent was launched in the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $389 million for the fourth quarter and $1.37 billion for the full year 2015. Our unreimbursed R&D expenses have collated as a total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D non-cash share based compensation expense was $214 million for the 3 months and $570 million for the full year 2015. We note that this comes in slightly above our 2015 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense guidance of $540 million to $560 million, primarily due to higher expenditures for our NGF programs. Our press release includes all the information required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expenses. For 2016, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $875 million to $950 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense is driven by 3 factors: advancing our pipeline outside of the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration, particularly our programs for NGF, RSV and CD20 by CD3; our obligation to pay for 20% of the Phase III clinical development expense following a first positive Phase III results of our partnered antibodies, primarily driven by the potential positive dupilumab Phase III read out in the first half of 2016; the advancement of our immuno-oncology pipeline in collaboration with Sanofi and proprietary R&D initiatives such as those in the area of human genomics. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $213 million for the fourth quarter and $646 million for the full year 2015. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in a range of $925 million and $1 billion. The increase in our SG&A expense is primarily driven by the ongoing Praluent launch, which is entering its first full year of lunch and prepare for the potential commercial launches of both sarilumab and dupilumab. As we've mentioned previously, in 2015, we began paying significant cash that is compared to prior periods. Cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for this quarter as well as for all of 2015 is based on an estimated cash tax paid or payable for the full year. This amount continues to be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a GAAP basis, cash tax is a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, was approximately 16% and 18%, respectively. 
For 2016, our guidance for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax income is 35% to 45%. This includes a onetime tax of approximately $222 million related to $600 million of our December 31, 2015, deferred revenue balance remaining from the immuno-oncology up from payment from Sanofi that we received in the third quarter of 2015. The cash tax impact in the immuno-oncology upfront payment would be spread equally throughout the year. Our capital expenditures for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, were $678 million. We expect our capital expenditures to be between $580 million and $680 million for 2016. These expenses continue -- these expenses continue to build on a manufacturing expansion made in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York; Ireland; as well as it exceeded expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. We ended the fourth quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.7 billion. As we have previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we paid $50 million to reduce these outstanding warrants. And in January 2016, we paid an additional $135 million to reduce more outstanding warrants. We intend to continue seeking opportunities to further reduce these outstanding warrants into 2016. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael."

So for those 3 launches, it's putting stress on our SG&A number. With regards to R&D, we've highlighted some drivers with regards to the increase and unreimbursed R&D. The biggest one probably the NGF program as you heard from Len and George earlier that program is full speed ahead with regards to entering Phase III very, very shortly We're also moving forward with RSD. Now these are both on partnered products. And then again, we get our first positive Phase III readout for dupilumab in the first half of 2016. And as you know and as we've said before, that's a driver with regards to us picking up 20% of the program cost associated with that. So that would not only include atopic dermatitis, that would also include the asthma indications associated with that. So all of these things associated are putting some stress in our expenses. And maybe Len may have a few additional comments."

And approval in 2015 for Praluent. 2016, we hope for sarilumab. 2017, the first approval for dupilumab. And beyond that, approval for dupilumab and asthma. Perhaps NGF coming up, RAC, progress and perhaps approval down the line there and immuno-oncology. So we have a very intensely compacted pipeline that we have to manage, both from a technical point of view, from an operational point of view, a manufacturing point of view, and of course, as Bob said, from a financial point of view."

They haven't been fully implemented in fact to roll out at Cisco to going over the next several months and even into the second quarter of this year. So coverage won't begin. We did particularly well in those cases where there was an exclusive or preferred decision made. We won that business over 60% of the time. And as Bob said in the Medicare business, where it's a large proportion of the statin use, a large proportion of our patients, we were able when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made and that was 80% of the time. And it was exclusive or preferred decision made, that went 95% of the lives went to Praluent. So we're very pleased that our product offering is resonating well and that people, I think, are getting our message. In terms of the patient types, as we mentioned, there's a very strict utilization management criteria in the category. So it is strictly within the label population, which is patients with heterozygous hypercholesterolemia and patients with a history of coronary disease.

Now whether or not the attitude doesn't matter how low you go and it's too complicated for doctors to be able to understand the use of low and high dose, I think that puts not quite enough faith in doctors and my colleagues in the medical profession. They get the difference. And I think this may be resonating well."

I mean, what Amgen is basically telling you, which is correct, which is that in previous studies, the amount of risk reduction you get is proportional to the absolute number of milligrams per deciliter that you lower LDL cholesterol. Now of course, in their Phase IIb/III studies, and I should say they're faced to none outcome studies as well as ours, were starting LDL cholesterol was higher. And so the overall LDL absolutely reduction was a lot. And therefore, the risk reduction was a lot. When you start out with more modest LDL, which we are both doing in our outcomes trial, you have less LDL lowering and on average, you should have less risk reduction that we think a every get robust results and will be able to look at various pet terms of peoples starting LDL and so on and so forth. So we're very confident in the LDL hypothesis. Remember, we're the first people to the LDL receptor, our Board of Directors. So we have been something we are very close to forever a long time. We believe LDL month and we believed outcomes trials and continue to support that."

2015 was another successful and productive year for Regeneron. EYLEA delivered impressive global growth. And we received approval for and launched Praluent, which is indicated in the U.S. as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. We made significant advances in our late-stage pipeline, submitting a biologic license application, or BLA, for sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis and advancing Phase III clinical development for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis and asthma. In 2015, we also advanced 2 new antibodies into Phase III. Regeneron 2222 for the prevention of  Respiratory Syncytial Virus or RSV infection infants and our anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritis pain. We also advanced our early-stage pipeline with progress across multiple therapeutic areas, including retinal diseases, cancer, infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases. 
Turning to EYLEA performance. EYLEA is now the market-leading brand in anti-VEGF therapy for retinal disease in the United States and continue to exhibit strong growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide. We saw approximately 54% growth year-over-year in the U.S., with sales of $2.68 billion. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA sales were approximately $4.1 billion for the full year. 
For the full year 2016, we estimate U.S. EYLEA net sales to grow approximately 20% over full year 2015 U.S. net sales. We are focused on maintaining our leadership in the retinal space. We are continuing clinical development with EYLEA where we have ongoing combination programs with PDGF and with ANG2 and are pursuing important additional indications for EYLEA that George will review later in the call.
Turning now to Praluent. We are proud to have brought the first PCSK9 inhibitor to the market in the United States for patients with uncontrolled LDL cholesterol, which was approved and launched in July of last year. We are still in the early stages of this launch and have been working diligently to provide broad access to eligible patients and educating physicians and patients in order to increase adoption. Bob Terifay will provide some additional metrics on how the launch is progressing. 
Our mission at Regeneron for 25 plus years has been to consistently and repeatedly bring important new medicines to patients in need. And we feel that we are well-positioned to deliver on this mission with our innovative pipeline. Building on last year's approval of Praluent, we anticipate at least 1 approval each year for the coming years. In 2016, we anticipate the approval of sarilumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Our breakthrough product, dupilumab and atopic dermatitis, is progressing. And we expect to report top line Phase III data and submitted BLA in the U.S. during this year. Beyond dupilumab, we have a rapidly developing late and early-stage pipeline that now consists of 13 product candidates that were all discovered by the scientists at Regeneron. And we expect to put additional new candidates into the clinic this year. George will provide some perspective on this during his remarks. 
In summary, we are in the midst of a very exciting time with Regeneron with many important events anticipated in 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then by Bob Landry."

As Len said, 2015 was a very successful and exciting year for R&D at Regeneron. I would like to begin with EYLEA. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss i",990,"Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len said, 2015 was a very successful and exciting year for R&D at Regeneron. 
I would like to begin with EYLEA. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes and as a result of microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina. If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can progress to profound and sometimes acute vision loss. While EYLEA is a approved to treat diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema, or DME, we believe that it could benefit much broader patient population with diabetic retinopathy who do not have DME where there is no approved anti-VEGF therapy. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year, we plan to initiate Panorama, a Phase III study of EYLEA in patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. The National Institute of Health will also independently investigate the potential role of anti-VEGF therapy in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This study called, Protocol-W, will be sponsored by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, or DRCR, and will compare EYLEA to sham in phases with severe, nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Protocol-W is expected to begin in the first quarter. 
A Phase II study of EYLEA in combination with our PDGF receptor antibody delivered as a co-formulated injection in wet age-related macular degeneration, or Wet AMD, is ongoing. And we expect to see top line data from this study by year end. This program had been granted fast track designation by the FDA. Data from the Phase I study of EYLEA in combination with Nesvacumab, our ANG2 antibody, delivered as a co-formulated injection, was presented just last week at the Angiogenesis Conference. This data shows that the combination of EYLEA with Nesvacumab was safe and well tolerated in patients with AMD and patients with DME. We plan to initiate Phase II studies that will include both these patient populations in the first half of the year. 
As Len mentioned, our Praluent launch is underway, and you'll hear further details from Bob Terifay on the commercial front. Our 18,000-patient outcomes trial is ongoing. And we expect the first interim analysis, which will test for futility will occur later this year based upon 50% of the expected events from the trial. Also, we could potentially have our second interim analysis, which occurs after 75% of the targeted primary events that have accrued by the end of this year. And this interim analysis will test for overwhelming efficacy and futility. As we previously disclosed, the stopping rule for this efficacy analysis with a hazard ratio of 0.802 favoring Praluent, as well as consistency across subgroups and regions, positive trends for secondary endpoints including all caused mortality and no excess noncardiovascular mortality. These last points are all important as we would not want to unblind a trial early because its efficacy in the primary endpoint at the cost of not reaching significant and important secondary endpoints. In addition to the outcomes trial, we plan to submit a supplemental BLA in the first half of the year with the Praluent monthly dosing regimen.
Turning now to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor anitbody for rheumatoid arthritis. Our regulatory submissions was accepted by the FDA and has been granted an action date of October 30, 2016. The Phase III MONARCH trial, which is a superiority study of sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab, which fully enrolled, and we expect top line data from this study in the first half of 2016. A European regulatory submission for sarilumab is expected to be made in the second half of 2016. 
I share Len's enthusiasm for dupilumab, our IL-4/13 pathway blocking antibody, which is currently in Phase III clinical studies in asthma and in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis where it's been granted breakthrough designation, in part because there are no FDA-approved systemic therapy for adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We expect to report top line data from the Phase III atopic dermatitis study, Solo-1, Solo-2 and CHRONOS in the first half of this year and to complete rolling BLS submission in the second half of the year. Our approximately 1,700-patient pivotal Phase III study of dupilumab in asthma is also enrolled. We also continued to explore other indications for dupilumab, which is nasal polyps and the eosinophilic esophagitis as well as other allergic or IL-4/13 mediated diseases. 
Our Nerve Growth Factor antibody, or NGF antibody,  fasinumab, is another late-stage pipeline candidate. Pain is one of the leading reasons that patients visit the doctor, and osteoarthritis is one of the major source of the pain in adults, particularly older adults. The increasing use of prescription opioids to treat pains has led to a growing epidemic of drug addiction and overdose-related fatalities as well as other opioid-related side effects. 
Blocking NGF has already shown the ability to improve pain compared to placebo or an active comparator such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, in Phase II and Phase III trials. We now have a clear path forward from the FDA and will be starting with 10,000 patient long-term treatment Phase II clinical study of fasinumab in the first half of the year. We anticipate reporting data from a 16-week study in osteoarthritis pain in the first half of the year. 
In our early-stage pipeline, we plan to share data from our Phase I/II study of  [indiscernible], our antibody to ANGPTL3 with Dyslipidemia from the first half as well as data from our ongoing immuno-oncology program such as our PD-1 program and the CD20 by CD3 by specific program. We have obviously been very busy and productive. In fact, this year, we expect to submit a record number of IND, and we look forward to sharing more details with you as these programs move into the clinic. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

A survey of 201 U.S. retinal specialists, who evaluated their reported usage of VEGF inhibitors in the fourth quarter of 2015, indicates that EYLEA continues to be the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents in all of our labeled indications in terms of market share of treated eyes. Importantly, the market share of treated eyes for EYLEA and DME is roughly double that for ranibizumab and similar to that -- for off-label bevacizumab.
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the fourth quarter were $7 million, which understates actual position in patient demand. As we reminded you last quarter, we anticipate that it would take some time for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, as well as strict utilization management criteria, we continue to expect a gradual uptake. In response to potential delays and formulary reimbursement decisions, we're offering free product to appropriate patients consistent with our labeled indication. We are waiting an insurance coverage decision. These delays uptake in commercial sales reporting. 
For example, much of Medicare Part D are government-paid patients are receiving free drug pending formulary coverage, which is expected later in the quarter. So performance cannot be solely judged on sales or filled prescriptions. As a reminder, the reimbursement environment is complex and is carefully managed by payers. Our goal has been to ensure that payers and health care providers understand the value that Praluent can offer to patients. And to that end, we have been and are still actively engaged in discussions with payers. 
There are approximately 240 million lives in the United States that have a drug benefit covered by commercial insurance or Medicare part D plans. Coverage decisions have already been made for approximately 90% of these lives. However, implementation is ongoing. And we expect continued rollout of the coverage over the next several months. Overall, for approximately 50% of the covered lives, a single PCSK9 antibody has been chosen an exclusive or preferred physician. In these exclusive or preferred cases, we estimate that Praluent was chosen for about 60% of the lives. The preference for Praluent was particularly evident in the Medicare Part D decisions. In Medicare, 80% of the lives have a single PCSK9 antibody in an exclusive or preferred position. For these exclusive or preferred Medicare Part B lives, Praluent was selected approximately 95% of the time. We believe these Medicare coverage decisions are particularly important because our major indications for Praluent is for patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. And these patients tend to be older. According to our estimates, about 28% of statin patients in the United States are Medicare Part B patients. We are pleased to see that Praluent is resonating well with payers. As plans begin to activate their coverage, we anticipate a potential uptake in prescription volume. Importantly, almost 90% of all prescriptions processed by the hub are for our lower 75-milligram every-other-week dose. As a reminder, in our Phase III clinical studies, the vast majority of Praluent patients achieved their LDL-cholesterol goals with a 75-milligram every-other-week dose. We continue our efforts to educate both patients and physicians on the benefit of using PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September with product available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. 
In the fourth quarter, we submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin 6 or IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries were made -- will be made over time. We also continue to pay for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor in 2017. We've recently informed Sanofi of our intent to co-promote dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. Next month, we will have a significant presence at the American College -- or the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology meeting in Los Angeles and the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in Washington, DC. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."
33715,323449305,929206,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are please with the full year performance Regeneron delivered in 2015. For the full year 2015, we earned $12.07 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion. This",1281,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are please with the full year performance Regeneron delivered in 2015. For the full year 2015, we earned $12.07 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion. This represents a year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 21% and 19%, respectively, for the full year 2015. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, non-GAAP net income per diluted share increased 1% to $2.83 versus fourth quarter of 2014, and non-GAAP net income of $327 million was unchanged versus fourth quarter of 2014. Regeneron's 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during 2015 and in adjustment for income taxes. Non-GAAP income tax expense is based upon cash, income taxes paid or payable for 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $1.1 billion and $4.1 billion for the full year 2015, which represented year-over-year growth of 37% for the 3 months and 46% for the full year. Net product sales were $750 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $2.69 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to $522 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1.75 billion for the full year of 2014. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $746 million in the fourth quarter and $2.68 billion in 2015, compared to $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1.74 billion for the full year of 2014, which represents an increase of 44% and 54%, respectively. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributary inventory levels as compared to the third quarter 2015. And overall, a slight decrease in comparison to the fourth quarter 2014 but remains within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range. As Len mentioned earlier, our U.S. EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full year 2016  over 2015 is approximately 20%. Ex U.S. EYLEA sales were $413 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $297 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, representing a 39% increase on a reported basis. Ex U.S. EYLEA sales for the full year of 2015 were $1.41 billion compared to $1.04 billion for 2014, representing a 36% increase on a reported basis. 
On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 54% for the 3 months and 58% for the full year 2015. Product revenues from ex U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $140 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States and $467 million for the full year 2015. Total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter was $165 million and $580 million for the full year 2015. 
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $166 million for the fourth quarter and $759 million for the full year 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $96 million for the full year 2015 was $240 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. 
Netting with these losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our partner, Sanofi, of $7 million for the fourth quarter 2015 and $11 million for the full year 2015. Recall that Praluent was launched in the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $389 million for the fourth quarter and $1.37 billion for the full year 2015. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D noncash share based compensation expense, was $214 million for the 3 months and $570 million for the full year 2015. We note that this comes in slightly above our 2015 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense guidance of $540 million to $560 million, primarily due to higher expenditures for our NGF program. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. 
For 2016, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $875 million to $950 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is driven by 3 factors: advancing our pipeline outside of the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration, particularly our programs for NGF, RSV and CD20 by CD3; our obligation to pay for 20% of the Phase III clinical development expense following a first positive Phase III results of our partnered antibodies, primarily driven by the potential positive dupilumab Phase III readout in the first half of 2016; the advancement of our immuno-oncology pipeline in collaboration with Sanofi and proprietary R&D initiatives such as those in the area of human genomics. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $213 million for the fourth quarter and $646 million for the full year 2015. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of $925 million and $1 billion. The increase in our SG&A expense is primarily driven by the ongoing Praluent launch, which is entering its first full year of launch and preparing for the potential commercial launches of both sarilumab and dupilumab. As we've mentioned previously, in 2015, we began paying significant cash income taxes as compared to prior periods. Cash tax, as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for this quarter as well as for all of 2015, is based on an estimated cash tax paid or payable for the full year. This amount continues to be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, cash tax, as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, was approximately 16% and 18%, respectively. 
For 2016, our guidance for cash tax, as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax income, is 35% to 45%. This includes a onetime tax of approximately $222 million related to $600 million of our December 31, 2015, deferred revenue balance remaining from the immuno-oncology upfront payment from Sanofi that we received in the third quarter of 2015. The cash tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment would be spread equally throughout the year. 
Our capital expenditures for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, were $678 million. We expect our capital expenditures to be between $580 million and $680 million for 2016. These expenses continue -- these expenses continue to build on the manufacturing expansions made in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York; in Limerick, Ireland; as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. We ended the fourth quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.7 billion. As we have previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we paid $50 million to reduce these outstanding warrants. And in January 2016, we paid an additional $135 million to reduce more outstanding warrants. We intend to continue seeking opportunities to further reduce these outstanding warrants into 2016. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael."

Certainly, it's something that we take very serious about this.

And on top of that, we are in the midst of launching sarilumab in the fourth quarter of 2016. And we're also preparing for first half 2017 for dupilumab. So for those 3 launches, it's putting stress on our SG&A number. With regards to R&D, we've highlighted some drivers with regards to the increase and unreimbursed R&D. The biggest one probably being the NGF program, as you heard from Len and George earlier. That program is full speed ahead with regards to entering Phase III very, very shortly. We're also moving forward with RSV. Now these are both unpartnered products. And then again, we get our first positive Phase III readout for dupilumab in the first half of 2016. And as you know and as we've said before, that's a driver with regards to us picking up 20% of the program cost associated with that. So that would not only include atopic dermatitis, that would also include the asthma indications associated with that. So all of these things associated are putting some stress on our expenses. And maybe Len may have a few additional comments."

I would just say that if you study this industry and companies in it, nobody ever has a perfectly spaced pipeline. The spaces are usually too wide with lots of white space and lots of worry, what to do, where's the next drug going to come from? Or very infrequently, as is the case here of Regeneron, there's a lot going on. It's very compacted in time. We, of course, would rather have the latter than the former. And that's why I think that we're managing through. And it's an exciting time: an approval in 2015 for Praluent; 2016, we hope for sarilumab; 2017, the first approval for dupilumab; and beyond that, approvals for dupilumab in asthma; perhaps NGF coming up; RSV; progress in the -- and perhaps approval down the line there; and immuno-oncology. So we have a very intensely compacted pipeline that we have to manage both from a technical point of view, from an operational point of view, a manufacturing point of view, and of course, as Bob says, from a financial point of view."

Unfortunately, it's a fairly competitive marketplace out there. I will reemphasize that some of the points -- take this opportunity. We emphasize some of the points that Bob made, which is that we feel on the contracting side, that process is starting to wind down in terms of about 90% of the lives who have, either commercial or a Medicare Part D coverage, decisions have been made. They haven't been fully implemented on many of them. And in fact, the rollout is just going to keep going over the next several months. And even into the second quarter of this year, some coverage won't begin. We did particularly well in those cases where there was an exclusive or preferred decision made. We won that business over 60% of the time. And as Bob said in the Medicare business, where there's a large proportion of the statin use, a large proportion of our patients, we were able when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made, and that was 80% of the time when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made, that went -- 95% of the lives went to Praluent. So we're very pleased that our product offering is resonating well. And that people, I think, are getting our message. In terms of the patient types, as we mentioned, there's a very strict utilization management criteria in the category. So it is strictly within the label population, which is patients with heterozygous familial  hypercholesterolemia and patients with a history of coronary disease. So we're seeing patients who had myocardial infarctions; patients with very, very high baseline LDL-C; patients who have FH. These are the patient populations for which the products is being dispensed."

I mean I think what Amgen is basically telling you, which is correct, which is that in previous studies, the amount of risk reduction you get is proportional to the absolute number of milligrams per deciliter that you lower LDL cholesterol. Now of course, in their Phase IIb/III studies -- I should say they're Phase III nonoutcome studies as well as ours, the starting LDL cholesterol was higher. And so the overall LDL absolutely reduction was a lot. And therefore, the risk reduction was a lot. When you start out with a more modest LDL, which we're both doing in our outcomes trial, you have less LDL lowering. And on average, you should have less risk reduction, but we think a every robust results. And we'll be able to look across the various spectrums of peoples who had this starting LDL and so on and so forth. So we're very confident in the LDL hypothesis. Remember, Brown and Goldstein were the first people to understand the LDL receptor, our Board of Directors. So this is something we have been very close to for a very long time.

I can't over emphasize what George just said, so I'll repeat it which is that, when the -- some people are trying to develop add-ons as 2 separate injections, which really means that you must have a robust efficacy and safety profile to justify the risk because injections in the eye, although probably none have -- there's been no more injections, then I can imagine has been with EYLEA around the world. But the injections in the eye still carry a small but real risk each time a physician sticks a needle in the eye without putting anything in there. And so if you're going to have a very small benefit, 2 needles fixed probably won't be justified. And as George said, the cost. We can deliver these at the same cost if necessary in a single injection. So we have both the financial burden as well as the injection burden really under our control. So therefore, we can be driven by any -- we can be driven to go to market with smaller benefits than you might have to hold yourself up to if you have to do a multiple injections and add-on costs."

Many of the payers have yet to implement their insurance coverage. So we expect to see that coverage continue to come on board over the next several months. Once that coverage comes on board, there is going to be some time for physicians to understand what utilization management criteria are and how to really document the prior authorization to get these patients through the entire process to get a defense prescription. So I would say you're going to see very gradual uptake for several months until we get to some kind of a steady state."

A very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. 2015 was another successful and productive year for Regeneron. EYLEA delivered impressive global growth. And we received approval for and launched Praluent",570,"Thanks, Michael. A very good morning to everyone who has joined us on the call and webcast today. 
2015 was another successful and productive year for Regeneron. EYLEA delivered impressive global growth. And we received approval for and launched Praluent, which is indicated in the U.S. as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for the treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. We made significant advances in our late-stage pipeline, submitting a biologic license application, or BLA, for sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis and advancing Phase III clinical development for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis and asthma. In 2015, we also advanced 2 new antibodies into Phase III. Regeneron 2222 for the prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus or RSV infection infants and our anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritis pain. We also advanced our early-stage pipeline with progress across multiple therapeutic areas, including retinal diseases, cancer, infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases. 
Turning to EYLEA performance. EYLEA is now the market-leading brand in anti-VEGF therapy for retinal disease in the United States and continue to exhibit strong growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide. We saw approximately 54% growth year-over-year in the U.S., with sales of $2.68 billion. On a worldwide basis, EYLEA sales were approximately $4.1 billion for the full year. 
For the full year 2016, we estimate U.S. EYLEA net sales to grow approximately 20% over full year 2015 U.S. net sales. We are focused on maintaining our leadership in the retinal space. We are continuing clinical development with EYLEA where we have ongoing combination programs with PDGF and with ANG2 and are pursuing important additional indications for EYLEA that George will review later in the call.
Turning now to Praluent. We are proud to have brought the first PCSK9 inhibitor to the market in the United States for patients with uncontrolled LDL cholesterol, which was approved and launched in July of last year. We are still in the early stages of this launch and have been working diligently to provide broad access to eligible patients and educating physicians and patients in order to increase adoption. Bob Terifay will provide some additional metrics on how the launch is progressing. 
Our mission at Regeneron for 25 plus years has been to consistently and repeatedly bring important new medicines to patients in need. And we feel that we are well-positioned to deliver on this mission with our innovative pipeline. Building on last year's approval of Praluent, we anticipate at least 1 approval each year for the coming years. In 2016, we anticipate the approval of sarilumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Our breakthrough product, dupilumab and atopic dermatitis, is progressing. And we expect to report top line Phase III data and submit a BLA in the U.S. during this year. Beyond dupilumab, we have a rapidly developing late and early-stage pipeline that now consists of 13 product candidates that were all discovered by the scientists at Regeneron. And we expect to put additional new candidates into the clinic this year. George will provide some perspective on this during his remarks. 
In summary, we are in the midst of a very exciting time with Regeneron with many important events anticipated in 2016. With that, let me turn the call over to Dr. George Yancopoulos, Regeneron's Chief Scientific Officer. He will be followed by Bob Terifay and then by Bob Landry."

As Len said, 2015 was a very successful and exciting year for R&D at Regeneron. I would like to begin with EYLEA. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss i",990,"Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. As Len said, 2015 was a very successful and exciting year for R&D at Regeneron. 
I would like to begin with EYLEA. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes and as a result of microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina. If left untreated, diabetic retinopathy can progress to profound and sometimes acute vision loss. While EYLEA is approved to treat diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema, or DME, we believe that it could benefit much broader patient population with diabetic retinopathy who do not have DME where there is no approved anti-VEGF therapy. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year, we plan to initiate Panorama, a Phase III study of EYLEA in patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. The National Institute of Health will also independently investigate the potential role of anti-VEGF therapy in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This study called, Protocol-W, will be sponsored by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, or DRCR, and will compare EYLEA to sham in phases with severe, nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. Protocol-W is expected to begin in the first quarter. 
A Phase II study of EYLEA in combination with our PDGF receptor antibody delivered as a co-formulated injection in wet age-related macular degeneration, or Wet AMD, is ongoing. And we expect to see top line data from this study by year end. This program had been granted fast track designation by the FDA. Data from the Phase I study of EYLEA in combination with Nesvacumab, our ANG2 antibody, delivered as a co-formulated injection, was presented just last week at the Angiogenesis Conference. These data shows that the combination of EYLEA with Nesvacumab was safe and well tolerated in patients with AMD and patients with DME. We plan to initiate Phase II studies that will include both these patient populations in the first half of the year. 
As Len mentioned, our Praluent launch is underway, and you'll hear further details from Bob Terifay on the commercial front. Our 18,000-patient outcomes trial is ongoing. And we expect the first interim analysis, which will test for futility to occur later this year based upon 50% of the expected events from the trial. Also, we could potentially have our second interim analysis, which occurs after 75% of the targeted primary events that have accrued by the end of this year. And this interim analysis will test for overwhelming efficacy and futility. As we previously disclosed, the stopping rule for this efficacy analysis is a hazard ratio of 0.802 favoring Praluent, as well as consistency across subgroups and regions, positive trends for secondary endpoints including all caused mortality and no excess noncardiovascular mortality. These last points are all important as we would not want to unblind a trial early because its efficacy in the primary endpoint at the cost of not reaching significant and important secondary endpoints. In addition to the outcomes trial, we plan to submit a supplemental BLA in the first half of the year with the Praluent monthly dosing regimen.
Turning now to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor anitbody for rheumatoid arthritis. Our regulatory submissions were accepted by the FDA and has been granted an action date of October 30, 2016. The Phase III MONARCH trial, which is a superiority study of sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab, which fully enrolled, and we expect top line data from this study in the first half of 2016. A European regulatory submission for sarilumab is expected to be made in the second half of 2016. 
I share Len's enthusiasm for dupilumab, our IL-4/13 pathway blocking antibody, which is currently in Phase III clinical studies in asthma and in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis where it's been granted breakthrough designation, in part because there are no FDA-approved systemic therapy for adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We expect to report top line data from the Phase III atopic dermatitis study, Solo-1, Solo-2 and CHRONOS in the first half of this year and to complete rolling BLS submission in the second half of the year. Our approximately 1,700-patient pivotal Phase III study of dupilumab in asthma is also enrolled. We also continue to explore other indications for dupilumab, such as nasal polyps and the eosinophilic esophagitis as well as other allergic or IL-4/13 mediated diseases. 
Our Nerve Growth Factor antibody, or NGF antibody,  fasinumab, is another late-stage pipeline candidate. Pain is one of the leading reasons that patients visit the doctor, and osteoarthritis is one of the major source of the pain in adults, particularly older adults. The increasing use of prescription opioids to treat pains has led to a growing epidemic of drug addiction and overdose-related fatalities as well as other opioid-related side effects. 
Blocking NGF has already shown the ability to improve pain compared to placebo or an active comparator such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, in Phase II and Phase III trials. We now have a clear path forward from the FDA and will be starting with 10,000 patient long-term treatment Phase III clinical study of fasinumab in the first half of the year. We anticipate reporting data from a 16-week study in osteoarthritis pain in the first half of the year. 
In our early-stage pipeline, we plan to share data from our Phase I/II study of anivacumab [indiscernible], our antibody to ANGPTL3 with Dyslipidemia from the first half as well as data from our ongoing immuno-oncology program such as our PD-1 program and the CD20 by CD3 by specific program. We have obviously been very busy and productive. In fact, this year, we expect to submit a record number of IND, and we look forward to sharing more details with you as these programs move into the clinic. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

We continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We also made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent or alirocumab, among U.S. payors. In addition, the European launch for Praluent commenced. 
Starting with EYLEA. Fourth quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the fourth quarter were $746 million. Full year, U.S. EYLEA sales were $2.68 billion, which represented 54% year-over-year growth. A survey of 201 U.S. retinal specialists, who evaluated their reported usage of VEGF inhibitors in the fourth quarter of 2015, indicates that EYLEA continues to be the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents in all of our labeled indications in terms of market share of treated eyes. Importantly, the market share of treated eyes for EYLEA and DME is roughly double that for ranibizumab and similar to that -- for off-label bevacizumab.
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the fourth quarter were $7 million, which understates actual position in patient demand. As we reminded you last quarter, we anticipate that it would take some time for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. Given these reasons, as well as strict utilization management criteria, we continue to expect a gradual uptake. In response to potential delays and formulary reimbursement decisions, we're offering free product to appropriate patients consistent with our labeled indication. We are waiting an insurance coverage decision. This delays uptake in commercial sales reporting. 
For example, much of Medicare Part D are government-paid patients are receiving free drug pending formulary coverage, which is expected later in the quarter. So performance cannot be solely judged on sales or filled prescriptions. As a reminder, the reimbursement environment is complex and is carefully managed by payers. Our goal has been to ensure that payers and health care providers understand the value that Praluent can offer to patients. And to that end, we have been and are still actively engaged in discussions with payers. 
There are approximately 240 million lives in the United States that have a drug benefit covered by commercial insurance or Medicare part D plans. Coverage decisions have already been made for approximately 90% of these lives. However, implementation is ongoing. And we expect continued rollout of the coverage over the next several months. Overall, for approximately 50% of the covered lives, a single PCSK9 antibody has been chosen an exclusive or preferred physician. In these exclusive or preferred cases, we estimate that Praluent was chosen for about 60% of the lives. The preference for Praluent was particularly evident in the mart Medicare Part D decisions. In Medicare, 80% of the lives have a single PCSK9 antibody in an exclusive or preferred position. For these exclusive or preferred Medicare Part B lives, Praluent was selected approximately 95% of the time. We believe these Medicare coverage decisions are particularly important because our major indications for Praluent is for patients with a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. And these patients tend to be older. According to our estimates, about 28% of statin patients in the United States are Medicare Part D patients. We are pleased to see that Praluent is resonating well with payers. As plans begin to activate their coverage, we anticipate a potential uptake in prescription volume. Importantly, almost 90% of all prescriptions processed by the hub are for our lower 75-milligram every-other-week dose. As a reminder, in our Phase III clinical studies, the vast majority of Praluent patients achieved their LDL-cholesterol goals with a 75-milligram every-other-week dose. We continue our efforts to educate both patients and physicians on the benefit of using PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September with product available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. 
In the fourth quarter, we submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin 6 or IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries were made -- will be made over time. We also continue to pay for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and IL-13 inhibitor in 2017. We've recently informed Sanofi of our intent to co-promote dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. Next month, we will have a significant presence at the American College -- or the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology meeting in Los Angeles and the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in Washington, DC. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."

This",1281,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. Overall, we are please with the full year performance Regeneron delivered in 2015. For the full year 2015, we earned $12.07 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion. This represents a year-over-year growth in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 21% and 19%, respectively, for the full year 2015. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, non-GAAP net income per diluted share increased 1% to $2.83 versus fourth quarter of 2014, and non-GAAP net income of $327 million was unchanged versus fourth quarter of 2014. Regeneron's 2015 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense, noncash interest expense related to our senior convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with conversions of a portion of our convertible notes during 2015 and in adjustment for income taxes. Non-GAAP income tax expense is based upon cash, income taxes paid or payable for 2015. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $1.1 billion and $4.1 billion for the full year 2015, which represented year-over-year growth of 37% for the 3 months and 46% for the full year. Net product sales were $750 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $2.69 billion for the full year of 2015 compared to $522 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1.75 billion for the full year of 2014. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $746 million in the fourth quarter and $2.68 billion in 2015, compared to $518 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $1.74 billion for the full year of 2014, which represents an increase of 44% and 54%, respectively. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributary inventory levels as compared to the third quarter 2015. And overall, a slight decrease in comparison to the fourth quarter 2014 but remains within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range. As Len mentioned earlier, our U.S. EYLEA net sales growth guidance for full year 2016 over 2015 is approximately 20%. Ex U.S. EYLEA sales were $413 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $297 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, representing a 39% increase on a reported basis. Ex U.S. EYLEA sales for the full year of 2015 were $1.41 billion compared to $1.04 billion for 2014, representing a 36% increase on a reported basis. 
On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 54% for the 3 months and 58% for the full year 2015. Product revenues from ex U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer HealthCare. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, Regeneron recognized $140 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States and $467 million for the full year 2015. Total Bayer HealthCare collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter was $165 million and $580 million for the full year 2015. 
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $166 million for the fourth quarter and $759 million for the full year 2015. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the fourth quarter of 2015, our share of losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $96 million for the full year 2015 was $240 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. 
Netting within these losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our partner, Sanofi, of $7 million for the fourth quarter 2015 and $11 million for the full year 2015. Recall that Praluent was launched in the third quarter of 2015. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $389 million for the fourth quarter and $1.37 billion for the full year 2015. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D noncash share based compensation expense, was $214 million for the 3 months and $570 million for the full year 2015. We note that this comes in slightly above our 2015 non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense guidance of $540 million to $560 million, primarily due to higher expenditures for our NGF program. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. 
For 2016, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $875 million to $950 million. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D spend is driven by 3 factors: advancing our pipeline outside of the Sanofi and Bayer collaboration, particularly our programs for NGF, RSV and CD20 by CD3; our obligation to pay for 20% of the Phase III clinical development expense following a first positive Phase III results of our partnered antibodies, primarily driven by the potential positive dupilumab Phase III readout in the first half of 2016; the advancement of our immuno-oncology pipeline in collaboration with Sanofi and proprietary R&D initiatives such as those in the area of human genomics. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $213 million for the fourth quarter and $646 million for the full year 2015. We expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of $925 million and $1 billion. The increase in our SG&A expense is primarily driven by the ongoing Praluent launch, which is entering its first full year of launch and preparing for the potential commercial launches of both sarilumab and dupilumab. As we've mentioned previously, in 2015, we began paying significant cash income taxes as compared to prior periods. Cash tax, as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for this quarter as well as for all of 2015, is based on an estimated cash tax paid or payable for the full year. This amount continues to be substantially lower than our GAAP effective tax rate. On a non-GAAP basis, cash tax, as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for the fourth quarter of 2015 and for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, was approximately 16% and 18%, respectively. 
For 2016, our guidance for cash tax, as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax income, is 35% to 45%. This includes a onetime tax of approximately $222 million related to $600 million of our December 31, 2015, deferred revenue balance remaining from the immuno-oncology upfront payment from Sanofi that we received in the third quarter of 2015. The cash tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment would be spread equally throughout the year. 
Our capital expenditures for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, were $678 million. We expect our capital expenditures to be between $580 million and $680 million for 2016. These expenses continue -- these expenses continue to build on the manufacturing expansions made in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York; in Limerick, Ireland; as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. We ended the fourth quarter of 2015 with cash and marketable securities of $1.7 billion. As we have previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we paid $50 million to reduce these outstanding warrants. And in January 2016, we paid an additional $135 million to reduce more outstanding warrants. We intend to continue seeking opportunities to further reduce these outstanding warrants into 2016. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael."

Certainly, it's something that we take very serious about this. As we mentioned several times in the quarters last year, we are in the midst of a sizable Praluent launch against a very formidable opponent. And on top of that, we are in the midst of launching sarilumab in the fourth quarter of 2016. And we're also preparing for first half 2017 for dupilumab. So for those 3 launches, it's putting stress on our SG&A number. With regards to R&D, we've highlighted some drivers with regards to the increase and unreimbursed R&D. The biggest one probably being the NGF program, as you heard from Len and George earlier. That program is full speed ahead with regards to entering Phase III very, very shortly. We're also moving forward with RSV. Now these are both unpartnered products. And then again, we get our first positive Phase III readout for dupilumab in the first half of 2016. And as you know and as we've said before, that's a driver with regards to us picking up 20% of the program cost associated with that. So that would not only include atopic dermatitis, that would also include the asthma indications associated with that. So all of these things associated are putting some stress on our expenses. And maybe Len may have a few additional comments."

And that's what I think that we're managing through. And it's an exciting time: an approval in 2015 for Praluent; 2016, we hope for sarilumab; 2017, the first approval for dupilumab; and beyond that, approvals for dupilumab in asthma; perhaps NGF coming up; RSV; progress in the -- and perhaps approval down the line there; and immuno-oncology. So we have a very intensely compacted pipeline that we have to manage both from a technical point of view, from an operational point of view, a manufacturing point of view, and of course, as Bob says, from a financial point of view."

Unfortunately, it's a fairly competitive marketplace out there. I will reemphasize that some of the points -- take this opportunity. We emphasize some of the points that Bob made, which is that we feel on the contracting side, that process is starting to wind down in terms of about 90% of the lives who have, either commercial or a Medicare Part D coverage, decisions have been made. They haven't been fully implemented on many of them. And in fact, the rollout is just going to keep going over the next several months. And even into the second quarter of this year, some coverage won't begin. We did particularly well in those cases where there was an exclusive or preferred decision made. We won that business over 60% of the time. And as Bob said in the Medicare business, where there's a large proportion of the statin use, a large proportion of our patients, we were able when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made, and that was 80% of the time when there was an exclusive or preferred decision made, that went -- 95% of the lives went to Praluent. So we're very pleased that our product offering is resonating well. And that people, I think, are getting our message. In terms of the patient types, as we mentioned, there are very strict utilization management criteria in the category. So it is strictly within the label population, which is patients with heterozygous familial  hypercholesterolemia and patients with a history of coronary disease. So we're seeing patients who've had myocardial infarctions; patients with very, very high baseline LDL-C; patients who have FH. These are the patient populations for which the products is being dispensed."

So it's going to be very hard to deconvolute, I think, the second year data."

Although VEGF inhibitors are being used more broadly for patients who are diagnosed with DME.

More patients getting older, more patients with diabetes. We see strength in potential market share, both from off label and from, coming from the off-label Avastin and perhaps from Lucentis. We see geographic growth with more room to grow outside the United States. Our ratio outside the United States is not as high as it is inside the United States in terms of market share.

I mean I think what Amgen is basically telling you, which is correct, which is that in previous studies, the amount of risk reduction you get is proportional to the absolute number of milligrams per deciliter that you lower LDL cholesterol. Now of course, in their Phase IIb/III studies -- I should say they're Phase III nonoutcome studies as well as ours, the starting LDL cholesterol was higher. And so the overall LDL absolutely reduction was a lot. And therefore, the risk reduction was a lot. When you start out with a more modest LDL, which we're both doing in our outcomes trial, you have less LDL lowering. And on average, you should have less risk reduction, but we think a very robust result. And we'll be able to look across the various spectrums of peoples who had this starting LDL and so on and so forth. So we're very confident in the LDL hypothesis. Remember, Brown and Goldstein were the first people to understand the LDL receptor, on our Board of Directors. So this is something we have been very close to for a very long time. We believe in the LDL hypothesis, and we believe the outcomes trials should continue to support that."

The first quarter of 2016 was busy and we've a lot to share with you today. Our strategy remains, as always, to focus our unique capabilities and drug discovery and development on bringing important new medicines to patients in need. George will provide you with some of the recent exciting progress we've made in that regard. 
From a high-level perspective, we had positive data readouts from 3 Phase III programs, Praluent for lowering LDL cholesterol in the setting, sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis, and dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. 
We also reported positive data from a Phase II/III study in osteoarthritis for fasinumab, our NGF for pain. And we continue to make good progress with our early stage assets and discovery efforts. 
Turning to our marketed products, EYLEA has continued to deliver solid growth and we are able to increase our guidance for the year. Praluent's launch is still ongoing and it's obviously faced with difficult reimbursement environment. 
While we fully understand payers' efforts to control costs, we do have serious concerns that appropriate patients are having undue difficulty getting approval for Praluent. We continue to be optimistic over the long term that Praluent will provide an important cholesterol-lowering option to many patients. 
Bob Terifay will provide more detail on EYLEA and Praluent. Following that, Bob Landry will provide more detail on financial results for the first quarter of 2016 as well as updated guidance. 
Finally, we are approaching the potential approval and launch of 2 new products, sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is under review with the FDA. Dupilumab is being developed for a number of indications and we are targeting completion of our rolling BLA submission for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016.

In February, we received 2 new results from Protocol T, a government-sponsored study in patients with DME, comparing the safety and efficacy of EYLEA versus Lucentis and Avastin. The primary efficacy endpoint for that study was at 1 year, which showed significant better vision gain with EYLEA in either with Lucentis or Avastin. 
The second year of the study was not designed to rigorously compare the anti-VEGF agents as the second year results were increasingly confounded by variable dosing frequencies as well as additional adjunctive therapies such as laser. 
Along these lines, it is important to point out that there was a greater number of injections substantially more use of laser associated with Avastin treatment in the overall population. 
Despite this, when compared with Avastin, EYLEA demonstrated a statistically significant 5-letter gain or an entire line of vision in patients with poor vision at baseline. 
At 2 years, the rates of most ocular adverse events were similar across 3 study groups. There was, however, statistical given lower rate of arterial events, including nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and vascular death in the EYLEA group compared with the ranibizumab group. 
A probably launch is underway and Bob Terifay will provide further details on the commercial front. 
Our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study is ongoing. The data monitoring committee for this study has completed the first interim analysis with 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. 
In addition to reviewing the safety data, the DMC performed the futility assessment and recommended the study continue with no changes. 
We remain blinded to the actual results of this analysis and the study is ongoing. A second interim analysis for futility as well as overwhelming efficacy can potentially occur in the second half of 2016, when 75% of the targeted primary events have occurred. 
In March, we reported positive data from the Phase III ODYSSEY ESCAPE study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who required chronic weekly or biweekly apheresis. Apheresis is an invasive, expensive and time-consuming therapy given to the patients with the highest cholesterol levels in the greatest need. 
Our study showed that Praluent reduced the need for apheresis by 75% compared to placebo. And 63% of Praluent patients no longer require apheresis compared to 0% of the patients with placebo arm. Praluent is the only PCSK9 inhibitor that has been studied in a apheresis study, which represents some of the most severe hypercholesterolemic patients. The adverse events had occurred more frequently in the Praluent-treated patients where injected sites reactions in [indiscernible]. 
We expect  a supplemental BLA for the once monthly dosing of regimen of Praluent to be filed in the second quarter, which if approved, will expand our dosing flexibility options.
Turning now to our late stage pipeline, where we had some very positive news. I'd like to start with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody, which is under review by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. 
In March, we announced positive data from the Phase III MONARCH study of sarilumab versus Humira, which demonstrated sarilumab was superior to Humira in the monotherapy setting improving signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 24 weeks. This was the first head-to-head study in the monotherapy study using a subcutaneously administered IL-6 inhibitor. 
The use of IL-6 inhibitions of monotherapy setting has been growing and this data provide us with a competitive product profile. Data from the MONARCH study will be included in our European submission and is expected midyear of 2016. 
Turning now to dupilumab, our IL-4 13 blocking antibody, where we recently announced positive top line data from Solo-1 and Solo-2 monotherapy Phase III studies in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
These were the first Phase III studies of a systemic therapy to demonstrate a significant improvement in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and confirm the positive data we have seen in our Phase IIb study. 
Overall, the study demonstrates significant improvements in measures of disease severity, skin clearing, itching, quality-of-life and mental health. We expect to present detailed data from the solo studies in the upcoming medical conference. 
We continue to expect top line data from the Phase III CHRONO study, which explores dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids in the second quarter of 2016. We expect to complete the rolling BLA submission for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016. Remind you that dupilumab has received breakthrough designation from the FDA for this indication in adults. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated liver AD Café, a Phase II study of dupilumab to support our European submission. This study invest dupilumab with common topical corticosteroids in adult patients with atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or intolerant to an intelligible form systemic [indiscernible] treatment. 
In addition to the studies in the adult setting, we also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the atopic dermatitis indication in the pediatric population once we have data from the ongoing Phase II pediatric study that is now fully enrolled. We expect this Phase II data in the second half of the year. 
We're also investigating dupilumab and other indications, including asthma, where we are currently enrolling our 1,700 patients pivotal study. 
We're also advancing critical development in indications such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. 
For fasinumab, our NGF antibody, earlier this week, we announced positive data from our Phase II/III study in osteoarthritis, which provides us with our first safety and efficacy data with our subcutaneous dosing regiment. This was the first completed study using the antibody to NGF that performs extensive imaging of knee, hip and shoulder joints at screening and throughout the trial. 
Interestingly, we found that sub inter-efficiency fraction and even osteoarthritis were present in this population at screening. 
Further, our findings in patients fasinumab treatment are consistent with prior data suggesting that they may not be a substantial increase in rapidly progressing osteoarthritis when an NGF antibody is using the monotherapy setting. 
That said, it's a relatively small trial and we look forward to data from a much larger clinical studies that are underway. 
We have also seen some exciting developments in an earlier stage program. I'd like to spend a few minutes in 2 areas. Our efforts in genetics and our recent collaboration in the arena of gene editing. In March, we published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine based on research that was conducted at the Regeneron Genetics Center, or the RGC. The publication showed that inactivating the patients in the gene called angiopoietin like 4 were associated with a significantly reduced risk of coronary artery diseases in humans. This is a great example that demonstrates how our efforts in the area of position medicine can link genetic mutations information with real-world health outcomes to make actionable discoveries. 
Many of the findings the RGC are already being used to inform Regeneron's robust and integrated R&D programs and give us the ability to incorporate large-scale sequencing into discovery and pipeline approaches. 
We also demonstrate the advantages of our unique combination of technologies. Using our proprietary VelociGene Technology, we developed animal models that collaborate the human genetics findings. We're able to use VelociGene platform to create a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of ANGPTL4 that reduce triglyceride levels in mice and nonhuman primate. 
We're also advancing the Phase II program of Regeneron 1500, an antibody that ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 play a central role of lipoprotein metabolism and our genetic data show that patients with homozygous activation mutations of this gene report greater than 50% lower levels of LDL, HDL and triglycerides. 
Initial data from the small study in homozygous patients will be presented at the upcoming annual meeting of the National Lipid Association. We 
recently entered into collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics with the aim of advancing [indiscernible] genetic technology into in vivo therapeutic development. This was a logical fit for us given our long-standing expertise on genetic engineering, combined with our industry-leading human genetics research with the RGC, which is already identifying important generic target. 
We believe that combining these capabilities with Intellia technology holds real promise for serious diseases that have been historically difficult to address. It expands our ability to help patients with antibody-base therapies may not be the optimal approach. 
We continue to make progress in immuno-oncology. REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody program has entered a Phase II potentially registrational study in cutaneous sub carcinoma. We'll be presenting some preliminary Phase I data at the upcoming annual ASCO conference. 
With that, I'd like to turn over to call to Bob Terifay."

During the first quarter of 2016, we continue to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We made substantial progress in securing a",974,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. 
During the first quarter of 2016, we continue to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. 
We made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. 
In addition, the European launch of Praluent continues to progress. 
We also are now preparing for the potential U.S. launch of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next 12 to 15 months. 
Starting with EYLEA. First quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter were $781 million. Net ex-U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter were $419 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. 
We continue to see quarter-over-quarter increases in our U.S. market shares leadership for EYLEA in the FDA approved anti-VEGF market, both in terms of dollar sales as well as injections as reported by 207 retinal specialist in our quarterly market research survey. 
We're encouraged about Q2 growth opportunities for EYLEA based upon the recently recorded 2-year results of the independently conducted Protocol T comparative study of EYLEA versus ranibizumab versus [indiscernible] in patients with diabetes macular edema. 
However, I should point out that we are closely monitoring pressures on EYLEA sales as the year progresses. They're currently a series of proposals for the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services regarding physician reimbursement for physician administered Medicare Part D buy and bill drugs, which could lead towards physicians favoring the use of off label repackaged bevacizumab or in large volume retinal practice ranibizumab due to provision of direct to physician financial incentives from the manufacturer. 
Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed inappropriate. Therefore, we and scores of other manufacturers, patient ethics groups and industry associations, will or have already submitted objections to CMS and Congress, recommending the physicians' choice be preserved an alternative scheme to reduce health care be explored. 
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the first quarter were $13 million, which understates the actual position of patient demand. 
As a reminder, over the last several quarters, we anticipated that it will take some time for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement covers decisions to begin to process patient claims. 
I'm pleased to tell you that as of April 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and 91% of Medicare insured lives have access to Praluent. 
We've recently seen an improvement in a number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled. Highlighting our approved coverage as well as our share of voice among health care professionals, the most recent nationally syndicated prescription audit for the week ended April 22, 2016, indicates that Praluent captured approximately 50% of new prescriptions in the class. 
Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict management utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork and documentation that the pharmacy benefit managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with PCSK9 inhibitor have not had their prescriptions filled. Frustrated by this process, health care professionals are limiting the prescriptions to the sickest of patients, a prescription volume for the PCSK9 inhibitor class is limited. 
We're focusing our efforts in improving the prescription process through the payers and specialty pharmacies. We're also working with physicians offices to ensure that the prescription process is better understood on a pair by pair basis. 
Over the last several weeks, we've seen 2 payers loosen their utilization management criteria, removing a requirement for prior therapy. 
ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data is positive will be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent. 
Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. 
Outside the United States, it remains a difficult reimbursement market with some countries awaiting outcomes data.
We submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin 6 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. 
We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Copromotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. 
We're excited about the potential U.S. launch for sarilumab. Given the essential role of interleukin 6 in the inflammation contributed to the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and more importantly, disabling joint destruction, we believe that IL-6 inhibitors should be used early following tumor necrosis factor or TNF inhibitor failure. 
Recently issued U.S. and European guidelines support the use of IL-6 inhibitor class in earlier lines of treatment. This is particularly relevant for those patients who cannot take combination therapies with methotrexate. 
With multiple players competing in the anti-IL-6 market place, this should contribute to improved physician awareness and understanding of the inadequacy of TNF inhibitor cycling and the need for early IL-6 inhibitor treatment. 
Subcutaneously administered sarilumab has strong clinical data in terms of improved signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and prevention of bone damage in methotrexate in inadequate responders. 
Similar improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA have been reported in the TNF inhibitor in adequate responder population. 
We continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and 13 inhibitor, which we expect in 2017. There are approximately 1.6 million patients with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the United States. We've been co-promoting dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."
33715,331187536,973634,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, good morning to everyone who has joined us today.

In the first quarter 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 11% to $2.57 versus first quarter of 2016 and non-GAAP net income of $293 million decreased 13% versus first quarter of 2015. 
Regeneron's 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and includes an adjustment for income taxes.  A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represent year-over-year growth of 38% over the first quarter of 2015. 
Net product sales were $784 million in the first quarter 2016 compared to $545 million in the first quarter of 2015. EYLEA net product sales into United States were $781 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $541 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents an increase of 44%. 
Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was an increase of 5%. During the first quarter 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the fourth quarter 2015 but continues to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range. 
As Len mentioned, we are updating our full year 2016 U.S. EYLEA guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25% from the previously provided guidance of approximately 20% growth. 
Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were $419 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $292 million in the first quarter 2015, representing a 44% increase in a reported basis. 
On an operational basis, our constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 48%. 
Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer. 
In the first quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $146 million from our share net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $180 million. I also like to take this moment to highlight our recently expanded collaboration with Bayer, following our agreement to jointly develop the co-formulation of our antibody to Ang2 in EYLEA. 
In connection with this agreement, Bayer made a $50 million upfront payment to us which was a receivable at March 31, 2016, and Regeneron has the potential to earn up to $80 million in development milestones. 
The $50 million upfront payment has been deferred and will be recognized over the estimated performance period. Similar to our EYLEA agreement, Regeneron has exclusive commercial rights within the U.S. and will retain all of the profits from any U.S. sales. 
Finally, a reminder for the EYLEA franchise. The second quarter of 2016 will be the final quarter in which we incur the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. In fact, I'm pleased to announce that this royalty will officially end in 2 more days.
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $220 million for the first quarter of '16. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursements of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercial related expenses and our share of profits and losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. 
In the first quarter of 2016, our share of the collaborations losses in connection with commercial with antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $99 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. 
Netted within the collaboration losses where the global sales of Praluent has recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $13 million for the first quarter 2016. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $392 million for the first quarter. Our unreimburse R&D expense, which is calculated as total GAAP R&D, expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense was $164 million for the first 3 months of 2016. 
Our press release includes all the information that's required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. 
For 2016, we like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in a range of $875 million to $950 million. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $230 million for the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of $925 million and $1 billion. 
Before I move on from our operating expenses, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the new guidance component we announced this morning. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external cost in connection with preparing to commercialize, are commercializing, as applicable, Praluent and sarilumab, effective in the first quarter 2016, dupilumab. This is the line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in Table 4 of our press release. 
Going forward, we believe that providing guidance for this number will help modeling the Sanofi collaboration revenue line item. 
For the first quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses was $73 million, and we expect this expense in 2016 to be in the range $320 million and $370 million. 
Turning now to our non-GAAP tax adjustment. Cash tax, as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for this quarter, continues to be lower than our GAAP effective tax rate, primarily due to the tax impact of noncash share-based compensation. 
On a non-GAAP basis, cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 38%. 
For 2016, our guidance for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax income remains at 35% to 45%. As previously reported, this includes a onetime tax of approximately $222 million related to the Sanofi immuno-oncology agreement. 
I'd also like to reiterate that the non-GAAP tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment will be spread equally throughout 2016. 
Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2016 were $104 million. Given our latest review of capital expenditures, we are tightening and lowering our full year 2016 capital expenditures guidance to a range of $550 million to $625 million from $580 million to $680 million. 
These expenditures continue to build on our manufacturing expansions in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Ireland as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. 
We ended the first quarter of 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $1.4 billion. As we previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt.  In the first quarter of 2016, we paid $242 million to reduce these outstanding warrants. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would briefly like to highlight certain financial companies of the recent collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics. 
The April 2016 agreement grants Regeneron access to Intellia's CRISPR technology platform as well as the right to discover and develop up to 10 targets on an exclusive basis over the course of the 6-year agreement. 
In return, we paid a $75 million upfront payment to Intellia, which we anticipate recording as R&D expense in the second quarter of 2016, but plan to exclude from non-GAAP net income. The agreement also requires Regeneron's to purchase up to $50 million of Intellia's shares contingent upon Intellia consummating its initial public offering. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Michael."

In addition, the safety profile was also very comforting. And we reported extensively and it really does suggest that it's going to have a very important benefit risk profile for patients. I think that basically for atopic dermatitis, it really means that it's all green light and all speed ahead. And that we're really excited that we can really bring forward, as the FDA has designated, a breakthrough therapy for these patients need. As you know, we also have a pivotal study in asthma, and that's already been read out. And we're in the midst of our first base through, which is now our second confirmatory study in that indication as well. So Dupilumab is a very, very exciting program.

For example, in the case of the retinal space, you could lead to physicians being required simply by the economics that are in place to force them to use an off label repackaged bevacizumab, which at least in the Protocol T trial was shown in DME not to be as effective as the other therapies. They could be forced to use this for economic reasons. We see that a number of manufacturers as well as a number of congressmen and patient advocacy groups recognize that you have to preserve physician choice and so there will be a number of complaints and whether it's going to the Congress, including our own."

The factors to consider obviously is that you're already always obviously see the PBM taking a notice of this. I saw this in somebody's report that this is the next big class that they're worried about. There are a lot of patients out there that might fit our label assuming we get the label. But I'm sure they're going to be -- there's going to be utilization management, make sure the topical steroids or whatever that they really have the right diagnosis, et cetera, et cetera. Whether there would be ""warehousing of patients"", people lining up to get it, it's just really impossible for us to tell. But I would suspect that this would be one of those launches that would be patient-driven that -- as people get on the drug if the results in the real world or anywhere is close to the results we've seen in our Phase III trials so far, I'm sure that patient drive would be tremendous because this is a terrible disease that people have been suffering with for decades. Adults now have it without anything at all new to really help to make a difference. And if you look at -- whether you measure this by quality of life metrics, the increase risk of suicide, just the terrible burden that this puts in patients, we're optimistic that this drug can make a difference for them. So we're hopeful for a good launch. But how that -- the actual ramp and whether it takes us a while to get it going and what the coverage looks like and all that, it's just too early to tell."

Our feeling is that, as George said in his talk, is that we did something in which we think is pretty important, which is we did an extensive and detailed screening of patients with x-rays and MRIs before they were ever exposed to drug. And that demonstrated that some of these things that people are concerned about might be somewhat induced by drugs. But really fairly prevalent in the population whether they be insufficiency fractures or whether they be osteoarthritis and so on. So I think that that was important. And I do think that the FDA has come around to thinking that this had to be looked at carefully. And that's what we're doing. And the right patients have to be studied, and that's also what we're doing. And they also have had concerns about whether or not any one of these drugs individually or as a class could affect on sympathetic nerves and sympathetic nervous system function. We also looked at that pretty well and we have more to tell you about that in upcoming meetings. But we didn't see any evidence at all. So that so far, as things look reasonable. But, I mean, as George said, it is a small study and we're underpowered to pick up very small increases in some of these things. And that's why we're going to study thousands and thousands of patients in our Phase III program."

And this is why we did this, as Len said, this extensive imaging of both the index joints but also non-index joints to see whether overall, the skeleton was really changing. And as we've already said, the thing that was very gratifying was that unfortunately, for these patients suffering from this important problem, there is it already significant skeletal pathology at baseline. These patients have these so-called sub sufficiency fraction. You could even see undiagnosed osteo necrosis in patients and so forth. And these events, both in the index and non-index joints, were not dramatically increased by treating with NGF. And 1 year for example would that be these subchondral efficiency fractures may be happening much more frequently with drug and eventually leading to much higher incidences of events down the line. And so it's very comforting not to see this. That said, there remain, as with any drug, and certainly with the drug this active, they will continue to be a risk associated with treatment. But one has to balance that would all the benefits that could be provided. Pain is a very serious problem for a lot of people, especially people suffering from osteoarthritis. And the options, obviously, as you know, are quite limiting with no new action drugs added to this field for decades. And so the possibility and the opportunity and new mechanism action subclass that might have different profiles. And also, different risk profile as compared to, for example, opioids and [indiscernible] and other drugs with serious risks. We think it can offer an important option for patients."

This is a major advantage to elderly patients who can't get into the physician's office on a regular basis. And so they are not therapeutically equivalent. EYLEA has longer durability of effect. I would also point out there are data in a subset of patients in the VIEW studies that indicate that there are patients who are more refractory to anti-VEGF  therapies, especially those who received prior anti-VEGF  therapies who may need more anti-VEGF  treatment and what we're seeing in those treatments, we're able to dry them up better with EYLEA than with Lucent."

And I think that we all have to really consider that maybe, and I hate to say it because some people are going to say, hey, don't challenge the physicians here. But I think the physicians here, and we understand the limitations of the real world and practice, doing a huge disservice to patients. In terms of the systematic under treatment that is probably occurring in this field, there's an enormous drive to try to get patients less trips to the office, less injections. And you're probably seen the release of recent data with long, 4 or 5-year follow on. And after you take the patients over the more controlled phases of the study, where they're getting, in general, in most studies, monthly treatment of very carefully monitored treatment, they essentially lose almost all their vision gain over this later years of 4- and 5-year follow-ups. And we believe that the data and evidence suggest that this is really due to systematic under treatment, patients getting less and less treatment, particularly in that setting. If you want to deliver the best care to patients, you should be delivering the best agents that has the longest duration of action. And we think that the only agent that's really demonstrated that convincingly is EYLEA. And so I think to save patients missions, you saw the long-term trials. Patients are losing vision. Physicians are not doing the right things by their patients. They're systematically under treating and particularly in those setting, they should be getting the best drug that protects patients against this vision loss. And it will be a disservice if, in fact, incentives and so forth are driven to the use of agent which will cause patients -- think about it, your patient, who can't drive, your patient who can't read, you're now given a drug all of a sudden, you gain 2, 3 lines of vision. That changes the world literally for you. Okay. You could do things you can't do before. And now, we developed a system that allows you to lose that, I think we have to think about how we want to practice medicine in this country if we create a situation that allows that."

We've seen this, for example, in the statins class where as more and more statins become more available, they grew the market. We believe that this is the opportunity for this class that we can educate physicians more. One, as I said earlier, on the central role of IL-6, in both the signs and symptoms of RA but as well as in joint destruction, which we feel is very important. Physicians need to understand they shouldn't stay with the TNF innovator, which over time, each additional TNF inhibitor does not deliver the efficacy that they receive with the first TNF inhibitor. So there's a benefit of moving to a new class, an IL-6 really does have a central role, both in symptoms as well as bone destruction."

It also doesn't make sense to just continue patients cycling on TNF if there is an alternative. It can deliver them better symptomatic relief. And so we think there's an enormous opportunity for this class. And importantly, in this class, and as Bob said, the most -- one of the most important things that I said it patients and physicians are concerned about is irreversible bone loss. That's one thing that you can't get back. And that's one thing that's left that in this field. And as you know, a tumor is now growing through a subcutaneous formulation. And if you look in the label, there's less, according to the subcutaneous formulation that's used there in terms of innovation of the irreversible bone loss, there's less than 50% inhibition by the subcutaneous formulation in terms of the bone loss. If you look at our study, we offered 2 doses. And if they both get approved, our higher subcutaneous dose gives greater than 90% inhibition of irreversible bone loss. So as Bob said, these are not identical agents. This is not a me to. This important differences. And there is an important opportunity to do better by patients in terms of the monotherapy settings and in terms of not just cycling through drugs that maybe aren't working for the patients and putting them in a different mechanism action drug."

It's an important thing for the class. The patients who need drug have to get an opportunity to have access to it."

But what I can say, as I did earlier, what they did is removed a trial period of 12-plus weeks of [indiscernible] after maximally tolerated statin therapy for the utilization management criteria. That was setting up a delay in access to PCSK9 inhibition. The physicians were having to put them [indiscernible] and then wait and it was causing a backlog for the doctors. So that has been removed with 2 of the payers. In terms of the improvement of a number of people going through the hub, I think what I could say is, one, as Len said, payers have come on board now. So especially Medicare patients now are getting access to therapy. I think the other thing is that the physicians as well as the specialty pharmacies are better understanding how to make the prescription process better. That's not -- it's not easy right now. We continue to work on improving it, but at least it has gotten better for some patients."

The first quarter of 2016 was busy, and we have a lot to share with you today. Our strategy remains, as always, to focus our unique capabilities in drug discovery and development on bringing important new medicines to patients in need. 
George will provide you with some of the recent exciting progress we have made in that regard. From a high-level perspective, we had positive data readouts from 3 Phase III programs, Praluent for lowering LDL cholesterol in the apheresis setting, sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis and dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We also reported positive data from a Phase II/III study in osteoarthritis for fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain. And we continue to make good progress with our earlier-stage assets and discovery efforts. 
Turning to our marketed products. EYLEA has continued to deliver solid growth, and we are able to increase our guidance for the year. Praluent's launch is still ongoing, and it's obviously faced a difficult reimbursement environment. While we fully understand payers' efforts to control costs, we do have serious concerns that appropriate patients are having undue difficulty getting approval for Praluent. We continue to be optimistic over the long term that Praluent will provide an important cholesterol-lowering option to many patients.  Bob Terifay will provide more detail on EYLEA and Praluent. Following that, Bob Landry will provide more detail on financial results for the first quarter of 2016 as well as updated guidance. 
Finally, we are approaching the potential approval and launch of 2 new products. Sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is under review with the FDA. Dupilumab is being developed for a number of indications, and we are targeting completion of our rolling BLA submission for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016. 
With that, let me turn the call over to George."

Let me begin with an update on EYLEA. In addition to the Phase II co-formulated combinations of EYLEA with rinucumab, an antibody to the PDGF receptor, and Nesvacumab, an antibody to angiopoietin-2, we have also commenced Panorama, a Phase III study of EYLEA in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without diabetic macular edema or DME, which will evaluate whether EYLEA can improve the retinopathy. 
Additionally, the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network or the DRCR initiated a related clinical study called Protocol-W to evaluate the potential of anti-VEGF therapy in preventing worsening of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This study will explore every 16-week dosing of EYLEA, which the only anti-VEGF treatment being investigated in this study. 
In February, we received 2 new results from Protocol T, a government-sponsored study in patients with DME, comparing the safety and efficacy of EYLEA versus Lucentis and Avastin. The primary efficacy endpoint for that study was at 1 year, which showed significantly better vision gain with EYLEA than either with Lucentis or Avastin. The second year of the study was not designed to rigorously compare the anti-VEGF agents as the second year results were increasingly confounded by variable dosing frequencies as well as additional or adjunctive therapies such as laser. 
Along these lines, it is important to point out there was a greater number of injections and substantially more use of laser associated with Avastin treatment in the overall population. Despite this, when compared with Avastin, EYLEA demonstrated a statistically significant 5-letter gain or an entire line of vision in patients with poor vision at baseline. At 2 years, the rate of most ocular adverse events were similar across the 3 study groups. There was, however, statistically significant lower rate of arterial thromboembolic events , including nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and vascular death in the EYLEA group compared with the ranibizumab group. 
Our Praluent launch is underway, and Bob Terifay will provide further details on the commercial front. Our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study is ongoing. The data monitoring committee for this study has completed the first interim analysis, with 50% of the total events had accrued (sic) [occurred] based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety data, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended the study continue with no changes. We remain blinded to the actual results of this analysis, and the study is ongoing. A second interim analysis for futility as well as overwhelming efficacy could potentially occur in the second half of 2016 when 75% of the targeted primary events have occurred. 
In March, we reported positive data from the Phase III ODYSSEY ESCAPE study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who require chronic weekly or biweekly apheresis. Apheresis is an invasive, expensive and time-consuming therapy given to the patients with the highest cholesterol levels and the greatest need. Our study showed that Praluent reduced the need for apheresis by 75% compared to placebo, and 63% of Praluent patients no longer required apheresis compared to 0% of the patients in the placebo arm. 
Praluent is the only PCSK9 inhibitor that has been studied in an apheresis setting, which represents some of the most severe hypercholesterolemic patients. The adverse events that occurred more frequently in the Praluent-treated patients were injection site reactions and myalgia. We expect our supplemental BLA for the once-monthly dosing regimen of Praluent to be filed in the second quarter, which, if approved, will expand our dosing flexibility options. 
Turning now to our late-stage pipeline, where we had some very positive news. I'd like to start with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody which is under review by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In March, we announced positive data from the Phase III MONARCH study of sarilumab versus Humira, which demonstrated that sarilumab was superior to Humira in the monotherapy setting in improving signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 24 weeks. This was the first head-to-head study in the monotherapy setting using a subcutaneously administered IL-6 inhibitor. The use of IL-6 inhibition in the monotherapy setting has been growing, and these data provide us with a competitive product profile. Data from the MONARCH study will be included in our European submission that is expected midyear of 2016. 
Turning now to dupilumab, our IL-4/13 blocking antibody, where we recently announced positive top line data from the Solo-1 and Solo-2 monotherapy Phase III studies in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. These were the first Phase III studies of a systemic therapy to demonstrate a significant improvement in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and confirm the positive data we have seen in our Phase IIb study. Overall, the studies demonstrate significant improvements in measures of disease severity, skin clearing, itching, quality of life and mental health. We expect to present detailed data from the Solo studies in an upcoming medical conference. 
We continue to expect top line data from the Phase III CHRONOS study, which explores dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, in the second quarter of 2016. We expect to complete the rolling BLA submission for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016. We remind you that dupilumab has received breakthrough designation from the FDA for this indication in adults. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated LIBERTY AD CAFE, a Phase III study of dupilumab to support our European submission. This study investigates dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or intolerant to or ineligible for systemic cyclosporine A treatment. In addition to the studies in the adult setting, we also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the atopic dermatitis indication in the pediatric population once we have data from the ongoing Phase II pediatric study that is now fully enrolled. We expect this Phase II data in the second half of the year. 
We're also investigating dupilumab in other indications, including asthma, where we are currently enrolling our 1,700-patient pivotal study. We're also advancing clinical development in indications such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. 
For fasinumab, our NGF antibody, earlier this week, we announced positive data from our Phase II/III study in osteoarthritis, which provides us with our first safety and efficacy data with our subcutaneous dosing regimen. This was the first completed study using an antibody to NGF that performs extensive imaging of knee, hip and shoulder joints at screening and throughout the trial. Interestingly, we found that  subchondral insufficiency fracture and even osteonecrosis were present in this population at screening. 
Further, our findings in patients following fasinumab treatment are consistent with prior data, suggesting that there may not be a substantial increase in rapidly progressing osteoarthritis when an NGF antibody is used in the monotherapy setting. That said, it's a relatively small trial, and we look forward to data from the much larger clinical studies that are underway. 
We have also seen some exciting developments in our earlier-stage programs. I'd like to spend a few minutes on 2 areas: our efforts in genetics and our recent collaboration in the arena of gene editing. In March, we published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine based on research that was conducted at the Regeneron Genetics Center or the RGC. The publication showed that inactivating mutations in a gene called angiopoeitin-like 4 were associated with a significantly reduced risk of coronary artery disease in humans. This is a great example that demonstrates how our efforts in the area of precision medicine can link genetic mutation information with real-world health outcomes to make actionable discoveries. 
Many of the findings from the RGC are already being used to inform Regeneron's robust and integrated R&D programs and give us the ability to incorporate large-scale sequencing into our discovery and pipeline approaches. It also demonstrates the advantages of our unique combination of technologies. Using our proprietary VelociGene Technology, we develop animal models that corroborate the human genetics findings. And we were able to use our VelocImmune platform to create a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of ANGPTL4 that reduce triglyceride levels in mice and nonhuman primates. 
We are also advancing a Phase II program of REGN1500, an antibody to ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 is thought to play a central role in lipoprotein metabolism, and our genetic data show that patients with homozygous inactivating mutations of this gene report greater than 50% lower levels of LDL, HDL and triglycerides. Initial data from a small study in homozygous patients will be presented at the upcoming Annual meeting of the National Lipid Association. 
We recently entered into collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics with the aim of advancing CRISPR/Cas gene editing technology into in vivo therapeutic development. This was a logical fit for us given our long-standing expertise on genetic engineering, combined with our industry-leading human genetics research with the RGC, which is already identifying important genetic targets. We believe that combining these capabilities with Intellia's technology holds real promise for serious diseases that have been historically difficult to address and expands our ability to help patients where antibody-based therapies may not be the optimal approach. 
We continue to make progress in immuno-oncology. REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody program, has entered a Phase II potential registrational study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We'll be presenting some preliminary Phase I data at the upcoming annual ASCO conference. 
With that, I would like to turn over the call to Bob Terifay."

During the first quarter of 2016, we continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We've made substantial progress in securing a",972,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of 2016, we continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We've made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent or alirocumab among U.S. payers. In addition, the European launch of Praluent continues to progress. 
We also are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next 12 to 15 months. 
Starting with EYLEA. First quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter were $781 million. Net ex-U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter were $419 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to see quarter-over-quarter increases in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market, both in terms of dollar sales as well as injections as reported by 207 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. 
We're encouraged about Q2 growth opportunities for EYLEA based upon the recently reported 2-year results of the independently conducted Protocol T comparative study of EYLEA versus ranibizumab versus bevacizumab in patients with diabetic macular edema. However, I should point out that we are closely monitoring pressures on EYLEA sales as the year progresses. There are currently a series of proposals for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B buy-and-bill drugs, which could lead towards physicians favoring the use of off-label, repackaged bevacizumab or, in large-volume retinal practices, ranibizumab due to the provision of direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer. 
Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. Therefore, we and scores of other manufacturers, patient ethics groups and industry associations will or have already submitted objections to CMS and Congress, recommending the physicians' choice be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce health care costs should be explored. 
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the first quarter were $13 million, which understates the actual position of patient demand. As a reminder, over the last several quarters, we anticipated that it would take some time for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. I'm pleased to tell you that as of April 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and 91% of Medicare-insured  lives have access to Praluent. We've recently seen an improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled. 
Highlighting our improved coverage as well as our share of voice among health care professionals, the most recent nationally syndicated prescription audit for the week ended April 22, 2016, indicates that Praluent captured approximately 50% of new prescriptions in the class.  Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict management -- utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork and documentation that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with a PS -- PCSK9 inhibitor have not had their prescriptions filled. Frustrated by this process, health care professionals are limiting the prescriptions to the sickest of patients. The prescription volume for the PCSK9 inhibitor class is limited. 
We're focusing our efforts on improving the prescription process through the payers and specialty pharmacies. We're also working with physicians' offices to ensure that the prescription process is better understood on a payer-by-payer basis. Over the last several weeks, we've seen 2 payers loosen their utilization management criteria, removing the requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, will be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent. 
Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Outside the United States, it remains a difficult reimbursement market, with some countries awaiting OUTCOMES data. 
We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin 6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. 
We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi-Genzyme in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We're excited about the potential U.S. launch for sarilumab. Given the central role of interleukin 6 in the inflammation contributed (sic) [attributed] to the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and, more importantly, disabling joint destruction, we believe that IL-6 inhibitors should be used early following tumor necrosis factor or TNF inhibitor failure. 
Recently issued U.S. and European guidelines support the use of IL-6 inhibitor class in earlier lines of treatments, and this is particularly relevant for those patients who cannot take combination therapies with methotrexate. With multiple players competing in the anti-IL-6 marketplace, this should contribute to improved physician awareness and understanding of the inadequacy of TNF inhibitor cycling and the need for early IL-6 inhibitor treatment. Subcutaneously administered sarilumab has strong clinical data in terms of the improved signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and prevention of bone damage in methotrexate-inadequate responders. Similar improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA have been reported in TNF inhibitor-inadequate responder population. 
We continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and 13 inhibitor, which we expect in 2017. There are approximately 1.6 million patients with inadequately controlled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the United States. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."
33715,331187536,974052,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. In the first quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 11% to $2.57 versus first quarter of 2015 and non-GAAP net income of $293 million decreased 13% versus first",1221,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. 
In the first quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 11% to $2.57 versus first quarter of 2015 and non-GAAP net income of $293 million decreased 13% versus first quarter of 2015.  Regeneron's 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and includes an adjustment for income taxes. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 38% over the first quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $784 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $545 million in the first quarter of 2015. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $781 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $541 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents an increase of 44%. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was an increase of 5%. 
During the first quarter 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the fourth quarter 2015, but continues to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range. As Len mentioned, we are updating our full year 2016 U.S. EYLEA guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25% from the previously provided guidance of approximately 20% growth. 
Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were $419 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $292 million in the first quarter 2015, representing a 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant-currency basis, sales increased approximately 48%. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer. In the first quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $146 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $180 million. 
I'd also like to take this moment to highlight our recently expanded collaboration with Bayer, following our agreement to jointly develop the co-formulation of our antibody to ANG2 and EYLEA. In connection with this agreement, Bayer made a $50 million upfront payment to us, which was a receivable at March 31, 2016, and Regeneron has the potential to earn up to $80 million in development milestones. The $50 million upfront payment has been deferred and will be recognized over the estimated performance period. Similar to our EYLEA agreement, Regeneron has exclusive commercial rights within the U.S. and will retain all of the profits from any U.S. sales. 
Finally, a reminder for the EYLEA franchise. The second quarter of 2016 will be the final quarter in which we incur the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. In fact, I'm pleased to announce that this royalty will officially end in 2 more days.
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $220 million for the first quarter of '16. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursements of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the first quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization with antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $99 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. 
Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $13 million for the first quarter 2016. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $392 million for the first quarter. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense, was $164 million for the first 3 months of 2016. Our press release includes all the information that's required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2016, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $875 million to $950 million. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $230 million for the first quarter 2016. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of $925 million and $1 billion. 
Before I move on from our operating expenses, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the new guidance component we announced this morning, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, Praluent, sarilumab and, effective in the first quarter of 2016, dupilumab. This is a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in Table 4 of our press release. Going forward, we believe that providing guidance for this number will help in modeling the Sanofi collaboration revenue line item. For the first quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $73 million, and we expect this expense in 2016 to be in the range $320 million and $370 million. 
Turning now to our non-GAAP tax adjustment. Cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for this quarter continues to be lower than our GAAP effective tax rate, primarily due to the tax impact of noncash share-based compensation. On a non-GAAP basis, cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 38%. 
For 2016, our guidance for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax income remains at 35% to 45%. As previously reported, this includes a onetime tax of approximately $222 million related to the Sanofi immuno-oncology agreement. I'd also like to reiterate that the non-GAAP tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment will be spread equally throughout 2016. 
Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2016 were $104 million. Given our latest review of capital expenditures, we are tightening and lowering our full year 2016 capital expenditures guidance to a range of $550 million to $625 million from $580 million to $680 million. These expenditures continue to build on our manufacturing expansions in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. 
We ended the first quarter of 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $1.4 billion. As we previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt.  In the first quarter of 2016, we paid $242 million to reduce these outstanding warrants. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would briefly like to highlight certain financial components of the recent collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics. The April 2016 agreement grants Regeneron access to Intellia's CRISPR technology platform as well as the right to discover and develop up to 10 targets on an exclusive basis over the course of the 6-year agreement. In return, we paid a $75 million upfront payment to Intellia, which we anticipate recording as R&D expense in the second quarter of 2016, but plan to exclude from non-GAAP net income. The agreement also requires Regeneron to purchase up to $50 million of Intellia's shares, contingent upon Intellia consummating its initial public offering. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael."

I'll take the dupilumab question. I guess the most important thing that we learned from the 2 Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis was, number one, that we confirmed the impressive efficacy and the important benefit to patients in essentially every single efficacy readout that we explored. So obviously, that's very gratifying and comforting when one actually sees data that is as promising as your earlier data and suggests it can really make an important difference to moderate to severe patients who really need new therapies to attack their disease. In addition, the safety profile was also very comforting. And we reported extensively and it really does suggest that it's going to have a very important benefit/risk profile for patients. I think that, basically, for atopic dermatitis, it really means that it's all greenlights and all speed ahead and that we're really excited that we could be really bringing forward, as the FDA has designated, a breakthrough therapy for these patients' need. As you know, we also have a pivotal study in asthma, and that's already been read out. And we're in the midst of our first breakthrough, which is now our second confirmatory study in that indication as well. So dupilumab is a very, very exciting program. And as I already told you about today, I told you that in terms of the atopic dermatitis population, we're also moving to the pediatric population there as well, which is also an important unmet need area."

However, the approach that has been proposed by Medicare Part B would limit options for physicians and patients to give appropriate therapies to patients who need them. For example, in the case of the retinal space, you could lead to physicians being required simply by the economics that are in place to force them to use an off-label repackaged bevacizumab, which, at least in the Protocol 3 -- T trial, was shown in DME not to be as effective as the other therapies. They could be forced to use this for economic reasons. We see that a number of manufacturers as well as a number of congressmen and patient advocacy groups recognize that you have to preserve physician choice, and so there will be a number of complaints and letters going into the Congress, including our own."

The factors to consider obviously is that you're already obviously seeing the PBMs taking a notice of this. I saw this in somebody's report, that this is the next big class that they're worried about. There are a lot of patients out there that might fit our label, assuming we get the label. But I'm sure they're going to be -- there's going to be utilization management, make sure they've tried the topical steroids or whatever, that they really have the right diagnosis, et cetera, et cetera. Now whether there will be ""warehousing of patients"", people lining up to get it, it's just really impossible for us to tell. But I would suspect that this would be one of those launches that will be patient-driven. That -- as people get on the drug, if the results in the real world or anywhere is close to the results we've seen in our Phase III trials so far, I'm sure that, that patient drive will be tremendous because this is a terrible disease that people have been suffering with for decades. Adults now have it without anything at all new to really help them and make a difference. And if you look at -- whether you measure this by quality-of-life metrics, the increased risk of suicide, just the terrible burden that this puts on patients, we're optimistic that this drug can make a difference for them. So we're hopeful for a good launch. But how that -- the actual ramp and whether it takes us a while to get it going and what the coverage looks like and all that, just too early to tell."

Well, maybe I'll make a brief comment. And if George has anything to add, obviously, he's welcome. The -- our feeling is that -- as George said in his talk, is that we did something which we think was pretty important, which is we did an extensive and detailed screening of patients with x-rays and MRIs before they were ever exposed to drug. And that demonstrated that some of these things that people were concerned about might be somewhat induced by drugs, were really fairly prevalent in the population, whether they be insufficiency fractures or whether they be osteonecrosis and so on. So I think that, that was important. And I do think that the FDA has come around to thinking that this has to be looked at carefully, and we -- and that's what we're doing. And the right patients have to be studied, and that's also what we're doing. They also have had concerns about whether or not any one of these drugs individually or as a class could have effect on sympathetic nerves and sympathetic nervous system function. We also looked at that pretty well, and we'll have more to tell you about that in upcoming meetings. But we didn't see any evidence at all so that, so far, things look reasonable. But as -- I think as George said, it's a small study, and we're underpowered to pick up very small increases in some of these things. And that's why we're going to study thousands and thousands of patients in our Phase III program."

And to add to that, I think that the -- one of the biggest underlying fears for this class, certainly by outside people but also by ourselves, was that the very small increase in certain arthropathy events, certain joint pathologies that was seen, particularly in combination with NSAIDs but also a small increase even in monotherapy might actually be reflecting a much bigger, somewhat invisible problem that there was a bigger, destructive process that would then be seen over longer periods in time and so forth. And this is why we did this -- as Len said, this extensive imaging of both the index joints but also non-index joints to see whether, overall, the skeleton was really changing. And as we've already said, the thing that was very gratifying was that, unfortunately, for these patients suffering from this important problem, there is already significant skeletal pathology at baseline. These patients have these so-called subchondral insufficiency fractures, and you could even see undiagnosed osteonecrosis in these patients and so forth. And these events, both in the index and the non-index joints, were not dramatically increased by treating with NGF. And one fear, for example, was that these asymptomatic subchondral insufficiency fractures may be happening much more frequently with drug and then eventually leading to much higher incidences of events down the line. And so it's very comforting not to see this. That said, there remain -- as with any drug and, certainly, with a drug this active, there will continue to be risks associated with treatment. But one has to balance that with all the benefits that could be provided. Pain is a very serious problem for a lot of people, especially people suffering from osteoarthritis. And the options, obviously, as you know, are quite limiting with no new mechanism-of-action drugs added to this field for decades. And so the possibility and the opportunity that a new mechanism-of-action class that might have different profile and also different risk profile as compared to, for example, opiates and NSAIDs and other drugs with serious risks, we think can offer an important option for patients."

And what we saw is very similar results with the EYLEA every 8-week dosing to the Lucentis every 4-week dosing. This is a major advantage to elderly patients who can't get into the physician's office on a regular basis. And so they are not therapeutically equivalent. EYLEA has a longer durability of effect. I would also point out, there are data in a subset of patients in the VIEW studies that indicates that there are patients who are more refractory to anti-VEGF therapy, especially those who've received prior anti-VEGF therapies who may need more anti-VEGF treatment. And what we're seeing in those patients, we're able to dry them up better with EYLEA than with Lucentis."

And I think that we all have to really consider that maybe -- and I hate to say it because some people are going to say, ""Hey, don't challenge the physicians here."" But I think the physicians here, and we understand the limitations of the real world and practice, are doing a huge disservice to patients, in terms of the systematic under-treatment that is probably occurring in this field. There's an enormous drive to try to get patients less trips to the office, less injections. And you've probably seen the release of recent data with long 4- or 5-year follow-on. And after you take the patients over the more controlled phases of the study, where they're getting, in general, in most studies, monthly treatment, a very carefully monitored treatment, they essentially lose almost all their vision gain over these later years of 4- and 5-year follow-ups. And we believe that the data and the evidence suggest that this is really due to systematic under-treatment, patients getting less and less treatment. And particularly in that setting, if you want to deliver the best care to patients, you should be delivering the best agent that has the longest duration of action, and we think that the only agent that's really demonstrated that convincingly is EYLEA. And so I think to save patients' visions -- you saw the long-term trials. Patients are losing visions. Physicians are not doing the right things by their patients. They're systematically under-treating. And particularly in those setting, they should be getting the best drug that protects patients against this vision loss. And it would be a disservice if, in fact, incentives and so forth are driven to the use of an inferior agent, which will cause patients -- think about it. You're a patient who can't drive, you're a patient who can't read, you're now given a drug. All of a sudden, you gain 2, 3 lines of vision. That changes the world literally for you. Okay. You could do things you can't do before. And now we developed a system that allows you to lose that. I think that we have to think about how we want to practice medicine in this country if we create a situation that allows that."

It is always more beneficial -- we've seen this, for example, in the statin class, where as more and more statins became available, they grew the market. We believe that this is the opportunity for this class, that we can educate physicians more, one, as I said earlier, on the central role of IL-6 in both the signs and symptoms of RA but as well as in joint destruction, which we feel is very important. Physicians need to understand they shouldn't stay with a TNF inhibitor, which, over time, each additional TNF inhibitor does not deliver the efficacy that they received with the first TNF inhibitor. So there's a benefit of moving to a new class, and IL-6 really does have a central role both in symptoms as well as bone destruction."

And there are many people, particularly women, who don't  like being on the product, and there seems to be movement towards monotherapy. And remember, methotrexate -- some have argued that for some drugs methotrexate provides the immunosuppression for the biologics so that any immune-related, if you will, blockade of effect doesn't appear as quickly. Suffice it to say, we -- and maybe George can comment on that more.

I think it's important to just highlight a few things because, once again, it all comes down to the patients and doing the best by the patients. And I think as Bob and Len already mentioned, if you look at the signs, it doesn't necessarily make sense to start all patients, particularly patients in monotherapy settings, with the TNF. And that may be a historical accident. It also doesn't make sense to just continue patients cycling on TNF if there is an alternative that can deliver them better symptomatic relief. And so we think that there's enormous opportunity for this class. And importantly, in this class, and as Bob said, the most -- one of the most important things that I think that patients and physicians are concerned about is irreversible bone loss. That's one thing that you can't get back, and that's one thing that's looked at in this field. And as you know, Actemra is now growing through a subcutaneous formulation. And if you look in the label, there's less -- according to the subcutaneous formulation that's used there in terms of the inhibition of the irreversible bone loss, there's less than 50% inhibition by the subcutaneous formulation in terms of Actemra in terms of the irreversible bone loss. If you look at our study, we offer 2 doses. And if they both get approved, our higher subcutaneous dose gives greater than 90% inhibition of irreversible bone loss. So as Bob said, these are not identical agents. This is not a me-too. There's important differences, and there's an important opportunity to do better by patients in terms of the monotherapy setting and in terms of not just cycling through drugs that maybe aren't working for the patients and putting them on a different mechanism-of-action drug."

But what I can say, as I did earlier, what they did is removed a trial period of 12-plus weeks of Zetia after maximally tolerated statin therapy from their the utilization management criteria. That was setting up a delay in access to PCSK9 inhibition. The physicians were having to put them on Zetia and then wait, and it was causing a real backlog for the doctors. So that has been removed by 2 of the payers. In terms of the improvement of the number of people going through the hub, I think what I could say is, one, the -- as Len said, payers have come onboard now, and so especially Medicare patients now are getting access to therapy.

The first quarter of 2016 was busy, and we have a lot to share with you today. Our strategy remains, as always, to focus our unique capabilities in drug discovery and development on bringing important new medicines to patients in need. 
George will provide you with some of the recent exciting progress we have made in that regard. From a high-level perspective, we had positive data readouts from 3 Phase III programs, Praluent for lowering LDL cholesterol in the apheresis setting, sarilumab in rheumatoid arthritis and dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We also reported positive data from a Phase II/III study in osteoarthritis for fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain. And we continue to make good progress with our earlier-stage assets and discovery efforts. 
Turning to our marketed products. EYLEA has continued to deliver solid growth, and we are able to increase our guidance for the year. Praluent's launch is still ongoing, and it's obviously faced a difficult reimbursement environment. While we fully understand payers' efforts to control costs, we do have serious concerns that appropriate patients are having undue difficulty getting approval for Praluent. We continue to be optimistic over the long term that Praluent will provide an important cholesterol-lowering option to many patients.  Bob Terifay will provide more detail on EYLEA and Praluent. Following that, Bob Landry will provide more detail on financial results for the first quarter of 2016 as well as updated guidance. 
Finally, we are approaching the potential approval and launch of 2 new products. Sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is under review with the FDA. Dupilumab is being developed for a number of indications, and we are targeting completion of our rolling BLA submission for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016. 
With that, let me turn the call over to George."

Let me begin with an update on EYLEA. In addition to the Phase II co-formulated combinations of EYLEA with rinucumab, an antibody to the PDGF receptor, and Nesvacumab, an antibody to angiopoietin-2, we have also commenced Panorama, a Phase III study of EYLEA in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients without diabetic macular edema or DME, which will evaluate whether EYLEA can improve the retinopathy. 
Additionally, the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network or the DRCR initiated a related clinical study called Protocol-W to evaluate the potential of anti-VEGF therapy in preventing worsening of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This study will explore every 16-week dosing of EYLEA, which is the only anti-VEGF treatment being investigated in this study. 
In February, we received 2 new results from Protocol T, a government-sponsored study in patients with DME, comparing the safety and efficacy of EYLEA versus Lucentis and Avastin. The primary efficacy endpoint for that study was at 1 year, which showed significantly better vision gain with EYLEA than either with Lucentis or Avastin. The second year of the study was not designed to rigorously compare the anti-VEGF agents as the second year results were increasingly confounded by variable dosing frequencies as well as additional or adjunctive therapies such as laser. 
Along these lines, it is important to point out there was a greater number of injections and substantially more use of laser associated with Avastin treatment in the overall population. Despite this, when compared with Avastin, EYLEA demonstrated a statistically significant 5-letter gain or an entire line of vision in patients with poor vision at baseline. At 2 years, the rate of most ocular adverse events were similar across the 3 study groups. There was, however, statistically significant lower rate of arterial thromboembolic events , including nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction and vascular death in the EYLEA group compared with the ranibizumab group. 
Our Praluent launch is underway, and Bob Terifay will provide further details on the commercial front. Our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study is ongoing. The data monitoring committee for this study has completed the first interim analysis, with 50% of the total events had accrued (sic) [occurred] based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety data, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended the study continue with no changes. We remain blinded to the actual results of this analysis, and the study is ongoing. A second interim analysis for futility as well as overwhelming efficacy could potentially occur in the second half of 2016 when 75% of the targeted primary events have occurred. 
In March, we reported positive data from the Phase III ODYSSEY ESCAPE study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who require chronic weekly or biweekly apheresis. Apheresis is an invasive, expensive and time-consuming therapy given to the patients with the highest cholesterol levels and the greatest need. Our study showed that Praluent reduced the need for apheresis by 75% compared to placebo, and 63% of Praluent patients no longer required apheresis compared to 0% of the patients in the placebo arm. 
Praluent is the only PCSK9 inhibitor that has been studied in an apheresis setting, which represents some of the most severe hypercholesterolemic patients. The adverse events that occurred more frequently in the Praluent-treated patients were injection site reactions and myalgia. We expect our supplemental BLA for the once-monthly dosing regimen of Praluent to be filed in the second quarter, which, if approved, will expand our dosing flexibility options. 
Turning now to our late-stage pipeline, where we had some very positive news. I'd like to start with sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody which is under review by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In March, we announced positive data from the Phase III MONARCH study of sarilumab versus Humira, which demonstrated that sarilumab was superior to Humira in the monotherapy setting in improving signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis at 24 weeks. This was the first head-to-head study in the monotherapy setting using a subcutaneously administered IL-6 inhibitor. The use of IL-6 inhibition in the monotherapy setting has been growing, and these data provide us with a competitive product profile. Data from the MONARCH study will be included in our European submission that is expected midyear of 2016. 
Turning now to dupilumab, our IL-4/13 blocking antibody, where we recently announced positive top line data from the Solo-1 and Solo-2 monotherapy Phase III studies in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. These were the first Phase III studies of a systemic therapy to demonstrate a significant improvement in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and confirm the positive data we have seen in our Phase IIb study. Overall, the studies demonstrate significant improvements in measures of disease severity, skin clearing, itching, quality of life and mental health. We expect to present detailed data from the Solo studies in an upcoming medical conference. 
We continue to expect top line data from the Phase III CHRONOS study, which explores dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, in the second quarter of 2016. We expect to complete the rolling BLA submission for dupilumab in atopic dermatitis in the third quarter of 2016. We remind you that dupilumab has received breakthrough designation from the FDA for this indication in adults. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated LIBERTY AD CAFE, a Phase II study of dupilumab to support our European submission. This study investigates dupilumab with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or intolerant to or ineligible for systemic cyclosporine A treatment. In addition to the studies in the adult setting, we also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the atopic dermatitis indication in the pediatric population once we have data from the ongoing Phase II pediatric study that is now fully enrolled. We expect this Phase II data in the second half of the year. 
We're also investigating dupilumab in other indications, including asthma, where we are currently enrolling our 1,700-patient pivotal study. We're also advancing clinical development in indications such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. 
For fasinumab, our NGF antibody, earlier this week, we announced positive data from our Phase II/III study in osteoarthritis, which provides us with our first safety and efficacy data with our subcutaneous dosing regimen. This was the first completed study using an antibody to NGF that performs extensive imaging of knee, hip and shoulder joints at screening and throughout the trial. Interestingly, we found that  subchondral insufficiency fracture and even osteonecrosis were present in this population at screening. 
Further, our findings in patients following fasinumab treatment are consistent with prior data, suggesting that there may not be a substantial increase in rapidly progressing osteoarthritis when an NGF antibody is used in the monotherapy setting. That said, it's a relatively small trial, and we look forward to data from the much larger clinical studies that are underway. 
We have also seen some exciting developments in our earlier-stage programs. I'd like to spend a few minutes on 2 areas: our efforts in genetics and our recent collaboration in the arena of gene editing. In March, we published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine based on research that was conducted at the Regeneron Genetics Center or the RGC. The publication showed that inactivating mutations in a gene called angiopoeitin-like 4 were associated with a significantly reduced risk of coronary artery disease in humans. This is a great example that demonstrates how our efforts in the area of precision medicine can link genetic mutation information with real-world health outcomes to make actionable discoveries. 
Many of the findings from the RGC are already being used to inform Regeneron's robust and integrated R&D programs and give us the ability to incorporate large-scale sequencing into our discovery and pipeline approaches. It also demonstrates the advantages of our unique combination of technologies. Using our proprietary VelociGene Technology, we develop animal models that corroborate the human genetics findings. And we were able to use our VelocImmune platform to create a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of ANGPTL4 that reduce triglyceride levels in mice and nonhuman primates. 
We are also advancing a Phase II program of REGN1500, an antibody to ANGPTL3. ANGPTL3 is thought to play a central role in lipoprotein metabolism, and our genetic data show that patients with homozygous inactivating mutations of this gene report greater than 50% lower levels of LDL, HDL and triglycerides. Initial data from a small study in homozygous patients will be presented at the upcoming Annual meeting of the National Lipid Association. 
We recently entered into collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics with the aim of advancing CRISPR/Cas gene editing technology into in vivo therapeutic development. This was a logical fit for us given our long-standing expertise on genetic engineering, combined with our industry-leading human genetics research with the RGC, which is already identifying important genetic targets. We believe that combining these capabilities with Intellia's technology holds real promise for serious diseases that have been historically difficult to address and expands our ability to help patients where antibody-based therapies may not be the optimal approach. 
We continue to make progress in immuno-oncology. REGN2810, our PD-1 antibody program, has entered a Phase II potential registrational study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. We'll be presenting some preliminary Phase I data at the upcoming annual ASCO conference. 
With that, I would like to turn over the call to Bob Terifay."

During the first quarter of 2016, we continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We've made substantial progress in securing a",972,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of 2016, we continued to see strong sales growth for EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and the rest of the world. We've made substantial progress in securing access and reimbursement for Praluent or alirocumab among U.S. payers. In addition, the European launch of Praluent continues to progress. 
We also are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next 12 to 15 months. 
Starting with EYLEA. First quarter U.S. net sales grew 44% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter were $781 million. Net ex-U.S. EYLEA sales in the first quarter were $419 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to see quarter-over-quarter increases in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market, both in terms of dollar sales as well as injections as reported by 207 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. 
We're encouraged about future growth opportunities for EYLEA based upon the recently reported 2-year results of the independently conducted Protocol T comparative study of EYLEA versus ranibizumab versus bevacizumab in patients with diabetic macular edema. However, I should point out that we are closely monitoring pressures on EYLEA sales as the year progresses. There are currently a series of proposals for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B buy-and-bill drugs, which could lead towards physicians favoring the use of off-label, repackaged bevacizumab or, in large-volume retinal practices, ranibizumab due to the provision of direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer. 
Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. Therefore, we and scores of other manufacturers, patient ethics groups and industry associations will or have already submitted objections to CMS and Congress, recommending the physicians' choice be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce health care costs should be explored. 
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the first quarter were $13 million, which understates the actual position of patient demand. As a reminder, over the last several quarters, we anticipated that it would take some time for commercial and government payers to conduct formulary reviews, make reimbursement coverage decisions and begin to process patient claims. I'm pleased to tell you that as of April 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and 91% of Medicare-insured  lives have access to Praluent. We've recently seen an improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled. 
Highlighting our improved coverage as well as our share of voice among health care professionals, the most recent nationally syndicated prescription audit for the week ended April 22, 2016, indicates that Praluent captured approximately 50% of new prescriptions in the class.  Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict management -- utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork and documentation that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with a PS -- PCSK9 inhibitor have not had their prescriptions filled. Frustrated by this process, health care professionals are limiting the prescriptions to the sickest of patients. The prescription volume for the PCSK9 inhibitor class is limited. 
We're focusing our efforts on improving the prescription process through the payers and specialty pharmacies. We're also working with physicians' offices to ensure that the prescription process is better understood on a payer-by-payer basis. Over the last several weeks, we've seen 2 payers loosen their utilization management criteria, removing the requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, will be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent. 
Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Outside the United States, it remains a difficult reimbursement market, with some countries awaiting OUTCOMES data. 
We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our interleukin 6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis, and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. 
We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi-Genzyme in the United States and are actively recruiting our field-based team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We're excited about the potential U.S. launch for sarilumab. Given the central role of interleukin 6 in the inflammation contributed (sic) [attributed] to the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and, more importantly, disabling joint destruction, we believe that IL-6 inhibitors should be used early following tumor necrosis factor or TNF inhibitor failure. 
Recently issued U.S. and European guidelines support the use of IL-6 inhibitor class in earlier lines of treatments, and this is particularly relevant for those patients who cannot take combination therapies with methotrexate. With multiple players competing in the anti-IL-6 marketplace, this should contribute to improved physician awareness and understanding of the inadequacy of TNF inhibitor cycling and the need for early IL-6 inhibitor treatment. Subcutaneously administered sarilumab has strong clinical data in terms of the improved signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and prevention of bone damage in methotrexate-inadequate responders. Similar improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA have been reported in TNF inhibitor-inadequate responder population. 
We continue to prepare for the potential U.S. launch of dupilumab, our IL-4 and 13 inhibitor, which we expect in 2017. There are approximately 1.6 million patients with inadequately controlled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in the United States. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."
33715,331187536,974531,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 05, 2016",2016-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. In the first quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 11% to $2.57 versus first quarter of 2015 and non-GAAP net income of $293 million decreased 13% versus first",1222,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone who has joined us today. 
In the first quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share decreased 11% to $2.57 versus first quarter of 2015 and non-GAAP net income of $293 million decreased 13% versus first quarter of 2015.  Regeneron's 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and includes an adjustment for income taxes. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the first quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 38% over the first quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $784 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $545 million in the first quarter of 2015. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $781 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $541 million in the first quarter of 2015, which represents an increase of 44%. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was an increase of 5%. 
During the first quarter 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight decrease in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the fourth quarter 2015, but continues to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range. As Len mentioned, we are updating our full year 2016 U.S. EYLEA guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25% from the previously provided guidance of approximately 20% growth. 
Ex-U.S. EYLEA sales were $419 million in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $292 million in the first quarter 2015, representing a 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant-currency basis, sales increased approximately 48%. Product revenue from ex-U.S. EYLEA sales is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer. In the first quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $146 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2016 was $180 million. 
I'd also like to take this moment to highlight our recently expanded collaboration with Bayer, following our agreement to jointly develop the co-formulation of our antibody to ANG2 and EYLEA. In connection with this agreement, Bayer made a $50 million upfront payment to us, which was a receivable at March 31, 2016, and Regeneron has the potential to earn up to $80 million in development milestones. The $50 million upfront payment has been deferred and will be recognized over the estimated performance period. Similar to our EYLEA agreement, Regeneron has exclusive commercial rights within the U.S. and will retain all of the profits from any U.S. sales. 
Finally, a reminder for the EYLEA franchise. The second quarter of 2016 will be the final quarter in which we incur the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. In fact, I'm pleased to announce that this royalty will officially end in 2 more days.
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $220 million for the first quarter of '16. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursements of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the first quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization with antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $99 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. 
Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $13 million for the first quarter 2016. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $392 million for the first quarter. Our unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators and R&D noncash share-based compensation expense, was $164 million for the first 3 months of 2016. Our press release includes all the information that's required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2016, we'd like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $875 million to $950 million. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $230 million for the first quarter 2016. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to be in the range of $925 million and $1 billion. 
Before I move on from our operating expenses, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the new guidance component we announced this morning, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, Praluent, sarilumab and, effective in the first quarter of 2016, dupilumab. This is a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in Table 4 of our press release. Going forward, we believe that providing guidance for this number will help in modeling the Sanofi collaboration revenue line item. For the first quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $73 million, and we expect this expense in 2016 to be in the range of $320 million and $370 million. 
Turning now to our non-GAAP tax adjustment. Cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for this quarter continues to be lower than our GAAP effective tax rate, primarily due to the tax impact of noncash share-based compensation. On a non-GAAP basis, cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax net income for the first quarter of 2016 was approximately 38%. 
For 2016, our guidance for cash tax as a percentage of non-GAAP pretax income remains at 35% to 45%. As previously reported, this includes a onetime tax of approximately $222 million related to the Sanofi immuno-oncology agreement. I'd also like to reiterate that the non-GAAP tax impact of the immuno-oncology upfront payment will be spread equally throughout 2016. 
Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2016 were $104 million. Given our latest review of capital expenditures, we are tightening and lowering our full year 2016 capital expenditures guidance to a range of $550 million to $625 million from $580 million to $680 million. These expenditures continue to build on our manufacturing expansions in 2015, which include expanding our facilities in Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland as well as the continued expansion of our Tarrytown, New York headquarters. 
We ended the first quarter of 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $1.4 billion. As we previously mentioned, we have been opportunistically entering into agreements to reduce the number of our outstanding warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt.  In the first quarter of 2016, we paid $242 million to reduce these outstanding warrants. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I would briefly like to highlight certain financial components of the recent collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics. The April 2016 agreement grants Regeneron access to Intellia's CRISPR technology platform as well as the right to discover and develop up to 10 targets on an exclusive basis over the course of the 6-year agreement. In return, we paid a $75 million upfront payment to Intellia, which we anticipate recording as R&D expense in the second quarter of 2016, but plan to exclude from non-GAAP net income. The agreement also requires Regeneron to purchase up to $50 million of Intellia's shares, contingent upon Intellia consummating its initial public offering. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Michael."

I'll take the dupilumab question. I guess the most important thing that we learned from the 2 Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis was, number one, that we confirmed the impressive efficacy and the important benefit to patients in essentially every single efficacy readout that we explored. So obviously, that's very gratifying and comforting when one actually sees data that is as promising as your earlier data and suggests it can really make an important difference to moderate to severe patients who really need new therapies to attack their disease. In addition, the safety profile was also very comforting. And we reported extensively and it really does suggest that it's going to have a very important benefit/risk profile for patients. I think that, basically, for atopic dermatitis, it really means that it's all greenlights and all speed ahead and that we're really excited that we could be really bringing forward, as the FDA has designated, a breakthrough therapy for these patients' need. As you know, we also have a pivotal study in asthma, and that's already been read out. And we're in the midst of our first breakthrough, which is now our second confirmatory study in that indication as well. So dupilumab is a very, very exciting program. And as I already told you about today, I told you that in terms of the atopic dermatitis population, we're also moving to the pediatric population there as well, which is also an important unmet need area."

However, the approach that has been proposed by Medicare Part B would limit options for physicians and patients to give appropriate therapies to patients who need them. For example, in the case of the retinal space, you could lead to physicians being required simply by the economics that are in place to force them to use an off-label repackaged bevacizumab, which, at least in the Protocol 3 -- T trial, was shown in DME not to be as effective as the other therapies. They could be forced to use this for economic reasons. We see that a number of manufacturers as well as a number of congressmen and patient advocacy groups recognize that you have to preserve physician choice, and so there will be a number of complaints and letters going into the Congress, including our own."

Now whether there will be ""warehousing of patients"", people lining up to get it, it's just really impossible for us to tell. But I would suspect that this would be one of those launches that will be patient-driven. That -- as people get on the drug, if the results in the real world or anywhere is close to the results we've seen in our Phase III trials so far, I'm sure that, that patient drive will be tremendous because this is a terrible disease that people have been suffering with for decades. Adults now have it without anything at all new to really help them and make a difference. And if you look at -- whether you measure this by quality-of-life metrics, the increased risk of suicide, just the terrible burden that this puts on patients, we're optimistic that this drug can make a difference for them.

Well, maybe I'll make a brief comment. And if George has anything to add, obviously, he's welcome. The -- our feeling is that -- as George said in his talk, is that we did something which we think was pretty important, which is we did an extensive and detailed screening of patients with x-rays and MRIs before they were ever exposed to drug. And that demonstrated that some of these things that people were concerned about might be somewhat induced by drugs, were really fairly prevalent in the population, whether they be insufficiency fractures or whether they be osteonecrosis and so on. So I think that, that was important. And I do think that the FDA has come around to thinking that this has to be looked at carefully, and we -- and that's what we're doing. And the right patients have to be studied, and that's also what we're doing. They also have had concerns about whether or not any one of these drugs individually or as a class could have effect on sympathetic nerves and sympathetic nervous system function. We also looked at that pretty well, and we'll have more to tell you about that in upcoming meetings. But we didn't see any evidence at all so that, so far, things look reasonable. But as -- I think as George said, it's a small study, and we're underpowered to pick up very small increases in some of these things. And that's why we're going to study thousands and thousands of patients in our Phase III program."

And to add to that, I think that the -- one of the biggest underlying fears for this class, certainly by outside people but also by ourselves, was that the very small increase in certain arthropathy events, certain joint pathologies that was seen, particularly in combination with NSAIDs but also a small increase even in monotherapy might actually be reflecting a much bigger, somewhat invisible problem that there was a bigger, destructive process that would then be seen over longer periods in time and so forth. And this is why we did this -- as Len said, this extensive imaging of both the index joints but also non-index joints to see whether, overall, the skeleton was really changing. And as we've already said, the thing that was very gratifying was that, unfortunately, for these patients suffering from this important problem, there is already significant skeletal pathology at baseline. These patients have these so-called subchondral insufficiency fractures, and you could even see undiagnosed osteonecrosis in these patients and so forth. And these events, both in the index and the non-index joints, were not dramatically increased by treating with NGF. And one fear, for example, was that these asymptomatic subchondral insufficiency fractures may be happening much more frequently with drug and then eventually leading to much higher incidences of events down the line. And so it's very comforting not to see this. That said, there remain -- as with any drug and, certainly, with a drug this active, there will continue to be risks associated with treatment. But one has to balance that with all the benefits that could be provided. Pain is a very serious problem for a lot of people, especially people suffering from osteoarthritis. And the options, obviously, as you know, are quite limiting with no new mechanism-of-action drugs added to this field for decades. And so the possibility and the opportunity that a new mechanism-of-action class that might have different profile and also different risk profile as compared to, for example, opiates and NSAIDs and other drugs with serious risks, we think can offer an important option for patients."

This is a major advantage to elderly patients who can't get into the physician's office on a regular basis. And so they are not therapeutically equivalent. EYLEA has a longer durability of effect. I would also point out, there are data in a subset of patients in the VIEW studies that indicates that there are patients who are more refractory to anti-VEGF therapy, especially those who've received prior anti-VEGF therapies who may need more anti-VEGF treatment.

And I think that we all have to really consider that maybe -- and I hate to say it because some people are going to say, ""Hey, don't challenge the physicians here."" But I think the physicians here, and we understand the limitations of the real world and practice, are doing a huge disservice to patients, in terms of the systematic under-treatment that is probably occurring in this field. There's an enormous drive to try to get patients less trips to the office, less injections. And you've probably seen the release of recent data with long 4- or 5-year follow-on. And after you take the patients over the more controlled phases of the study, where they're getting, in general, in most studies, monthly treatment, a very carefully monitored treatment, they essentially lose almost all their vision gain over these later years of 4- and 5-year follow-ups. And we believe that the data and the evidence suggest that this is really due to systematic under-treatment, patients getting less and less treatment. And particularly in that setting, if you want to deliver the best care to patients, you should be delivering the best agent that has the longest duration of action, and we think that the only agent that's really demonstrated that convincingly is EYLEA. And so I think to save patients' visions -- you saw the long-term trials. Patients are losing visions. Physicians are not doing the right things by their patients. They're systematically under-treating. And particularly in those setting, they should be getting the best drug that protects patients against this vision loss. And it would be a disservice if, in fact, incentives and so forth are driven to the use of an inferior agent, which will cause patients -- think about it. You're a patient who can't drive, you're a patient who can't read, you're now given a drug. All of a sudden, you gain 2, 3 lines of vision. That changes the world literally for you. Okay. You could do things you can't do before. And now we developed a system that allows you to lose that. I think that we have to think about how we want to practice medicine in this country if we create a situation that allows that."

It is always more beneficial -- we've seen this, for example, in the statin class, where as more and more statins became available, they grew the market. We believe that this is the opportunity for this class, that we can educate physicians more, one, as I said earlier, on the central role of IL-6 in both the signs and symptoms of RA but as well as in joint destruction, which we feel is very important. Physicians need to understand they shouldn't stay with a TNF inhibitor, which, over time, each additional TNF inhibitor does not deliver the efficacy that they received with the first TNF inhibitor. So there's a benefit of moving to a new class, and IL-6 really does have a central role both in symptoms as well as bone destruction."

I think it's important to just highlight a few things because, once again, it all comes down to the patients and doing the best by the patients. And I think as Bob and Len already mentioned, if you look at the signs, it doesn't necessarily make sense to start all patients, particularly patients in monotherapy settings, with the TNF. And that may be a historical accident. It also doesn't make sense to just continue patients cycling on TNF if there is an alternative that can deliver them better symptomatic relief. And so we think that there's enormous opportunity for this class. And importantly, in this class, and as Bob said, the most -- one of the most important things that I think that patients and physicians are concerned about is irreversible bone loss. That's one thing that you can't get back, and that's one thing that's looked at in this field. And as you know, Actemra is now growing through a subcutaneous formulation. And if you look in the label, there's less -- according to the subcutaneous formulation that's used there in terms of the inhibition of the irreversible bone loss, there's less than 50% inhibition by the subcutaneous formulation in terms of Actemra in terms of the irreversible bone loss. If you look at our study, we offer 2 doses. And if they both get approved, our higher subcutaneous dose gives greater than 90% inhibition of irreversible bone loss. So as Bob said, these are not identical agents. This is not a me-too. There's important differences, and there's an important opportunity to do better by patients in terms of the monotherapy setting and in terms of not just cycling through drugs that maybe aren't working for the patients and putting them on a different mechanism-of-action drug."

I think the other thing is that the physicians as well as the specialty pharmacies are better understanding how to make the prescription process better. That's not -- it's not easy right now. We continue to work on improving it, but at least it has gotten better for some patients."

Before I turn the call over to my colleagues who will discuss our scientific, commercial and financial performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to give you some broader perspective on Regeneron and our business. Regeneron continues to advance its mission to bring important new medicines to patients in need. EYLEA is our drug used to treating a number of potentially blinding diseases. And with million's of injections administered each year, it is one of our most important approved products and continuous grow well globally. EYLEA is at an annual global net sales run rate that exceeds $5 billion. This has been driven both by the approval of EYLEA in new indications as well as new data that have further increased the confidence of physicians in this product. Thanks to our long-standing belief and investment in science and technology, we are now in the midst of a new product cycle, which has the potential to impact multiple disease settings. This investment in science has resulted in Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol, an additional potential near-term approvals that could address rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Our late-stage pipeline also includes program and asthma, pain, respiratory and virus and immunotherapy of cancer. Our area pipeline opportunities continue to grow with a total of 15 product candidates currently in clinical development, including 7 that we are developing independently, with several more expected to enter the clinic in the near-term, making for pipeline that can address potential opportunities ranging from there or for diseases such as fiber , [indiscernible] or FOP, to emerging affecting diseases epidemic, such as Zika. George will provide specific details and some of these programs later in this call. All of these opportunities are the results of investments we made in science and technology over the last 20 years, yielding a pipeline that is entirely home-grown. Our commitment to the long-term is unwavering as we invest in the next generation of technologies to support our feature pipeline. For example, our Regeneron Genetics Center and our investment technologies with companies in the areas of gene-editing and cell therapies, such us which is synergistic with our existing capabilities. I should also mention that we recognize that we operate in a rapidly changing environment that poses new challenges to the commercialization of our products, and we continue to try and develop innovative solutions to address these issues. Lastly, we believe it's absolutely essential to attract the best and brightest minds to scientific careers and to elevate the place of science in our society. Therefore, we were thrilled to announce in May that Regeneron was selected as new sponsors for these new science talent search. Regeneron is only the third sponsor in this renowned 75-year history of this high school science talent competition, which was previously sponsored by Intel. And before that, by Westinghouse. George and I are both alumni of the Science Talent Search and we believe the program plays a vital role encouraging national encouraging talented young people to pursue a path in science and engineering. With that introduction, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline. 
In the second quarter, we reported positive data from 3 Phase III studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and 13 blocker in patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Dupilumab is the first systemic therapy to show positive Phase II results in this indications. 
On our last earnings call, we talked about the positive data from the first 2 Phase III studies, Solo-1 and Solo-2, which studied dupilumab as a monotherapy. 
In June, we just recently reported the results from the third study, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, which was a long-term study that invest dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, which is currently the standard of care in the United States for the treatment of this difficult disease. Overall, the efficacy observed in the CHRONOS study was very consistent with the previously reported positive Phase III Solo-1 and Solo-2 studies of dupilumab in the monotherapy setting. When the primary endpoint of the CHRONOS study was assessed at 16 weeks, the studies continued until 52 weeks and efficacy was sustained in both the dupilumab 300-milligram weekly as well as the 300-milligram every other week dose group through this 1 year mark. 
At 16 weeks, about 40% of the patients in both dupilumab dose groups achieved clear or almost clear skin status as measured by the investigator's global assessment score compared to about 12% of the patients in the topical-steroid-only on. Nearly 2/3 of the patients receiving dupilumab achieved a 75% improvement in the average improvement in the overall skin score as excess by the eczema area severe index easy score, compared to about 23% of patients in the topical-steroid-only on. 
This was the first long-term Phase III study to show that dupilumab in combination with topical steroids was superior to topical steroids alone and provided sustained efficacy and significantly improve measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching and quality of life through 1 year of treatment.
The overall rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the group's treated with dupilumab in combination with topical steroid and the topical steroids alone. Serious and/or severe infections were numerically higher in the topical steroid alone. Adverse events that were noted to have a higher rate with sarilumab treatment included injection site reactions, which was seen in 20% of the patients on the dupilumab weekly arm, 16% of the patients in dupilumab every 2-week arm and 9% of the patients with placebo plus topical steroid alone arm. And conjunctivitis, which was observed in 19% of the patients with dupilumab weekly arm, 13% of patients in the dupilumab every other week arm and 8% of patients in the topical steroid alone arm. About 22% of the patients in the placebo group, 23% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly group and 28% of the dupilumab every other weekly group had a reported history of allergic conjunctivitis coming into the study.
These 1 year results from the CHRONOS study further suggest that dupilumab impact the activation of the interleukin-4 13 pathway and result in significant efficacy without the side effects associated with immuno suppressing therapies. 
In this regard, and very importantly, we have not observed an increasing overall infections or serious infections in our atopic dermatitis program to date. The U.S. BLA submission has been completed, and we look forward to working with the FDA to bringing this important breakthrough therapy to patients as soon as possible. 
We were also developing dupilumab in other allergic diseases such as asthma, nasal polyps, esophagitis. As a reminder, our first pivotal study in asthma show that 2 doses of dupilumab, 200 milligram and 300 milligram every other week, in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonist, demonstrated a statistically significant 12% to 15% improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1 over placebo at week 12, at a 64% to 75% reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over placebo. The most common adverse event with injection site reactions, which are more frequent and dupilumab dose groups at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The of infections was bound across treatment groups at 42% to 45% of dupilumab arms and 46% in the placebo arm as with the serious adverse events, which were seen in 3% to 7% of the dupilumab groups and 5% in the placebo group. We expect our confirmatory 1 year Phase III study of dupilumab in this indication of complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2016. 
As a reminder, we are the only late-stage biologic that targets both IL-4 and IL-13, and recent competitor developments in the late-stage asthma space are consistent with our preclinical data and our hypothesis that it is important to block both of these interleukins.
Turning to Praluent. Our 18,000 patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study is ongoing. As we previously disclosed data monitoring committee for this study completed the first interim analysis with 50% of the total had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety study, the DMC performed the fertility assessment recommended for the study continues with no changes. A second interim analysis for fertility as well as for overall efficacy when 75% of the targeted primary incidents occurred is expected later this year. As Len mentioned, we also have 3 other late-stage programs: Sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, where we expect FDA action by October 30; fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain associated with osteoarthritis; and the Regeneron 2222, for respiratory virus or RSV.
Turning now to our earlier-stage pipeline. In May, reported positive interim proof-of-concept data from a Phase II study of , and the antibody angiopoietin-PTL3 in patients with homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients continue to have a major unmet need as they are typically not as responsive to standard lipid-lowering therapy such as states or even PCSK9 inhibition. And some of the other treatment options available are limited by the accompanying safety and tolerability concerns. Although these data were from a small number of patients, we're encouraged by the additional 55% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at week 4 on top of standard of care compared to baseline.
In this study, alirocumab was generally well tolerated with no adverse event leading to discontinuation. The most common drug-related adverse events were injections site reactions, which were mild in severity. 
Our Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with rinucumab, GDF8 receptor antibody and what age Mac other the generation or wet AMD, which has been granted Fast Track designation, is fully enrolled and we expect top line data from the study in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is a 3-arm, 2-stage study with patients randomized to receive 1 of 3 dosing regiments: EYLEA alone; EYLEA in combination with low-dose PDGF block antibody; or EYLEA in combination with high-dose PDGF blocking antibody. Our primary efficacy endpoint of the first stage of this study is the mean change in visual acuity at week 12 from baseline. The second stage of this study is designed to confirm and extend these findings from the first stage of the study. Our Phase II combination studies of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-2 and AMD and DME continue to enroll patients. We are very excited by our earlier-stage pipeline in immuno-oncology, where both our PD-1 antibody and our CD20 by CD3 bispecific antibody have demonstrated promising activity in early clinical trials. A potential pivotal study with our PD-1 antibody in squamous cell carcinoma, continues to enroll patients, and we hope to be in that additional accommodations over the next 6 to 12 months. We have also expanded our capability in the area of precision immunotherapy with our recently announced collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immuno cell therapies. This collaboration takes advantage over our unique VelocImmune and VelociNext technologies that will allow us to use cell-based therapies to target tumor cells. 
We also recently initiated Phase I study in healthy volunteers of Regeneron 2477, an active antibody being treatment of viral dysplasia, or FLP, and other musculoskeletal disorders. We remain committed to using our technologies and approaches to help address emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola, MERS and Zika. For Zika, we have identified several fully human monoclonal antibody candidates that were able to potentially block the virus -- to potently block the virus from infecting cells in the future. An early date these antibodies are protected in the animal model. We're now in the process of scaling up for human trials. We also recently initiated our first and human study in healthy volunteers in our Ebola program, which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

We're pleased with the sales growth up EYLEA or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and x U.S. in the first half of 2016. We've made progress in improving access in reimbursement for Praluent, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European and Japanese launches for Praluent continue to progress. And we are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next year. 
Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter U.S. net sales grew 27% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $831 million. Net  x U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $486 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to have a strong position in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market in terms of injections as reported by 203 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. According to our survey results, in the overall anti-VEGF market, EYLEA has a 37% share of injections as compared to 19% for ranibizumab and 44% for off-label repackaged bevacizumab. On the other hand, with our growing market share, our expenses to support reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement systems have also increased, impacting both our gross-to-net ratio as well as our profit margin. I should note that there are currently a series of proposals for the -- from the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services regarding physician reimbursement for physician administered Medicare Part B  by inbuilt drugs, which leads to positions favoring the use of bevacizumab or large breasted, ranibizumab due to the provision of increased directive physician financial from the manufacturer and group purchasing organization. The impact of any changes is difficult to predict. Though we are monitoring the situation very closely. Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both beneficial to map and ranibizumab. The positions of patients are not be denied access to any drug therapy this is deemed appropriate. We believe that position joint should be preserved an alternative scheme is to be reduce health care cost should be explored. 
Turning now to probably win. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $24 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $21 million of the total. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and approximately 91% of Medicare-insured lives have access to Praluent. We continue to see improvement in the number of prescriptions that are I successfully being filled, with both Praluent and generally splitting market share. However, only approximately 25% of our prescriptions written actually get dispensed. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork that a pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients were eligible for treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor have not have the prescriptions filled. We continue to focus our efforts on improving access -- improving the Scripture process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. Over the last several months, we've seen some payers losing their utilization management criteria, removing a requirement in prior therapy. Others have streamlined the prior authorization processes. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, is anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent. 
Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with a product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K. and Spain among others. It still remains a difficult reimbursement market with some countries awaiting outcomes data. And the United States, we've submitted the supplemental BLA for the 300-milligram monthly dose of Praluent and have been granted a PDUFA date of January 24, 2017. We have also submitted a regulatory application for Praluent monthly dosing in the EU. Also in July, Praluent was approved in Japan. We've submitted the BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and had been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. Earlier this week, the European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for sarilumab was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States, and we have completed hiring of our field-based team. Training began this week. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We're currently preparing for dupilumab commercialization with potential U.S. approval in the first half 2017. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States with Sanofi Genzyme and began improving our sales management team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made on a later date. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."
33715,372870908,1024685,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented a",1426,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented an increase of 24% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. 
Regeneron's second quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and a $75 million up front payment made in connection with our April 2016 license in collaboration agreement with Intellia. It also includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments. A full resolution of GAAP and on GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. I will describe in further detail shortly effective this quarter, our non-GAAP net income is no longer included an adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were estimated to be paid or payable in cash. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented a year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $834 million in the second quarter 2016 compared to $658 million in the second quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $831 million compared to $655 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 27% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was 6%. 
EYLEA distributor inventory levels continue to be within our 1- to 2-week targeted range, and the June 30 levels were very similar to our large March 31, 2016 levels. 
Please note that we are reaffirming our 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25%.
X U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue was recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $486 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to $338 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 24% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 42%. In the second quarter 2016, Regeneron recognized $167 million from our share in net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $192 million. As a reminder, for the EYLEA franchise, during May 26, 2016, we stopped incurring the relative expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. This benefited our cost of goods sold and cost of collaboration line items. 
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $163 million for the second quarter of 2016. Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement average Enron incurred R&D expense. Reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the second quarter of 2016, our share of the collaborations losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $122 million, which can be found in table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborators, Sanofi, of $24 million for the second quarter 2016.
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $406 million for the second quarter 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as a total GAAP R&D expense, less R&D reimbursement from our collaborators, R&D noncash share-based compensation expense and the Intellia upfront payment was $222 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate non-GAAP R&D expense. Given our forecasted spend in associate reimbursement levels in the second half of 2016, we are increasing and tightening our full year guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of between $970 million to just over $1 billion from the previously provided range of $875 million to $950 million. This increase is a result of 2 factors: A forecasted increase in spending shift from partnered and unpartnered antibody development programs. We now have 7 antibodies that we're developing independently, including 2 that are in late stage,  RSV and fasinumab; and a greater allocation of unreimbursed manufacturing cost within our Rensselaer New York facility to R&D as opposed to inventory due to less demand for Praluent than was anticipated. Non-GAAP expense was $244 million for the second quarter of 2016. We are increasing and tightening non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to $980 million to $1.02 billion from the range of $925 million to $1 billion. This increase is primarily driven by our expenses to support EYLEA reimbursement activities, including patients support services and reimbursement assistance along with additional investments in EYLEA commercialization. This increase is partially offset by lower commercialization prelaunch and associated with our collaboration antibodies with Sanofi. As you may recall, last quarter, we introduced a new guidance component, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs that Regeneron incurred in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing as applicable Praluent, sarilumab and dupilumab. Again, this is a line item found within the Sanofi collaboration revenue referenced in table 4 of our press release. 
For the second quarter 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses was $86 million. We are lowering and tightening this guidance for 2016 to be in the range of $310 million and $340 million from $320 million to $370 million. 
Turning now to taxes. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our non-GAAP measures included income tax expense adjustments from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were paid or payable in cash for the respective period. Historically, it was a significant difference between the companies GAAP effective tax rate and the actual facts income taxes paid or payable probably due to tax benefits related to employee exercises and stock options. The tax benefits related to employee exercises and stock options were strictly recorded in additional paid in capital for GAAP reporting purposes. 
During the second quarter of 2016, the company early adopted accounting standards update 2016-09, the new standard requires companies to recognize tax benefits in connection with employee exercises of stock options in the income statement. In other words, we'll account for tax reductions related to stock options exercises in a period of exercise as a discrete item the quarter with early adoption of the new standard, the company chose to discontinue its non-GAAP income excess by adopting the new standard in limiting one of our primarily differences between the company's effective tax rate and cash income taxes paid or payable. As a result, our second quarter 2016 and 2015 non-GAAP financial results included in our earnings release were comparison now reflect discontinuance over our non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment.
This new standard will result in variability in our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter as based on GAAP rules, these items are not forecasted in our estimated annual effective tax rate. These deductions are based on the company's stock price and individual employees decisions on when to exercise their stock options. The carbon tax adjustment in the reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income table 3  of our earnings release, solely represents income tax effects related to our non-GAAP pretax adjustments. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 33%, which is 8% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of the changes in the geographic mix of earnings and share base compensation as compared to the same quarter of last year. 
For 2016, our guidance for our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year will be 33% to 41%. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 was $139 million and $243 million, respectively. We are lowering our full year 2016 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $480 million to $530 million from the previously provided range of $550 million to $625 million. These 2016 expenditures include expansion of our manufacturing capabilities and both Rensselaer, New York, Island as well as growth in our TarryTarrytown, New York headquarters as we continue to grow our employee base. Regeneron's balance sheet had $1.64 billion of cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016.

So we designed the study to include a second stage as well that actually shows the effects of adding our therapy on top in the same groups. That we predict to be a more powerful way of confirming if there are added benefits of the PDGF therapies. So we'll have the first type of comparison, which we consider perhaps to be slightly less powerful in the time frame that I just described. And then will also be getting the second stage of data.

Some say, well, wait for outcomes before I go to the map things like that.

We have consistently seen it in our atopic dermatitis studies. We have not seen it in our asthma studies. As you know, and these differences, for example, in the way topical steroids are used in the populations and so forth. And we have various ideas about why this may be the case. That said, even though it seems specific to the weighted drug is being used in this particular patient population and perhaps either use or actually do less use of topical steroids in the treated patients. The comforting thing is that these patients do have, as we pointed out in the call, they do have already a lot of history of conjunctivitis. So this is not really something brand-new to the patient now patients. And the conjunctivitis that are seen here on dupilumab seems to be of mild to moderate severity and is limited. Most cases actually resolve during treatment. And very few, if any, cases actually lead to discontinuation. So it seems as if the benefit risk is really maintained in the phase of this. That said also, in terms of the second part of your question about dupilumab. We think it's a very different situation compared to Praluent. I mean there is a huge unmet need here. Patients are really suffering from ongoing symptomatology. And the data actually shows add that this symptomatology is actually markedly improved with the dupilumab treatment. So that it seems to us that there's going to be a lot of patients who really are -- and we already know, who was going to be possibly impacted their lives that they're going to be demanding this drug. And it seems to offset -- of these patients will deserve to have this first systemic therapy that could really make a difference in their lives. Let me remind you that we're talking about the most moderate to severe class of patients here, which are more than 1 million patients in the United States alone. And these patients really have very few other alternatives. And as you see with our data in CHRONOS, where we treat on top of topical steroids, the standard of care, very few, only about 10% of the patients or so, become clear or almost with topical steroids as opposed to about 40% on the drug. And there's not only, of course, the cosmetic effects of having these skin lesions and so forth  and the associated infections and so forth that they get. But there's an enormous amount of itch that drives a lot of behavioral problems associated depressive and psychological symptomatology here and so forth. And we've actually shown that much of this is actually impacted in our studies. So we've been a very important drug for this population of patients, and we think that there's going to be a very important opportunity to make a lot of difference in a lot of people's lives, which is what should count in this business. But beyond that, I think that we also have to remember that dupilumab is really a franchise onto itself. The data really suggested that we have hit upon here with blocking both interleukin-4 and 13, the critical levels of allergic disease in general. We're hoping to extend the findings from our first pivotal study in asthma by confirming in the second pivotal study. And we'll also be continuing to study in other allergic diseases where as you've already seen, we already have some positive data in other allergic diseases in the early-stage studies as well. So this can benefit not only the allergic and atopic disease and atopical dermatitis studies that confirm it to additional diseases as well."

But patients with atopic dermatitis really suffer. It's really made its way to pop-culture. There's a new series on HBO. I do know if seen it. It's called the Night Of. And the actor, John Turturro, who trained as a lawyer and suffers terribly from atopic dermatitis. He has to wear sandals. He has to go to groups to discuss all this.

A very small proportion of those patients have received other therapies, immunosuppressant agents, generally not biologics with things like cyclosporine and methotrexate. The challenge with those therapies is a can't use them or long term. They've got some toxicities that really interfere with the patient's long-term use of the therapy. And thus, their symptoms will come back, their itch will come back and their quality of life will decrease. So there is a huge opportunity for dupilumab in this uncontrolled severe patients.

So we're hoping that we put together our unique capabilities that nobody else in the cell therapy space had, together with a pioneer in a-determithe leader in this area such as IE Jacobowitz and her team that we could really do a special thing. And I think at this point, that's what want to say about this collaboration."

Before I turn the call over to my colleagues, who will discuss our scientific, commercial and financial performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to give you some broader perspective on Regeneron and our business. Regeneron continues to advance its mission to bring important new medicines to patients in need. EYLEA is our drug used to treating a number of potentially blinding diseases. And with millions of injections administered each year, it is one of our most important approved products and continuous grow well globally. EYLEA is now at an annual global net sales run rate that exceeds $5 billion. This has been driven both by the approval of EYLEA in new indications as well as new data that have further increased the confidence of physicians in this product. Thanks to our long-standing belief and investment in science and technology, we are now in the midst of a new product cycle, which has the potential to impact multiple disease settings. This investment in science has resulted in Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol, and additional potential near-term approvals that could address rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Our late-stage pipeline also includes programs in asthma, pain, respiratory syncytial virus and the immunotherapy of cancer. Our earlier pipeline opportunities continue to grow with a total of 15 product candidates currently in clinical development, including 7 that we are developing independently, with several more expected to enter the clinic in the near term, making for pipeline that can address potential opportunities ranging from rare often diseases such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, to emerging infectious diseases epidemic, such as Zika. George will provide specific details on some of these programs later in this call. All of these opportunities are the results of investments we made in science and technology over the last 20 years, yielding a pipeline that is entirely home-grown. Our commitment to the long-term is unwavering as we invest in the next generation of technologies to support our feature pipeline. For example, our Regeneron Genetics Center and our investment in technologies with companies in the areas of gene-editing and cell therapy, such as Intellia and Adicet, which are synergistic with our existing capabilities. I should also mention that we recognize that we operate in a rapidly changing environment that poses new challenges to the commercialization of our products, and we continue to try and develop innovative solutions to address these issues. Lastly, we believe it's absolutely essential to attract the best and brightest minds to scientific careers and to elevate the place of science in our society. Therefore, we were thrilled to announce in May that Regeneron was selected as the new sponsor of the Science Talent Search. Regeneron is only the third sponsor in this renowned 75-year history of this high school science talent competition, which was previously sponsored by Intel and before that, by Westinghouse. George and I are both alumni of the Science Talent Search, and we believe the program plays a vital role encouraging -- in encouraging talented young people to pursue a path in science and engineering.
With that introduction, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline.In the second quarter, we reported positive data from 3 Phase III studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and 13 bloc",1499,"Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline.
In the second quarter, we reported positive data from 3 Phase III studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and 13 blocker in patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Dupilumab is the first systemic therapy to show positive Phase III results in this indication.
On our last earnings call, we talked about the positive data from the first 2 Phase III studies, Solo-1 and Solo-2, which studied dupilumab as a monotherapy.
In June, we just recently reported the results from the third study, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, which was a long-term study that investigated dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, which are currently the standard of care in the United States for the treatment of this difficult disease. Overall, the efficacy observed in the CHRONOS study was very consistent with the previously reported positive Phase III Solo-1 and Solo-2 studies of dupilumab in the monotherapy setting. While the primary endpoint of the CHRONOS study was assessed at 16 weeks, the study continued until 52 weeks and efficacy was sustained in both the dupilumab 300-milligram weekly as well as the 300-milligram every-other-week dose groups through this 1-year mark. At 16 weeks, about 40% of the patients in both dupilumab dose groups achieved clear or almost clear skin status as measured by the investigator global assessment score compared to about 12% of the patients in the topical-steroid-only arm. Nearly 2/3 of the patients receiving dupilumab achieved a 75% improvement in the average improvement in the overall skin score as assessed by the eczema area and severity index or the EASI score, compared to about 23% of patients in the topical-steroid-only arm.
This was the first long-term Phase III study to show that dupilumab in combination with topical steroids was superior to topical steroids alone and provided sustained efficacy and significantly improved measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching and quality of life through 1 year of treatment.
The overall rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the groups treated with dupilumab in combination with topical steroid and the topical steroids alone. Serious and/or severe infections were numerically higher in the topical-steroid-alone group. Adverse events that were noted to have a higher rate with dupilumab treatment included injection-site reactions, which were seen in 20% of the patients on the dupilumab weekly arm, 16% of the patients in dupilumab every-2-week arm and 9% of the patients in the placebo plus topical-steroid-alone arm. And conjunctivitis, which was observed in 19% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly arm, 13% of patients in the dupilumab every-other-week arm and 8% of patients in the topical-steroid-alone arm. About 22% of the patients in the placebo group, 23% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly group and 28% in the dupilumab every-other-weekly group had a reported history of allergic conjunctivitis coming into the study.
These 1-year results from the CHRONOS study further suggested dupilumab impacts the aberrant activation of the interleukin-4/13 pathway and results in significant efficacy without the side effects associated with immune-suppressing therapies.
In this regard, and very importantly, we have not observed an increase in overall infections or serious infections in our atopic dermatitis program to date. The U.S. BLA submission has been completed, and we look forward to working with the FDA to bringing this important breakthrough therapy to patients as soon as possible.
We are also developing dupilumab in other allergic diseases, such as asthma, nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis. As a reminder, our first pivotal study in asthma show that 2 doses of dupilumab, 200 milligram and 300 milligram every other week, in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta-agonist, demonstrated a statistically significant 12% to 15% improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1 over placebo at week 12, and a 64% to 75% reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over placebo. The most common adverse event was injection-site reaction, which are more frequent in the dupilumab dose groups at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The incident of infections was balance across treatment groups at 42% to 45% of dupilumab arms and 46% in the placebo arm as was the incidence of serious adverse events, which were seen in 3% to 7% of the dupilumab groups and 5% in the placebo group. We expect our confirmatory 1-year Phase III study of dupilumab in this indication to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2016.
As a reminder, we are the only late-stage biologic that targets both IL-4 and IL-13, and recent competitor [ph] developments in the late-stage asthma space are consistent with our preclinical data and our hypothesis that it is important to block both of these interleukins.
Turning to Praluent. Our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study is ongoing. As we had previously disclosed, the data-monitoring committee for this study completed the first interim analysis with 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety study, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended that the study continue with no changes. A second interim analysis for futility as well as for overwhelming efficacy when 75% of the targeted primary events has occurred is expected later this year.
As Len mentioned, we also have 3 other late-stage programs: Sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, where we expect FDA action by October 30; fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain associated with osteoarthritis; and the Regeneron 2222, for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
Turning now to our earlier-stage pipeline. In May, we reported positive interim proof-of-concept data from a Phase II study of evinacumab and the antibody to angiopoietin-PTL3 in patients with homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients continue to have a major unmet need as they are typically not as responsive to standard lipid-lowering therapy, such as statins or even to PCSK9 inhibition. And some of the other treatment options available to them are limited by the accompanying safety and tolerability concerns. Although these data were from a small number of patients, we're encouraged by the additional 55% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at week 4 on top of standard of care compared to baseline.
In this study, evinacumab was generally well tolerated and there were no adverse events leading to discontinuation. The most common drug-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, which were mild in severity.
Our Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with rinucumab, our PDGF-receptor antibody, in wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which has been granted fast-track designation, is fully enrolled, and we expect top line data from the study in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is a 3-arm, 2-stage study with patients randomized to receive 1 of 3 dosing regimens: EYLEA alone; EYLEA in combination with low-dose PDGF-blocking antibody; or EYLEA in combination with high-dose PDGF-blocking antibody. The primary efficacy endpoint of the first stage of this study is the mean change in visual acuity at week 12 from baseline. The second stage of the study is designed to confirm and extend the findings from the first stage of the study. Our Phase II combination studies of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with Nesvacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-2, in AMD and DME, continue to enroll patients. We are very excited by our earlier-stage pipeline in immuno-oncology, where both our PD-1 antibody and our CD20 by CD3 bispecific antibody have demonstrated promising activity in early clinical trials. A potential pivotal study with our PD-1 antibody in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma continues to enroll patients, and we hope to be investigating additional agents and combinations over the next 6 to 12 months. We have also expanded our capability in the area of precision immunotherapy with our recently announced collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immune cell therapies. This collaboration takes advantage over our unique VelocImmune and Veloci-Next technologies that will allow us to use cell-based therapies to target tumor cells.
We also recently initiated Phase I study in healthy volunteers of Regeneron 2477, an Activin A antibody, being developed for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, and other musculoskeletal disorders. We remain committed to using our technologies and approaches to help address emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola, MERS and Zika. For Zika, we have identified several fully human monoclonal antibody candidates that we're able to potentially block the virus -- to potently block the virus from infecting cells in vitro, and early data indicates that these antibodies are protected in an animal model. We are now in the process of scaling up for human trials. We also recently initiated our first in-human study in healthy volunteers in our Ebola program, which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

We are pleased with the sales growth by EYLEA, or aflibercept, injection, both in the United States and ex U.S. in the first half of 2016. We've made progress in improving access and reimbursement for Praluent, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European and Japanese launches for Praluent continue to progress. And we are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next year.
Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter U.S. net sales grew 27% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $831 million. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $486 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to have a strong position in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market in terms of injections as reported by 203 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. According to our survey results, in the overall anti-VEGF market, EYLEA has a 37% share of injections as compared to 19% for ranibizumab and 44% for off-label repackaged bevacizumab. On the other hand, with our growing market share, our expenses to support reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance, have also increased, impacting both our gross-to-net ratio as well as our profit margin. I should note that there are currently a series of proposals for the -- from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B buy-and-bill drugs, which could lead towards positions favoring the use of bevacizumab or, in large-volume retinal practices, ranibizumab due to the provision of increased direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer and group-purchasing organizations.
The impact of any changes is difficult to predict. Though we are monitoring this situation very closely. Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. We believe that physician choice should be preserved and alternative scheme as to reduce health care cost should be explored.
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $24 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $21 million of the total. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and approximately 91% of Medicare-insured lives have access to Praluent. We continue to see improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled, with both Praluent and evolocumab generally splitting market share evenly. However, only approximately 25% of our prescriptions written actually get dispensed. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with the PCSK9 inhibitor have not had their prescriptions filled. We continue to focus our efforts on improving access -- improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. Over the last several months, we've seen some payers losing their utilization management criteria, removing the requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. Others have streamlined the prior-authorization processes. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent.
Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with the product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K. and Spain among others. It still remains a difficult reimbursement market with some countries awaiting OUTCOMES data. In the United States, we've submitted the supplemental BLA for the 300-milligram monthly dose of Praluent and have been granted a PDUFA date of January 24, 2017. We have also submitted a regulatory application for Praluent monthly dosing in the EU. Also in July, Praluent was approved in Japan. We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor inhibitor, for rheumatoid arthritis and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. Earlier this week, the European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for sarilumab was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States, and we've completed hiring of our field-based team. Training began this week. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We're currently preparing for dupilumab commercialization with potential U.S. approval in the first half 2017. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States with Sanofi Genzyme and they have begun interviewing our sales management team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date.

In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented an increase of 24% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Regeneron's second quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and $75 million up-front payment made in connection with our April 2016 license and collaboration agreement with Intellia. It also includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. I will describe in further detail shortly, effective this quarter, our non-GAAP net income is no longer includes in adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were estimated to be paid or payable in cash. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented a year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $834 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $658 million in the second quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $831 million compared to $655 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 27% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was 6%. EYLEA distributor inventory levels continue to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range, and the June 30 levels were very similar to our large March 31, 2016 levels.
Please note that we are reaffirming our 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25%.
Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $486 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $338 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 42%. In the second quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $167 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $192 million.
As a reminder, for the EYLEA franchise, during May 2016, we stopped incurring the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. This benefited our cost to goods sold and cost of collaboration manufacturing line items.
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $163 million for the second quarter of 2016. Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the second quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $122 million, which can be found in table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $24 million for the second quarter of 2016.
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $406 million for the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense, less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, R&D noncash share-based compensation expense and the Intellia up-front payment, was $222 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. Given our forecasted spend in associate reimbursement level for the second half of 2016, we are increasing and tightening our full year guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of between $970 million to just over $1 billion from the previously provided range of $875 million to $950 million. This increase is a result of 2 factors: A forecasted increase in spending shift from partnered to unpartnered antibody development programs. We now have 7 antibodies that we're developing independently, including 2 that are in late stage, RSV and fasinumab; and a greater allocation of unreimbursed manufacturing cost within our Rensselaer, New York facility to R&D as opposed to inventory due to less demand for Praluent than was anticipated. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $244 million for the second quarter of 2016. We are increasing and tightening non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to $980 million to $1.02 billion from the range of $925 million to $1 billion. This increase is primarily driven by our expenses to support EYLEA reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance along with additional investments in EYLEA's commercialization. This increase is partially offset by lower commercialization and prelaunch spend associated with our collaboration antibodies with Sanofi. As you may recall, last quarter, we introduced a new guidance component, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs that Regeneron incurs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing as applicable, Praluent, sarilumab and dupilumab. Again, this is the line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in table 4 of our press release.
For the second quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $86 million. We are lowering and tightening this guidance in 2016 to be in the range of $310 million and $340 million from $320 million to $370 million.
Turning now to taxes. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our non-GAAP measures included an income tax expense adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were paid or payable in cash for the respective period. Historically, there was a significant difference between the company's GAAP-effective tax rate and the actual cash income taxes paid or payable primarily due to tax benefits related to employee exercises stock options. The tax benefits related to employee exercises stock options were historically recorded in additional paid in capital for GAAP-reporting purposes.
During the second quarter of 2016, the company early adopted accounting standards update 2016-09. The new standard requires companies to recognize tax benefits in connection with employee exercises stock option in the income statement. In other words, we'll account for tax deductions related to stock option exercises in the period of exercise as a discrete item to the quarter. With the early adoption of the new standard, the company chose to discontinue its former non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment since by adopting the new standard and eliminated one of our primarily -- primary differences between the company's effective tax rate and cash income taxes paid or payable. As a result, our second quarter 2016 and 2015 non-GAAP financial results included in our earnings release for comparison now reflect discontinuance of our non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment.
This new standard will result in variability in our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. As based on GAAP rules, these items are not forecasted in our estimated annual effective tax rate. These deductions are based on the company's stock price and individual employees' decisions on when to exercise their stock options. The current tax-related adjustment in our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, table 3 of our earnings release, solely represents the income tax effects related to our non-GAAP pretax adjustments. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 33%, which is 8% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and share base compensation as compared to the same quarter of last year.
For 2016, our guidance for our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year will be 33% to 41%. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 was $139 million and $243 million, respectively. We are lowering our full year 2016 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $480 million to $530 million from the previously provided range of $550 million to $625 million. These 2016 expenditures include the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in both Rensselaer, New York; in Limerick, Ireland; as well as growth in our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as we continue to grow our employee base. Regeneron's balance sheet had $1.64 billion of cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016. Less than $500,000 of our originally issued $400 million of convertible senior notes due October 1, 2016, remain outstanding.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Michael."

So we designed the study to include a second stage as well that actually shows the effects of adding on therapy on top within the same group. That we predict to be a more powerful way of confirming if there are added benefits of the PDGF therapies. So we'll have the first type of comparison, which we consider perhaps to be slightly less powerful in the time frame that I just described, and then we will also be getting the second stage of data. So depending on how strong the first set of data is, we will either be able to make a decision at that point or we'll be awaiting the results from the second stage to help us make that decision."

And that has happened in a few plans already. With regards to the prior authorization paperwork, some of the payers had prior authorizations that required 10s -- almost up to 40 questions. It became very tedious for the physicians. So some of the plans have begun to change their prior authorization to be simpler. And again, that is in place in a few payers now.

It seems to me there are 3 ways -- 3 important factors you can consider. Assuming that we have a relatively high satisfaction rate that patients get on the drug, get their cholesterol lowered and tolerate the drug, this is not like hepatitis C market. Those should be long-term patients, so we begin to accumulate as opposed to constantly having to find to replace as you would, let's say in a hep C environment. Secondly, as Bob said, this is -- the cardiologists are not like the rheumatologists where they have people in their office, who are very experienced in dealing with the prior authorizations and paperwork, and I think that they are getting more efficient at it, they are somewhat frustrated by it for sure, and some of them are giving up. Some say, ""well, I'll wait for outcomes before I go to them at with fights"" and things like that. But I do believe that the experience that the doctors in picking the patients that they know that each PBM for each patient or each payer, if you will, they kind of know -- are getting better at knowing how to get this done as they get more experience. And then, of course, finally, as George mentioned, we hope that the OUTCOMES data later this year will change the dynamic out there in terms of the feeling, the compelling need to go on these products if we show an OUTCOMES benefit."

We have consistently seen it in our atopic dermatitis studies. We have not seen it in our asthma studies. As you know, there's differences, for examples, in the way topical steroids are used in the populations and so forth, and we have various ideas about why this may be the case. That said, even though it seems specific to the way the drug is being used in this particular patient population and perhaps with either the use or actually the less use of topical steroids in the treated patients. The comforting thing is that these patients do have -- as we pointed out in the call, they do have already a lot of history of conjunctivitis. So this is not really something brand-new to the patients. And the conjunctivitis that is seen here on dupilumab seems to be of mild-to-moderate severity and is limited. Most cases actually resolve during treatment. And very few, if any, cases actually lead to discontinuation. So it seems as if the benefit/risk is really maintained in the phase of this. That said also, in terms of the second part of your question about dupilumab, we think it's a very different situation compared to Praluent. I mean there is a huge unmet need here. Patients are really suffering from ongoing symptomatology. And the data actually shows that this symptomatology is actually markedly improved with the dupilumab treatment. So that it seems to us that there's going to be a lot of patients who really are -- and we already know, who are going to be so positively impacted in their lives that they're going to be demanding this drug. And it seems to us that these patients will deserve to have this first systemic therapy that can really make a difference in their lives. Let me remind you that this is -- we're talking about the most moderate-to-severe class of the patients here, which are more than 1 million patients in the United States alone, and these patients really have very few other alternatives. And as you can see with our data in CHRONOS, where we treat on top of topical steroids, the standard of care, very few, only about 10% of the patients or so, become clear or almost clear with topical steroids as opposed to about 40% on the drug. And there's not only, of course, the cosmetic effects of having these skin lesions and so forth and the associated infections and so forth that you get, but there's an enormous amount of itch, which drives a lot of behavioral problems and so forth. There is associated depressive and psychological symptomatology here and so forth. And we've actually shown that much of this is actually impacted in our studies. So we think this can be a very important drug for this population of patients, and we think that there's going to be a very important opportunity to make a lot of difference in a lot of people's lives, which is what should count in this business. But beyond that, I think that we also have to remember that dupilumab is really a franchise onto itself. The data really suggest that we have hit upon here with blocking both interleukin-4 and 13, the critical drivers of allergic disease in general. We're hoping obviously to extend the findings from our first pivotal study in asthma by confirming them with the second pivotal study. And we'll also be continuing to study in other allergic diseases whereas you've already seen we already have some positive data in other allergic diseases in early-stage studies as well. So this can benefit not only the allergic and atopic disease of atopic dermatitis, but we hope to be able to have studies that confirm it to additional allergic diseases as well."

But patients with atopic dermatitis really suffer. It's really made its way into pop-culture. There's a new series on HBO. I don't know if any of you have seen, it's called The Night Of, and the actor, John Turturro, portrays as lawyer, who suffers terribly from atopic dermatitis. He has to wear sandals.

A very small proportion of those patients have received other therapies, immunosuppressant agents, generally not biologics, but things like cyclosporine and methotrexate. The challenge with those therapies is you can't use them long term. They've got some toxicities that really interfere with the patient's long-term use of the therapy. And thus, their symptoms will come back, their itch will come back and their quality of life will decrease. So there is a huge opportunity for dupilumab in these uncontrolled moderate-to-severe patients.

Before I turn the call over to my colleagues, who will discuss our scientific, commercial and financial performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to give you some broader perspective on Regeneron and our business. Regeneron continues to advance its mission to bring important new medicines to patients in need. EYLEA is our drug used to treating a number of potentially blinding diseases. And with millions of injections administered each year, it is one of our most important approved products and continuous grow well globally. EYLEA is now at an annual global net sales run rate that exceeds $5 billion. This has been driven both by the approval of EYLEA in new indications as well as new data that have further increased the confidence of physicians in this product. Thanks to our long-standing belief and investment in science and technology, we are now in the midst of a new product cycle, which has the potential to impact multiple disease settings. This investment in science has resulted in Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol, and additional potential near-term approvals that could address rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Our late-stage pipeline also includes programs in asthma, pain, respiratory syncytial virus and the immunotherapy of cancer. Our earlier pipeline opportunities continue to grow with a total of 15 product candidates currently in clinical development, including 7 that we are developing independently, with several more expected to enter the clinic in the near term, making for pipeline that can address potential opportunities ranging from rare often diseases such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, to emerging infectious diseases epidemic, such as Zika. George will provide specific details on some of these programs later in this call. All of these opportunities are the results of investments we made in science and technology over the last 20 years, yielding a pipeline that is entirely home-grown. Our commitment to the long-term is unwavering as we invest in the next generation of technologies to support our feature pipeline. For example, our Regeneron Genetics Center and our investment in technologies with companies in the areas of gene-editing and cell therapy, such as Intellia and Adicet, which are synergistic with our existing capabilities. I should also mention that we recognize that we operate in a rapidly changing environment that poses new challenges to the commercialization of our products, and we continue to try and develop innovative solutions to address these issues. Lastly, we believe it's absolutely essential to attract the best and brightest minds to scientific careers and to elevate the place of science in our society. Therefore, we were thrilled to announce in May that Regeneron was selected as the new sponsor of the Science Talent Search. Regeneron is only the third sponsor in this renowned 75-year history of this high school science talent competition, which was previously sponsored by Intel and before that, by Westinghouse. George and I are both alumni of the Science Talent Search, and we believe the program plays a vital role encouraging -- in encouraging talented young people to pursue a path in science and engineering.
With that introduction, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline.In the second quarter, we reported positive data from 3 Phase III studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and 13 bloc",1499,"Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline.
In the second quarter, we reported positive data from 3 Phase III studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and 13 blocker in patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Dupilumab is the first systemic therapy to show positive Phase III results in this indication.
On our last earnings call, we talked about the positive data from the first 2 Phase III studies, Solo-1 and Solo-2, which studied dupilumab as a monotherapy.
In June, we just recently reported the results from the third study, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, which was a long-term study that investigated dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, which are currently the standard of care in the United States for the treatment of this difficult disease. Overall, the efficacy observed in the CHRONOS study was very consistent with the previously reported positive Phase III Solo-1 and Solo-2 studies of dupilumab in the monotherapy setting. While the primary endpoint of the CHRONOS study was assessed at 16 weeks, the study continued until 52 weeks and efficacy was sustained in both the dupilumab 300-milligram weekly as well as the 300-milligram every-other-week dose groups through this 1-year mark. At 16 weeks, about 40% of the patients in both dupilumab dose groups achieved clear or almost clear skin status as measured by the investigator global assessment score compared to about 12% of the patients in the topical-steroid-only arm. Nearly 2/3 of the patients receiving dupilumab achieved a 75% improvement in the average improvement in the overall skin score as assessed by the eczema area and severity index or the EASI score, compared to about 23% of patients in the topical-steroid-only arm.
This was the first long-term Phase III study to show that dupilumab in combination with topical steroids was superior to topical steroids alone and provided sustained efficacy and significantly improved measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching and quality of life through 1 year of treatment.
The overall rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the groups treated with dupilumab in combination with topical steroid and the topical steroids alone. Serious and/or severe infections were numerically higher in the topical-steroid-alone group. Adverse events that were noted to have a higher rate with dupilumab treatment included injection-site reactions, which were seen in 20% of the patients on the dupilumab weekly arm, 16% of the patients in dupilumab every-2-week arm and 9% of the patients in the placebo plus topical-steroid-alone arm. And conjunctivitis, which was observed in 19% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly arm, 13% of patients in the dupilumab every-other-week arm and 8% of patients in the topical-steroid-alone arm. About 22% of the patients in the placebo group, 23% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly group and 28% in the dupilumab every-other-weekly group had a reported history of allergic conjunctivitis coming into the study.
These 1-year results from the CHRONOS study further suggested dupilumab impacts the aberrant activation of the interleukin-4/13 pathway and results in significant efficacy without the side effects associated with immune-suppressing therapies.
In this regard, and very importantly, we have not observed an increase in overall infections or serious infections in our atopic dermatitis program to date. The U.S. BLA submission has been completed, and we look forward to working with the FDA to bringing this important breakthrough therapy to patients as soon as possible.
We are also developing dupilumab in other allergic diseases, such as asthma, nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis. As a reminder, our first pivotal study in asthma show that 2 doses of dupilumab, 200 milligram and 300 milligram every other week, in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta-agonist, demonstrated a statistically significant 12% to 15% improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1 over placebo at week 12, and a 64% to 75% reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over placebo. The most common adverse event was injection-site reaction, which are more frequent in the dupilumab dose groups at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The incident of infections was balance across treatment groups at 42% to 45% of dupilumab arms and 46% in the placebo arm as was the incidence of serious adverse events, which were seen in 3% to 7% of the dupilumab groups and 5% in the placebo group. We expect our confirmatory 1-year Phase III study of dupilumab in this indication to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2016.
As a reminder, we are the only late-stage biologic that targets both IL-4 and IL-13, and recent competitor [ph] developments in the late-stage asthma space are consistent with our preclinical data and our hypothesis that it is important to block both of these interleukins.
Turning to Praluent. Our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study is ongoing. As we had previously disclosed, the data-monitoring committee for this study completed the first interim analysis with 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety study, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended that the study continue with no changes. A second interim analysis for futility as well as for overwhelming efficacy when 75% of the targeted primary events has occurred is expected later this year.
As Len mentioned, we also have 3 other late-stage programs: Sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, where we expect FDA action by October 30; fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain associated with osteoarthritis; and the Regeneron 2222, for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
Turning now to our earlier-stage pipeline. In May, we reported positive interim proof-of-concept data from a Phase II study of evinacumab and the antibody to angiopoietin-PTL3 in patients with homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients continue to have a major unmet need as they are typically not as responsive to standard lipid-lowering therapy, such as statins or even to PCSK9 inhibition. And some of the other treatment options available to them are limited by the accompanying safety and tolerability concerns. Although these data were from a small number of patients, we're encouraged by the additional 55% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at week 4 on top of standard of care compared to baseline.
In this study, evinacumab was generally well tolerated and there were no adverse events leading to discontinuation. The most common drug-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, which were mild in severity.
Our Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with rinucumab, our PDGF-receptor antibody, in wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which has been granted fast-track designation, is fully enrolled, and we expect top line data from the study in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is a 3-arm, 2-stage study with patients randomized to receive 1 of 3 dosing regimens: EYLEA alone; EYLEA in combination with low-dose PDGF-blocking antibody; or EYLEA in combination with high-dose PDGF-blocking antibody. The primary efficacy endpoint of the first stage of this study is the mean change in visual acuity at week 12 from baseline. The second stage of the study is designed to confirm and extend the findings from the first stage of the study. Our Phase II combination studies of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with Nesvacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-2, in AMD and DME, continue to enroll patients. We are very excited by our earlier-stage pipeline in immuno-oncology, where both our PD-1 antibody and our CD20 by CD3 bispecific antibody have demonstrated promising activity in early clinical trials. A potential pivotal study with our PD-1 antibody in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma continues to enroll patients, and we hope to be investigating additional agents and combinations over the next 6 to 12 months. We have also expanded our capability in the area of precision immunotherapy with our recently announced collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immune cell therapies. This collaboration takes advantage over our unique VelocImmune and Veloci-Next technologies that will allow us to use cell-based therapies to target tumor cells.
We also recently initiated Phase I study in healthy volunteers of Regeneron 2477, an Activin A antibody, being developed for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, and other musculoskeletal disorders. We remain committed to using our technologies and approaches to help address emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola, MERS and Zika. For Zika, we have identified several fully human monoclonal antibody candidates that we're able to potentially block the virus -- to potently block the virus from infecting cells in vitro, and early data indicates that these antibodies are protected in an animal model. We are now in the process of scaling up for human trials. We also recently initiated our first in-human study in healthy volunteers in our Ebola program, which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

We've made progress in improving access and reimbursement for Praluent, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European and Japanese launches for Praluent continue to progress. And we are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next year.
Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter U.S. net sales grew 27% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $831 million. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $486 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to have a strong position in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market in terms of injections as reported by 203 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. According to our survey results, in the overall anti-VEGF market, EYLEA has a 37% share of injections as compared to 19% for ranibizumab and 44% for off-label repackaged bevacizumab. On the other hand, with our growing market share, our expenses to support reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance, have also increased, impacting both our gross-to-net ratio as well as our profit margin. I should note that there are currently a series of proposals for the -- from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B buy-and-bill drugs, which could lead towards positions favoring the use of bevacizumab or, in large-volume retinal practices, ranibizumab due to the provision of increased direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer and group-purchasing organizations.
The impact of any changes is difficult to predict. Though we are monitoring this situation very closely. Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. We believe that physician choice should be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce health care cost should be explored.
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $24 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $21 million of the total. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and approximately 91% of Medicare-insured lives have access to Praluent. We continue to see improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled, with both Praluent and evolocumab generally splitting market share evenly. However, only approximately 25% of our prescriptions written actually get dispensed. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with the PCSK9 inhibitor have not had their prescriptions filled. We continue to focus our efforts on improving access -- improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. Over the last several months, we've seen some payers loosen their utilization management criteria, removing the requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. Others have streamlined the prior-authorization processes. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent.
Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with the product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K. and Spain among others. It still remains a difficult reimbursement market with some countries awaiting OUTCOMES data. In the United States, we've submitted the supplemental BLA for the 300-milligram monthly dose of Praluent and have been granted a PDUFA date of January 24, 2017. We have also submitted a regulatory application for Praluent monthly dosing in the EU. Also in July, Praluent was approved in Japan. We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor inhibitor, for rheumatoid arthritis and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. Earlier this week, the European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for sarilumab was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States, and we've completed hiring of our field-based team. Training began this week. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We're currently preparing for dupilumab commercialization with potential U.S. approval in the first half 2017. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States with Sanofi Genzyme and they have begun interviewing our sales management team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date.
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."
33715,372870908,1025383,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented a",1438,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented an increase of 24% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Regeneron's second quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and $75 million up-front payment made in connection with our April 2016 license and collaboration agreement with Intellia. It also includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. I will describe in further detail shortly, effective this quarter, our non-GAAP net income is no longer includes in adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were estimated to be paid or payable in cash. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented a year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $834 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $658 million in the second quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $831 million compared to $655 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 27% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was 6%. EYLEA distributor inventory levels continue to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range, and the June 30 levels were very similar to our large March 31, 2016 levels.
Please note that we are reaffirming our 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25%.
Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $486 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $338 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 42%. In the second quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $167 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $192 million.
As a reminder, for the EYLEA franchise, during May 2016, we stopped incurring the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. This benefited our cost to goods sold and cost of collaboration manufacturing line items.
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $163 million for the second quarter of 2016. Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the second quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $122 million, which can be found in table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $24 million for the second quarter of 2016.
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $406 million for the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense, less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, R&D noncash share-based compensation expense and the Intellia up-front payment, was $222 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. Given our forecasted spend in associate reimbursement level for the second half of 2016, we are increasing and tightening our full year guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of between $970 million to just over $1 billion from the previously provided range of $875 million to $950 million. This increase is a result of 2 factors: A forecasted increase in spending shift from partnered to unpartnered antibody development programs. We now have 7 antibodies that we're developing independently, including 2 that are in late stage, RSV and fasinumab; and a greater allocation of unreimbursed manufacturing cost within our Rensselaer, New York facility to R&D as opposed to inventory due to less demand for Praluent than was anticipated. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $244 million for the second quarter of 2016. We are increasing and tightening non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to $980 million to $1.02 billion from the range of $925 million to $1 billion. This increase is primarily driven by our expenses to support EYLEA reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance along with additional investments in EYLEA's commercialization. This increase is partially offset by lower commercialization and prelaunch spend associated with our collaboration antibodies with Sanofi. As you may recall, last quarter, we introduced a new guidance component, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs that Regeneron incurs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing as applicable, Praluent, sarilumab and dupilumab. Again, this is the line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in table 4 of our press release.
For the second quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $86 million. We are lowering and tightening this guidance in 2016 to be in the range of $310 million and $340 million from $320 million to $370 million.
Turning now to taxes. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our non-GAAP measures included an income tax expense adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were paid or payable in cash for the respective period. Historically, there was a significant difference between the company's GAAP-effective tax rate and the actual cash income taxes paid or payable primarily due to tax benefits related to employee exercises stock options. The tax benefits related to employee exercises stock options were historically recorded in additional paid in capital for GAAP-reporting purposes.
During the second quarter of 2016, the company early adopted accounting standards update 2016-09. The new standard requires companies to recognize tax benefits in connection with employee exercises of stock option in the income statement. In other words, we'll account for tax deductions related to stock option exercises in the period of exercise as a discrete item to the quarter. With the early adoption of the new standard, the company chose to discontinue its former non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment since by adopting the new standard and eliminated one of our primarily -- primary differences between the company's effective tax rate and cash income taxes paid or payable. As a result, our second quarter 2016 and 2015 non-GAAP financial results included in our earnings release for comparison now reflect discontinuance of our non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment.
This new standard will result in variability in our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. As based on GAAP rules, these items are not forecasted in our estimated annual effective tax rate. These deductions are based on the company's stock price and individual employees' decisions on when to exercise their stock options. The current tax-related adjustment in our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, table 3 of our earnings release, solely represents the income tax effects related to our non-GAAP pretax adjustments. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 33%, which is 8% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and share base compensation as compared to the same quarter of last year.
For 2016, our guidance for our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year will be 33% to 41%. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 was $139 million and $243 million, respectively. We are lowering our full year 2016 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $480 million to $530 million from the previously provided range of $550 million to $625 million. These 2016 expenditures include the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in both Rensselaer, New York; in Limerick, Ireland; as well as growth in our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as we continue to grow our employee base. Regeneron's balance sheet had $1.64 billion of cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016. Less than $500,000 of our originally issued $400 million of convertible senior notes due October 1, 2016, remain outstanding.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Michael."

That's the first stage. As you know, even in studies with hundreds of patients in them, as we have of course seen, we have as much experience as anybody alone and with our collaborators doing these large studies, there can be a lot of variability in letters gained. So we designed the study to include a second stage as well that actually shows the effects of adding on therapy on top within the same group. That we predict to be a more powerful way of confirming if there are added benefits of the PDGF therapies. So we'll have the first type of comparison, which we consider perhaps to be slightly less powerful in the time frame that I just described, and then we will also be getting the second stage of data. So depending on how strong the first set of data is, we will either be able to make a decision at that point or we'll be awaiting the results from the second stage to help us make that decision."

And that has happened in a few plans already. With regards to the prior authorization paperwork, some of the payers had prior authorizations that required 10s -- almost up to 40 questions. It became very tedious for the physicians. So some of the plans have begun to change their prior authorization to be simpler. And again, that is in place in a few payers now.

Assuming that we have a relatively high satisfaction rate that patients get on the drug, get their cholesterol lowered and tolerate the drug, this is not like hepatitis C market. Those should be long-term patients, so we begin to accumulate as opposed to constantly having to find to replace as you would, let's say in a hep C environment. Secondly, as Bob said, this is -- the cardiologists are not like the rheumatologists where they have people in their office, who are very experienced in dealing with the prior authorizations and paperwork, and I think that they are getting more efficient at it, they are somewhat frustrated by it for sure, and some of them are giving up. Some say, ""well, I'll wait for outcomes before I go to the mat with fights"" and things like that. But I do believe that the experience that the doctors in picking the patients that they know that each PBM for each patient or each payer, if you will, they kind of know -- are getting better at knowing how to get this done as they get more experience. And then, of course, finally, as George mentioned, we hope that the OUTCOMES data later this year will change the dynamic out there in terms of the feeling, the compelling need to go on these products if we show an OUTCOMES benefit."

We have consistently seen it in our atopic dermatitis studies. We have not seen it in our asthma studies. As you know, there's differences, for examples, in the way topical steroids are used in the populations and so forth, and we have various ideas about why this may be the case. That said, even though it seems specific to the way the drug is being used in this particular patient population and perhaps with either the use or actually the less use of topical steroids in the treated patients. The comforting thing is that these patients do have -- as we pointed out in the call, they do have already a lot of history of conjunctivitis. So this is not really something brand-new to the patients. And the conjunctivitis that is seen here on dupilumab seems to be of mild-to-moderate severity and is limited. Most cases actually resolve during treatment. And very few, if any, cases actually lead to discontinuation. So it seems as if the benefit/risk is really maintained in the face of this. That said also, in terms of the second part of your question about dupilumab, we think it's a very different situation compared to Praluent. I mean there is a huge unmet need here. Patients are really suffering from ongoing symptomatology. And the data actually shows that this symptomatology is actually markedly improved with the dupilumab treatment. So that it seems to us that there's going to be a lot of patients who really are -- and we already know, who are going to be so positively impacted in their lives that they're going to be demanding this drug. And it seems to us that these patients will deserve to have this first systemic therapy that can really make a difference in their lives. Let me remind you that this is -- we're talking about the most moderate-to-severe class of the patients here, which are more than 1 million patients in the United States alone, and these patients really have very few other alternatives. And as you can see with our data in CHRONOS, where we treat on top of topical steroids, the standard of care, very few, only about 10% of the patients or so, become clear or almost clear with topical steroids as opposed to about 40% on the drug. And there's not only, of course, the cosmetic effects of having these skin lesions and so forth and the associated infections and so forth that you get, but there's an enormous amount of itch, which drives a lot of behavioral problems and so forth. There is associated depressive and psychological symptomatology here and so forth. And we've actually shown that much of this is actually impacted in our studies. So we think this can be a very important drug for this population of patients, and we think that there's going to be a very important opportunity to make a lot of difference in a lot of people's lives, which is what should count in this business. But beyond that, I think that we also have to remember that dupilumab is really a franchise onto itself. The data really suggest that we have hit upon here with blocking both interleukin-4 and 13, the critical drivers of allergic disease in general. We're hoping obviously to extend the findings from our first pivotal study in asthma by confirming them with the second pivotal study. And we'll also be continuing to study in other allergic diseases whereas you've already seen we already have some positive data in other allergic diseases in early-stage studies as well. So this can benefit not only the allergic and atopic disease of atopic dermatitis, but we hope to be able to have studies that confirm it to additional allergic diseases as well."

But patients with atopic dermatitis really suffer. It's really made its way into pop-culture. There's a new series on HBO. I don't know if any of you have seen, it's called The Night Of, and the actor, John Turturro, portrays this lawyer, who suffers terribly from atopic dermatitis. He has to wear sandals. He goes to groups to discuss all this. And really has a terrible impact on his life. And this -- I don't think this is just a TV portrayal. I think this is what we see, the people really suffer from this disease."

This appears to be more of immunomodulators correcting an immune deviation. And actually, as we reported and as we summarized during this call, there is no increase in infections and in serious infections here. So once again, this is an important option that's being offered to the patients in contrast to other alternatives which were essentially immunosuppressing. And to have this sort of efficacy with a nonimmunosuppressing agent, I think, is also offering a lot of hope to patients."

So as George pointed out, there are approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States who are uncontrolled on topical therapies, who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. A very small proportion of those patients have received other therapies, immunosuppressant agents, generally not biologics, but things like cyclosporine and methotrexate. The challenge with those therapies is you can't use them long term. They've got some toxicities that really interfere with the patient's long-term use of the therapy. And thus, their symptoms will come back, their itch will come back and their quality of life will decrease. So there is a huge opportunity for dupilumab in these uncontrolled moderate-to-severe patients. There's the pent-up demand among patients and physicians to get the patients on therapy and to improve their lives."

Before I turn the call over to my colleagues, who will discuss our scientific, commercial and financial performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to give you some broader perspective on Regeneron and our business. Regeneron continues to advance its mission to bring important new medicines to patients in need. EYLEA is our drug used to treating a number of potentially blinding diseases. And with millions of injections administered each year, it is one of our most important approved products and continuous grow well globally. EYLEA is now at an annual global net sales run rate that exceeds $5 billion. This has been driven both by the approval of EYLEA in new indications as well as new data that have further increased the confidence of physicians in this product. Thanks to our long-standing belief and investment in science and technology, we are now in the midst of a new product cycle, which has the potential to impact multiple disease settings. This investment in science has resulted in Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol, and additional potential near-term approvals that could address rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Our late-stage pipeline also includes programs in asthma, pain, respiratory syncytial virus and the immunotherapy of cancer. Our earlier pipeline opportunities continue to grow with a total of 15 product candidates currently in clinical development, including 7 that we are developing independently, with several more expected to enter the clinic in the near term, making for pipeline that can address potential opportunities ranging from rare often diseases such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, to emerging infectious diseases epidemic, such as Zika. George will provide specific details on some of these programs later in this call. All of these opportunities are the results of investments we made in science and technology over the last 20 years, yielding a pipeline that is entirely home-grown. Our commitment to the long-term is unwavering as we invest in the next generation of technologies to support our feature pipeline. For example, our Regeneron Genetics Center and our investment in technologies with companies in the areas of gene-editing and cell therapy, such as Intellia and Adicet, which are synergistic with our existing capabilities. I should also mention that we recognize that we operate in a rapidly changing environment that poses new challenges to the commercialization of our products, and we continue to try and develop innovative solutions to address these issues. Lastly, we believe it's absolutely essential to attract the best and brightest minds to scientific careers and to elevate the place of science in our society. Therefore, we were thrilled to announce in May that Regeneron was selected as the new sponsor of the Science Talent Search. Regeneron is only the third sponsor in this renowned 75-year history of this high school science talent competition, which was previously sponsored by Intel and before that, by Westinghouse. George and I are both alumni of the Science Talent Search, and we believe the program plays a vital role encouraging -- in encouraging talented young people to pursue a path in science and engineering.
With that introduction, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline.In the second quarter, we reported positive data from 3 Phase III studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and 13 bloc",1499,"Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline.
In the second quarter, we reported positive data from 3 Phase III studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and 13 blocker in patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Dupilumab is the first systemic therapy to show positive Phase III results in this indication.
On our last earnings call, we talked about the positive data from the first 2 Phase III studies, Solo-1 and Solo-2, which studied dupilumab as a monotherapy.
In June, we just recently reported the results from the third study, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, which was a long-term study that investigated dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, which are currently the standard of care in the United States for the treatment of this difficult disease. Overall, the efficacy observed in the CHRONOS study was very consistent with the previously reported positive Phase III Solo-1 and Solo-2 studies of dupilumab in the monotherapy setting. While the primary endpoint of the CHRONOS study was assessed at 16 weeks, the study continued until 52 weeks and efficacy was sustained in both the dupilumab 300-milligram weekly as well as the 300-milligram every-other-week dose groups through this 1-year mark. At 16 weeks, about 40% of the patients in both dupilumab dose groups achieved clear or almost clear skin status as measured by the investigator global assessment score compared to about 12% of the patients in the topical-steroid-only arm. Nearly 2/3 of the patients receiving dupilumab achieved a 75% improvement in the average improvement in the overall skin score as assessed by the eczema area and severity index or the EASI score, compared to about 23% of patients in the topical-steroid-only arm.
This was the first long-term Phase III study to show that dupilumab in combination with topical steroids was superior to topical steroids alone and provided sustained efficacy and significantly improved measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching and quality of life through 1 year of treatment.
The overall rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the groups treated with dupilumab in combination with topical steroid and the topical steroids alone. Serious and/or severe infections were numerically higher in the topical-steroid-alone group. Adverse events that were noted to have a higher rate with dupilumab treatment included injection-site reactions, which were seen in 20% of the patients on the dupilumab weekly arm, 16% of the patients in dupilumab every-2-week arm and 9% of the patients in the placebo plus topical-steroid-alone arm. And conjunctivitis, which was observed in 19% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly arm, 13% of patients in the dupilumab every-other-week arm and 8% of patients in the topical-steroid-alone arm. About 22% of the patients in the placebo group, 23% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly group and 28% in the dupilumab every-other-weekly group had a reported history of allergic conjunctivitis coming into the study.
These 1-year results from the CHRONOS study further suggested dupilumab impacts the aberrant activation of the interleukin-4/13 pathway and results in significant efficacy without the side effects associated with immune-suppressing therapies.
In this regard, and very importantly, we have not observed an increase in overall infections or serious infections in our atopic dermatitis program to date. The U.S. BLA submission has been completed, and we look forward to working with the FDA to bringing this important breakthrough therapy to patients as soon as possible.
We are also developing dupilumab in other allergic diseases, such as asthma, nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis. As a reminder, our first pivotal study in asthma show that 2 doses of dupilumab, 200 milligram and 300 milligram every other week, in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta-agonist, demonstrated a statistically significant 12% to 15% improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1 over placebo at week 12, and a 64% to 75% reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over placebo. The most common adverse event was injection-site reaction, which are more frequent in the dupilumab dose groups at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The incident of infections was balance across treatment groups at 42% to 45% of dupilumab arms and 46% in the placebo arm as was the incidence of serious adverse events, which were seen in 3% to 7% of the dupilumab groups and 5% in the placebo group. We expect our confirmatory 1-year Phase III study of dupilumab in this indication to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2016.
As a reminder, we are the only late-stage biologic that targets both IL-4 and IL-13, and recent competitor [ph] developments in the late-stage asthma space are consistent with our preclinical data and our hypothesis that it is important to block both of these interleukins.
Turning to Praluent. Our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study is ongoing. As we had previously disclosed, the data-monitoring committee for this study completed the first interim analysis with 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety study, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended that the study continue with no changes. A second interim analysis for futility as well as for overwhelming efficacy when 75% of the targeted primary events has occurred is expected later this year.
As Len mentioned, we also have 3 other late-stage programs: Sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, where we expect FDA action by October 30; fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain associated with osteoarthritis; and the Regeneron 2222, for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
Turning now to our earlier-stage pipeline. In May, we reported positive interim proof-of-concept data from a Phase II study of evinacumab and the antibody to angiopoietin-PTL3 in patients with homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients continue to have a major unmet need as they are typically not as responsive to standard lipid-lowering therapy, such as statins or even to PCSK9 inhibition. And some of the other treatment options available to them are limited by the accompanying safety and tolerability concerns. Although these data were from a small number of patients, we're encouraged by the additional 55% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at week 4 on top of standard of care compared to baseline.
In this study, evinacumab was generally well tolerated and there were no adverse events leading to discontinuation. The most common drug-related adverse events were injection-site reactions, which were mild in severity.
Our Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with rinucumab, our PDGF-receptor antibody, in wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which has been granted fast-track designation, is fully enrolled, and we expect top line data from the study in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is a 3-arm, 2-stage study with patients randomized to receive 1 of 3 dosing regimens: EYLEA alone; EYLEA in combination with low-dose PDGF-blocking antibody; or EYLEA in combination with high-dose PDGF-blocking antibody. The primary efficacy endpoint of the first stage of this study is the mean change in visual acuity at week 12 from baseline. The second stage of the study is designed to confirm and extend the findings from the first stage of the study. Our Phase II combination studies of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with Nesvacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-2, in AMD and DME, continue to enroll patients. We are very excited by our earlier-stage pipeline in immuno-oncology, where both our PD-1 antibody and our CD20 by CD3 bispecific antibody have demonstrated promising activity in early clinical trials. A potential pivotal study with our PD-1 antibody in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma continues to enroll patients, and we hope to be investigating additional agents and combinations over the next 6 to 12 months. We have also expanded our capability in the area of precision immunotherapy with our recently announced collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immune cell therapies. This collaboration takes advantage over our unique VelocImmune and Veloci-Next technologies that will allow us to use cell-based therapies to target tumor cells.
We also recently initiated Phase I study in healthy volunteers of Regeneron 2477, an Activin A antibody, being developed for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, and other musculoskeletal disorders. We remain committed to using our technologies and approaches to help address emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola, MERS and Zika. For Zika, we have identified several fully human monoclonal antibody candidates that we're able to potentially block the virus -- to potently block the virus from infecting cells in vitro, and early data indicates that these antibodies are protected in an animal model. We are now in the process of scaling up for human trials. We also recently initiated our first in-human study in healthy volunteers in our Ebola program, which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."
33715,372870908,1026222,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George, and hello, everyone. We are pleased with the sales growth by EYLEA, or aflibercept, injection, both in the United States and ex U.S. in the first half of 2016. We've made progress in improving access and reimbursement for Praluent, or a",803,"Thank you, George, and hello, everyone. We are pleased with the sales growth by EYLEA, or aflibercept, injection, both in the United States and ex U.S. in the first half of 2016. We've made progress in improving access and reimbursement for Praluent, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European and Japanese launches for Praluent continue to progress. And we are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next year.
Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter U.S. net sales grew 27% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $831 million. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $486 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to have a strong position in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market in terms of injections as reported by 203 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. According to our survey results, in the overall anti-VEGF market, EYLEA has a 37% share of injections as compared to 19% for ranibizumab and 44% for off-label repackaged bevacizumab. On the other hand, with our growing market share, our expenses to support reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance, have also increased, impacting both our gross-to-net ratio as well as our profit margin. I should note that there are currently a series of proposals for the -- from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B buy-and-bill drugs, which could lead towards positions favoring the use of bevacizumab or, in large-volume retinal practices, ranibizumab due to the provision of increased direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer and group-purchasing organizations.
The impact of any changes is difficult to predict. Though we are monitoring this situation very closely. Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. We believe that physician choice should be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce health care cost should be explored.
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $24 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $21 million of the total. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and approximately 91% of Medicare-insured lives have access to Praluent. We continue to see improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled, with both Praluent and evolocumab generally splitting market share evenly. However, only approximately 25% of our prescriptions written actually get dispensed. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork that the pharmacy benefits managers and health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with the PCSK9 inhibitor have not had their prescriptions filled. We continue to focus our efforts on improving access -- improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. Over the last several months, we've seen some payers loosen their utilization management criteria, removing the requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. Others have streamlined the prior-authorization processes. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent.
Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with the product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K. and Spain among others. It still remains a difficult reimbursement market with some countries awaiting OUTCOMES data. In the United States, we've submitted the supplemental BLA for the 300-milligram monthly dose of Praluent and have been granted a PDUFA date of January 24, 2017. We have also submitted a regulatory application for Praluent monthly dosing in the EU. Also in July, Praluent was approved in Japan. We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor inhibitor, for rheumatoid arthritis and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. Earlier this week, the European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for sarilumab was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States, and we've completed hiring of our field-based team. Training began this week. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We're currently preparing for dupilumab commercialization with potential U.S. approval in the first half 2017. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States with Sanofi Genzyme and they have begun interviewing our sales management team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date.
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."
33715,372870908,1026222,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented a",1438,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented an increase of 24% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Regeneron's second quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and $75 million up-front payment made in connection with our April 2016 license and collaboration agreement with Intellia. It also includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments. A full reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. I will describe in further detail shortly, effective this quarter, our non-GAAP net income is no longer includes in adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were estimated to be paid or payable in cash. Total revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented a year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $834 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $658 million in the second quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $831 million compared to $655 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 27% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was 6%. EYLEA distributor inventory levels continue to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range, and the June 30 levels were very similar to our large March 31, 2016 levels.
Please note that we are reaffirming our 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25%.
Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $486 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $338 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis, or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 42%. In the second quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $167 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $192 million.
As a reminder, for the EYLEA franchise, during May 2016, we stopped incurring the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. This benefited our cost to goods sold and cost of collaboration manufacturing line items.
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $163 million for the second quarter of 2016. Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the second quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $122 million, which can be found in table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $24 million for the second quarter of 2016.
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $406 million for the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense, less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, R&D noncash share-based compensation expense and the Intellia up-front payment, was $222 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. Given our forecasted spend in associate reimbursement level for the second half of 2016, we are increasing and tightening our full year guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of between $970 million to just over $1 billion from the previously provided range of $875 million to $950 million. This increase is a result of 2 factors: A forecasted increase in spending shift from partnered to unpartnered antibody development programs. We now have 7 antibodies that we're developing independently, including 2 that are in late stage, RSV and fasinumab; and a greater allocation of unreimbursed manufacturing cost within our Rensselaer, New York facility to R&D as opposed to inventory due to less demand for Praluent than was anticipated. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $244 million for the second quarter of 2016. We are increasing and tightening non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to $980 million to $1.02 billion from the range of $925 million to $1 billion. This increase is primarily driven by our expenses to support EYLEA reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance along with additional investments in EYLEA's commercialization. This increase is partially offset by lower commercialization and prelaunch spend associated with our collaboration antibodies with Sanofi. As you may recall, last quarter, we introduced a new guidance component, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs that Regeneron incurs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing as applicable, Praluent, sarilumab and dupilumab. Again, this is the line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in table 4 of our press release.
For the second quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $86 million. We are lowering and tightening this guidance in 2016 to be in the range of $310 million and $340 million from $320 million to $370 million.
Turning now to taxes. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our non-GAAP measures included an income tax expense adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were paid or payable in cash for the respective period. Historically, there was a significant difference between the company's GAAP-effective tax rate and the actual cash income taxes paid or payable primarily due to tax benefits related to employee exercises stock options. The tax benefits related to employee exercises stock options were historically recorded in additional paid in capital for GAAP-reporting purposes.
During the second quarter of 2016, the company early adopted accounting standards update 2016-09. The new standard requires companies to recognize tax benefits in connection with employee exercises of stock option in the income statement. In other words, we'll account for tax deductions related to stock option exercises in the period of exercise as a discrete item to the quarter. With the early adoption of the new standard, the company chose to discontinue its former non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment since by adopting the new standard and eliminated one of our primarily -- primary differences between the company's effective tax rate and cash income taxes paid or payable. As a result, our second quarter 2016 and 2015 non-GAAP financial results included in our earnings release for comparison now reflect discontinuance of our non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment.
This new standard will result in variability in our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. As based on GAAP rules, these items are not forecasted in our estimated annual effective tax rate. These deductions are based on the company's stock price and individual employees' decisions on when to exercise their stock options. The current tax-related adjustment in our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, table 3 of our earnings release, solely represents the income tax effects related to our non-GAAP pretax adjustments. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 33%, which is 8% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and share base compensation as compared to the same quarter of last year.
For 2016, our guidance for our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year will be 33% to 41%. Our capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 was $139 million and $243 million, respectively. We are lowering our full year 2016 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $480 million to $530 million from the previously provided range of $550 million to $625 million. These 2016 expenditures include the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in both Rensselaer, New York; in Limerick, Ireland; as well as growth in our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as we continue to grow our employee base. Regeneron's balance sheet had $1.64 billion of cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016. Less than $500,000 of our originally issued $400 million of convertible senior notes due October 1, 2016, remain outstanding.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Michael."

That's the first stage. As you know, even in studies with hundreds of patients in them, as we have of course seen, we have as much experience as anybody alone and with our collaborators doing these large studies, there can be a lot of variability in letters gained. So we designed the study to include a second stage as well that actually shows the effects of adding on therapy on top within the same group. That we predict to be a more powerful way of confirming if there are added benefits of the PDGF therapies. So we'll have the first type of comparison, which we consider perhaps to be slightly less powerful in the time frame that I just described, and then we will also be getting the second stage of data. So depending on how strong the first set of data is, we will either be able to make a decision at that point or we'll be awaiting the results from the second stage to help us make that decision."

It became very tedious for the physicians. So some of the plans have begun to change their prior authorization to be simpler. And again, that is in place in a few payers now.

Those should be long-term patients, so we begin to accumulate as opposed to constantly having to find to replace as you would, let's say in a hep C environment. Secondly, as Bob said, this is -- the cardiologists are not like the rheumatologists where they have people in their office, who are very experienced in dealing with the prior authorizations and paperwork, and I think that they are getting more efficient at it, they are somewhat frustrated by it for sure, and some of them are giving up. Some say, ""well, I'll wait for outcomes before I go to the mat with fights"" and things like that. But I do believe that the experience that the doctors in picking the patients that they know that each PBM for each patient or each payer, if you will, they kind of know -- are getting better at knowing how to get this done as they get more experience. And then, of course, finally, as George mentioned, we hope that the OUTCOMES data later this year will change the dynamic out there in terms of the feeling, the compelling need to go on these products if we show an OUTCOMES benefit."

And based on a lot of the science, it's really very, very hard to predict what, if any, benefit will be seen here. Would you think that our unique two-stage design will end up giving us probably the best data in most convincing perspective on whether there is an added benefit or not, and as Len pointed out, the fact that if there is an added benefit, we'll be able to do it with a single injection. And assuming appropriate safety, we'll make it easier to deliver that benefit to patients with this approach. And remember, our approach here, we are combining 2 very similar antibody-like drugs into a single co-formulated injection as opposed to giving 2 very different types of drugs with separate injections."

We have consistently seen it in our atopic dermatitis studies. We have not seen it in our asthma studies. As you know, there's differences, for examples, in the way topical steroids are used in the populations and so forth, and we have various ideas about why this may be the case. That said, even though it seems specific to the way the drug is being used in this particular patient population and perhaps with either the use or actually the less use of topical steroids in the treated patients. The comforting thing is that these patients do have -- as we pointed out in the call, they do have already a lot of history of conjunctivitis. So this is not really something brand-new to the patients. And the conjunctivitis that is seen here on dupilumab seems to be of mild-to-moderate severity and is limited. Most cases actually resolve during treatment. And very few, if any, cases actually lead to discontinuation. So it seems as if the benefit/risk is really maintained in the face of this. That said also, in terms of the second part of your question about dupilumab, we think it's a very different situation compared to Praluent. I mean there is a huge unmet need here. Patients are really suffering from ongoing symptomatology. And the data actually shows that this symptomatology is actually markedly improved with the dupilumab treatment. So that it seems to us that there's going to be a lot of patients who really are -- and we already know, who are going to be so positively impacted in their lives that they're going to be demanding this drug. And it seems to us that these patients will deserve to have this first systemic therapy that can really make a difference in their lives. Let me remind you that this is -- we're talking about the most moderate-to-severe class of the patients here, which are more than 1 million patients in the United States alone, and these patients really have very few other alternatives. And as you can see with our data in CHRONOS, where we treat on top of topical steroids, the standard of care, very few, only about 10% of the patients or so, become clear or almost clear with topical steroids as opposed to about 40% on the drug. And there's not only, of course, the cosmetic effects of having these skin lesions and so forth and the associated infections and so forth that you get, but there's an enormous amount of itch, which drives a lot of behavioral problems and so forth. There is associated depressive and psychological symptomatology here and so forth. And we've actually shown that much of this is actually impacted in our studies. So we think this can be a very important drug for this population of patients, and we think that there's going to be a very important opportunity to make a lot of difference in a lot of people's lives, which is what should count in this business. But beyond that, I think that we also have to remember that dupilumab is really a franchise onto itself. The data really suggest that we have hit upon here with blocking both interleukin-4 and 13, the critical drivers of allergic disease in general. We're hoping obviously to extend the findings from our first pivotal study in asthma by confirming them with the second pivotal study. And we'll also be continuing to study in other allergic diseases whereas you've already seen we already have some positive data in other allergic diseases in early-stage studies as well. So this can benefit not only the allergic and atopic disease of atopic dermatitis, but we hope to be able to have studies that confirm it to additional allergic diseases as well."

But patients with atopic dermatitis really suffer. It's really made its way into pop-culture. There's a new series on HBO. I don't know if any of you have seen, it's called The Night Of, and the actor, John Turturro, portrays this lawyer, who suffers terribly from atopic dermatitis. He has to wear sandals. He goes to groups to discuss all this. And really has a terrible impact on his life. And this -- I don't think this is just a TV portrayal. I think this is what we see, the people really suffer from this disease."

This appears to be more of immunomodulators correcting an immune deviation. And actually, as we reported and as we summarized during this call, there is no increase in infections and in serious infections here. So once again, this is an important option that's being offered to the patients in contrast to other alternatives which were essentially immunosuppressing. And to have this sort of efficacy with a nonimmunosuppressing agent, I think, is also offering a lot of hope to patients."

So as George pointed out, there are approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States who are uncontrolled on topical therapies, who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. A very small proportion of those patients have received other therapies, immunosuppressant agents, generally not biologics, but things like cyclosporine and methotrexate. The challenge with those therapies is you can't use them long term. They've got some toxicities that really interfere with the patient's long-term use of the therapy. And thus, their symptoms will come back, their itch will come back and their quality of life will decrease. So there is a huge opportunity for dupilumab in these uncontrolled moderate-to-severe patients. There's the pent-up demand among patients and physicians to get the patients on therapy and to improve their lives."

Before I turn the call over to my colleagues, who will discuss our scientific, commercial and financial performance, I'd like to take a few minutes to give you some broader perspective on Regeneron and our business. 
Regeneron continues to advance its mission to bring important new medicines to patients in need. EYLEA is our drug used to treat a number of potentially blinding diseases. And with millions of injections administered each year, it is one of our most important approved products and continues to grow well globally. EYLEA is now at an annual global net sales run rate that exceeds $5 billion. This has been driven both by the approval of EYLEA in new indications as well as new data that have further increased the confidence of physicians in this product. 
Thanks to our long-standing belief and investment in science and technology, we are now in the midst of a new product cycle, which has the potential to impact multiple disease settings. This investment in science has resulted in Praluent, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol, and additional potential near-term approvals that could address rheumatoid arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Our late-stage pipeline also includes programs in asthma, pain, respiratory syncytial virus and the immunotherapy of cancer. 
Our earlier pipeline opportunities continue to grow with a total of 15 product candidates currently in clinical development, including 7 that we are developing independently, with several more expected to enter the clinic in the near term, making for a pipeline that can address potential opportunities ranging from rare orphan diseases such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, to emerging infectious diseases, epidemic such as Zika. George will provide specific details on some of these programs later in this call. 
All of these opportunities are the results of investments we made in science and technology over the last 20 years, yielding a pipeline that is entirely home-grown. Our commitment to the long term is unwavering as we invest in the next generation of technologies to support our future pipeline. For example, our Regeneron Genetics Center and our investment in technologies with companies in the areas of gene editing and cell therapy, such as Intellia and Adicet, which are synergistic with our existing capabilities. I should also mention that we recognize that we operate in a rapidly changing environment that poses new challenges to the commercialization of our products, and we continue to try and develop innovative solutions to address these issues. 
Lastly, we believe it's absolutely essential to attract the best and brightest minds to scientific careers and to elevate the place of science in our society. Therefore, we were thrilled to announce in May that Regeneron was selected as the new sponsor of the Science Talent Search. Regeneron is only the third sponsor in this renowned 75-year history of this high school science talent competition, which was previously sponsored by Intel and before that by Westinghouse. George and I are both alumni of the Science Talent Search and we believe the program plays a vital role encouraging -- in encouraging talented young people to pursue a path in science and engineering.
With that introduction, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with progress in our late-stage pipeline.
In the second quarter, we reported positive data from 3 Phase III studies of dupilumab, our interleukin-4 and -13 blocker in patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Dupilumab is the first systemic therapy to show positive Phase III results in this indication.
On our last earnings call, we talked about the positive data from the first 2 Phase III studies, SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, which studied dupilumab as a monotherapy. In June, we just recently reported the results from the third study, LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, which was a long-term study that investigated dupilumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, which are currently the standard of care in the United States for the treatment of this difficult disease. Overall, the efficacy observed in the CHRONOS study was very consistent with the previously reported positive Phase III SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies of dupilumab in the monotherapy setting. 
While the primary endpoint of the CHRONOS study was assessed at 16 weeks, the study continued until 52 weeks and efficacy was sustained in both the dupilumab 300-milligram weekly as well as the 300-milligram every other week dose groups through this 1-year mark. At 16 weeks, about 40% of the patients in both dupilumab dose groups achieved clear or almost clear skin status as measured by the Investigator Global Assessment score compared to about 12% of the patients in the topical steroid only arm. 
Nearly 2/3 of the patients receiving dupilumab achieved a 75% improvement in the average improvement in the overall skin score as assessed by the Eczema Area and Severity Index, or the EASI, score compared to about 23% of patients in the topical steroid only arm. This was the first long-term Phase III study to show that dupilumab in combination with topical steroids was superior to topical steroids alone and provided sustained efficacy and significantly improved measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching and quality of life through 1 year of treatment.
The overall rate of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the groups treated with dupilumab in combination with topical steroid and the topical steroids alone. Serious and/or severe infections were numerically higher in the topical steroid alone group. Adverse events that were noted to have a higher rate with dupilumab treatment included injection site reactions, which were seen in 20% of the patients on the dupilumab weekly arm, 16% of the patients in dupilumab every 2-week arm and 9% of the patients in the placebo plus topical steroid alone arm. And conjunctivitis, which was observed in 19% of patients in the dupilumab weekly arm, 13% of patients in the dupilumab every other week arm and 8% of patients in the topical steroid alone arm. About 22% of the patients in the placebo group, 23% of the patients in the dupilumab weekly group and 28% of the patients in the dupilumab every other weekly group had a reported history of allergic conjunctivitis coming into the study.
These 1-year results from the CHRONOS study further suggest that dupilumab impacts the aberrant activation of the interleukin-4, -13 pathway and results in significant efficacy without the side effects associated with immune suppressing therapies. In this regard, and very importantly, we have not observed an increase in overall infections or serious infections in our atopic dermatitis program to date. The U.S. BLA submission has been completed, and we look forward to work with the FDA to bring this important breakthrough therapy to patients as soon as possible.
We are also developing dupilumab in other allergic diseases, such as asthma, nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis. As a reminder, our first pivotal study in asthma show that 2 doses of dupilumab, 200-milligram and 300-milligram every other week, in combination with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonist, demonstrated a statistically significant 12% to 15% improvement in lung function as measured by FEV1 over placebo at week 12, and a 64% to 75% reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over placebo. 
The most common adverse event was injection site reaction, which was more frequent in the dupilumab dose groups at 13% to 25% compared to 12% in the placebo group. The incident of infections was balanced across treatment groups at 42% to 45% in dupilumab arms and 46% in the placebo arm as was the incidence of serious adverse events, which were seen in 3% to 7% of the dupilumab groups and 5% in the placebo group. We expect our confirmatory 1-year Phase III study of dupilumab in this indication to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, we are the only late-stage biologic that targets both IL-4 and IL-13, and recent competitor developments in the late-stage asthma space are consistent with our preclinical data and our hypotheses that it is important to block both of these interleukins.
Turning to Praluent. Our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study is ongoing. As we have previously disclosed, the data monitoring committee for this study completed the first interim analysis when 50% of the total events had accrued based on unblinded study data. In addition to reviewing the safety study, the DMC performed a futility assessment and recommended that the study continue with no changes. A second interim analysis for futility as well as for overwhelming efficacy when 75% of the targeted primary events has occurred is expected later this year.
As Len mentioned, we also have 3 other late-stage programs: sarilumab, our interleukin-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis, where we expect FDA action by October 30; fasinumab, our NGF antibody for pain associated with osteoarthritis; and Regeneron 2222 for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV.
Turning now to our earlier stage pipeline. In May, we reported positive interim proof-of-concept data from a Phase II study of evinacumab, an antibody to angiopoietin PTL3 in patients with a homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia. These patients continue to have a major unmet need as they are typically not as responsive to standard lipid lowering therapy, such as statins or even to PCSK9 inhibition. And some of the other treatment options available to them are limited by the accompanying safety and tolerability concerns. 
Although these data were from a small number of patients, we are encouraged by the additional 55% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at week 4 on top of standard of care compared to baseline. In this study, evinacumab was generally well tolerated and there were no adverse events leading to discontinuation. The most common drug related adverse events were injection site reactions, which were mild in severity.
Our Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with rinucumab, our PDGF-receptor antibody, in wet age related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, which has been granted fast track designation, is fully enrolled, and we expect top line data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2016. This is a 3-arm, 2-stage study with patients randomized to receive 1 of 3 dosing regimens: EYLEA alone; EYLEA in combination with low dose PDGF blocking antibody; or EYLEA in combination with high dose PDGF blocking antibody. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the first stage of this study is the mean change in visual acuity at week 12 from baseline. The second stage of the study is designed to confirm and extend the findings from the first stage of the study. Our Phase II combination studies of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to angiopoietin-2 in AMD and DME, continue to enroll patients. We are very excited by our earlier stage pipeline in immuno-oncology, where both our PD-1 antibody and our CD20 by CD3 bispecific antibody have demonstrated promising activity in early clinical trials. Our potentially pivotal study with our PD-1 antibody in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma continues to enroll patients, and we hope to be investigating additional agents and combinations over the next 6 to 12 months. 
We have also expanded our capability in the area of precision immunotherapy with our recently announced collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immune cell therapies. This collaboration takes advantage over our unique VelocImmune and Veloci-Next technologies that will allow us to use cell-based therapies to target tumor cells.
We also recently initiated a Phase I study in healthy volunteers of Regeneron 2477, an activin antibody being developed for the treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, or FOP, and other musculoskeletal disorders. We remain committed to using our technologies and approaches to help address emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola, MERS and Zika. For Zika, we have identified several fully human monoclonal antibody candidates that are able to potentially block the virus -- to potently block the virus from infecting cells in vitro, and early data indicate that these antibodies are protective in an animal model. We are now in the process of scaling up for human trials. We also recently initiated our first in human study in healthy volunteers in our Ebola program, which has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA.
With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."
33715,372870908,1035143,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George, and hello, everyone. We're pleased with the sales growth of EYLEA, or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and ex U.S. in the first half of 2016. We've made progress in improving access and reimbursement for Praluent, or ali",812,"Thank you, George, and hello, everyone. We're pleased with the sales growth of EYLEA, or aflibercept injection, both in the United States and ex U.S. in the first half of 2016. We've made progress in improving access and reimbursement for Praluent, or alirocumab, among U.S. payers. In addition, the European and Japanese launches for Praluent continue to progress. And we are now preparing for the potential U.S. launches of sarilumab and dupilumab over the next year.
Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter U.S. net sales grew 27% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $831 million. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the second quarter were $486 million, which represents 44% growth year-over-year on a reported basis. We continue to have a strong position in our U.S. market share leadership for EYLEA in the FDA approved anti-VEGF market in terms of injections as reported by 203 retinal specialists in our quarterly market research survey. According to our survey results, in the overall anti-VEGF market, EYLEA has a 37% share of injections as compared to 19% for ranibizumab and 44% for off-label repackaged bevacizumab. 
On the other hand, with our growing market share, our expenses to support reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance, have also increased, impacting both our gross to net ratio as well as our profit margin. I should note that there are currently a series of proposals for the -- from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician administered Medicare Part B buy-and-bill drugs, which could lead towards physicians favoring the use of bevacizumab or, in large volume retinal practices, ranibizumab due to the provision of increased direct-to-physician financial incentives from the manufacturer and group purchasing organizations.
The impact of any changes is difficult to predict, though we are monitoring the situation very closely. Regeneron believes that EYLEA is clearly differentiated from both bevacizumab and ranibizumab. Physicians and patients should not be denied access to any drug therapy that is deemed appropriate. We believe that physician choice should be preserved and alternative schemas to reduce health care costs should be explored.
Turning now to Praluent. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the second quarter were $24 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $21 million of the total. I'm pleased to share that as of July 1, approximately 74% of commercially insured lives and approximately 91% of Medicare insured lives have access to Praluent. We continue to see improvement in the number of prescriptions that are successfully being filled, with both Praluent and evolocumab generally splitting market share evenly. However, only approximately 25% of our prescriptions written actually get dispensed. Unfortunately, due to unprecedented strict utilization management criteria and very tedious prior authorization paperwork that the pharmacy benefits managers at health plans have put in place, many patients who are eligible for treatment with a PCSK9 inhibitor have not had their prescriptions filled. 
We continue to focus our efforts on improving access -- improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. Over the last several months, we've seen some payers loosen their utilization management criteria, removing a requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. Others have streamlined the prior authorization processes. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent.
Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with the product now available in several countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K. and Spain among others. It still remains a difficult reimbursement market with some countries awaiting OUTCOMES data. 
In the United States, we've submitted the supplemental BLA for the 300-milligram monthly dose of Praluent and have been granted a PDUFA date of January 24, 2017. We have also submitted a regulatory application for Praluent monthly dosing in the EU. Also in July, Praluent was approved in Japan. We've submitted a BLA to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis and have been granted a PDUFA date of October 30, 2016. 
Earlier this week, the European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for sarilumab was accepted for review by the European Medicines Agency. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States, and we have completed hiring of our field based team. Training began this week. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made over time. We're currently preparing for dupilumab commercialization with potential U.S. approval in the first half of 2017. We'll be co-promoting dupilumab in the United States with Sanofi Genzyme and have begun interviewing our sales management team. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date.
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."
33715,372870908,1035143,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented a",1442,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone. I have several financial updates to provide this morning. Let me start with our top line second quarter earnings. In the second quarter of 2016, non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.82. This represented an increase of 24% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015.
Regeneron's second quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and $75 million upfront payment made in connection with our April 2016 license and collaboration agreement with Intellia. It also includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. I will describe in further detail shortly, effective this quarter, our non-GAAP net income is no longer includes an adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were estimated to be paid or payable in cash. 
Total revenues in the second quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represented a year-over-year growth of 21% over the second quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $834 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $658 million in the second quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $831 million compared to $655 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 27% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was 6%. EYLEA distributor inventory levels continue to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range, and the June 30 levels were very similar to our March 31, 2016 levels. Please note that we are reaffirming our 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of between 20% and 25%.
Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $486 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $338 million in the second quarter of 2015, representing a 44% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 42%. In the second quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $167 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the second quarter of 2016 was $192 million. As a reminder, for the EYLEA franchise, during May 2016, we stopped incurring the royalty expense in connection with our agreement with Genentech related to global EYLEA sales. This benefited our cost of goods sold and cost of collaboration manufacturing line items.
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $163 million for the second quarter of 2016. Sanofi collaboration revenue line primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies. In the second quarter of 2016, our share of the collaborations losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, primarily Praluent, was $122 million, which can be found in table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within the collaboration losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator, Sanofi, of $24 million for the second quarter of 2016.
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $406 million for the second quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, R&D noncash share-based compensation expense and the Intellia upfront payment, was $222 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. Given our forecasted spend and associated reimbursement level for the second half of 2016, we are increasing and tightening our full year guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of between $970 million to just over $1 billion from the previously provided range of $875 million to $950 million. This increase is a result of 2 factors: A forecasted increase in spending shift from partnered to unpartnered antibody development programs. We now have 7 antibodies that we are developing independently including 2 that are in late stage, RSV and fasinumab; and a greater allocation of unreimbursed manufacturing costs within our Rensselaer, New York facility to R&D as opposed to inventory due to less demand for Praluent than was anticipated. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $244 million for the second quarter of 2016. We are increasing and tightening non-GAAP SG&A expense in 2016 to $980 million to $1.02 billion from the range of $925 million to $1 billion. This increase is primarily driven by our expenses to support EYLEA reimbursement activities, including patient support services and reimbursement assistance along with additional investments in EYLEA's commercialization. This increase is partially offset by lower commercialization and prelaunch spend associated with our collaboration antibodies with Sanofi. 
As you may recall, last quarter, we introduced a new guidance component, Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization related expenses, which represents reimbursement of internal and external costs that Regeneron incurs in connection with preparing to commercialize or commercializing, as applicable, Praluent, sarilumab and dupilumab. Again, this is the line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue and is referenced in table 4 of our press release. For the second quarter of 2016, the reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses was $86 million. We are lowering and tightening this guidance in 2016 to be in the range of $310 million and $340 million from $320 million to $370 million.
Turning now to taxes. Prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, our non-GAAP measures included an income tax expense adjustment from GAAP tax expense to the amount of taxes that were paid or payable in cash for the respective period. Historically, there was a significant difference between the company's GAAP-effective tax rate and the actual cash income taxes paid or payable primarily due to tax benefits related to employee exercises stock options. The tax benefits related to employee exercises stock options were historically recorded in additional paid in capital for GAAP reporting purposes.
During the second quarter of 2016, the company early adopted accounting standards update 2016-09. The new standard requires companies to recognize tax benefits in connection with employee exercises stock options in the income statement. In other words, we will account for tax deductions related to stock option exercises in the period of exercise as a discrete item to the quarter. With the early adoption of the new standard, the company chose to discontinue its former non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment since, by adopting the new standard, it eliminated one of our primarily -- primary differences between the company's effective tax rate and cash income taxes paid or payable. 
As a result, our second quarter 2016 and 2015 non-GAAP financial results included in our earnings release for comparison now reflect discontinuance of our non-GAAP income tax expense adjustment. This new standard will result in variability in our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. As based on GAAP rules, these items are not forecasted in our estimated annual effective tax rate. These deductions are based on the company's stock price and individual employees' decisions on when to exercise their stock options. The current tax related adjustment in our reconciliation of GAAP net income to non-GAAP net income, table 3 of our earnings release, solely represents the income tax effects related to our non-GAAP pretax adjustment. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was approximately 33%, which is 8% lower compared to the second quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings and share-based compensation as compared to the same quarter of last year. For 2016, our guidance for our GAAP effective tax rate for the full year will be 33% to 41%. 
Our capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2016 and for the 6 months ended June 30, 2016 were $139 million and $243 million, respectively. We are lowering our full year 2016 capital expenditure guidance to a range of $480 million to $530 million from the previously provided range of $550 million to $625 million. These 2016 expenditures include the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in both Rensselaer, New York and Limerick, Ireland as well as growth in our Tarrytown, New York headquarters as we continue to grow our employee base. Regeneron's balance sheet had $1.64 billion of cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2016. Less than $500,000 of our originally issued $400 million of convertible senior notes due October 1, 2016, remain outstanding.
With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Michael."

As you know, even in studies with hundreds of patients in them, as we've of course seen, we have as much experience as anybody alone and with our collaborators in doing these large studies, there can be a lot of variability in letters gained. So we designed the study to include a second stage as well that actually shows the effects of adding on therapy on top within the same groups. That we predict to be a more powerful way of confirming if there are added benefits of the PDGF therapy. So we will have the first type of comparison, which we consider perhaps to be slightly less powerful, in the time frame that I just described, and then we will also be getting the second stage of data.

And that has happened in a few plans already. With regards to the prior authorization paperwork, some of the payers had prior authorizations that required 10s -- or almost up to 40 questions. It became very tedious for the physicians. So some of the plans have begun to change their prior authorization to be simpler. And again, that is in place in a few payers now. I think the real driver that's going to change things is going to be when we get the OUTCOMES data for the product."

It seems to me there are 3 ways -- 3 important factors you can consider. Assuming that we have a relatively high satisfaction rate that patients who get on the drug, get their cholesterol lowered and tolerate the drug, this is not like hepatitis C market. Those should be long-term patients. So we begin to accumulate as opposed to constantly having to find to replace, as you would, let's say, in a hep C environment. Secondly, as Bob said, this is -- the cardiologists are not like the rheumatologists where they have people in their office who are very experienced in dealing with these prior authorizations and paperwork. And I think that they are getting more efficient at it. They are somewhat frustrated by it for sure and some of them are giving up. Some say, ""well, I'll wait for outcomes before I go to the mat with fights"" and things like that. But I do believe that the experience of the doctors in picking the patients that they know that each PBM for each patient or each payer, if you will, they kind of know -- are getting better at knowing how to get this done as they get more experience. And then, of course, finally, as George mentioned, we hope that the OUTCOMES data later this year will change the dynamic out there in terms of the feeling, the compelling need to go on these products if we show an OUTCOMES benefit."

We have consistently seen it in our atopic dermatitis studies. We have not seen it in our asthma studies. As you know, there's differences, for examples, in the way topical steroids are used in the populations and so forth, and we have various ideas about why this may be the case. That said, even though it seems specific to the way the drug is being used in this particular patient population and perhaps with either the use or actually the less use of topical steroids in the treated patients, the comforting thing is that these patients do have, as we pointed out in the call, they do have already a lot of history of conjunctivitis. So this is not really something brand-new to the patients. And the conjunctivitis that is seen here on dupilumab seems to be of mild to moderate severity and is limited. Most cases actually resolve during treatment and very few, if any, cases actually lead to discontinuation. So it seems as if the benefit/risk is really maintained in the face of this. That said, also, in terms of the second part of your question about dupilumab, we think it's a very different situation compared to Praluent. I mean there is a huge unmet need here. Patients are really suffering from ongoing symptomatology. And the data actually shows that this symptomatology is actually markedly improved with the dupilumab treatment. So that it seems to us that there's going to be a lot of patients who really are -- and we already know, who are going to be so positively impacted in their life that they're going to be demanding this drug. And it seems to us that these patients will deserve to have this first systemic therapy that can really make a difference in their lives. Let me remind you that this is -- we're talking about the most moderate to severe class of the patients here, which are more than 1 million patients in the United States alone, and these patients really have very few other alternatives. And as you see with our data in CHRONOS, where we treat on top of topical steroids, the standard of care, very few, only about 10% of the patients or so, become clear or almost clear with topical steroids as opposed to about 40% on the drug. And there's not only, of course, the cosmetic effects of having these skin lesions and so forth and the associated infections and so forth that you get, but there's an enormous amount of itch, which drives a lot of behavioral problems and so forth. There's associated depressive and psychological symptomatology here and so forth. And we've actually shown that much of this is actually impacted in our studies. So we think this can be a very important drug for this population of patients, and we think that there's going to be a very important opportunity to make a lot of difference in a lot of peoples' lives, which is what should count in this business. But beyond that, I think that we also have to remember that dupilumab is really a franchise onto itself. The data really suggest that we have hit upon here with blocking both interleukin-4 and -13, the critical drivers of allergic disease in general. We're hoping ODYSSEY to extend the findings from our first pivotal study in asthma by confirming them with the second pivotal study. And we will also be continuing to study in other allergic diseases where, as you've already seen, we already have some positive data in other allergic diseases in early stage studies as well. So this can benefit, not only the allergic and atopic disease of atopic dermatitis, but we hope to be able to have studies that confirm it to additional allergic diseases as well."

But patients with atopic dermatitis really suffer. It's really made its way into pop culture. There's a new series on HBO. I don't know if any of you have seen it, called The Night Of. And the actor, John Turturro, portrays this lawyer who suffers terribly from atopic dermatitis. He has to wear sandals. He goes to group to discuss all this.

This appears to be more of a immunomodulator that is correcting an immune deviation. And actually, as we reported and as we summarized during this call, there is no increase in infections and in serious infections here. So once again, this is an important option that's being offered to the patients in contrast to other alternatives which were essentially immunosuppressing. And to have this sort of efficacy with a nonimmunosuppressing agent, I think is also offering a lot of hope to patients."

So as George pointed out, there are approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States who are uncontrolled on topical therapies who have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. A very small proportion of those patients have received other therapies, immunosuppressant agents, generally not biologics, but things like cyclosporine and methotrexate. The challenge with those therapies is you can't use them long term. They've got some toxicities that really interfere with the patient's long-term use of the therapy. And thus, their symptoms will come back, their itch will come back and their quality of life will decrease. So there is a huge opportunity for dupilumab in these uncontrolled moderate to severe patients. There's a pent-up demand among patients and physicians to get the patients on therapy and to improve their lives."

I'd like to begin by giving you a high-level sense of our near-term and longer-term priorities at Regeneron.  
EYLEA, our flagship anti-VEGF, continues to remain a key financial driver for Regeneron. We are pleased with the continued growth of EYLEA and are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the branded anti-VEGF market by pursuing both additional indications for EYLEA, such as diabetic retinopathy, where we currently have a Phase III study ongoing. And we are also looking at ways in which we can improve upon the high efficacy bar set by EYLEA to combinations with an antibody to ANG2, where we currently have 2 Phase II studies ongoing. 
While EYLEA remains very important to our business, we are equally focused on the ongoing launch of PRALUENT, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol as well as advancing our pipeline. For PRALUENT, we believe that if outcomes data are positive, it will drive greater use of this class. As mentioned in our press release, we expect the second interim analysis by the end of this month. 
Moving on to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. As you heard last week, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. This was due to certain manufacturing deficiencies not specific to sarilumab that were observed during a routine inspection of a Sanofi fill and finish plant in France. Sanofi has provided comprehensive responses and is working closely with the FDA to address the deficiencies as expeditiously as possible. It has only been a week since we received the Complete Response Letter. And we are preparing to engage in meaningful discussions with the FDA. So it is too early for us to comment on the expected time line for potential sarilumab approval. 
We do not expect these manufacturing deficiencies will impact dupilumab or as it is now known by its brand name, Dupixent, where our Biologics License Application, or BLA, is currently under FDA priority review for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults. The FDA action date for the BLA is at the end of March. Dupixent is a very important pipeline product candidate for us. And we believe that atopic dermatitis represents an area of high unmet need. As a reminder, we received breakthrough designation in this indication. In addition to atopic dermatitis, we are also investigating Dupixent in other indications, including asthma, where we recently completed enrollment in our second pivotal study. 
In the mid-term, we are looking to important clinical progress from several of our Phase II and III programs, which span a variety of therapeutic areas, such as allergic diseases, pain, viral diseases, ophthalmology, oncology, cardiometabolic disease, inflammatory and rare diseases. These programs have the potential to drive the next wave of growth for Regeneron. You will hear more about the key current developments from some of these programs from George. 
At Regeneron, we've always been committed to long-term science and innovation. In fact, today's marketed products as well as the 16 product candidates in clinical development were all home-grown in our internal R&D engine. We will continue to invest in science and technology that can provide sustainable innovation and growth well into the future. This unique long-term focus on science is at the heart of why we have been able to attract top talent, which is key to our continuing success. Through that end, last week, we were thrilled to be named by Science Magazine as the #1 company in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry to work for, a recognition we have received for 4 of the last 6 years. 
We know that our industry has faced many important questions regarding pricing of drugs. This is not the forum to discuss the complex issue of drug pricing. But I think it is important to note that Regeneron is in a unique position. As a company founded on science and committed to the research and development of important new products, we are well positioned to succeed even in a difficult and constrained pricing environment. In fact, we have never raised prices on any of our drugs, choosing instead to grow through the optimization of currently marketed products by pursuing new indications as well as the introduction of new medicines. Our future potential growth will be driven by this strategy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late-stage drug candidates in the industry.

I'd like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late-stage drug candidates in the industry. We are investigating Dupixent in a wide variety of allergic diseases. The most advanced of which is uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
Just last month, we had the opportunity to present detailed results from SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, which were 2 identical Phase III studies that investigated Dupixent in the monotherapy setting at the annual EADV conference. These data were also concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These were the first large pivotal studies where a systemic investigational therapy demonstrated significant reduction in the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis with an average reduction in skin scores of about 70%, accompanied by a marked reduction in the usually unrelenting itch associated with this disease and almost 40% of these patients achieving clearing or near-clearing of the skin lesions. 
Unlike other immune modulating therapies, there was no evidence of increased immunosuppression. And the most common adverse events in the 2 trials were injection site reactions and conjunctivitis. We were encouraged by the excitement with which these data were received by the physician community as well as by patients. And we believe that this speaks to the current unmet need and frustration with currently available therapies for this severely debilitating disease. As Len mentioned, our BLA for Dupixent for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is currently under FDA review and has been given priority review status and an action date of March 29, 2017. 
While the SOLO studies were in the monotherapy setting, we have also reported positive 1-year top line data from the CHRONOS Phase III study, which explored Dupixent in combination with topical corticosteroids. The safety and efficacy findings from the long-term CHRONOS study were consistent with those observed in SOLO 1 and 2. I'm also pleased to share that LIBERTY AD CAFÉ, a Phase III study of Dupixent with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or are intolerant to or ineligible for oral cyclosporine, is now fully enrolled. We, along with our collaborator Sanofi, expect to complete the regulatory resubmission in Europe and Japan in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric severe atopic dermatitis population in the first quarter of 2017 in patients between the ages of 12 and 17. We are pleased that similar to the adult indications, Dupixent has received breakthrough designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
While atopic dermatitis is the most advanced indication in development for Dupixent, we are making headway with our asthma program as well. We have previously announced positive results from our first pivotal study in uncontrolled persistent asthma despite treatment with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonists. As a reminder, these data demonstrated improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV and exacerbations in all patients regardless of baseline eosinophil status. There was a 15% improvement above placebo in FEV1 and a 75% reduction in exacerbations in the overall population treated with the 300-milligram, every 2-week dose. The most common adverse events associated with treatment in this study was injection site reaction. 
In September, we announced completion of enrollment in LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, which is our confirmatory Phase III pivotal study of Dupixent in this indication. The primary endpoint of this study is at 52 weeks. And we, therefore, expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. towards the end of 2017. We also expect to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric asthma patients in early 2017. We are also exploring the use of Dupixent in several other allergic indications, such as nasal polyps, where we expect to initiate a Phase III study early next year. And in eosinophilic esophagitis, we are currently in a Phase II. 
Turning to fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor antibody for pain. In October, we provided an update on this program. Following the observation of a case of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis in a patient receiving high-dose fasinumab, who had a history of advanced osteoarthritis of the knee, the FDA placed our Phase II study in chronic lower back pain patients on clinical hold. This event prompted an unplanned interim analysis of the study, which had already completed 70% of its targeted enrollment. The unplanned analysis showed clear evidence of efficacy with improvement in pain scores in all fasinumab groups compared to placebo at 8- and 12-week time points with p-value of less than 0.01. Preliminary safety results were also generally consistent with those observed previously with this class. The FDA has since communicated that we can continue development of fasinumab in chronic lower back pain by excluding patients who have advanced osteoarthritis. We are also continuing our pivotal program in osteoarthritis with final design elements still receiving regulatory feedback. The fasinumab program will contain safety data from approximately 10,000 patients overall.
Moving to PRALUENT. The recent news on the discontinuation of development of bococizumab obviously has a major impact on the PCSK9 landscape. This further underscores the very high bar in terms of safety and efficacy for this class. This example also highlights to us the value of our fully human VelocImmune-based antibody technology. In terms of our PRALUENT program, our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, remains ongoing. We expect the second interim analysis for futility and overwhelming efficacy by the end of this month. We, and our collaborator Sanofi, have also completed regulatory submissions for the once-monthly dosing formulation of PRALUENT in the Europe and Japan territories as well as in the United States, where we have been granted an FDA action date of January 24, 2017. 
Our immuno-oncology program continues to advance and expand. We believe that these are still early days in the area of immuno-oncology with the collective knowledge of this field evolving rapidly and the competitive landscape changing continuously. Evidence of this includes the recent surprising failure of the market-leading PD-1 antibody in first-line lung cancer. Regarding our PD-1 program, our potentially pivotal study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is ongoing and we plan to announce additional studies in the near future. In addition, we're also studying PD-1 in combination with our bispecific CD20xCD3 molecule. At the end of this year, at the American Society of Hematology or ASH conference, we will be presenting monotherapy data from the CD20xCD3 program. Lastly, we plan to advance Regeneron 3767 [ph], an antibody LAG3, into clinical development by the end 2016. 
In October, we announced top line results from a Phase II combination study of EYLEA with rinucumab, our PDGF receptor antibody in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD, where the data demonstrated no improvement in best corrected visual acuity or BCVA, the primary endpoint of the study, versus EYLEA alone. We think these study results demonstrate the high hurdle that has been set by the well-established efficacy and safety of EYLEA. That said, we are looking for ways in which we can strengthen our EYLEA franchise. To that end, we are conducting a Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to ANG2, in AMD and DME. The DME study is full enrolled while the study in wet AMD continues to enroll patients. We are also exploring longer-acting approaches with this class. 
And with that summary, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $854 million and year-to-date sales were $2.5 billion. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $471 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth, unadjusted for currency fluctuations. Net ex U.S. year-to-date sales were $1.4 billion. EYLEA is the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its proven indications in the United States. In the U.S., we are seeing increased competitor discounts and rebates. We are carefully assessing these actions. As I'm sure you are well aware, there's a pending proposal for the Centers of Medicare Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B or buy-and-build drugs. We worked hard on the policy and legislative front on this issue, and we will be prepared to respond on the commercial front as needed to make sure that patients continue to have full and complete access to EYLEA.
Turning now to Praluent or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the third quarter were $38 million worldwide, with the U.S. accounting for $32 million of the total. Sales data and IMS total prescription data indicate that Praluent and alirocumab market shares are roughly 50-50 in the United States. As reported by IMS, U.S. total prescriptions of Praluent increased sequentially 60% versus second quarter 2016. The challenge for the PCSK9 inhibitor class continues to be the significant reimbursement hurdles for the physicians, offices and patients, resulting in a low volume of prescriptions being dispensed. This has resulted in physician offices reserving their initial prescriptions to a limited pool of patients. We continue to focus our efforts in improving access and improving the prescription process to the payers and specialty pharmacies. We're gradually seeing more payers losing their utilization management criteria, including removing the requirement for prior therapy. In addition, we're now seeing some patients shortening the number of months that a patient needs to be on a maximum-tolerated statin therapy and eliminating a specialist only prescribing our consultation requirement. Others have streamlined the prior authorization process. ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data if positive are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of Praluent. Outside of the United States, Praluent was approved in the EU in September of 2015, with the product now approved in 41 countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K., Spain, Norway and The Netherlands. It still remains a challenging reimbursement situation with some countries awaiting cardiovascular OUTCOMES data. We continue to plan for the potential launch of sarilumab in the United States. As an example, we have a major presence at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting this month in Washington, D.C. We'll be presenting data from our MONARCH Study of sarilumab as monotherapy in patients who are [indiscernible] responders as well as subset analysis from our pivotal U.S. registration studies. We'll have a display floor present highlighting the central role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis. European marketing authorization application for sarilumab is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency, with a potential decision on the application expected in mid-2017. Co-promotion decisions for Europe and other x U.S. countries will be made over time.
We're currently preparing for Dupixent or dupilumab commercialization, with an FDA PDUFA date of March 29, 2017. We will be co-promoting Dupixent with Sanofi Genzyme in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. We are aware that Kaiser, payers and pharmacy benefits managers are proactively evaluating the cost-effectiveness of emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis in the United States. We want to take a moment to discuss how we're thinking about the Dupixent commercial opportunity, which differs in many important respects in the situation we faced with Praluent. Dupixent has already demonstrated efficacy on the most important outcomes. Consistent efficacy on rash severity, itching and quality of my life measures. In the United States, there are 1.6 million patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The majority of which will not likely receive Dupixent therapy. We estimate that approximately 300,000 of these patients have exhausted all approved therapies and have failed or unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressant therapies. Many of these advanced patients are suffering from a host of related issues, including sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. These atopic dermatitis patients should not be denied therapy. We hope payers and insurers will provide appropriate and timely access to Dupixent should it be approved, and the patients should not have to step through unapproved immunosuppressant therapies, many of which have brought black box warnings. We plan to work closely with all stakeholders, including patients, physicians and payers to achieve this goal. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."

Regeneron posted strong financial results in the third quarter of 2016 as well as entered into 2 new exciting collaborations. We were also lowering and tightening full year 2016 guidance on non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, non-GAAP SG&A, our effective tax rate and capital expenditures. Let me start with our top line third quarter earnings. In the third quarter 2016, non-GAAP net income was $365 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $3.13. This represents an increase of 32% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Regeneron's third quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and the $25 million up front payment made in connection with our third quarter 2016 license, in collaboration agreement with and includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% over the third quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $857 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $738 million in the third quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $854 million compared to $734 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing 16% year-over-year growth; sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was approximately 3%. 
During the third quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the second quarter of 2016 but continues to be within our normal 1 to 2 weeks targeted range.
As mentioned in our press release issued this morning, we're tightening our full year 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of 23% to 25%. X U.S. EYLEA sales, where were product revenues are recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $471 million in third quarter of 2016 compared to $371 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing a 27% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 25%. In the third quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $171 million from our share in net profits of EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $191 million. 
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $144 million for the third quarter of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consist of reimbursement average entering-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits and losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. In the third quarter of 2016, our share of the collaborations losses in connection with commercialization of antibodies, which includes Praluent and pre-commercialization activities and cost in connection with sarilumab, Dupixent was $112 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within this collaboration losses were a global sales of Praluent as recognized by our collaborator Sanofi of $38 million for the third quarter of 2016. Before moving to expenses, I'd like to highlight 2 third quarter business development transactions. The first is the collaboration we entered into with Teva to develop and commercialize our NGF antibody, fasinumab. Under the terms of the agreement, Teva paid Regeneron a $250 million upfront payment that we will equally share on an ongoing basis R&D expenses of approximately $1 billion under a global development plan, we plan to radically recognize the upfront payment as revenue over the related performance bearded. The signing of this agreement did not have a material P&L impact in the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the intellectual property associated with our late-stage pipeline, including fasinumab, has been migrated offshore. Thus, expenses associated with the program will be recognized in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate. 
The other 2016 third quarter business development transaction was a collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immuned cell therapeutics. In accordance with this agreement, we paid Adicet a $25 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2016, which we have recorded as GAAP R&D expense in our consolidated statement of operations but have excluded from our non-GAAP net income. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense, less R&D noncash share-based compensation expense as well as the upfront payment we made to collaborator, Adicet, was $437 million for the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators was $256 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information as required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. As a result of the recently executed collaboration with Teva regarding fasinumab, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, to be in the range of $945 million to $975 million from our previous guidance range of $970 million to just over $1 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $221 million for the third quarter 2016. We're tightening and lowering our full year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $965 million to $995 million from our previous guidance range of $980 million to $1.02 billion. Note that even after lowering and tightening our full year guidance, we do not expect to see any material prelaunch cost savings from the PDUFA delay of sarilumab. We will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi , and our sales forces is already on board. And as you heard earlier from Bob Terifay, we continue to prepare for the launch and anticipation of the resolution of matters with the FDA. Sanofi reimbursement of the Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, the line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $66 million for the third quarter of 2016. We are tightening our full year 2016 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $310 million to $335 million from $310 million to $340 million. 
Turning now to taxes. Effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 27.6% as compared to 46.5% in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, inclusion of the tax benefit of share-based compensation and the impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction as compared to the same quarter of last year as well as the discrete impact to this quarter of a change in our assessment of reserves for uncertain tax positions. 
For 2016, we are lowering and tightening guidance for our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be 29% to 33% from the previously provided range of 33% to 41%. Our capital expenditures for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, we're $361 million. 
For the full year 2016, we are lowering and tightening our guidance for capital expenditures to be  in the range of $480 million to $510 million from the previously provided range of $480 million to $530 million. 2016 capital expenditures primarily include costs in connection with renovations of our Limerick Ireland manufacturing facility; tenant improvement and associated costs at our Tarrytown, New York facilities; renovations and addition store in Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facilities; and the purchase of an office building near our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. We ended the third quarter of 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, which includes the Teva upfront payment of $250 million. As we have reported in previous quarters, we have opportunistically reduced the number of warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt issuance through repurchases from the warrant counter parties. Depending on market and other conditions we may spend up to $450 million to repurchase or settle these outstanding warrants. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Michael."

And 1/4 of the patients have 85% or more of their body covered with this disease. This just shows how severely these patients are. And it's not just that their skin is covered with this rash but this is a weepy, itchy, horrific rash that they just can't escape. And remarkably, enough as we said, despite the heavy burden of disease at baseline, almost 40% of these patients achieved a clearer, almost clear status. Rarely in this business do you have a privilege to be involved in a story like this that can make such a difference in patients lives. We've been lucky here in Regeneron that we've done this a couple of times already. But we think that Dupixent is really a once-in-a-lifetime story where you can really impact such an important disease so dramatically, have an average 70% improvement among all patients. And the thing that's also so stunning to us about dupilumab is that it looks like it might have the promise to do likewise in a host of related allergic disease, including the overall asthma population where there again in the most uncontrolled severe population. Once again, the results are very impressive from our first pivotal study. And we think the same is being the case and a host of other allergic settings. So the short answer to your question is, unfortunately, there's a lot of patients who have more than 50% of their body surface covered. Those patients are certainly, by any category, considered severe patients. As Bob already told you, many of them have exhausted all other options. And we just hope that the -- all the other ancillary things don't keep these important patients from getting access to this important life-changing drug."

We knew that with Praluent, of course, that we can lower cholesterol rather dramatically. But to most patients, unless they're highly involved in the details of their care, which some are. But many, to them, that isn't the end-all be-all or something they wake up everyday wondering how to get that cholesterol down. Of course, if they have an art that and everybody to family does and they do pay attention to that. And then there was the push back well, you don't really know do you that it improves outcomes. We're just going on a hypothesis even know there's a quite a deal of data to certainly support that hypothesis. So it's not a disease that people are clamoring to get treated and is not outcomes that are readily in hand. Contrast that with Praluent where these patients are desperate for treatment, truly desperate for treatment. And we're not talking about the topical treatments that are available such as steroids that might become available when you're dealing with small areas of relatively mild to moderate disease. We're talking about the kind of patients George referred to, which are really quite significant. And these patients can see the outcome themselves. They can tell that they're doing better. And we see it in our studies, we see it in our questionnaires. We see it in whether or not they're sleeping because they can scratch themselves so badly. I heard a story the other day which practically it was but as all to tears where a little boy who was visiting his grandparents and so is cuddling and sleeping on the same bed  with very bad atopic dermatitis, said to his grand parents, can you each hold one of my hands when I sleep so I don't scratch myself so badly. I mean, think about that. This is a disease that people really are looking for treatments. And if we can get this drug approved, first, for adults and, hopefully, down the road, for children, we can really provide something that they can tangibly feel. We're passionate about making sure that we remove all the barriers out there, and we expect to work with patients, with doctors, with payers, with organizations to make sure that people are aware of this treatment and can get access to it.

I'd like to begin by giving you a high-level sense of our near-term and longer-term priorities at Regeneron.  
EYLEA, our flagship anti-VEGF, continues to remain a key financial driver for Regeneron. We are pleased with the continued growth of EYLEA and are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the branded anti-VEGF market by pursuing both additional indications for EYLEA, such as diabetic retinopathy, where we currently have a Phase III study ongoing. And we are also looking at ways in which we can improve upon the high efficacy bar set by EYLEA to combinations with an antibody to ANG2, where we currently have 2 Phase II studies ongoing. 
While EYLEA remains very important to our business, we are equally focused on the ongoing launch of PRALUENT, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol as well as advancing our pipeline. For PRALUENT, we believe that if OUTCOMES data are positive, it will drive greater use of this class. As mentioned in our press release, we expect the second interim analysis by the end of this month. 
Moving on to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. As you heard last week, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. This was due to certain manufacturing deficiencies not specific to sarilumab that were observed during a routine inspection of a Sanofi fill and finish plant in France. Sanofi has provided comprehensive responses and is working closely with the FDA to address the deficiencies as expeditiously as possible. It has only been a week since we received the Complete Response Letter. And we are preparing to engage in meaningful discussions with the FDA. So it is too early for us to comment on the expected time line for potential sarilumab approval. 
We do not expect these manufacturing deficiencies will impact dupilumab or as it is now known by its brand name, Dupixent, where our Biologics License Application, or BLA, is currently under FDA priority review for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults. The FDA action date for the BLA is at the end of March. Dupixent is a very important pipeline product candidate for us. And we believe that atopic dermatitis represents an area of high unmet need. As a reminder, we received breakthrough designation in this indication. In addition to atopic dermatitis, we are also investigating Dupixent in other indications, including asthma, where we recently completed enrollment in our second pivotal study. 
In the mid-term, we are looking to important clinical progress from several of our Phase II and III programs, which span a variety of therapeutic areas, such as allergic diseases, pain, viral diseases, ophthalmology, oncology, cardiometabolic disease, inflammatory and rare diseases. These programs have the potential to drive the next wave of growth for Regeneron. You will hear more about the key current developments from some of these programs from George. 
At Regeneron, we've always been committed to long-term science and innovation. In fact, today's marketed products as well as the 16 product candidates in clinical development were all home-grown in our internal R&D engine. We will continue to invest in science and technology that can provide sustainable innovation and growth well into the future. This unique long-term focus on science is at the heart of why we have been able to attract top talent, which is key to our continuing success. Through that end, last week, we were thrilled to be named by Science Magazine as the #1 company in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry to work for, a recognition we have received for 4 of the last 6 years. 
We know that our industry has faced many important questions regarding pricing of drugs. This is not the forum to discuss the complex issue of drug pricing. But I think it is important to note that Regeneron is in a unique position. As a company founded on science and committed to the research and development of important new products, we are well positioned to succeed even in a difficult and constrained pricing environment. In fact, we have never raised prices on any of our drugs, choosing instead to grow through the optimization of currently marketed products by pursuing new indications as well as the introduction of new medicines. Our future potential growth will be driven by this strategy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late-stage drug candidates in the industry. We are investigating Dupixent in a wide variety of allergic diseases. The most advanced of which is uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
Just last month, we had the opportunity to present detailed results from SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, which were 2 identical Phase III studies that investigated Dupixent in the monotherapy setting at the annual EADV conference. These data were also concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These were the first large pivotal studies where a systemic investigational therapy demonstrated significant reduction in the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis with an average reduction in skin scores of about 70%, accompanied by a marked reduction in the usually unrelenting itch associated with this disease and almost 40% of these patients achieving clearing or near-clearing of the skin lesions. 
Unlike other immune modulating therapies, there was no evidence of increased immunosuppression. And the most common adverse events in the 2 trials were injection site reactions and conjunctivitis. We were encouraged by the excitement with which these data were received by the physician community as well as by patients. And we believe that this speaks to the current unmet need and frustration with currently available therapies for this severely debilitating disease. As Len mentioned, our BLA for Dupixent for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is currently under FDA review and has been given priority review status and an action date of March 29, 2017. 
While the SOLO studies were in the monotherapy setting, we have also reported positive 1-year top line data from the CHRONOS Phase III study, which explored Dupixent in combination with topical corticosteroids. The safety and efficacy findings from the long-term CHRONOS study were consistent with those observed in SOLO 1 and 2. I'm also pleased to share that LIBERTY AD CAFÉ, a Phase III study of Dupixent with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or are intolerant to or ineligible for oral cyclosporine, is now fully enrolled. We, along with our collaborator Sanofi, expect to complete the regulatory resubmission in Europe and Japan in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric severe atopic dermatitis population in the first quarter of 2017 in patients between the ages of 12 and 17. We are pleased that similar to the adult indications, Dupixent has received breakthrough designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
While atopic dermatitis is the most advanced indication in development for Dupixent, we are making headway with our asthma program as well. We have previously announced positive results from our first pivotal study in uncontrolled persistent asthma despite treatment with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonists. As a reminder, these data demonstrated improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV and exacerbations in all patients regardless of baseline eosinophil status. There was a 15% improvement above placebo in FEV1 and a 75% reduction in exacerbations in the overall population treated with the 300-milligram, every 2-week dose. The most common adverse events associated with treatment in this study was injection site reaction. 
In September, we announced completion of enrollment in LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, which is our confirmatory Phase III pivotal study of Dupixent in this indication. The primary endpoint of this study is at 52 weeks. And we, therefore, expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. towards the end of 2017. We also expect to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric asthma patients in early 2017. We are also exploring the use of Dupixent in several other allergic indications, such as nasal polyps, where we expect to initiate a Phase III study early next year. And in eosinophilic esophagitis, we are currently in a Phase II. 
Turning to fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor antibody for pain. In October, we provided an update on this program. Following the observation of a case of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis in a patient receiving high-dose fasinumab, who had a history of advanced osteoarthritis of the knee, the FDA placed our Phase II study in chronic lower back pain patients on clinical hold. This event prompted an unplanned interim analysis of the study, which had already completed 70% of its targeted enrollment. The unplanned analysis showed clear evidence of efficacy with improvement in pain scores in all fasinumab groups compared to placebo at 8- and 12-week time points with p-value of less than 0.01. Preliminary safety results were also generally consistent with those observed previously with this class. The FDA has since communicated that we can continue development of fasinumab in chronic lower back pain by excluding patients who have advanced osteoarthritis. We are also continuing our pivotal program in osteoarthritis with final design elements still receiving regulatory feedback. The fasinumab program will contain safety data from approximately 10,000 patients overall.
Moving to PRALUENT. The recent news on the discontinuation of development of bococizumab obviously has a major impact on the PCSK9 landscape. This further underscores the very high bar in terms of safety and efficacy for this class. This example also highlights to us the value of our fully human VelocImmune-based antibody technology. In terms of our PRALUENT program, our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, remains ongoing. We expect the second interim analysis for futility and overwhelming efficacy by the end of this month. We, and our collaborator Sanofi, have also completed regulatory submissions for the once-monthly dosing formulation of PRALUENT in the Europe and Japan territories as well as in the United States, where we have been granted an FDA action date of January 24, 2017. 
Our immuno-oncology program continues to advance and expand. We believe that these are still early days in the area of immuno-oncology with the collective knowledge of this field evolving rapidly and the competitive landscape changing continuously. Evidence of this includes the recent surprising failure of the market-leading PD-1 antibody in first-line lung cancer. Regarding our PD-1 program, our potentially pivotal study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is ongoing and we plan to announce additional studies in the near future. In addition, we're also studying PD-1 in combination with our bispecific CD20xCD3 molecule. At the end of this year, at the American Society of Hematology or ASH conference, we will be presenting monotherapy data from the CD20xCD3 program. Lastly, we plan to advance Regeneron 3767 [ph], an antibody LAG3, into clinical development by the end 2016. 
In October, we announced top line results from a Phase II combination study of EYLEA with rinucumab, our PDGF receptor antibody in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD, where the data demonstrated no improvement in best corrected visual acuity or BCVA, the primary endpoint of the study, versus EYLEA alone. We think these study results demonstrate the high hurdle that has been set by the well-established efficacy and safety of EYLEA. That said, we are looking for ways in which we can strengthen our EYLEA franchise. To that end, we are conducting a Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to ANG2, in AMD and DME. The DME study is full enrolled while the study in wet AMD continues to enroll patients. We are also exploring longer-acting approaches with this class. 
And with that summary, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $854 million and year-to-date sales were $2.5 billion. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $471 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth, unadjusted for currency fluctuations. Net ex U.S. year-to-date sales were $1.4 billion. 
EYLEA is the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. In the U.S., we are seeing increased competitor discounts and rebates. We are carefully assessing these actions. As I'm sure you're well aware, there's a pending proposal from the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B or buy-and-bill drugs. We've worked hard on the policy and legislative front on this issue. And we'll be prepared to respond on the commercial front as needed to make sure that patients continue to have full and complete access to EYLEA.
Turning now to PRALUENT or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the third quarter were $38 million worldwide with U.S. accounting for $32 million of the total. Sales data and IMS total prescription data indicate that PRALUENT and evolocumab market share are roughly 50-50 in the United States. As reported by IMS, U.S. total prescriptions for PRALUENT increased sequentially 60% versus second quarter 2016. 
The challenge for the PCSK9 inhibitor class continues to be the significant reimbursement hurdles for the physicians' offices and patients, resulting in a low volume of prescriptions being dispensed. This has resulted in physicians' offices reserving their initial prescriptions to a limited pool of patients. We continue to focus our efforts in improving access and improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. We're gradually seeing more payers loosen their utilization management criteria, including removing their requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. In addition, we are now seeing some patients shortening the number of months that a patient needs to be on a maximally tolerated statin therapy and eliminating a specialist-only prescribing or consultation requirement. Others have streamlined the prior authorization process. 
ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of PRALUENT. Outside of the United States, PRALUENT was approved in the EU in September of 2015 with the product now approved in 41 countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K., Spain, Norway and the Netherlands. It still remains a challenging reimbursement situation with some countries awaiting cardiovascular OUTCOMES data. 
We continue to plan for the potential launch of sarilumab in the United States. As an example, we have a major presence at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting this month in Washington, D.C. We'll be presenting data from our MONARCH study of sarilumab as monotherapy in patients who are DMARD responders as well as subset analysis from our pivotal U.S. registrational studies. We'll have a display floor presence highlighting the central role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis. The European Marketing Authorization Application for sarilumab is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency with a potential decision on the application expected in mid-2017. Co-promotion decisions for Europe and other ex U.S. countries will be made over time.
We're currently preparing for Dupixent or dupilumab commercialization with an FDA PDUFA date of March 29, 2017. We will be co-promoting Dupixent with Sanofi-Genzyme in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. We are aware that ICER, payers and pharmacy benefits managers are proactively evaluating the cost-effectiveness of emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis in the United States. We want to take a moment to discuss how we are thinking about the Dupixent commercial opportunity, which differs in many important respects from the situation we faced with PRALUENT. 
Dupixent has already demonstrated efficacy on the most important outcomes: consistent efficacy on rash severity, itching and quality of life measures. In the United States, there are 1.6 million patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, the majority of which will not likely receive Dupixent therapy. We estimate that approximately 300,000 of these patients have exhausted all approved therapies and have failed or unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressant therapies. Many of these advanced patients are suffering from a host of related issues, including sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. These atopic dermatitis patients should not be denied therapy. We hope payers and insurers will provide appropriate and timely access to Dupixent, should it be approved, and that patients will not have to step through unapproved immunosuppressant therapies, many of which have black box warnings. We plan to work closely with all stakeholders, including patients, physicians and payers to achieve this goal. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."

We are also lowering and tightening full year 2016 guidance on non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, non-GAAP",1331,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning. Regeneron posted strong financial results in the third quarter of 2016 as well as entered into 2 new exciting collaborations. We are also lowering and tightening full year 2016 guidance on non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, non-GAAP SG&A, our effective tax rate and capital expenditures. 
Let me start with our top line third quarter earnings. In the third quarter 2016, non-GAAP net income was $365 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $3.13. This represents an increase of 32% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Regeneron's third quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and the $25 million upfront payment made in connection with our third quarter 2016 license and collaboration agreement with Adicet and includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% over the third quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $857 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $738 million in the third quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $854 million compared to $734 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was approximately 3%. During the third quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the second quarter of 2016 but continues to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range.
As mentioned in our press release issued this morning, we're tightening our full year 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of 23% to 25%. Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $471 million in third quarter of 2016 compared to $371 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing a 27% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 25%. In the third quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $171 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $191 million. 
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $144 million for the third quarter of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. In the third quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies, which includes PRALUENT and pre-commercialization activities and costs in connection with sarilumab and Dupixent, was $112 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within these collaboration losses were the global sales of PRALUENT as recognized by our collaborator Sanofi of $38 million for the third quarter of 2016. 
Before moving to expenses, I'd like to highlight 2 third quarter business development transactions. The first is the collaboration we entered into with Teva to develop and commercialize our NGF antibody, fasinumab. Under the terms of the agreement, Teva paid Regeneron a $250 million upfront payment and we will equally share on an ongoing basis R&D expenses of approximately $1 billion under a global development plan. We plan to ratably recognize the upfront payment as revenue over the related performance period. The signing of this agreement did not have a material P&L impact on the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the intellectual property associated with our late-stage pipeline, including fasinumab, has been migrated offshore, thus expenses and revenues associated with the program will be recognized in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The other 2016 third quarter business development transaction was a collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immune cell therapeutics. In accordance with this agreement, we paid Adicet a $25 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2016, which we have recorded as GAAP R&D expense in our consolidated statement of operations but have excluded from our non-GAAP net income. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D noncash share-based compensation expense as well as the upfront payment we made to collaborator Adicet, was $437 million for the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $256 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information as required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. As a result of the recently executed collaboration with Teva regarding fasinumab, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $945 million to $975 million from our previous guidance range of $970 million to just over $1 billion. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $221 million for the third quarter 2016. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $965 million to $995 million from our previous guidance range of $980 million to $1.02 billion. Note that even after lowering and tightening our full year guidance, we do not expect to see any material prelaunch cost savings from the PDUFA delay of sarilumab, we will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi-Genzyme and our sales force is already onboard. And as you heard earlier from Bob Terifay, we continue to prepare for the launch in anticipation of the resolution of matters with the FDA. Sanofi reimbursement of the Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $66 million for the third quarter of 2016. We are tightening our full year 2016 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $310 million to $335 million from $310 million to $340 million. 
Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2016 was 27.6% as compared to 46.5% in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, inclusion of the tax benefit of share-based compensation and the impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction as compared to the same quarter of last year as well as the discrete impact to this quarter of a change in our assessment of reserves for uncertain tax positions. For 2016, we are lowering and tightening guidance for our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be 29% to 33% from the previously provided range of 33% to 41%. 
Our capital expenditures for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, were $361 million. For the full year 2016, we are lowering and tightening our guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $480 million to $510 million from the previously provided range of $480 million to $530 million. 2016 capital expenditures primarily include costs in connection with renovations of our Limerick, Ireland manufacturing facility; tenant improvement and associated costs at our Tarrytown, New York facility; renovations and additional store at Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facility; and the purchase of an office building near our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. 
We ended the third quarter 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, which includes the Teva upfront payment of $250 million. As we have reported in previous quarters, we have opportunistically reduced the number of warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt issuance through repurchases from the warrant counterparties. Depending on market and other conditions, we may spend up to $450 million to repurchase or settle these outstanding warrants. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Michael."

To me, that suggests some sort of tone deafness in this environment. We think that we have to compete in 2 ways. We have to compete with a very good drug, which we think sarilumab will be. Of course, we have to get over this filling glitch and get to market as quickly as we can. But we think that the class is doing very well. There's some data out there from the first [indiscernible] class, where monotherapy against the leading anti-TNF, the anti-IL-6 receptor class performed better. And there are some people who simply don't like to take methotrexate. We have data of our own, which probably won't be in our first filing, similar types of results with outperforming in monotherapy. But giving a solid entry with good properties is not going to be enough here. And we have to compete with an offering that payers will find attractive. I think Regeneron is not -- is willing to break some of the mold here. And I'm getting some hints from my colleagues that I've probably said enough. So I'll leave it at that."

So we have done very, very well with EYLEA in DME. That has been the driver of growth over the last couple of years, primarily driven by the impressive Protocol T results, which indicated that EYLEA was superior to LUCENTIS and ranibizumab on its primary endpoint. The challenge with continuing growth in DME is that there are a number of patients that never make it to the retinal specialist's office. They go to an ophthalmologist who do laser therapy. Laser is a revenue driver in the ophthalmologist office. And they don't make it to the retina physician's office, where they could get access to anti-VEGF therapy. This has been a focus for us. We are educating. We're trying to educate patients that if they do have DME, they ought to get themselves to a retinal specialist. But this is chipping away at a habit among the ophthalmologists and it's going to take some time. But we continue to see that the DME market does offer substantial growth opportunities in the future. And as Len mentioned earlier, if and when we get the diabetic retinopathy indication, that would be a further driver."

We should just let you know that obviously in our studies, on average, the patients that we study had more than 50% of their body surface at baseline covered by this disease. And 1/4 of the patients had 85% or more of their body covered with this disease. This just shows how severely these patients are. And it's not just that their skin is covered with this rash, but this is a weepy, itchy, horrific rash that they just can't escape. And remarkably, enough as we said, despite the heavy burden of disease at baseline, almost 40% of these patients achieved a clearer, almost clear status. Rarely in this business do you have a privilege to be involved in a story like this that can make such a difference in patients' lives. And we've been lucky here at Regeneron that we've done this a couple of times already. But we think that Dupixent is really a once-in-a-lifetime story, where you can really impact such an important disease so dramatically, have an average 70% improvement among all patients. And the thing that's also so stunning to us about dupilumab is that it looks like it might have the promise to do likewise in a host of related allergic diseases, including the overall asthma population, where there again in the most uncontrolled severe population, once again the results are very impressive from our first pivotal study. And we think the same may be the case in a host of other allergic settings. So the short answer to your question is, unfortunately, there's a lot of patients who have more than 50% of their body surface covered. Those patients are certainly, by any category, considered severe patients. As Bob already told you, many of them have exhausted all other options. And we just hope that the -- all the other ancillary things don't keep these important patients from getting access to this important life-changing drug."

But to most patients, unless they're highly involved in the details of their care, which some are, but many, to them, that isn't the end-all, be-all, something they wake up every day wondering how to get that cholesterol down. Of course, if they've had a heart attack and everybody in their family does, and they do pay attention to that. But then there was the pushback, ""Well, you don't really know, do you, that it improves outcomes?"" We're just going on a hypothesis, even through there's a great deal of data to certainly support that hypothesis. So it's not a disease that people are clamoring to get treated and it's not outcomes that are readily in hand. Contrast that with PRALUENT, where these patients are desperate for treatment, truly desperate for treatment. And we're not talking about the topical treatments that are available, such as steroids that might become available when you're dealing with small areas of relatively mild to moderate disease. We're talking about the kind of patients George referred to, which are really quite significant. And these patients can see the outcome themselves. They can tell that they're doing better. And we see it in our studies, we see it in our questionnaires. We see it whether or not they're sleeping because they can scratch themselves so badly. I heard a story the other day, which practically -- it was group of us that practically brought us all to tears, where a little boy who was visiting his grandparents and so is cuddling and sleeping on the same bed with very bad atopic dermatitis said to his grandparents, ""Can you each hold one of my hands when I sleep, so I don't scratch myself so badly?"" I mean, think about that. This is a disease that people really are looking for treatments. And if we can get this drug approved, first, for adults and hopefully down the road for children, we can really provide something that they can tangibly feel. We're passionate about making sure that we remove all the barriers out there and we expect to work with patients, with doctors, with payers, with organizations to make sure that people are aware of this treatment and can get access to it."

I'd like to begin by giving you a high-level sense of our near-term and longer-term priorities at Regeneron.  
EYLEA, our flagship anti-VEGF, continues to remain a key financial driver for Regeneron. We are pleased with the continued growth of EYLEA and are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the branded anti-VEGF market by pursuing both additional indications for EYLEA, such as diabetic retinopathy, where we currently have a Phase III study ongoing. And we are also looking at ways in which we can improve upon the high efficacy bar set by EYLEA to combinations with an antibody to ANG2, where we currently have 2 Phase II studies ongoing. 
While EYLEA remains very important to our business, we are equally focused on the ongoing launch of PRALUENT, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol as well as advancing our pipeline. For PRALUENT, we believe that if OUTCOMES data are positive, it will drive greater use of this class. As mentioned in our press release, we expect the second interim analysis by the end of this month. 
Moving on to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. As you heard last week, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. This was due to certain manufacturing deficiencies not specific to sarilumab that were observed during a routine inspection of a Sanofi fill and finish plant in France. Sanofi has provided comprehensive responses and is working closely with the FDA to address the deficiencies as expeditiously as possible. It has only been a week since we received the Complete Response Letter. And we are preparing to engage in meaningful discussions with the FDA. So it is too early for us to comment on the expected time line for potential sarilumab approval. 
We do not expect these manufacturing deficiencies will impact dupilumab or as it is now known by its brand name, Dupixent, where our Biologics License Application, or BLA, is currently under FDA priority review for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults. The FDA action date for the BLA is at the end of March. Dupixent is a very important pipeline product candidate for us. And we believe that atopic dermatitis represents an area of high unmet need. As a reminder, we received breakthrough designation in this indication. In addition to atopic dermatitis, we are also investigating Dupixent in other indications, including asthma, where we recently completed enrollment in our second pivotal study. 
In the mid-term, we are looking to important clinical progress from several of our Phase II and III programs, which span a variety of therapeutic areas, such as allergic diseases, pain, viral diseases, ophthalmology, oncology, cardiometabolic disease, inflammatory and rare diseases. These programs have the potential to drive the next wave of growth for Regeneron. You will hear more about the key current developments from some of these programs from George. 
At Regeneron, we've always been committed to long-term science and innovation. In fact, today's marketed products as well as the 16 product candidates in clinical development were all home-grown in our internal R&D engine. We will continue to invest in science and technology that can provide sustainable innovation and growth well into the future. This unique long-term focus on science is at the heart of why we have been able to attract top talent, which is key to our continuing success. Through that end, last week, we were thrilled to be named by Science Magazine as the #1 company in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry to work for, a recognition we have received for 4 of the last 6 years. 
We know that our industry has faced many important questions regarding pricing of drugs. This is not the forum to discuss the complex issue of drug pricing. But I think it is important to note that Regeneron is in a unique position. As a company founded on science and committed to the research and development of important new products, we are well positioned to succeed even in a difficult and constrained pricing environment. In fact, we have never raised prices on any of our drugs, choosing instead to grow through the optimization of currently marketed products by pursuing new indications as well as the introduction of new medicines. Our future potential growth will be driven by this strategy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late-stage drug candidates in the industry. We are investigating Dupixent in a",1261,"Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. I'd like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late-stage drug candidates in the industry. We are investigating Dupixent in a wide variety of allergic diseases. The most advanced of which is uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
Just last month, we had the opportunity to present detailed results from SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, which were 2 identical Phase III studies that investigated Dupixent in the monotherapy setting at the annual EADV conference. These data were also concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These were the first large pivotal studies where a systemic investigational therapy demonstrated significant reduction in the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis with an average reduction in skin scores of about 70%, accompanied by a marked reduction in the usually unrelenting itch associated with this disease and almost 40% of these patients achieving clearing or near-clearing of the skin lesions. 
Unlike other immune modulating therapies, there was no evidence of increased immunosuppression. And the most common adverse events in the 2 trials were injection site reactions and conjunctivitis. We were encouraged by the excitement with which these data were received by the physician community as well as by patients. And we believe that this speaks to the current unmet need and frustration with currently available therapies for this severely debilitating disease. As Len mentioned, our BLA for Dupixent for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is currently under FDA review and has been given priority review status and an action date of March 29, 2017. 
While the SOLO studies were in the monotherapy setting, we have also reported positive 1-year top line data from the CHRONOS Phase III study, which explored Dupixent in combination with topical corticosteroids. The safety and efficacy findings from the long-term CHRONOS study were consistent with those observed in SOLO 1 and 2. I'm also pleased to share that LIBERTY AD CAFÉ, a Phase III study of Dupixent with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or are intolerant to or ineligible for oral cyclosporine, is now fully enrolled. We, along with our collaborator Sanofi, expect to complete the regulatory resubmission in Europe and Japan in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric severe atopic dermatitis population in the first quarter of 2017 in patients between the ages of 12 and 17. We are pleased that similar to the adult indications, Dupixent has received breakthrough designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
While atopic dermatitis is the most advanced indication in development for Dupixent, we are making headway with our asthma program as well. We have previously announced positive results from our first pivotal study in uncontrolled persistent asthma despite treatment with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonists. As a reminder, these data demonstrated improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV and exacerbations in all patients regardless of baseline eosinophil status. There was a 15% improvement above placebo in FEV1 and a 75% reduction in exacerbations in the overall population treated with the 300-milligram, every 2-week dose. The most common adverse events associated with treatment in this study was injection site reaction. 
In September, we announced completion of enrollment in LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, which is our confirmatory Phase III pivotal study of Dupixent in this indication. The primary endpoint of this study is at 52 weeks. And we, therefore, expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. towards the end of 2017. We also expect to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric asthma patients in early 2017. We are also exploring the use of Dupixent in several other allergic indications, such as nasal polyps, where we expect to initiate a Phase III study early next year. And in eosinophilic esophagitis, we are currently in a Phase II. 
Turning to fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor antibody for pain. In October, we provided an update on this program. Following the observation of a case of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis in a patient receiving high-dose fasinumab, who had a history of advanced osteoarthritis of the knee, the FDA placed our Phase II study in chronic lower back pain patients on clinical hold. This event prompted an unplanned interim analysis of the study, which had already completed 70% of its targeted enrollment. The unplanned analysis showed clear evidence of efficacy with improvement in pain scores in all fasinumab groups compared to placebo at 8- and 12-week time points with p-value of less than 0.01. Preliminary safety results were also generally consistent with those observed previously with this class. The FDA has since communicated that we can continue development of fasinumab in chronic lower back pain by excluding patients who have advanced osteoarthritis. We are also continuing our pivotal program in osteoarthritis with final design elements still receiving regulatory feedback. The fasinumab program will contain safety data from approximately 10,000 patients overall.
Moving to PRALUENT. The recent news on the discontinuation of development of bococizumab obviously has a major impact on the PCSK9 landscape. This further underscores the very high bar in terms of safety and efficacy for this class. This example also highlights to us the value of our fully human VelocImmune-based antibody technology. In terms of our PRALUENT program, our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, remains ongoing. We expect the second interim analysis for futility and overwhelming efficacy by the end of this month. We, and our collaborator Sanofi, have also completed regulatory submissions for the once-monthly dosing formulation of PRALUENT in the Europe and Japan territories as well as in the United States, where we have been granted an FDA action date of January 24, 2017. 
Our immuno-oncology program continues to advance and expand. We believe that these are still early days in the area of immuno-oncology with the collective knowledge of this field evolving rapidly and the competitive landscape changing continuously. Evidence of this includes the recent surprising failure of the market-leading PD-1 antibody in first-line lung cancer. Regarding our PD-1 program, our potentially pivotal study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is ongoing and we plan to announce additional studies in the near future. In addition, we're also studying PD-1 in combination with our bispecific CD20xCD3 molecule. At the end of this year, at the American Society of Hematology or ASH conference, we will be presenting monotherapy data from the CD20xCD3 program. Lastly, we plan to advance Regeneron 3767, an antibody LAG3, into clinical development by the end 2016. 
In October, we announced top line results from a Phase II combination study of EYLEA with rinucumab, our PDGF receptor antibody in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD, where the data demonstrated no improvement in best corrected visual acuity or BCVA, the primary endpoint of the study, versus EYLEA alone. We think these study results demonstrate the high hurdle that has been set by the well-established efficacy and safety of EYLEA. That said, we are looking for ways in which we can strengthen our EYLEA franchise. To that end, we are conducting a Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to ANG2, in AMD and DME. The DME study is full enrolled while the study in wet AMD continues to enroll patients. We are also exploring longer-acting approaches in this class. 
And with that summary, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."
33715,404125717,1074384,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter U.S. EYLEA or aflibercept net sales grew 16% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $854 million and year-to-date sales were $2.5 billion. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the",818,"Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter U.S. EYLEA or aflibercept net sales grew 16% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $854 million and year-to-date sales were $2.5 billion. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $471 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth, unadjusted for currency fluctuations. Net ex U.S. year-to-date sales were $1.4 billion. 
EYLEA is the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. In the U.S., we are seeing increased competitor discounts and rebates. We are carefully assessing these actions. As I'm sure you're well aware, there's a pending proposal from the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B or buy-and-bill drugs. We've worked hard on the policy and legislative front on this issue. And we'll be prepared to respond on the commercial front as needed to make sure that patients continue to have full and complete access to EYLEA.
Turning now to PRALUENT or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the third quarter were $38 million worldwide with U.S. accounting for $32 million of the total. Sales data and IMS total prescription data indicate that PRALUENT and evolocumab market share are roughly 50-50 in the United States. As reported by IMS, U.S. total prescriptions for PRALUENT increased sequentially 60% versus second quarter 2016. 
The challenge for the PCSK9 inhibitor class continues to be the significant reimbursement hurdles for the physicians' offices and patients, resulting in a low volume of prescriptions being dispensed. This has resulted in physicians' offices reserving their initial prescriptions to a limited pool of patients. We continue to focus our efforts in improving access and improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. We're gradually seeing more payers loosen their utilization management criteria, including removing their requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. In addition, we are now seeing some patients shortening the number of months that a patient needs to be on a maximally tolerated statin therapy and eliminating a specialist-only prescribing or consultation requirement. Others have streamlined the prior authorization process. 
ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of PRALUENT. Outside of the United States, PRALUENT was approved in the EU in September of 2015 with the product now approved in 41 countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K., Spain, Norway and the Netherlands. It still remains a challenging reimbursement situation with some countries awaiting cardiovascular OUTCOMES data. 
We continue to plan for the potential launch of sarilumab in the United States. As an example, we have a major presence at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting this month in Washington, D.C. We'll be presenting data from our MONARCH study of sarilumab as monotherapy in patients who are DMARD responders as well as subset analysis from our pivotal U.S. registrational studies. We'll have a display floor presence highlighting the central role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis. The European Marketing Authorization Application for sarilumab is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency with a potential decision on the application expected in mid-2017. Co-promotion decisions for Europe and other ex U.S. countries will be made over time.
We're currently preparing for Dupixent or dupilumab commercialization with an FDA PDUFA date of March 29, 2017. We will be co-promoting Dupixent with Sanofi-Genzyme in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. We are aware that ICER, payers and pharmacy benefits managers are proactively evaluating the cost-effectiveness of emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis in the United States. We want to take a moment to discuss how we are thinking about the Dupixent commercial opportunity, which differs in many important respects from the situation we faced with PRALUENT. 
Dupixent has already demonstrated efficacy on the most important outcomes: consistent efficacy on rash severity, itching and quality of life measures. In the United States, there are 1.6 million patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, the majority of which will not likely receive Dupixent therapy. We estimate that approximately 300,000 of these patients have exhausted all approved therapies and have failed or are unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressant therapies. Many of these advanced patients are suffering from a host of related issues, including sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. These atopic dermatitis patients should not be denied therapy. We hope payers and insurers will provide appropriate and timely access to Dupixent, should it be approved, and that patients will not have to step through unapproved immunosuppressant therapies, many of which have black box warnings. We plan to work closely with all stakeholders, including patients, physicians and payers to achieve this goal. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."

Regeneron posted strong financial results in the third quarter of 2016 as well as entered into 2 new exciting collaborations. We are also lowering and tightening full year 2016 guidance on non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, non-GAAP",1331,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning. Regeneron posted strong financial results in the third quarter of 2016 as well as entered into 2 new exciting collaborations. We are also lowering and tightening full year 2016 guidance on non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, non-GAAP SG&A, our effective tax rate and capital expenditures. 
Let me start with our top line third quarter earnings. In the third quarter 2016, non-GAAP net income was $365 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $3.13. This represents an increase of 32% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Regeneron's third quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and the $25 million upfront payment made in connection with our third quarter 2016 license and collaboration agreement with Adicet and includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% over the third quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $857 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $738 million in the third quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $854 million compared to $734 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was approximately 3%. During the third quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the second quarter of 2016 but continues to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range.
As mentioned in our press release issued this morning, we're tightening our full year 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of 23% to 25%. Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $471 million in third quarter of 2016 compared to $371 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing a 27% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 25%. In the third quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $171 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $191 million. 
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $144 million for the third quarter of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. In the third quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies, which includes PRALUENT and pre-commercialization activities and costs in connection with sarilumab and Dupixent, was $112 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within these collaboration losses were the global sales of PRALUENT as recognized by our collaborator Sanofi of $38 million for the third quarter of 2016. 
Before moving to expenses, I'd like to highlight 2 third quarter business development transactions. The first is the collaboration we entered into with Teva to develop and commercialize our NGF antibody, fasinumab. Under the terms of the agreement, Teva paid Regeneron a $250 million upfront payment and we will equally share on an ongoing basis R&D expenses of approximately $1 billion under a global development plan. We plan to ratably recognize the upfront payment as revenue over the related performance period. The signing of this agreement did not have a material P&L impact on the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the intellectual property associated with our late-stage pipeline, including fasinumab, has been migrated offshore, thus expenses and revenues associated with the program will be recognized in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The other 2016 third quarter business development transaction was a collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immune cell therapeutics. In accordance with this agreement, we paid Adicet a $25 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2016, which we have recorded as GAAP R&D expense in our consolidated statement of operations but have excluded from our non-GAAP net income. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D noncash share-based compensation expense as well as the upfront payment we made to collaborator Adicet, was $437 million for the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $256 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information as required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. As a result of the recently executed collaboration with Teva regarding fasinumab, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $945 million to $975 million from our previous guidance range of $970 million to just over $1 billion. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $221 million for the third quarter 2016. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $965 million to $995 million from our previous guidance range of $980 million to $1.02 billion. Note that even after lowering and tightening our full year guidance, we do not expect to see any material prelaunch cost savings from the PDUFA delay of sarilumab, we will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi-Genzyme and our sales force is already onboard. And as you heard earlier from Bob Terifay, we continue to prepare for the launch in anticipation of the resolution of matters with the FDA. Sanofi reimbursement of the Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $66 million for the third quarter of 2016. We are tightening our full year 2016 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $310 million to $335 million from $310 million to $340 million. 
Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2016 was 27.6% as compared to 46.5% in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, inclusion of the tax benefit of share-based compensation and the impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction as compared to the same quarter of last year as well as the discrete impact to this quarter of a change in our assessment of reserves for uncertain tax positions. For 2016, we are lowering and tightening guidance for our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be 29% to 33% from the previously provided range of 33% to 41%. 
Our capital expenditures for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, were $361 million. For the full year 2016, we are lowering and tightening our guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $480 million to $510 million from the previously provided range of $480 million to $530 million. 2016 capital expenditures primarily include costs in connection with renovations of our Limerick, Ireland manufacturing facility; tenant improvement and associated costs at our Tarrytown, New York facilities; renovations and additional store at Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facility; and the purchase of an office building near our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. 
We ended the third quarter 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, which includes the Teva upfront payment of $250 million. As we have reported in previous quarters, we have opportunistically reduced the number of warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt issuance through repurchases from the warrant counterparties. Depending on market and other conditions, we may spend up to $450 million to repurchase or settle these outstanding warrants. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Michael."

And when the FDA lifts the -- we get regulatory approval on that, then we will be in a position to ensure that the product is fully supported from a marketing and sales perspective."

To me, that suggests some sort of tone deafness in this environment. We think that we have to compete in 2 ways. We have to compete with a very good drug, which we think sarilumab will be. Of course, we have to get over this filing glitch and get to market as quickly as we can. But we think that the class is doing very well. There's some data out there from the first [indiscernible] class, where monotherapy against the leading anti-TNF, the anti-IL-6 receptor class performed better. And there are some people who simply don't like to take methotrexate. We have data of our own, which probably won't be in our first filing, similar types of results with outperforming in monotherapy. But giving a solid entry with good properties is not going to be enough here. And we have to compete with an offering that payers will find attractive. I think Regeneron is not -- is willing to break some of the mold here. And I'm getting some hints from my colleagues that I've probably said enough. So I'll leave it at that."

Of course, we have to work with the agency and they have to be satisfied.

That has been the driver of growth over the last couple of years, primarily driven by the impressive Protocol T results, which indicated that EYLEA was superior to LUCENTIS and ranibizumab on its primary endpoint. The challenge with continuing growth in DME is that there are a number of patients that never make it to the retinal specialist's office. They go to an ophthalmologist who do laser therapy. Laser is a revenue driver in the ophthalmologist office. And they don't make it to the retina physician's office, where they could get access to anti-VEGF therapy. This has been a focus for us. We are educating. We're trying to educate patients that if they do have DME, they ought to get themselves to a retinal specialist.

And it's not just that their skin is covered with this rash, but this is a weepy, itchy, horrific rash that they just can't escape. And remarkably, enough as we said, despite the heavy burden of disease at baseline, almost 40% of these patients achieved a clearer, almost clear status. Rarely in this business do you have a privilege to be involved in a story like this that can make such a difference in patients' lives. And we've been lucky here at Regeneron that we've done this a couple of times already. But we think that Dupixent is really a once-in-a-lifetime story, where you can really impact such an important disease so dramatically, have an average 70% improvement among all patients. And the thing that's also so stunning to us about dupilumab is that it looks like it might have the promise to do likewise in a host of related allergic diseases, including the overall asthma population, where there again in the most uncontrolled severe population, once again the results are very impressive from our first pivotal study. And we think the same may be the case in a host of other allergic settings. So the short answer to your question is, unfortunately, there's a lot of patients who have more than 50% of their body surface covered. Those patients are certainly, by any category, considered severe patients. As Bob already told you, many of them have exhausted all other options. And we just hope that the -- all the other ancillary things don't keep these important patients from getting access to this important life-changing drug."

But to most patients, unless they're highly involved in the details of their care, which some are, but many, to them, that isn't the end-all, be-all, something they wake up every day wondering how to get that cholesterol down. Of course, if they've had a heart attack and everybody in their family does, and they do pay attention to that. But then there was the pushback, ""Well, you don't really know, do you, that it improves outcomes?"" We're just going on a hypothesis, even through there's a great deal of data to certainly support that hypothesis. So it's not a disease that people are clamoring to get treated and it's not outcomes that are readily in hand. Contrast that with PRALUENT, where these patients are desperate for treatment, truly desperate for treatment. And we're not talking about the topical treatments that are available, such as steroids that might become available when you're dealing with small areas of relatively mild to moderate disease. We're talking about the kind of patients George referred to, which are really quite significant. And these patients can see the outcome themselves. They can tell that they're doing better. And we see it in our studies, we see it in our questionnaires. We see it whether or not they're sleeping because they can scratch themselves so badly. I heard a story the other day, which practically -- it was group of us that practically brought us all to tears, where a little boy who was visiting his grandparents and so is cuddling and sleeping on the same bed with very bad atopic dermatitis said to his grandparents, ""Can you each hold one of my hands when I sleep, so I don't scratch myself so badly?"" I mean, think about that. This is a disease that people really are looking for treatments. And if we can get this drug approved, first, for adults and hopefully down the road for children, we can really provide something that they can tangibly feel. We're passionate about making sure that we remove all the barriers out there and we expect to work with patients, with doctors, with payers, with organizations to make sure that people are aware of this treatment and can get access to it."

I'd like to begin by giving you a high-level sense of our near-term and longer-term priorities at Regeneron.  
EYLEA, our flagship anti-VEGF, continues to remain a key financial driver for Regeneron. We are pleased with the continued growth of EYLEA and are committed to maintaining our leadership position in the branded anti-VEGF market by pursuing both additional indications for EYLEA, such as diabetic retinopathy, where we currently have a Phase III study ongoing. And we are also looking at ways in which we can improve upon the high efficacy bar set by EYLEA to combinations with an antibody to ANG2, where we currently have 2 Phase II studies ongoing. 
While EYLEA remains very important to our business, we are equally focused on the ongoing launch of PRALUENT, our PCSK9 antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol as well as advancing our pipeline. For PRALUENT, we believe that if OUTCOMES data are positive, it will drive greater use of this class. As mentioned in our press release, we expect the second interim analysis by the end of this month. 
Moving on to sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. As you heard last week, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. This was due to certain manufacturing deficiencies not specific to sarilumab that were observed during a routine inspection of a Sanofi fill and finish plant in France. Sanofi has provided comprehensive responses and is working closely with the FDA to address the deficiencies as expeditiously as possible. It has only been a week since we received the Complete Response Letter. And we are preparing to engage in meaningful discussions with the FDA. So it is too early for us to comment on the expected time line for potential sarilumab approval. 
We do not expect these manufacturing deficiencies will impact dupilumab or as it is now known by its brand name, Dupixent, where our Biologics License Application, or BLA, is currently under FDA priority review for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adults. The FDA action date for the BLA is at the end of March. Dupixent is a very important pipeline product candidate for us. And we believe that atopic dermatitis represents an area of high unmet need. As a reminder, we received breakthrough designation in this indication. In addition to atopic dermatitis, we are also investigating Dupixent in other indications, including asthma, where we recently completed enrollment in our second pivotal study. 
In the mid-term, we are looking to important clinical progress from several of our Phase II and III programs, which span a variety of therapeutic areas, such as allergic diseases, pain, viral diseases, ophthalmology, oncology, cardiometabolic disease, inflammatory and rare diseases. These programs have the potential to drive the next wave of growth for Regeneron. You will hear more about the key current developments from some of these programs from George. 
At Regeneron, we've always been committed to long-term science and innovation. In fact, today's marketed products as well as the 16 product candidates in clinical development were all home-grown in our internal R&D engine. We will continue to invest in science and technology that can provide sustainable innovation and growth well into the future. This unique long-term focus on science is at the heart of why we have been able to attract top talent, which is key to our continuing success. Through that end, last week, we were thrilled to be named by Science Magazine as the #1 company in the biotech or pharmaceutical industry to work for, a recognition we have received for 4 of the last 6 years. 
We know that our industry has faced many important questions regarding pricing of drugs. This is not the forum to discuss the complex issue of drug pricing. But I think it is important to note that Regeneron is in a unique position. As a company founded on science and committed to the research and development of important new products, we are well positioned to succeed even in a difficult and constrained pricing environment. In fact, we have never raised prices on any of our drugs, choosing instead to grow through the optimization of currently marketed products by pursuing new indications as well as the introduction of new medicines. Our future potential growth will be driven by this strategy. 
With that, let me turn the call over to George."

I'd like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late-stage drug candidates in the industry.

I'd like to begin with Dupixent, our IL-4/13 blocker, which we believe is one of the most exciting late-stage drug candidates in the industry. We are investigating Dupixent in a wide variety of allergic diseases. The most advanced of which is uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
Just last month, we had the opportunity to present detailed results from SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, which were 2 identical Phase III studies that investigated Dupixent in the monotherapy setting at the annual EADV conference. These data were also concurrently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These were the first large pivotal studies where a systemic investigational therapy demonstrated significant reduction in the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis with an average reduction in skin scores of about 70%, accompanied by a marked reduction in the usually unrelenting itch associated with this disease and almost 40% of these patients achieving clearing or near-clearing of the skin lesions. 
Unlike other immune modulating therapies, there was no evidence of increased immunosuppression. And the most common adverse events in the 2 trials were injection site reactions and conjunctivitis. We were encouraged by the excitement with which these data were received by the physician community as well as by patients. And we believe that this speaks to the current unmet need and frustration with currently available therapies for this severely debilitating disease. As Len mentioned, our BLA for Dupixent for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is currently under FDA review and has been given priority review status and an action date of March 29, 2017. 
While the SOLO studies were in the monotherapy setting, we have also reported positive 1-year top line data from the CHRONOS Phase III study, which explored Dupixent in combination with topical corticosteroids. The safety and efficacy findings from the long-term CHRONOS study were consistent with those observed in SOLO 1 and 2. I'm also pleased to share that LIBERTY AD CAFÉ, a Phase III study of Dupixent with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with or are intolerant to or ineligible for oral cyclosporine, is now fully enrolled. We, along with our collaborator Sanofi, expect to complete the regulatory resubmission in Europe and Japan in the fourth quarter of 2016. We also plan to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric severe atopic dermatitis population in the first quarter of 2017 in patients between the ages of 12 and 17. We are pleased that similar to the adult indications, Dupixent has received breakthrough designation for the treatment of pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. 
While atopic dermatitis is the most advanced indication in development for Dupixent, we are making headway with our asthma program as well. We have previously announced positive results from our first pivotal study in uncontrolled persistent asthma despite treatment with inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonists. As a reminder, these data demonstrated improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV and exacerbations in all patients regardless of baseline eosinophil status. There was a 15% improvement above placebo in FEV1 and a 75% reduction in exacerbations in the overall population treated with the 300-milligram, every 2-week dose. The most common adverse events associated with treatment in this study was injection site reaction. 
In September, we announced completion of enrollment in LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, which is our confirmatory Phase III pivotal study of Dupixent in this indication. The primary endpoint of this study is at 52 weeks. And we, therefore, expect to make a regulatory submission in the U.S. towards the end of 2017. We also expect to initiate a Phase III study in the pediatric asthma patients in early 2017. We are also exploring the use of Dupixent in several other allergic indications, such as nasal polyps, where we expect to initiate a Phase III study early next year. And in eosinophilic esophagitis, we are currently in a Phase II. 
Turning to fasinumab, our Nerve Growth Factor antibody for pain. In October, we provided an update on this program. Following the observation of a case of rapidly progressive osteoarthritis in a patient receiving high-dose fasinumab, who had a history of advanced osteoarthritis of the knee, the FDA placed our Phase II study in chronic lower back pain patients on clinical hold. This event prompted an unplanned interim analysis of the study, which had already completed 70% of its targeted enrollment. The unplanned analysis showed clear evidence of efficacy with improvement in pain scores in all fasinumab groups compared to placebo at 8- and 12-week time points with p-value of less than 0.01. Preliminary safety results were also generally consistent with those observed previously with this class. The FDA has since communicated that we can continue development of fasinumab in chronic lower back pain by excluding patients who have advanced osteoarthritis. We are also continuing our pivotal program in osteoarthritis with final design elements still receiving regulatory feedback. The fasinumab program will contain safety data from approximately 10,000 patients overall.
Moving to PRALUENT. The recent news on the discontinuation of development of bococizumab obviously has a major impact on the PCSK9 landscape. This further underscores the very high bar in terms of safety and efficacy for this class. This example also highlights to us the value of our fully human VelocImmune-based antibody technology. In terms of our PRALUENT program, our 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study, remains ongoing. We expect the second interim analysis for futility and overwhelming efficacy by the end of this month. We, and our collaborator Sanofi, have also completed regulatory submissions for the once-monthly dosing formulation of PRALUENT in the Europe and Japan territories as well as in the United States, where we have been granted an FDA action date of January 24, 2017. 
Our immuno-oncology program continues to advance and expand. We believe that these are still early days in the area of immuno-oncology with the collective knowledge of this field evolving rapidly and the competitive landscape changing continuously. Evidence of this includes the recent surprising failure of the market-leading PD-1 antibody in first-line lung cancer. Regarding our PD-1 program, our potentially pivotal study in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is ongoing and we plan to announce additional studies in the near future. In addition, we're also studying PD-1 in combination with our bispecific CD20xCD3 molecule. At the end of this year, at the American Society of Hematology or ASH conference, we will be presenting monotherapy data from the CD20xCD3 program. Lastly, we plan to advance Regeneron 3767, an antibody LAG3, into clinical development by the end 2016. 
In October, we announced top line results from a Phase II combination study of EYLEA with rinucumab, our PDGF receptor antibody in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD, where the data demonstrated no improvement in best corrected visual acuity or BCVA, the primary endpoint of the study, versus EYLEA alone. We think these study results demonstrate the high hurdle that has been set by the well-established efficacy and safety of EYLEA. That said, we are looking for ways in which we can strengthen our EYLEA franchise. To that end, we are conducting a Phase II study of EYLEA in a co-formulated combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to ANG2, in AMD and DME. The DME study is full enrolled while the study in wet AMD continues to enroll patients. We are also exploring longer-acting approaches in this class. 
And with that summary, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay."

Third quarter U.S. EYLEA or aflibercept net sales grew 16% year-over-year. Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $854 million and year-to-date sales were $2.5 billion.

Net U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $854 million and year-to-date sales were $2.5 billion. Net ex U.S. EYLEA sales in the third quarter were $471 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth, unadjusted for currency fluctuations. Net ex U.S. year-to-date sales were $1.4 billion. 
EYLEA is the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. In the U.S., we are seeing increased competitor discounts and rebates. We are carefully assessing these actions. As I'm sure you're well aware, there's a pending proposal from the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services regarding physician reimbursement for physician-administered Medicare Part B or buy-and-bill drugs. We've worked hard on the policy and legislative front on this issue. And we'll be prepared to respond on the commercial front as needed to make sure that patients continue to have full and complete access to EYLEA.
Turning now to PRALUENT or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the third quarter were $38 million worldwide with U.S. accounting for $32 million of the total. Sales data and IMS total prescription data indicate that PRALUENT and evolocumab market share are roughly 50-50 in the United States. As reported by IMS, U.S. total prescriptions for PRALUENT increased sequentially 60% versus second quarter 2016. 
The challenge for the PCSK9 inhibitor class continues to be the significant reimbursement hurdles for the physicians' offices and patients, resulting in a low volume of prescriptions being dispensed. This has resulted in physicians' offices reserving their initial prescriptions to a limited pool of patients. We continue to focus our efforts in improving access and improving the prescription process through the payers and the specialty pharmacies. We're gradually seeing more payers loosen their utilization management criteria, including removing their requirement for prior ezetimibe therapy. In addition, we are now seeing some patients shortening the number of months that a patient needs to be on a maximally tolerated statin therapy and eliminating a specialist-only prescribing or consultation requirement. Others have streamlined the prior authorization process. 
ODYSSEY OUTCOMES data, if positive, are anticipated to be a key driver in shaping the future success of PRALUENT. Outside of the United States, PRALUENT was approved in the EU in September of 2015 with the product now approved in 41 countries. Reimbursement discussions are currently underway with several governments across Europe. Positive reimbursement decisions have been issued in the U.K., Spain, Norway and the Netherlands. It still remains a challenging reimbursement situation with some countries awaiting cardiovascular OUTCOMES data. 
We continue to plan for the potential launch of sarilumab in the United States. As an example, we have a major presence at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting this month in Washington, D.C. We'll be presenting data from our MONARCH study of sarilumab as monotherapy in patients who are DMARD responders as well as subset analysis from our pivotal U.S. registrational studies. We'll have a display floor presence highlighting the central role of IL-6 in rheumatoid arthritis. The European Marketing Authorization Application for sarilumab is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency with a potential decision on the application expected in mid-2017. Co-promotion decisions for Europe and other ex U.S. countries will be made over time.
We're currently preparing for Dupixent or dupilumab commercialization with an FDA PDUFA date of March 29, 2017. We will be co-promoting Dupixent with Sanofi-Genzyme in the United States. Co-promotion decisions for other countries will be made at a later date. We are aware that ICER, payers and pharmacy benefits managers are proactively evaluating the cost-effectiveness of emerging therapies for atopic dermatitis in the United States. We want to take a moment to discuss how we are thinking about the Dupixent commercial opportunity, which differs in many important respects from the situation we faced with PRALUENT. 
Dupixent has already demonstrated efficacy on the most important outcomes: consistent efficacy on rash severity, itching and quality of life measures. In the United States, there are 1.6 million patients with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, the majority of which will not likely receive Dupixent therapy. We estimate that approximately 300,000 of these patients have exhausted all approved therapies and have failed or are unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressant therapies. Many of these advanced patients are suffering from a host of related issues, including sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. These atopic dermatitis patients should not be denied therapy. We hope payers and insurers will provide appropriate and timely access to Dupixent, should it be approved, and that patients will not have to step through unapproved immunosuppressant therapies, many of which have black box warnings. We plan to work closely with all stakeholders, including patients, physicians and payers to achieve this goal. 
With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry."

We are also lowering and tightening full year 2016 guidance on non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D, non-GAAP SG&A, our effective tax rate and capital expenditures. 
Let me start with our top line third quarter earnings. In the third quarter 2016, non-GAAP net income was $365 million and non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $3.13. This represents an increase of 32% in both non-GAAP net income per diluted share as well as non-GAAP net income in the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Regeneron's third quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income primarily excludes noncash share-based compensation expense and the $25 million upfront payment made in connection with our third quarter 2016 license and collaboration agreement with Adicet and includes the income tax effect of these non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. 
Total revenues in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.2 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 7% over the third quarter of 2015. Net product sales were $857 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $738 million in the third quarter of 2015. EYLEA U.S. net product sales were $854 million compared to $734 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing 16% year-over-year growth. Sequential quarter-over-quarter growth was approximately 3%. During the third quarter of 2016, EYLEA experienced a slight increase in U.S. distributor inventory levels as compared to the second quarter of 2016 but continues to be within our normal 1- to 2-week targeted range.
As mentioned in our press release issued this morning, we're tightening our full year 2016 U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance to be year-over-year growth of 23% to 25%. Ex U.S. EYLEA sales, where product revenue is recorded by our collaborator, Bayer, were $471 million in third quarter of 2016 compared to $371 million in the third quarter of 2015, representing a 27% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 25%. In the third quarter of 2016, Regeneron recognized $171 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $191 million. 
Turning now to our Sanofi collaboration. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $144 million for the third quarter of 2016. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses and our share of profits or losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. In the third quarter of 2016, our share of the collaboration's losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies, which includes PRALUENT and pre-commercialization activities and costs in connection with sarilumab and Dupixent, was $112 million, which can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. Netted within these collaboration losses were the global sales of PRALUENT as recognized by our collaborator Sanofi of $38 million for the third quarter of 2016. 
Before moving to expenses, I'd like to highlight 2 third quarter business development transactions. The first is the collaboration we entered into with Teva to develop and commercialize our NGF antibody, fasinumab. Under the terms of the agreement, Teva paid Regeneron a $250 million upfront payment and we will equally share on an ongoing basis R&D expenses of approximately $1 billion under a global development plan. We plan to ratably recognize the upfront payment as revenue over the related performance period. The signing of this agreement did not have a material P&L impact on the third quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the intellectual property associated with our late-stage pipeline, including fasinumab, has been migrated offshore, thus expenses and revenues associated with the program will be recognized in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate. The other 2016 third quarter business development transaction was a collaboration with Adicet, which will allow us to discover and develop engineered next-generation immune cell therapeutics. In accordance with this agreement, we paid Adicet a $25 million upfront payment in the third quarter of 2016, which we have recorded as GAAP R&D expense in our consolidated statement of operations but have excluded from our non-GAAP net income. 
Turning now to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expense, which is calculated as the total GAAP R&D expense less R&D noncash share-based compensation expense as well as the upfront payment we made to collaborator Adicet, was $437 million for the third quarter of 2016. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $256 million for the 3 months ended September 30, 2016. Our press release includes all the information as required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. As a result of the recently executed collaboration with Teva regarding fasinumab, we are lowering and tightening our full year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $945 million to $975 million from our previous guidance range of $970 million to just over $1 billion. 
Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $221 million for the third quarter 2016. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2016 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $965 million to $995 million from our previous guidance range of $980 million to $1.02 billion. Note that even after lowering and tightening our full year guidance, we do not expect to see any material prelaunch cost savings from the PDUFA delay of sarilumab, we will be co-promoting sarilumab with Sanofi-Genzyme and our sales force is already onboard. And as you heard earlier from Bob Terifay, we continue to prepare for the launch in anticipation of the resolution of matters with the FDA. Sanofi reimbursement of the Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $66 million for the third quarter of 2016. We are tightening our full year 2016 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $310 million to $335 million from $310 million to $340 million. 
Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2016 was 27.6% as compared to 46.5% in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in the geographic mix of earnings, inclusion of the tax benefit of share-based compensation and the impact of the domestic manufacturing deduction as compared to the same quarter of last year as well as the discrete impact to this quarter of a change in our assessment of reserves for uncertain tax positions. For 2016, we are lowering and tightening guidance for our full year GAAP effective tax rate to be 29% to 33% from the previously provided range of 33% to 41%. 
Our capital expenditures for the 9 months ended September 30, 2016, were $361 million. For the full year 2016, we are lowering and tightening our guidance for capital expenditures to be in the range of $480 million to $510 million from the previously provided range of $480 million to $530 million. 2016 capital expenditures primarily include costs in connection with renovations of our Limerick, Ireland manufacturing facility; tenant improvement and associated costs at our Tarrytown, New York facilities; renovations and additional store at Rensselaer, New York manufacturing facility; and the purchase of an office building near our Rensselaer manufacturing facility. 
We ended the third quarter 2016 with cash and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, which includes the Teva upfront payment of $250 million. As we have reported in previous quarters, we have opportunistically reduced the number of warrants that we issued in 2011 in connection with our convertible debt issuance through repurchases from the warrant counterparties. Depending on market and other conditions, we may spend up to $450 million to repurchase or settle these outstanding warrants. 
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Michael."

To me, that suggests some sort of tone deafness in this environment. We think that we have to compete in 2 ways. We have to compete with a very good drug, which we think sarilumab will be. Of course, we have to get over this filing glitch and get to market as quickly as we can. But we think that the class is doing very well. There's some data out there from the first [indiscernible] class, where monotherapy against the leading anti-TNF, the anti-IL-6 receptor class performed better. And there are some people who simply don't like to take methotrexate. We have data of our own, which probably won't be in our first filing, similar types of results with outperforming in monotherapy. But giving a solid entry with good properties is not going to be enough here. And we have to compete with an offering that payers will find attractive. I think Regeneron is not -- is willing to break some of the mold here. And I'm getting some hints from my colleagues that I've probably said enough. So I'll leave it at that."

Of course, we have to work with the agency and they have to be satisfied.

The challenge with continuing growth in DME is that there are a number of patients that never make it to the retinal specialist's office. They go to an ophthalmologist who do laser therapy. Laser is a revenue driver in the ophthalmologist office. And they don't make it to the retina physician's office, where they could get access to anti-VEGF therapy. This has been a focus for us. We are educating. We're trying to educate patients that if they do have DME, they ought to get themselves to a retinal specialist. But this is chipping away at a habit among the ophthalmologists and it's going to take some time. But we continue to see that the DME market does offer substantial growth opportunities in the future. And as Len mentioned earlier, if and when we get the diabetic retinopathy indication, that would be a further driver."

We should just let you know that obviously in our studies, on average, the patients that we study had more than 50% of their body surface at baseline covered by this disease. And 1/4 of the patients had 85% or more of their body covered with this disease. This just shows how severely these patients are. And it's not just that their skin is covered with this rash, but this is a weepy, itchy, horrific rash that they just can't escape. And remarkably, enough as we said, despite the heavy burden of disease at baseline, almost 40% of these patients achieved a clearer, almost clear status. Rarely in this business do you have a privilege to be involved in a story like this that can make such a difference in patients' lives. And we've been lucky here at Regeneron that we've done this a couple of times already. But we think that Dupixent is really a once-in-a-lifetime story, where you can really impact such an important disease so dramatically, have an average 70% improvement among all patients. And the thing that's also so stunning to us about dupilumab is that it looks like it might have the promise to do likewise in a host of related allergic diseases, including the overall asthma population, where there again in the most uncontrolled severe population, once again the results are very impressive from our first pivotal study. And we think the same may be the case in a host of other allergic settings. So the short answer to your question is, unfortunately, there's a lot of patients who have more than 50% of their body surface covered. Those patients are certainly, by any category, considered severe patients. As Bob already told you, many of them have exhausted all other options. And we just hope that the -- all the other ancillary things don't keep these important patients from getting access to this important life-changing drug."

But to most patients, unless they're highly involved in the details of their care, which some are, but many, to them, that isn't the end-all, be-all, something they wake up every day wondering how to get that cholesterol down. Of course, if they've had a heart attack and everybody in their family does, and they do pay attention to that. But then there was the pushback, ""Well, you don't really know, do you, that it improves outcomes?"" We're just going on a hypothesis, even through there's a great deal of data to certainly support that hypothesis. So it's not a disease that people are clamoring to get treated and it's not outcomes that are readily in hand. Contrast that with PRALUENT, where these patients are desperate for treatment, truly desperate for treatment. And we're not talking about the topical treatments that are available, such as steroids that might become available when you're dealing with small areas of relatively mild to moderate disease. We're talking about the kind of patients George referred to, which are really quite significant. And these patients can see the outcome themselves. They can tell that they're doing better. And we see it in our studies, we see it in our questionnaires. We see it whether or not they're sleeping because they can scratch themselves so badly. I heard a story the other day, which practically -- it was group of us that practically brought us all to tears, where a little boy who was visiting his grandparents and so is cuddling and sleeping on the same bed with very bad atopic dermatitis said to his grandparents, ""Can you each hold one of my hands when I sleep, so I don't scratch myself so badly?"" I mean, think about that. This is a disease that people really are looking for treatments. And if we can get this drug approved, first, for adults and hopefully down the road for children, we can really provide something that they can tangibly feel. We're passionate about making sure that we remove all the barriers out there and we expect to work with patients, with doctors, with payers, with organizations to make sure that people are aware of this treatment and can get access to it."
