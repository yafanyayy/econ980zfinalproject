Today, we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing a solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance and then, of course, take your questions.F",649,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Today, we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing a solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance and then, of course, take your questions.
First, for the year, organic growth was up 6% with Tools & Storage leading the way, up 8%. Security was flat, while industrial delivered 2%. Operating margin spend [ph] 90 basis points to 14.2%, which is a post-merger record for the company.  EPS of $5.82 was a 10% improvement versus 2014. Jim's don't let a lot more detail, particularly on the margins and growth by segment when he gets into the segment reviews. 
Free cash flow came in at $871 million on strong working capital turns at 9.2. And in line with our previous commitments, we executed over $1 billion of share repurchase actions in 2015, wrapping up a really strong year in which we overcame numerous challenges, not least of which was foreign currency.
Guidance for 2016 is being established with an EPS range of $6 and $6.20 per share or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3% versus 2015. Don is going to take you through this in more detail later in the call.
Moving to the right on the chart for the quarter. Revenue expanded 1% organically, with total gross down 5% of the top line impact with foreign currencies negative 6% for the quarter. There was a fiscal calendar phenomenon in the fourth quarter that did have a modest bit in organic growth, that Don is noted to just more in detail with the walk through the quarter -- but  think it's an important point.
Operating margin rate for the quarter was 14.2%, which was a 100 basis points of improvement ahead of fourth quarter '15. Our margins increased due to continued sharp focus on price realization and some commodity deflation, delivering operating leverage, despite $50 million from foreign currency pressure in the quarter. EPS of $1.78, was up 30% versus fourth quarter '14 as the solid operational performance, combined with low tax, share count and some restructuring, less than the prior quarter offset the foreign exchange.
Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of the sources of growth. This quarter, as previously mentioned, organic growth remained positive due to the continued strength of Tools & Storage, particularly in the U.S. and the European residential and nonresidential construction markets and the Stanley Engineered Fastening automotive business, which offset pressure in the industrial channel, lower emerging market volumes and customer-specific volume declines within the Stanley Engineered Fastening Electronics business.
This growth was offset by foreign exchange headwinds of 6% in the quarter, resulting in total revenue down 5% as previously mentioned. Looking at it geographic, Europe that go with the way, up 3% as a share gains continued in the region and nearly every market contributed positive growth. The U.S. generated 1% organic growth, while solid construction POS performance, has left customer inventories in good shape as we enter 2016. 
Emerging markets and the rest of the world began to show signs of the macro pressure to the top line, contracting 2% and 3%, respectively. There was as always, significant variation among the countries, with China, Russia and Venezuela showed the largest year-on-year declines.  And quickly, for the year, organic growth was 6%, 5% volume, 1% price. This growth was offset by 7% currency, netting down to a 1% decline in total revenue, as shown in the box on the left of the chart.
We were pleased that geographically, the organic growth we shared around the world is spread fairly evenly, of course, with the U.S. leading the way at plus 8%, Europe, plus 4%; emerging markets, plus 3%; and the rest of the world, plus 3%. 
Let me turn it over to Jim to get into some more operating detail on our 3 segments."

I'll start with the Tools & Storage which wrapped up a banner year, with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult times, mix and markets in a relentless dollar strengthening. Tools benefited from strong execution momentum i",1519,"Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with the Tools & Storage which wrapped up a banner year, with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult times, mix and markets in a relentless dollar strengthening. 
Tools benefited from strong execution momentum in all areas, new products, supply chain and commercial excellence. As for markets, continued strength in the U.S. construction, DIY and consumer was a help. However, emerging market and overall industrial conditions where more than challenging. European tool end markets continue to be flat to slightly positive, and continuing the U.S. dollars strengthening, especially against Latin American currencies, presented familiar but increasingly large headwinds for both revenues and operating margin.
Organic growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter, with all regions once again contributing, Europe but the way, up 6%, followed by North America and emerging markets continue to 3% and 1%, respectively. Although revenues were down 3% due to a 6-point currency impact, operating margin was up 1% with a 60 basis points year-over-year improvement in the rate. Execution of price, productivity and cost control initiatives, along with a little help from lower commodity prices, enabled us to more than offset the onslaught from currency pressure. And across the global product lines, Power Tools posted 5% organic growth, with contributions from Professional Power Tools, up 7%; Consumer Power Tools, up 3%; and accessories, up 2%.
Our Hand Tools & Storage business was down 2%, as strength with an construction tools and our Mac Mobile Distribution business was offset by significantly lower sales within the industrial channel. 
Innovation continues to generate solid growth across the business, with the ongoing contributions from DC brushless power tools as well as new product rollouts such as the DeWalt 20- and 40-volt outdoor Stanley FatMax power to us and Europe and DeWalt the Mannix. Within that America, retail POS performance was again strong in the quarter, wrapping up a record year which saw a positive POS in 50 of 52 weeks. Growth across every SBU and as impressively across all major brands, Black & Decker, DeWalt, Stanley and Bostitch.
Importantly, retail inventories remain at healthy and appropriate levels consistent with prior year. And in addition, the team continues to dial the performance in Mac tools, which closed the quarter with growth enhancing the digits, delivering its 6 consecutive year and 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. And finally, we continue to enjoy robust growth in e-commerce, this time, highlighted by success with our rebranded and very innovative Black & Decker consumer products.
Europe continues to perform at multiples above the underlying market, posting 6% organic growth in the quarter for a full year total of 7%. This region has shown remarkably consistent share gains in a relatively flat market, delivering approximately 7% organic growth across much of the past 3 years. Importantly, the growth in Europe continues to be widespread across nearly all regions as consistent share gains validate the success of our innovation and commercial excellence initiatives.
The emerging market team once again, overcame significant market headwinds, generating 1% organic growth in the quarter with contributions from over Argentina, Mexico and Turkey more than offsetting continued pressures in Russia, China, Brazil and other parts of South America. And meanwhile, the timely global release of the Stanley Power Tools line for emerging markets continues to get traction in the large and growing mid-price point segment, helping to offset regional economic and geopolitical market turbulence. 
The fourth quarter caps off an exceptional year by our Tools & Storage team; 8% organic growth for the year against the 6% 2014, with an operating margin rate up 110 basis points, executing on all fronts, taking share, improving profitability in the face of a volatile backdrop, and at the same time, the team very methodically and successfully positioned the business for more growth ahead. In that regard, we see continued robust growth for tools in 2016. Our innovation pipeline is stronger than anytime since the merger, and our supply chain and commercial teams are operating at very high fitness levels with the SFS 2.0 firmly embedded in our operating culture. These are exciting times for Tools & Storage, and we expect the performance level to continue to be very high as we go forward.
Turning to Security. Progress continued across our Security business, we're Europe advancing on all fronts, and North America showing steady progress in its transmission efforts. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically, the fifth consecutive quarter on positive territory. Commercial lens were widespread across most countries as we recognize benefits from investments in our regional sales organizations. Profitability continued to improving sequentially and versus prior year, with a fourth quarter operating margin rate approaching 10%.  Solid order intake and a healthy backlog, both up double digits year-over-year, combined with stable attrition rates within our targeted range, leave us well positioned to continue forward momentum into 2016.
While organic revenues were down within North America due principally to a large installation in last year's fourth quarter, the team posted sequential margin expansion due to improved field productivity within the commercial Electronic Security business as the benefits from the Stanley standard operational improvement initiative began to take hold. Strong orders, a healthy backlog and a growing R&R portfolio position this business well as we head into 2016.
Emerging markets were again a modest drag on Security growth and profitability, as we cut the conditions in China continued. But overall, for the segment, profitability was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially, a solid indicator that our transformation efforts are taking hold within the organization.
Turning to industrial. Industrial saw a 1% organic decline in the quarter as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening's, electronics and industrial businesses more than offset the strong global automotive revenue and organic growth in our Oil & Gas business. Operating profit was up 5%, with a 210-basis-point improvement in the margin rate, as productivity gains and cost controls were able to counteract lower volume.
Engineered Fastening's 3% organic decline was attributable to weakening within the industrial channel and lower sales volume in the electronics space as our largest consumer electronics customer unexpectedly reduced production levels on their recently launched smartphone. This more than offset another quarter in which our automotive revenues outpaced light vehicle production. The business was able to anticipate some of the industrial market softness and thus benefited from proactive cost actions taken within the quarter. Infrastructure delivered positive organic growth of 2%, as Oil & Gas grew 17%, organically, propelled by increased project activity in the North America offshore market, more than offsetting declines in hydraulics, which continues to be impacted by depressed scrap steel prices.
All in all, an impressive operational performance was registered by the industrial teams, expanding profitability and margin rates in the face of a choppy and mostly, inhospitable end market environment, with the exception of auto production. 
In summary, for the total company, the fourth quarter represented a solid performance, wrapping up a tremendous year which included organic growth of 6%, record operating margins and record EPS.  This performance highlights our team's agility, passion to perform and ability to be proactive and responsive to market conditions, balancing investments for growth and taking out costs when necessary, strengths that will serve us well as we head into 2016. 
As we consider the 2016 outlook, which done was your review in a few minutes, our ability to generate outsized organic growth albeit at the slower pace than in the preceding 2 years, will be enabled by the investments we have made and are making in SFS 2.0, which is our transformational business operating system. 
In early 2015, we launched the next generation of SFS, creating a more powerful mechanism to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion with high asset efficiency. The expanded SFS 2.0 is transforming back company by focusing our activities in 5 key areas: Digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, commercial excellence, functional transformation and core SFS. I would encourage serious long-term investors to develop a deep understanding of SFS 2.0, and that this is not an Investor Relations marketing jargon but rather, a carefully constructed and executed framework that enables our organization to extract maximum value out of our world-class franchises. We do this through capital efficient organic growth and continuous margin expansion. You have already seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in the organic growth and margin expansion in Tools & Storage and other parts of the company. In 2016, you will see a growing impact from breakthrough innovation, digital as well as the other elements of the initiative, which is now in its second year and gaining momentum.
I would also say that we are once again, open for business when it comes to inorganic growth. We look forward to supplementing our organic growth with a disciplined approach to M&A that we have deployed during almost 100 acquisitions over the past 15 years, a period of time when we more than quadrupled our revenues and market cap and outperformed the S&P 500's total shareholder return by 5x. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Don Allan."
304977,321463517,922135,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full ye",1768,"Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full year. This full year result is approximately $50 million to $75 million lower than we anticipated going into the quarter and is the result of lower than expected fourth quarter volumes in Tools & Storage and Engineered Fastening, which in turn, resulted in lower working capital liquidation.
Nonetheless, working capital turns finished the year at 9.2x, flat to the prior year, but at a level that many industrials would envy. Overall, our cash flow performance remains strong, a 96% conversion rate for the full year in our leverage metrics are in line with our year-end expectations.
One additional comment on free cash flow as it relates to the other line. As you can see, we experienced approximately $120 million variants versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. This variants was planned and is due primarily to discontinued operation activity in the fourth quarter of 2014, combined with the timing of certain derivative settlements and tax payments. 
So let's turn to Page 11. I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. Certainly, it won't be news to anyone that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against the vast majority of currencies around the world. This strong dollar has resulted in approximately a 50% increase against the Brazilian real since the beginning of 2015. Also, the British pound and the Australian dollar are at levels we have not seen since the 2008 credit crisis, and the Canadian dollar has not been this weak versus U.S. Dollar for well over 1 decade. And last but certainly not least, the Argentinian peso, which essentially -- has been on a constant decline in since the government's default back in 2001, accelerated its traction with a 30% cliff devaluation in December, resulting in other meaningful headwind for us in 2016. 
The effect of all these moves is that we are facing another significant foreign exchange headwind in 2016, which at current spot rates, results in a year-over-year impact to operating margin between $170 million and $190 million. This impact is a combination of transactional and translational. However, approximately 2/3 of the 2016 headwind will be transactional, pressuring our margins, while approximately 1/3 will be translational. The transactional amount is substantially higher than prior year, as we feel the impact of the 2015 derivative hedges expiring in 2016, and this is approximately $60 million of our total currency headwind.  This 2016 currency impact is on top of over $300 million in currency headwinds we faced over the past 2 years where our team's focused on significant operational actions which more than offset these pressures in 2014 in 2015. 
However, given the magnitude of these continued headwinds, we will not be able to completely offset currency in 2016 with pricing post action. That being said, we will offset approximately 50% of this $170 million to $190 million headwind within 2016. And as we have previously discussed, over the long term, we will continue to identify opportunities to localize production to help mitigate currency, as well as improve the efficiency of our global supply chain.
So let's transition to our 2016 outlook on the next page. As John mentioned, we are guiding to an EPS range of $6 to $6.20, or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3%. 
Let's walk through some of the key drivers in our guidance. First, we expect organic growth to approximate 3%, which will contribute $0.45 to $0.50 EPS for the year. As Jim discussed, SFS 2.0 will help fuel this growth in 2016 and beyond. We expect our Tools & Storage business to continue to make -- to take market share in most regions. Our innovation pipeline is robust, and we believe this business can leverage that to grow in the low to mid-single-digits in the face of challenging global macroeconomic environment.
We expect progress to continue within the Security platform, resulting in low single-digit growth. And we also expect industrial to have low single-digit growth as the Engineered Fastening automotive business will continue to demonstrate strong growth while the remainder of the segment faces pressures across several end markets, including Oil & Gas, scrap steel, general industrial and electronics. 
One additional point related to organic growth before I move on to the next topic. It's worth noting that when normalizing for a 53-week activity which was included in the 2014 fourth quarter, which is a fiscal calendar phenomenon that occurs every 7 years, if you adjust for that, the total company's organic growth would've actually been 1.5 to 2 points higher or approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is notable when you consider the fact that 1% organic growth and us guiding for 3% organic growth in 2016. We believe this, along with a strength of our certain markets we operate in, namely U.S. construction, along with global automotive production, combined with our focus in SFS 2.0, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 3% organic growth outlook for 2016.
Continuing to the next EPS driver. We will see another $0.45 to $0.50 of earnings improvement from additional cost and productivity initiatives. We have a solid amount of carryover commodity deflation materializing in 2016, and the business teams have worked hard to identify additional cost-reduction opportunities, which on top of our normal productivity gains, will result in a solid contribution to the bottom line. Also, we see an additional increase to EPS of approximately $0.13 from a lower share base due to the carryover benefit of our 2015 share actions as well as opportunistic buybacks, particularly if we continue to see depressed share prices. Working against all of these these strong operational actions will be the previously mentioned foreign exchange headwind, which result in approximately $0.85 to $0.95 of EPS pressure year-over-year.
Because of the severity of this transactional currency headwind, and its impact on margins, we expect of the company-wide operating margin for 2016 to be relatively flat year-over-year. To put this in perspective, we estimate that the FX headwinds and net of benefits we are receiving from lower commodity costs as well as pricing activities, will cause us to lose 60 to 75 basis points of margin rate improvement in 2016. Our 3-year financial vision presented at the May 2015 investor meeting contemplated a 50 to 75 basis points of margin improvement each year, which assumed a stable foreign exchange environment. So we believe we're continuing to perform in line with that objective, albeit with our improvements offsetting FX rather than resulting in OM rate expansion as we like to see.
A few other items to mention related to guidance are: We expect our restructuring charges and tax rate to be let relatively flat in the prior year. And then finally, as we look to the first quarter, we expect our first quarter EPS as a percentage of the full year EPS to be approximately 18.5%, which is very close to the prior 2 year's average. 
Moving to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. I've already touched on most of the drivers behind our organic growth, so I'll spent a minute on margin rate expectations. We expect Tools & Storage margin to be relatively flat year-over-year, and is primarily the result of the FX dynamic a described earlier, netting against the really impressive operating leverage this business continues to achieve.
We expect Security margins to continue to improve modestly versus the prior year, reflecting benefits from further progress in field productivity, our commercial investments and the realignment of the cost structure of the business to help drive profitable future growth, another good step forward is anticipated. Industrial margins are expected to be relatively flat, as productivity gains and cost take-out's, particularly, within the Engineered Fastening business, are expected to offset top line pressure, are previously discussed related to key portions of this segment.
Before moving on to the summary of this morning's call, I would like to discuss the potential for a recessionary environment to make a few comments on what actions we would take if and I emphasize if we are faced with deteriorating economic conditions. At this stage, we believe the U.S. recession is low probability in 2016. However, we have established contingency plans to ensure we are adequately prepared. If we were faced with this type of an environment, consistent with our behavior in past similar circumstances, we would execute mitigation press and they would take the form of headcount reductions, investment delays and further discretionary spending reductions. Specifically, if the environment results in enough experiencing a flat organic revenue performance versus our current view of 3% growth, we would take off actions to hold EPS relatively close to our guidance range. Clearly, if a more severe environment is to occur, which appears unlikely at this stage, we would focus on protecting our earnings basis much is possible, similar to the approach we took in 2009.
Now moving on to the summary page. We are very pleased with the businesses performance in 2015. We witnessed strong operational execution overcome a host of external challenges, including $220 million of foreign exchange headwind which delivered ultimately, organic growth of 6% at the top end of our targeted range, a record operating margin rate of 14.2% which was up 90 basis points versus the prior year; and of course, double-digit EPS growth.
We are also encouraged with the progress in our Security business, particularly Security Europe which really made meaningful improvement on all fronts. As we look to 2016, we are focused on positioning the company to manage through another year of turbulent markets and severe foreign exchange headwinds. As such, we remain committed to our core objectives: Maintaining our focus on organic growth through both continued innovation and commercial excellence; ensuring progress within Security segment -- the Security segment to maintain the momentum we saw in 2015, of course, executing on an additional cost and pricing actions to help partially offset our FX headwinds and also being prepared to take further actions as conditions warrant. As always, maintaining our perpetual focus on working capital manage -- management and improving that as we move forward, and importantly, leveraging the pillars of SFS 2.0 and to continue driving momentum in 2016 and beyond.
That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now, I move to Q&A."

The innovation pipeline for Tools & Storage is as robust as it has been at any time since the merger. And what we've been focusing on, if you rewind to 2010 when we put the companies together, there was a lithium-ion problem, they were losing share. We inherited that. Fortunately, they had done a fair amount of corrective action that began to manifest itself in the -- shortly after the merger and we start to regaining share. And then we, after that, a year or 2 of that, really came out strong with the DC brushless, a complete redesign of DC brushless products. And that became the fastest-growing segment of cordless. And we became the -- we were growing at about 2x, and still are going at a very rapid rate, vis a vis competition. And then at the same time, there was a lot of incremental -- call it incremental innovation in hand tools and storage and revitalization of the Black & Decker brand and product lines, the consumer products and accessories as well. So there's been a lot of I'll call it broad-based but relatively small-scale innovation in addition to the lithium ion gains and then the DC brushless gains. So that's all really what's driven the NPI -- driven some of the growth here in addition to the commercial excellence that you referred to. Now what's coming is something more on the order of breakthrough innovation, which is the real SFS 2.0. And without getting into the details of exactly what it is, I think if you stay tuned during 2016, you will start to see some pretty interesting innovation that would be more in the category of breakthrough. And in addition to that, we will continue on with the incremental type innovation in the DC brushless and the -- continuing progress in lithium-ion. So it really is a step-function increase in innovation that is occurring in the tools business. And you'll start to see the manifestation of that, I think, in the second half of the year. As far as Europe, there's a number of things going on in Europe relative to the Black & Decker products, the consumer business, the brushless, which is a big deal over there, and a number of other things. But I'd say Europe is a combination, to the NPI -- plus just a tremendous thrust into commercial excellence, which as we've described it or as we describe it, involves a multipronged attack into the 7 pillars, if you will of customer-facing processes, which include gaining customer insights, driving innovation, driving brand awareness, being excellent at pricing and promotion, deploying the sales force properly, doing channel in partner programs that are very aggressive and successful. And then finally, providing outstanding customer sales and post sales support. And it's a focus on all those various processes. When you put them all together, that's what's really driving the growth in Europe. And I'd say on top of that, you have what I'll call second-order revenue synergies from the Black & Decker merger than our -- even today, manifesting themselves in the -- further growth customer whitespace, distribution channel whitespace, those types of things, brand whitespace are all helping drive the European growth."

The business is that represents about 20% of our total business, 25%, I guess, within industrial hand tools within Tools & Storage. But if it if I kind of address, I'll say, the elephant in the room or you're very -- polite or diplomatic about it, but I think I can answer your question quite helpfully. We strive to grow at 2x the rate of the markets in our Tools & Storage business over the long term. And we've mattered to exceed that objective over the past 2 years as Jim just described as the SFS 2.0 growth initiatives started to gain traction. And this being said, I don't think it's realistic to plan such outsized growth in each and every quarter from any global diversified industrial. So in the fourth quarter, organic growth was lower than we'd planned but the shortfall was in areas you would expect. And a lot of information from Jim and Don. But to try to summarize it, we did have lower industrial channel volumes in Tools & Storage and Stanley Engineered Fastening, that was the full point of organic growth relative to our expectations. And that's globally across the company. Another full point was lower customer-specific volumes than it's been well on the public domain from a large consumer electronics customer from our Stanley Engineered Fastening business, again, within the Industrial segment. But that contributed almost the full point of slower organic growth than our expectations. Something that's not directly related to industrial channels, emerging markets softness, if you will, contributed about 1 point. So relative to the 1% reported, that's about 300 more basis points. And then lastly, Don talked about the fiscal calendar phenomenon, which was another 100 to 200 basis points. So looking at all that way, it's -- I think it's fairly straight forward, without question, the biggest headwind being industrial markets in general, and those markets in the U.S., in particular because they've been so strong. Conversely, as Jim just talked about, Tools & Storage in the U.S., up mid-single-digits; Europe, up 6% [ph] but that's driven by construction and retail, even e-commerce, which was way up. Automotive is still strong, we grew 6% in the fourth quarter which is well above the rate of white vehicle production, and Security Europe -- our investments are paying off, it was up 3%. So I think your question is spot on. Our biggest headwind on organic growth, obviously, so that has nothing to do with FX, are the industrial markets. They represent 20% to 30% of our business. And if they're flat, we think that -- the markets are flat, we think that's probably as well is -- they're going to do. And I think you can do the math from there. So I hope that helps."

It's an interesting situation because you have various -- very much a sector specific series of issues with agriculture, mining and oil and gas or energy. So there's a capital -- cap is kind of contraction going on in those industries. And it's sort of spilled over to, in fact, the overall MRO market as well. And then you have industrial markets such as automotive that are more driven by consumer demand, and those are relatively healthy. So within industrial, you have a dichotomy of markets that are flat out on their back. And then you have other healthy markets. And fortunately for us, a good portion of our industrial exposure happens to be in the automotive. And if that holds up, that'll be a very good thing. And we'll just see what -- how long it takes for this ag, mining and energy, those segments to kind of play out and trough out.

We don't -- we just have a policy not to mention customers names on our call. But I think it's quite clear who it is, and that's -- they're choosing not ours.

Today, the huge customers but they represent about 1/2 that amount. And the same thing with Engineered Fastening, and then I'll turn it -- we'll turn it over to Don.

But even if it we're going to do the same thing irrespective of cyclical or -- in cyclical, Jim, Don and I have been doing this a longtime. I want to talk about where you were about I've done business when it was at $0.85, and we've seen it approach $1.50. That's fairly cyclical. Irrespective, whether it's cyclical or secular, what we can do the most, I think, 2 things: We're not going to double down where the risks I high but we're also not going to walk away from our investments. We're going to stay positioned, particularly in emerging markets, and 50% of our revenues is outside the U.S. in those markets which will continue to grow albeit slower from a lower base, to be in a position to leverage our share and leverage our volume, when and if it turns around. But the biggest thing affecting it and I think Don touched on it -- we always will talk about translational in transactional. And as the transactional aspect gross to more than 50% of our foreign exchange headwind, what we're working very hard to do is move production and sourcing locally. We have a goal to produce 50% or more of what we do in countries where we sell it. And if you take that to the next step, obviously, everyone knows you can't build a plant overnight, nor would you want to, nor would you want to put bricks-and-mortar down if you believe it's secular. But what we can do is a much better job and we're working hard at it, qualifying local, both raw materials and more important, critical importance of players. And if you're working in emerging markets, as I think you're aware, many of our components that are critical to quality are either U.S.-made or U.S. produced or dollar-denominated. To the extent we could qualify local suppliers, protect our IP but produce those critical components locally, to be processed locally, that's going to be a tremendous offset or hedge. But Don may want to add something to that?"

I think -- and that particular point, what John said is exactly the correct. However, the reality is that at this stage in certain parts of the world, Canada and Brazil, being the best examples, there's not a great deal of suppliers that are available that we can do that way. So that's something that we have to think about, is there an Asian company that we are currently working with -- that they can create a plant within Brazil and allow us to have a supplier locally. That is transacting locally? Those are all things that takes time. These does not necessarily the things that happen overnight. In the meantime, we're doing things as much as we can that make economic sense over the short term and the long term. But I think we do view this is very much a cyclical shift and if that view changes overtime, then obviously, our view of -- where we manufacturer, we'll have to shift as well. Because if you look at the history of Stanley and, of course, the history of Black & Decker separately, they're both known for pursuing the lowest cost possible and also, maintaining the highest quality. And that's not going to change. So as dynamics shift in the markets around the world and the costs shift with it, we have to be flexible and agile to make sure that we're doing the right thing from a supply chain perspective."

We also -- within that business, within Engineered Fastening, where we have a kind of general industrial sector that's about $0.5 billion in revenue on an annualized basis, that has been feeling pressure as well similar to the industrial tool business within Tools & Storage. And for example, in the fourth quarter, that business was down approximately 10%. And we expect that to continue, at least into the first half. So those 2 things are definitely putting pressure on the top line and the margin. Now offsetting that and going in the opposite direction is what Jim and what John had mentioned about the automotive production business within Engineered Fastening, is offsetting that, we expect growth probably in the mid-single digits again within that business in 2016. And we also have cost actions in various other productivity actions we're taking across Engineered Fastening to make sure that margins are flat and hopefully, will be a bit better than that is the year goes on. And then the 2 smaller pieces of industrial which is the Oil & Gas business and the hydraulic tool business, a combination of what we call infrastructure, yes, we expect those to be relatively flat on the top line, maybe down slightly and then margin, flat as well as those markets are pretty slow at this stage.

I guess, I'll just add to that, I think it is important because the very end of your question was more than fair in terms of getting paid for the innovation. We have a history of -- if you were protecting price are being paid by innovation just for that reason. Specifically, to bring the same product for a minor, modest incremental improvement to a customer even in a flat commodity situation, and expect the price increases, unrealistic to say the least, real prices have been declining 2% to 3% a year or 1% 2% a year for the last 10 years, real prices. So the way to protect price -- and I think it's probably more important in understanding why Don has confident that overall, we'll see some modest price is to bring in some cases, meaningful -- incremental but meaningful, and in other canis cases, to Jim's point, breakthrough innovation to the customers -- if no one else has it, you can charge whatever you can value price and charge what you believe is appropriate for it. So it's far easier to bring about improvement at a 5% or 6% higher price point. That way, you cover your inflation, your labor inflation, or anything else that there -- happens to be there, the incremental cost of that improvement. And you and the customer both wins. Because the customer can take its retail price up, you can take your wholesale price up, and thereby, protecting margins and everybody wins. And it's a fair trade."

On the industrial side, it was pretty much a consistent trend throughout the quarter other than electronics. Obviously, electronics shifted to the negative dramatically in the month of November, and that held into December and held -- it's holding into the first quarter.

Importantly, as Jim pointed out, I think most important, POS was good in the fourth quarter, so inventories are in a good place. So nothing to suggest dire strait, but it's very early days."

As far as the North American Security business, I mean, I think we're finding that in the verticals, the Healthcare vertical is doing absolutely fabulously. It's achieved mid-double-digit margins, mid-teens. And is growing faster making some investments to grow it faster and it could be a substantial contributor to organic growth. The retail vertical, I think, is still kind of in the early days, in terms of trying to figure out exactly where the value proposition can be and how big we can make that, how profitable it can be. And so I'd say we're probably in about a third or fourth inning with the retail, but I would expect by mid to late '16, we would make a lot of progress on that front as well. I think the other verticals -- those are the 2 verticals that we're going to be emphasizing this year and really, get them right, get the Healthcare one growing, get the retail strategy fully engaged. And then at that point, we'll decide if we want to add another critical to our main area of focus."

So, yes, I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, the free cash flow for 2015 came in a little bit lighter than we anticipated, and it was primarily due to less working capital liquidation as a result of the lower organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. And aunts interesting, the timing of how it played out as -- you see what happens in our Tools & Storage business, in particular, that we have high levels of revenue on October or November, preparing for the holiday season as well as doing kind of refill orders after Black Friday. And then we collect a lot of that by the end of December because we saw a different trend occurring in that particular business and obviously a lower organic growth number, then our expectation, the result was that we didn't get the working capital turn that we anticipating. We're anticipating at 9.5 to 9.7. They came in at 9.2 which are actually fantastic. And at this stage, working capital turn improvement becomes harder and harder. The other dynamic as we grow organically and we saw that significant organic growth we had in 2015, you have to improve your working capital turns even more to get a cash flow benefit. So even with -- if we have achieved an improvement to 9.5 and 9.7, we still would have cash flow statement for working capital would've had to get a much closer to 10 to see a positive. And that's just the reality what we're going to do with going forward, that we won't see large working capital benefit in the cash flow statement, and we want to continue to improve working capital and get it over 10 turns over the next few years. And hopefully, when -- as we do that, the amount of impact to cash flow will be modest. But likely the monthly negative as a result, our cash flow on a go-forward basis will be -- will still be very strong. I would, as I said for 2016, expect the conversion rate to be about 100%, which would mean it's going to be similar between $900 million to $925 million for 2016. We always look to improve our working capital more than we had our goals and expectations. So obviously, we'll be driving to try to outperform that, but right now based on where we are with our working capital turn, we can't expect the large cash flow benefits from that area. And really, the cash flow is going to come from the earnings performance and operational performance."

Today, we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance and then, of course, take your questions.Fir",645,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Today, we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance and then, of course, take your questions.
First, for the year, organic growth was up 6% with Tools & Storage leading the way, up 8%. Security was flat, while industrial delivered 2%. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14.2%, which is a post-merger record for the company.  EPS was $5.92 with a 10% improvement versus 2014. Jim is going to provide a lot more detail, particularly on the margins and growth by segment when he gets into the segment reviews. 
Free cash flow came in at $871 million on strong working capital turns at 9.2. And in line with our previous commitments, we executed over $1 billion of share repurchase actions in 2015, wrapping up a really strong year in which we overcame numerous challenges, not the least of which was foreign currency.
Guidance for 2016 is being established with an EPS range of $6 and $6.20 per share or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3% versus 2015. Don is going to take you through this in more detail later in the call.
Moving to the right on the chart for the quarter. Revenue expanded 1% organically, with total gross down 5% with the top line impacted, foreign currency was negative 6% for the quarter. There was a fiscal calendar phenomenon in the fourth quarter that did have a modest negative impact on organic growth, that Don is going to address more in detail when he walks through the quarter, but I think it's an important point.
Operating margin rate for the quarter was 14.2%, which was a 100 basis point improvement ahead of fourth quarter '14. Our margins increased due to continued sharp focus on price realization and some commodity deflation, delivering operating leverage, despite $50 million from foreign currency pressure in the quarter. EPS of $1.78, was up 30% versus fourth quarter '14 as the solid operational performance, combined with lower tax, share count and some restructuring, less than the prior quarter offset the foreign exchange.
Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of the sources of growth. This quarter, as previously mentioned, organic growth remained positive due to the continued strength of Tools & Storage, particularly in the U.S. and the European residential and nonresidential construction markets and the Stanley Engineered Fastening automotive business, which offset pressure in the industrial channel, lower emerging market volumes and customer-specific volume declines within the Stanley Engineered Fastening Electronics business.
This growth was offset by foreign exchange headwinds of 6% in the quarter, resulting in total revenue down 5% as previously mentioned. Looking at it geographically, Europe lead the way, up 3% as share gains continued in the region and nearly every market contributed positive growth. The U.S. generated 1% organic growth, while solid construction POS performance has left customer inventories in good shape as we enter 2016. 
Emerging markets and the rest of the world begin to show signs of macro pressure to the top line, contracting 2% and 3%, respectively. There was as always, significant variation among the countries, with China, Russia and Venezuela showed the largest year-on-year declines.  Quickly, for the year, organic growth was 6%, 5% volume, 1% price. This growth was offset by 7% currency, netting down to a 1% decline in total revenue, as shown in the box on the left of the chart.
We were pleased that geographically, the organic growth we shared around the world has spread fairly evenly, of course, with the U.S. leading the way at plus 8%, Europe, plus 4%; emerging markets, plus 3%; and the rest of the world, plus 3%. 
Let me turn it over to, Jim, to get into some more operating detail on our 3 segments."

I'll start with the Tools & Storage which wrapped up a banner year, with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult comps, mixed end markets and a relentless dollar strengthening. Tools benefited from strong execution momentu",1507,"Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with the Tools & Storage which wrapped up a banner year, with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult comps, mixed end markets and a relentless dollar strengthening. 
Tools benefited from strong execution momentum in all areas, new products, supply chain and commercial excellence. As for markets, continued strength in U.S. construction, DIY and consumer was a help. However, emerging market and overall industrial conditions where more than challenging. European tool end markets continue to be flat to slightly positive, and continuing U.S. dollars strengthening especially against Latin American currencies presented familiar but increasingly large headwinds for both revenues and operating margin.
Organic growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter, with all regions once again contributing, Europe lead the way, up 6%, followed by North America and emerging markets contributing 3% and 1%, respectively. Although revenues were down 3% due to a 6-point currency impact, operating margin was up 1% with a 60 basis point year-over-year improvement in the rate. Execution of price, productivity and cost control initiatives, along with a little help from lower commodity prices, enabled us to more than offset the onslaught from currency pressure. And across the global product lines, Power Tools posted 5% organic growth, with contributions from Professional Power Tools, up 7%; Consumer Power Tools, up 3%; and accessories, up 2%.
Our Hand Tools & Storage business was down 2%, as strength within construction tools and our Mac Mobile Distribution business was offset by significantly lower sales within the industrial channel. 
Innovation continues to generate solid growth across the business, with ongoing contributions from DC brushless power tools as well as new product rollouts such as the DeWalt 20- and 40-volt outdoor, Stanley FatMax Power Tools in Europe and DeWalt Pneumatics. Within North America, retail POS performance was again strong in the quarter, wrapping up a record year which saw a positive POS in 50 of 52 weeks. Growth across every SBU and as impressively across all major brands, Black & Decker, DeWalt, Stanley and Bostitch.
Importantly, retail inventories remain at healthy and appropriate levels consistent with prior year. And in addition, the team continues to drive out-performance in Mac tools, which closed the quarter with growth in high single digits, delivering its 6 consecutive year and 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. And finally, we continue to enjoy robust growth in e-commerce, this time, highlighted by success with our rebranded and very innovative Black & Decker consumer products.
Europe continues to perform at multiples above the underlying market, posting 6% organic growth in the quarter for a full year total of 7%. This region has shown remarkably consistent share gains in a relatively flat market, delivering approximately 7% organic growth across much of the past 3 years. Importantly, the growth in Europe continues to be widespread across nearly all regions as consistent share gains validate the success of our innovation and commercial excellence initiatives.
The emerging market team once again overcame significant market headwinds, generating 1% organic growth in the quarter with contributions from Argentina, Mexico and Turkey more than offsetting continued pressures in Russia, China, Brazil and other parts of South America. And meanwhile, the timely global release of the Stanley Power Tools line for emerging markets continues to get traction in the large and growing mid-price point segment, helping to offset regional economic and geopolitical market turbulence. 
The fourth quarter caps off an exceptional year by our Tools & Storage team; 8% organic growth for the year against a 6% 2014 comp, with an operating margin rate up 110 basis points, executing on all fronts, taking share, improving profitability in the face of a volatile backdrop, and at the same time, the team very methodically and successfully positioned the business for more growth ahead. In that regard, we see continued robust growth for tools in 2016. Our innovation pipeline is stronger than anytime since the merger, and our supply chain and commercial teams are operating at very high fitness levels with SFS 2.0 firmly embedded in our operating culture. These are exciting times for Tools & Storage, and we expect the performance level to continue to be very high as we go forward.
Turning to Security. Progress continued across our Security business with Europe advancing on all fronts, and North America showing steady progress in its transformation efforts. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically, the fifth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Commercial lens were widespread across most countries as we recognize benefits from investments in our regional sales organizations. Profitability continued to improve sequentially and versus prior year, with a fourth quarter operating margin rate approaching 10%.  Solid order intake and a healthy backlog, both up double digits year-over-year, combined with stable attrition rates within our targeted range, leave us well positioned to continue forward momentum into 2016.
While organic revenues were down within North America due principally to a large installation in last year's fourth quarter, the team posted sequential margin expansion due to improved field productivity within the commercial Electronic Security business as the benefits from the Stanley standard operational improvement initiative began to take hold. Strong orders, a healthy backlog and a growing RMR portfolio position this business well as we head into 2016.
Emerging markets were again a modest drag on Security growth and profitability as weak market conditions in China continued. But overall, for the segment, profitability was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially, a solid indicator that our transformation efforts are taking hold within the organization.
Turning to Industrial. Industrial saw a 1% organic decline in the quarter as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening's, electronics and industrial businesses more than offset strong global automotive revenue and organic growth in our Oil & Gas business. Operating profit was up 5%, with a 210-basis-point improvement in the margin rate, as productivity gains and cost controls were able to counteract lower volume.
Engineered Fastening's 3% organic decline was attributable to weakening within the industrial channel and lower sales volume in the electronics space as our largest consumer electronics customer unexpectedly reduced production levels on their recently launched smartphone. This more than offset another quarter in which our automotive revenues outpaced light vehicle production. The business was able to anticipate some of the industrial market softness and thus benefited from proactive cost actions taken within the quarter. Infrastructure delivered positive organic growth of 2%, as Oil & Gas grew 17% organically, propelled by increased project activity in the North America onshore market, more than offsetting declines in hydraulics, which continues to be impacted by depressed scrap steel prices.
All-in-all, an impressive operational performance was registered by the industrial teams, expanding profitability and margin rates in the face of a choppy and mostly inhospitable end-market environment, with the exception of auto production. 
In summary, for the total company, the fourth quarter represented a solid performance wrapping up a tremendous year which included organic growth of 6%, record operating margins and record EPS.  This performance highlights our team's agility, passion to perform and ability to be proactive and responsive to market condition, balancing investments for growth and taking out costs when necessary, strengths that will serve us well as we head into 2016. 
As we consider the 2016 outlook which, Don, will share with you in a few minutes, our ability to generate outsized organic growth albeit at a slower pace than in the preceding 2 years, will be enabled by the investments we have made and are making in SFS 2.0, which is our transformational business operating system. 
In early 2015, we launched the next generation of SFS, creating a more powerful mechanism to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion with high asset efficiency. The expanded SFS 2.0 is transforming the company by focusing our activities in 5 key areas: Digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, commercial excellence, functional transformation and core SFS. I would encourage serious long-term investors to develop a deep understanding of SFS 2.0, in that this is not an Investor Relations marketing jargon but rather a carefully constructed and executed framework that enables our organization to extract maximum value out of our world-class franchises. We do this through capital efficient organic growth and continuous margin expansion. You have already seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in the organic growth and margin expansion in Tools & Storage and other parts of the company. In 2016, you will see a growing impact from breakthrough innovation, digital as well as the other elements of the initiative, which is now in its second year and gaining momentum.
I would also say that we are once again, open for business when it comes to inorganic growth. We look forward to supplementing our organic growth with a disciplined approach to M&A that we have deployed during almost 100 acquisitions over the past 15 years, a period of time when we more than quadrupled our revenues and market cap and outperformed the S&P 500's total shareholder return by 5x. 
With that, I'll turn it over to, Don Allan."
304977,321463517,922370,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full ye",1756,"Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full year. This full year result is approximately $50 million to $75 million lower than we anticipated going into the quarter and is the result of lower than expected fourth quarter volumes in Tools & Storage and Engineered Fastening, which in turn, resulted in lower working capital liquidation.
Nonetheless, working capital turns finished the year at 9.2x, flat to the prior year, but at a level that many industrials would envy. Overall, our cash flow performance remained strong, a 96% conversion rate for the full year in our leverage metrics are in line with our year-end expectations.
One additional comment on free cash flow as it relates to the other line. As you can see, we experienced approximately $120 million variants versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. This variants was planned and is due primarily to discontinued operation activity in the fourth quarter of 2014, combined with the timing of certain derivative settlements and tax payments. 
So let's turn to Page 11. I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. Certainly, it won't be news to anyone that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against the vast majority of currencies around the world. This strong dollar has resulted in approximately a 50% increase against the Brazilian real since the beginning of 2015. Also, the British pound and the Australian dollar are at levels we have not seen since the 2008 credit crisis, and the Canadian dollar has not been this weak versus U.S. Dollar for well over 1 decade. And last but certainly not least, the Argentinian peso, which essentially been on a constant decline since the government's default back in 2001, accelerated its traction with a 30% cliff devaluation in December, resulting in other meaningful headwind for us in 2016. 
The effect of all these moves is that we are facing another significant foreign exchange headwind in 2016, which at current spot rates, results in a year-over-year impact to operating margin between $170 million and $190 million. This impact is a combination of transactional and translational. However, approximately 2/3 of the 2016 headwind will be transactional, pressuring our margins, while approximately 1/3 will be translational. The transactional amount is substantially higher than prior year, as we feel the impact of the 2015 derivative hedges expiring in 2016, and this is approximately $60 million of our total currency headwind.  This 2016 currency impact is on top of over $300 million in currency headwinds we faced over the past 2 years where our team's focused on significant operational actions which more than offset these pressures in 2014 and 2015. 
However, given the magnitude of these continued headwinds, we will not be able to completely offset currency in 2016 with pricing cost action. That being said, we will offset approximately 50% of this $170 million to $190 million headwind within 2016. And as we have previously discussed, over the long term, we will continue to identify opportunities to localize production to help mitigate currency as well as improve the efficiency of our global supply chain.
So let's transition to our 2016 outlook on the next page. As John mentioned, we are guiding to an EPS range of $6 to $6.20 or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3%. 
Let's walk through some of the key drivers in our guidance. First, we expect organic growth to approximate 3%, which will contribute $0.45 to $0.50 EPS for the year. As Jim discussed, SFS 2.0 will help fuel this growth in 2016 and beyond. We expect our Tools & Storage business to continue to make -- to take market share in most regions. Our innovation pipeline is robust, and we believe this business can leverage that to grow in the low to mid-single-digits in the face of challenging global macroeconomic environment.
We expect progress to continue within the Security platform, resulting in low single-digit growth. And we also expect industrial to have low single-digit growth as the Engineered Fastening automotive business will continue to demonstrate strong growth while the remainder of the segment faces pressures across several end markets, including Oil & Gas, scrap steel, general industrial and electronics. 
One additional point related to organic growth before I move on to the next topic. It's worth noting that when normalizing for a 53-week activity which was included in the 2014 fourth quarter, which is a fiscal calendar phenomenon that occurs every 7 years, if you adjust for that, the total company's organic growth would've actually been 1.5 to 2 points higher or approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is notable when you consider the fact that 1% organic growth in us guiding to 3% organic growth in 2016. We believe this, along with the strength of certain markets we operate in, namely U.S. construction, along with global automotive production, combined with our focus in SFS 2.0, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 3% organic growth outlook for 2016.
Continuing to the next EPS driver. We will see another $0.45 to $0.50 of earnings improvement from additional cost and productivity initiatives. We have a solid amount of carryover commodity deflation materializing in 2016, and the business teams have worked hard to identify additional cost-reduction opportunities, which on top of our normal productivity gains, will result in a solid contribution to the bottom line. Also, we see an additional increase to EPS of approximately $0.13 from a lower share base due to the carryover benefit of our 2015 share actions as well as opportunistic buybacks, particularly if we continue to see depressed share prices. Working against all of these strong operational actions will be the previously mentioned foreign exchange headwind, which results in approximately $0.85 to $0.95 of EPS pressure year-over-year.
Because of the severity of this transactional currency headwind, and its impact on margins, we expect the company-wide operating margin for 2016 to be relatively flat year-over-year. To put this in perspective, we estimate that the FX headwinds, net of benefits we are receiving from lower commodity costs as well as pricing activities, will cause us to lose 60 to 75 basis points of margin rate improvement in 2016. Our 3-year financial vision presented at the May 2015 investor meeting contemplated a 50 to 75 basis points of margin improvement each year, which assumed a stable foreign exchange environment. So we believe we're continuing to perform in line with that objective, albeit with our improvements offsetting FX rather than resulting in OM rate expansion as we like to see.
A few other items mentioned related to guidance are: We expect our restructuring charges and tax rate to be relatively flat to the prior year. And then finally, as we look to the first quarter, we expect our first quarter EPS percentage over the the full year EPS to be approximately 18.5%, which is very close to the prior 2 year's average. 
Moving to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. I've already touched on most of the drivers behind our organic growth, so I'll spend a minute on margin rate expectations. We expect Tools & Storage margin to be relatively flat year-over-year, and is primarily the result of the FX dynamic I described earlier, netting against the really impressive operating leverage this business continues to achieve.
We expect Security margins to continue to improve modestly versus prior year, reflecting benefits from further progress in field productivity, commercial investments, and the realignment of the cost structure of the business to help drive profitable future growth, another good step forward is anticipated. Industrial margins are expected to be relatively flat, as productivity gains and cost take-out's, particularly, within the Engineered Fastening business, are expected to offset top line pressure, are previously discussed related to key portions of this segment.
Before moving on to the summary of this morning's call, I would like to discuss the potential for a recessionary environment to make a few comments on what actions we would take if, and I emphasize if, if we are faced with deteriorating economic conditions. At this stage, we believe a U.S. recession is low probability in 2016. However, we have established contingency plans to ensure we are adequately prepared. If we were faced with this type of an environment, consistent with our behavior in past similar circumstances, we would execute mitigation plans and they would take the form of headcount reductions, investment delays and further discretionary spending reductions. Specifically, if the environment results in us experiencing a flat organic revenue performance versus our current view of 3% growth, we would take actions to hold EPS relatively close to our guidance range. Clearly, if a more severe environment is to occur, which appears unlikely at this stage, we would focus on protecting our earnings base as much as possible, similar to the approach we took in 2009.
Now moving on to the summary page. We are very pleased with the businesses performance in 2015. We witnessed strong operational execution overcome a host of external challenges, including $220 million of foreign exchange headwind which delivered ultimately, organic growth of 6% at the top end of our targeted range, a record operating margin rate of 14.2% which was up 90 basis points versus the prior year; and of course, double-digit EPS growth.
We are also encouraged with the progress in our Security business, particularly Security Europe which really made meaningful improvement on all fronts. As we look to 2016, we are focused on positioning the company to manage through another year of turbulent markets and severe foreign exchange headwinds. As such, we remain committed to our core objectives: Maintaining our focus on organic growth through both continued innovation and commercial excellence; ensuring progress within Security segment -- the Security segment to maintain the momentum we saw in 2015, of course, executing on additional cost and pricing actions to help partially offset our FX headwinds and also being prepared to take further actions as conditions warrant. As always, maintaining our perpetual focus on working capital manage -- management and improving that as we move forward, and importantly, leveraging the pillars of SFS 2.0 and to continue driving momentum in 2016 and beyond.
That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now, I move to Q&A."

The innovation pipeline for Tools & Storage is as robust as it has been at any time since the merger. And what we've been focusing on, if you rewind to 2010 when we put the companies together, there was a lithium-ion problem, they were losing share. We inherited that. Fortunately, they had done a fair amount of corrective action that began to manifest itself in the -- shortly after the merger and we started regaining share. And then we, after that, a year or 2 of that, really came out strong with the DC brushless, a complete redesign of DC brushless products. And that became the fastest-growing segment of cordless. And we became the -- we were growing at about 2x, and still are growing at a very rapid rate vis-à-vis competition. And then at the same time, there was a lot of incremental -- call it incremental innovation going on in Hand Tools & Storage and revitalization of the Black & Decker brand and product lines, the consumer products and accessories as well. So there's been a lot of, I'll call it broad-based but relatively small-scale innovation in addition to the lithium-ion gains and then the DC brushless gains. So that's all really what's driven the NPI -- driven some of the growth here in addition to the commercial excellence that you referred to. Now what's coming is something more on the order of breakthrough innovation, which is the real SFS 2.0. And without getting into the details of exactly what it is, I think if you stay tuned during 2016, you will start to see some pretty interesting innovation that would be more in the category of breakthrough. And in addition to that, we will continue on with the incremental type innovation in the DC brushless and the continuing progress in lithium-ion. So it really is a step-function increase in innovation that is occurring in the tools business. And you'll start to see the manifestation of that, I think, in the second half of the year. As far as Europe, there's a number of things going on in Europe relative to the Black & Decker products, the consumer business, the brushless, which is a big deal over there, and a number of other things. But I'd say Europe is a combination, to the NPI plus just a tremendous thrust into commercial excellence, which as we've described it or as we describe it, involves a multipronged attack into the 7 pillars, if you will of customer-facing processes, which include gaining customer insights, driving innovation, driving brand awareness, being excellent at pricing and promotion, deploying the sales force properly, doing channel partner programs that are very aggressive and successful. And then finally, providing outstanding customer sales and post sales support. And it's a focus on all those various processes. When you put them all together, that's what's really driving the growth in Europe. And I'd say on top of that, you have what I'll call second-order revenue synergies from the Black & Decker merger that are even today manifesting themselves in further growth customer whitespace, distribution channel whitespace, those types of things, brand whitespace are all helping drive the European growth."

The good news is it represents about 20% of our total business, 25%, I guess, with industrial hand tools within Tools & Storage. But if I kind of address, I'll say, the elephant in the room, you're very polite or diplomatic about it, but I think I can answer your question quite helpfully. We strive to grow at 2x the rate of the market in our Tools & Storage business over the long term. And we've met or exceeded that objective over the past 2 years as, Jim, just described as the SFS 2.0 growth initiatives started to gain traction. And this being said, I don't think it's realistic to plan such outsized growth in each and every quarter from any global diversified industrial. So in the fourth quarter, organic growth was lower than we'd planned but the shortfall was in areas you would expect. And a lot of information from, Jim and Don. But to try to summarize it, we did have lower industrial channel volumes in Tools & Storage and Stanley Engineered Fastening, that was the full point of organic growth relative to our expectations. And that's globally across the company. Another full point was lower customer-specific volumes and it's been well in the public domain from a large consumer electronics customer for our Stanley Engineered Fastening business, again, within the Industrial segment. But that contributed almost the full point of slower organic growth than our expectations. Something that's not directly related to industrial channels, emerging market softness, if you will, contributed about 1 point. So relative to the 1% reported, that's about 300 more basis points. And then lastly, Don talked about the fiscal calendar phenomenon, which was another 100 to 200 basis points. So looking at all that way, it's -- I think it's fairly straight forward, without question, the biggest headwind being in industrial markets in general, and those markets in the U.S., in particular because they've been so strong. Conversely, as Jim just talked about, Tools & Storage in the U.S., up mid-single-digits; Europe, up 6% that's driven by construction and retail, even e-commerce, which was way up. Automotive is still strong, we grew 6% in the fourth quarter which is well above the rate of light vehicle production, and Security Europe -- our investments are paying off, it was up 3%. So I think your question is spot on. Our biggest headwind on organic growth, obviously, because that has nothing to do with FX, are the industrial markets. They represent 20% to 30% of our business. And if they're flat, we think that -- the markets are flat, we think that's probably as well as they're going to do. And I think you can do the math from there. So I hope that helps."

It's an interesting situation because you have various -- very much a sector specific series of issues with agriculture, mining and oil and gas or energy. So there's a capital --  CapEx kind of contraction going on in those industries. And it sort of spilled over to affect the overall MRO market as well. And then you have industrial markets such as automotive that are more driven by consumer demand, and those are relatively healthy. So within industrial, you have a dichotomy of markets that are flat out on their back. And then you have other healthy markets. And fortunately for us, a good portion of our industrial exposure happens to be in the automotive. And if that holds up, that'll be a very good thing. And we'll just see what -- how long it takes for this ag, mining and energy, those segments to kind of play out and trough out.

We don't -- we just have a policy not to mention customers names on our call. But I think it's quite clear who it is, and that's -- they're choosing not ours. That being said, strategically, it's to diversify our customer base, just as we've done over the years in Global Tools & Storage, where there was a point in time where the 2 largest North American big bucks retailers represented 40% of our business. Today, they're huge customers but they represent about 1/2 that amount. The same thing with Engineered Fastening, and then I'll turn it -- we'll turn it over to Don. Less than 3 years ago, OEM automotive was more than 70% of the business. So the conscious decision to diversify the verticals we serve, particularly with a focus on electronics to a lesser extent, aerospace. And we've done that and it's been pretty successful. So we've had tremendous growth and a step back relative to 1 customers end market our product sales being down. Simply said, within consumer electronics, we need to diversify our customer base.

That business is demonstrating kind of mid- to high single-digit organic growth over the last year. We expect the -- that type of trend to continue.

But even if we're going to do the same thing irrespective of cyclical or -- cyclical, Jim, Don and I have been doing this a longtime. We just want to talk about the euro, everybody worries about it being at parity. I've done business when it was at $0.85, and we've seen it approach $1.50. That's fairly cyclical. Irrespective, whether it's cyclical or secular, what we can do the most, I think, 2 things: We're not going to double down where the risks are high but we're also not going to walk away from our investments. We're going to stay positioned, particularly in emerging markets, and 50% of our revenues is outside the U.S. in those markets which will continue to grow albeit slower from a lower base, to be in a position to leverage our share and leverage our volume, when and if it turns around. But the biggest thing affecting us and I think, Don touched on it, we always talk about both translational and transactional. And as the transactional aspect grows to more than 50% of our foreign exchange headwind, what we're working very hard to do is move production and sourcing locally. We have a goal to produce 50% or more of what we do in countries where we sell it. And if you take that to the next step, obviously, everyone knows you can't build a plant overnight, nor would you want to, nor would you want to put bricks-and-mortar down if you believe it's secular. But what we can do is a much better job and we're working hard at it, qualifying local, both raw materials and more important critical component suppliers. And if you're working in emerging markets, as I think you're aware, many of our components that are critical to quality are either U.S -- based or U.S. produced or dollar-denominated. To the extent we can qualify local suppliers, protect our IP but produce those critical components locally, to be processed locally, that's going to be a tremendous offset or hedge. Don, may want to add something to that."

I think in that particular point, what John said is exactly the correct. However, the reality is that at this stage in certain parts of the world, Canada and Brazil, being the best examples, there's not a great deal of suppliers that are available that we can do that with. So that's something that we have to think about, is there an Asian company that we are currently working with -- that they can create a plant within Brazil and allow us to have a supplier locally. That is transacting locally? Those are all things that take time. These are not necessarily things that happen overnight. In the meantime, we're doing things as much as we can that make economic sense over the short term and the long term. But I think we do view this as very much a cyclical shift and if that view changes overtime, then obviously, our view of where we manufacture, we'll have to shift as well. Because if you look at the history of Stanley and, of course, the history of Black & Decker separately, they're both known for pursuing the lowest cost possible and also, maintaining the highest quality. And that's not going to change. So as dynamics shift in the markets around the world and cost shift with it, we have to be flexible and agile to make sure that we're doing the right thing from a supply chain perspective."

We also -- within that business, within Engineered Fastening, where we have a kind of general industrial sector that's about $0.5 billion in revenue on an annualized basis, that has been feeling pressure as well similar to the Industrial Tool business within Tools & Storage. And -- for example, in the fourth quarter, that business was down approximately 10%. And we expect that to continue, at least into the first half. So those 2 things are definitely putting pressure on the top line and the margin. Now offsetting that and going in the opposite direction is what, Jim and both John had mentioned about the automotive production business within Engineered Fastening, is offsetting that, we expect growth probably in the mid-single digits again within that business in 2016. And we also have cost actions and various other productivity actions we're taking across Engineered Fastening to make sure that the margins are flat and hopefully little bit better than that as the year goes on. And then the 2 smaller pieces of industrial which is the Oil & Gas business and the hydraulic tool business, a combination of what we call infrastructure, we expect those to be relatively flat on the top line, maybe down slightly and then margin flat as well as those markets are pretty slow at this stage. But we think we've gone through the difficult comps as we go into 2016."

We do expect a modest positive in price in 2016, and there's really a makeup within that number. We do see positive -- more positive price in emerging market action. So as we deal with this currency pressure, in particular, in Brazil and some of the other Latin countries, but then also in Canada as well which is obviously not an emerging market, we expect some price increase there. So those are positives. Some of the negatives, we will see a little bit of price pressure in different parts of the mature markets as we have dealt with some significant commodity deflation, that's been a benefit to us. We don't expect that to be significant, but those are very kind of surgical strategic decisions that our Tools & Storage team is very savvy at managing and working through as part of the overall offering to our customers."

I guess, I'll just add to that, I think it is important because the very end of your question was more than fair in terms of getting paid for the innovation. We have a history of -- if you were protecting price are being paid by innovation just for that reason. Specifically, to bring the same product or a minor modest incremental improvement to a customer even in a flat commodity situation, and expect the price increases, unrealistic to say the least, real prices have been declining 2% to 3% a year or 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years, real prices. So the way to protect price -- and I think it's probably more important understanding why Don has confidence that overall we'll see some modest price is to bring in some cases, meaningful -- incremental but meaningful, and in other cases, to Jim's point, breakthrough innovation to the customers -- if no one else has it, you can charge whatever, you can value price and charge what you believe is appropriate for it. So it's far easier to bring a product improvement at a 5% or 6% higher price point. That way, you cover your inflation, your labor inflation, or anything else that there happens to be there, the incremental cost of that improvement. And you and the customer both wins. Because the customer can take his retail price up, you can take your wholesale price up, and thereby, protecting margins and everybody wins. And it's a fair trade."

I would say that we didn't see anything that was really indicative of significant market trends. When it comes to our retail business in Tools & Storage, there's a lot of ebbs and flows in the quarter that are really dependent on when customers want product, refilling orders, after the holiday season. So from a general market trend, we didn't see anything dramatic within the consumer side of Tools & Storage. On the industrial side, it was pretty much a consistent trend throughout the quarter other than electronics. Obviously, electronics shifted to the negative dramatically in the month of November, and that held into December and its held -- it's holding into the first quarter. So we're not necessarily taking anything as far as market trends in the fourth quarter as a big indicator to the first quarter and beyond, beyond some of the things that we've already discussed such as electronics and general industrial. But I think the only thing that really shifted within the quarter would've been the electronics business with Engineered Fastening."

And the other thing I'll add to that, that I think, most of us are aware of, as it relates to our retail customers and the retail business in general, one of the reasons, Don said that between 18% and 19% of our earnings take place from the first quarter -- January is always a very slow month, because I know you understand and most people on the call do, our largest customers fiscal years end in January. It's postholiday season. They have a very appropriate objective of reducing or minimizing inventories as the year closes. So simply said, whatever happens in January, we don't ever think of it as a good predictor or indicator of how the year is go to start. We need pretty much a full first quarter, particularly, on the retail side for that reason to get a flavor for where we are or where we're going. Importantly, as Jim pointed out, I think most important, POS was good in the fourth quarter, so inventories are in a good place. So nothing to suggest dire straits, but it's very early days."

As far as the North American Security business, I mean, I think we're finding that in the verticals, the Healthcare vertical is doing absolutely fabulously. It achieved mid-double-digit margins, mid-teens. And the issue with that now is how to grow it faster, so we'll be making some investments to grow it faster and it could be a substantial contributor to organic growth. The retail vertical, I think, is still kind of in the early days, in terms of trying to figure out exactly where the value proposition can be and how big we can make that, how profitable it can be. And so I'd say we're probably in about the third or fourth inning with the retail, but I would expect by mid to late '16, we would make a lot of progress on that front as well. I think the other verticals -- those are the 2 verticals that we're going to be emphasizing this year and really, get them right, get the Healthcare one growing, get the retail strategy fully engaged. And then at that point, we'll decide if we want to add another vertical to our main area of focus."

So, yes, I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, the free cash flow for 2015 came in a little bit lighter than we anticipated, and it was primarily due to less working capital liquidation as a result of the lower organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. And its interesting, the timing of how it played out is, usually what happens in our Tools & Storage business in particular is that we have high levels of revenue in October or November, preparing for the holiday season as well as doing kind of refill orders after Black Friday. And then we collect a lot of that by the end of December because we saw a different trend occur in that particular business and obviously a lower organic growth number, then our expectation, the result was that we didn't get the working capital turn that we're anticipating. We're anticipating turns of 9.5 to 9.7. They came in at 9.2 which are actually fantastic. And at this stage, working capital turn improvement becomes harder and harder. The other dynamic is as we grow organically and you saw the significant organic growth we had in 2015, you have to improve your working capital turns even more to get a cash flow benefit. So even with -- if we had achieved an improvement to 9.5 and 9.7, we still would had a slight negative within our cash flow statement for working capital, we would've had to get it much closer to 10 to see a positive. And that's just the reality of what we're going to deal with going forward, that we won't see large working capital benefit in the cash flow statement, and we want to continue to improve working capital and get it over 10 turns over the next few years. And hopefully, when we -- as we do that, the amount of impact to cash flow will be modest. But it likely will be modestly negative as a result, our cash flow on a go-forward basis will be -- will still be very strong. I would -- as I said for 2016, I expect the conversion rate to be about 100%, which would mean it's going to be similar between $900 million to $925 million for 2016. We always look to improve our working capital more and beyond our goals and expectations. So obviously, we'll be driving to try to outperform that, but right now based on where we are with our working capital turn, we can't expect large cash flow benefits from that area. And really, the cash flow is going to come from the earnings performance and operational performance."

Today, we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing a solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance and then, of course, take your questions.F",646,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Today, we're going to spend just a few minutes reviewing a solid operational fourth quarter that wrapped up a really strong year before we discuss this year's guidance and then, of course, take your questions.
First, for the year, organic growth was up 6% with Tools & Storage leading the way, up 8%. Security was flat, while industrial delivered 2%. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 14.2%, which is a post-merger record for the company.  EPS was $5.92 with a 10% improvement versus 2014. Jim is going to provide a lot more detail, particularly on the margins and growth by segment when he gets into the segment reviews. 
Free cash flow came in at $871 million on strong working capital turns at 9.2. And in line with our previous commitments, we executed over $1 billion of share repurchase actions in 2015, wrapping up a really strong year in which we overcame numerous challenges, not the least of which was foreign currency.
Guidance for 2016 is being established with an EPS range of $6 and $6.20 per share or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3% versus 2015. Don is going to take you through this in more detail later in the call.
Moving to the right on the chart for the quarter. Revenue expanded 1% organically, with total gross down 5% with the top line impacted, foreign currency was negative 6% for the quarter. There was a fiscal calendar phenomenon in the fourth quarter that did have a modest negative impact on organic growth, that Don is going to address more in detail when he walks through the quarter, but I think it's an important point.
Operating margin rate for the quarter was 14.2%, which was a 100 basis point improvement ahead of fourth quarter '14. Our margins increased due to continued sharp focus on price realization and some commodity deflation, delivering operating leverage, despite $50 million from foreign currency pressure in the quarter. EPS of $1.78, was up 30% versus fourth quarter '14 as the solid operational performance, combined with lower tax, share count and some restructuring, less than the prior quarter offset the foreign exchange.
Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of the sources of growth. This quarter, as previously mentioned, organic growth remained positive due to the continued strength of Tools & Storage, particularly in the U.S. and the European residential and nonresidential construction markets and the Stanley Engineered Fastening automotive business, which offset pressure in the industrial channel, lower emerging market volumes and customer-specific volume declines within the Stanley Engineered Fastening Electronics business.
This growth was offset by foreign exchange headwinds of 6% in the quarter, resulting in total revenue down 5% as previously mentioned. Looking at it geographically, Europe lead the way, up 3% as share gains continued in the region and nearly every market contributed positive growth. The U.S. generated 1% organic growth, while solid construction POS performance has left customer inventories in good shape as we enter 2016. 
Emerging markets and the rest of the world began to show signs of macro pressure to the top line, contracting 2% and 3%, respectively. There was as always, significant variation among the countries, with China, Russia and Venezuela showed the largest year-on-year declines.  Quickly, for the year, organic growth was 6%, 5% volume, 1% price. This growth was offset by 7% currency, netting down to a 1% decline in total revenue, as shown in the box on the left of the chart.
We were pleased that geographically, the organic growth we shared around the world has spread fairly evenly, of course, with the U.S. leading the way at plus 8%, Europe, plus 4%; emerging markets, plus 3%; and the rest of the world, plus 3%. 
Let me turn it over to, Jim, to get into some more operating detail on our 3 segments."
304977,321463517,922657,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with the Tools & Storage which wrapped up a banner year, with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult comps, mixed end markets and a relentless dollar strengthening. Tools benefited from strong execution momentu",1507,"Okay. Thanks, John. I'll start with the Tools & Storage which wrapped up a banner year, with solid fourth quarter performance despite difficult comps, mixed end markets and a relentless dollar strengthening. 
Tools benefited from strong execution momentum in all areas, new products, supply chain and commercial excellence. As for markets, continued strength in U.S. construction, DIY and consumer was a help. However, emerging market and overall industrial conditions were more than challenging. European tool end markets continue to be flat to slightly positive, and continuing U.S. dollars strengthening especially against Latin American currencies presented familiar but increasingly large headwinds for both revenues and operating margin.
Organic growth for the segment was 3% in the quarter, with all regions once again contributing, Europe lead the way, up 6%, followed by North America and emerging markets contributing 3% and 1%, respectively. Although revenues were down 3% due to a 6-point currency impact, operating margin was up 1% with a 60 basis point year-over-year improvement in the rate. Execution of price, productivity and cost control initiatives, along with a little help from lower commodity prices, enabled us to more than offset the onslaught from currency pressure. And across the global product lines, Power Tools posted 5% organic growth, with contributions from Professional Power Tools, up 7%; Consumer Power Tools, up 3%; and accessories, up 2%.
Our Hand Tools & Storage business was down 2%, as strength within construction tools and our Mac Mobile Distribution business was offset by significantly lower sales within the industrial channel. 
Innovation continues to generate solid growth across the business, with ongoing contributions from DC brushless power tools as well as new product rollouts such as the DeWalt 20- and 40-volt outdoor, Stanley FatMax Power Tools in Europe and DeWalt Pneumatics. Within North America, retail POS performance was again strong in the quarter, wrapping up a record year which saw a positive POS in 50 of 52 weeks. Growth across every SBU and as impressively across all major brands, Black & Decker, DeWalt, Stanley and Bostitch.
Importantly, retail inventories remain at healthy and appropriate levels consistent with prior year. And in addition, the team continues to drive out-performance in Mac tools, which closed the quarter with growth in high single digits, delivering its 6 consecutive year and 24th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. And finally, we continue to enjoy robust growth in e-commerce, this time, highlighted by success with our rebranded and very innovative Black & Decker consumer products.
Europe continues to perform at multiples above the underlying market, posting 6% organic growth in the quarter for a full year total of 7%. This region has shown remarkably consistent share gains in a relatively flat market, delivering approximately 7% organic growth across much of the past 3 years. Importantly, the growth in Europe continues to be widespread across nearly all regions as consistent share gains validate the success of our innovation and commercial excellence initiatives.
The emerging market team once again overcame significant market headwinds, generating 1% organic growth in the quarter with contributions from Argentina, Mexico and Turkey more than offsetting continued pressures in Russia, China, Brazil and other parts of South America. And meanwhile, the timely global release of the Stanley Power Tools line for emerging markets continues to get traction in the large and growing mid-price point segment, helping to offset regional economic and geopolitical market turbulence. 
The fourth quarter caps off an exceptional year by our Tools & Storage team; 8% organic growth for the year against a 6% 2014 comp, with an operating margin rate up 110 basis points, executing on all fronts, taking share, improving profitability in the face of a volatile backdrop, and at the same time, the team very methodically and successfully positioned the business for more growth ahead. In that regard, we see continued robust growth for tools in 2016. Our innovation pipeline is stronger than anytime since the merger, and our supply chain and commercial teams are operating at very high fitness levels with SFS 2.0 firmly embedded in our operating culture. These are exciting times for Tools & Storage, and we expect the performance level to continue to be very high as we go forward.
Turning to Security. Progress continued across our Security business with Europe advancing on all fronts, and North America showing steady progress in its transformation efforts. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically, the fifth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Commercial lens were widespread across most countries as we recognize benefits from investments in our regional sales organizations. Profitability continued to improve sequentially and versus prior year, with a fourth quarter operating margin rate approaching 10%.  Solid order intake and a healthy backlog, both up double digits year-over-year, combined with stable attrition rates within our targeted range, leave us well positioned to continue forward momentum into 2016.
While organic revenues were down within North America due principally to a large installation in last year's fourth quarter, the team posted sequential margin expansion due to improved field productivity within the commercial Electronic Security business as the benefits from the Stanley standard operational improvement initiative began to take hold. Strong orders, a healthy backlog and a growing RMR portfolio position this business well as we head into 2016.
Emerging markets were again a modest drag on Security growth and profitability as weak market conditions in China continued. But overall, for the segment, profitability was up 100 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially, a solid indicator that our transformation efforts are taking hold within the organization.
Turning to Industrial. Industrial saw a 1% organic decline in the quarter as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening's, electronics and industrial businesses more than offset strong global automotive revenue and organic growth in our Oil & Gas business. Operating profit was up 5%, with a 210-basis-point improvement in the margin rate, as productivity gains and cost controls were able to counteract lower volume.
Engineered Fastening's 3% organic decline was attributable to weakening within the industrial channel and lower sales volume in the electronics space as our largest consumer electronics customer unexpectedly reduced production levels on their recently launched smartphone. This more than offset another quarter in which our automotive revenues outpaced light vehicle production. The business was able to anticipate some of the industrial market softness and thus benefited from proactive cost actions taken within the quarter. Infrastructure delivered positive organic growth of 2%, as Oil & Gas grew 17% organically, propelled by increased project activity in the North America onshore market, more than offsetting declines in hydraulics, which continues to be impacted by depressed scrap steel prices.
All-in-all, an impressive operational performance was registered by the industrial teams, expanding profitability and margin rates in the face of a choppy and mostly inhospitable end-market environment, with the exception of auto production. 
In summary, for the total company, the fourth quarter represented a solid performance wrapping up a tremendous year which included organic growth of 6%, record operating margins and record EPS.  This performance highlights our team's agility, passion to perform and ability to be proactive and responsive to market condition, balancing investments for growth and taking out costs when necessary, strengths that will serve us well as we head into 2016. 
As we consider the 2016 outlook which, Don, will share with you in a few minutes, our ability to generate outsized organic growth albeit at a slower pace than in the preceding 2 years, will be enabled by the investments we have made and are making in SFS 2.0, which is our transformational business operating system. 
In early 2015, we launched the next generation of SFS, creating a more powerful mechanism to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion with high asset efficiency. The expanded SFS 2.0 is transforming the company by focusing our activities in 5 key areas: Digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, commercial excellence, functional transformation and core SFS. I would encourage serious long-term investors to develop a deep understanding of SFS 2.0, in that this is not an Investor Relations marketing jargon but rather a carefully constructed and executed framework that enables our organization to extract maximum value out of our world-class franchises. We do this through capital efficient organic growth and continuous margin expansion. You have already seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in the organic growth and margin expansion in Tools & Storage and other parts of the company. In 2016, you will see a growing impact from breakthrough innovation, digital as well as the other elements of the initiative, which is now in its second year and gaining momentum.
I would also say that we are once again, open for business when it comes to inorganic growth. We look forward to supplementing our organic growth with a disciplined approach to M&A that we have deployed during almost 100 acquisitions over the past 15 years, a period of time when we more than quadrupled our revenues and market cap and outperformed the S&P 500's total shareholder return by 5x. 
With that, I'll turn it over to, Don Allan."
304977,321463517,922657,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full ye",1756,"Thank you, Jim. Let's begin with our fourth quarter and full year free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $697 million, up almost $50 million from the prior year, resulting in $871 million of free cash flow for the full year. This full year result is approximately $50 million to $75 million lower than we anticipated going into the quarter and is the result of lower than expected fourth quarter volumes in Tools & Storage and Engineered Fastening, which in turn, resulted in lower working capital liquidation.
Nonetheless, working capital turns finished the year at 9.2x, flat to the prior year, but at a level that many industrials would envy. Overall, our cash flow performance remained strong, a 96% conversion rate for the full year in our leverage metrics are in line with our year-end expectations.
One additional comment on free cash flow as it relates to the other line. As you can see, we experienced approximately $120 million variants versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. This variants was planned and is due primarily to discontinued operation activity in the fourth quarter of 2014, combined with the timing of certain derivative settlements and tax payments. 
So let's turn to Page 11. I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. Certainly, it won't be news to anyone that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against the vast majority of currencies around the world. This strong dollar has resulted in approximately a 50% increase against the Brazilian real since the beginning of 2015. Also, the British pound and the Australian dollar are at levels we have not seen since the 2008 credit crisis, and the Canadian dollar has not been this weak versus U.S. Dollar for well over 1 decade. And last but certainly not least, the Argentinian peso, which essentially been on a constant decline since the government's default back in 2001, accelerated its traction with a 30% cliff devaluation in December, resulting in other meaningful headwind for us in 2016. 
The effect of all these moves is that we are facing another significant foreign exchange headwind in 2016, which at current spot rates, results in a year-over-year impact to operating margin between $170 million and $190 million. This impact is a combination of transactional and translational. However, approximately 2/3 of the 2016 headwind will be transactional, pressuring our margins, while approximately 1/3 will be translational. The transactional amount is substantially higher than prior year, as we feel the impact of the 2015 derivative hedges expiring in 2016, and this is approximately $60 million of our total currency headwind.  This 2016 currency impact is on top of over $300 million in currency headwinds we faced over the past 2 years where our team's focused on significant operational actions which more than offset these pressures in 2014 and 2015. 
However, given the magnitude of these continued headwinds, we will not be able to completely offset currency in 2016 with pricing cost action. That being said, we will offset approximately 50% of this $170 million to $190 million headwind within 2016. And as we have previously discussed, over the long term, we will continue to identify opportunities to localize production to help mitigate currency as well as improve the efficiency of our global supply chain.
So let's transition to our 2016 outlook on the next page. As John mentioned, we are guiding to an EPS range of $6 to $6.20 or a midpoint EPS growth of approximately 3%. 
Let's walk through some of the key drivers in our guidance. First, we expect organic growth to approximate 3%, which will contribute $0.45 to $0.50 EPS for the year. As Jim discussed, SFS 2.0 will help fuel this growth in 2016 and beyond. We expect our Tools & Storage business to continue to make -- to take market share in most regions. Our innovation pipeline is robust, and we believe this business can leverage that to grow in the low to mid-single-digits in the face of challenging global macroeconomic environment.
We expect progress to continue within the Security platform, resulting in low single-digit growth. And we also expect industrial to have low single-digit growth as the Engineered Fastening automotive business will continue to demonstrate strong growth while the remainder of the segment faces pressures across several end markets, including Oil & Gas, scrap steel, general industrial and electronics. 
One additional point related to organic growth before I move on to the next topic. It's worth noting that when normalizing for a 53-week activity which was included in the 2014 fourth quarter, which is a fiscal calendar phenomenon that occurs every 7 years, if you adjust for that, the total company's organic growth would've actually been 1.5 to 2 points higher or approximately 3% in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is notable when you consider the fact that 1% organic growth in us guiding to 3% organic growth in 2016. We believe this, along with the strength of certain markets we operate in, namely U.S. construction, along with global automotive production, combined with our focus in SFS 2.0, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve 3% organic growth outlook for 2016.
Continuing to the next EPS driver. We will see another $0.45 to $0.50 of earnings improvement from additional cost and productivity initiatives. We have a solid amount of carryover commodity deflation materializing in 2016, and the business teams have worked hard to identify additional cost-reduction opportunities, which on top of our normal productivity gains, will result in a solid contribution to the bottom line. Also, we see an additional increase to EPS of approximately $0.13 from a lower share base due to the carryover benefit of our 2015 share actions as well as opportunistic buybacks, particularly if we continue to see depressed share prices. Working against all of these strong operational actions will be the previously mentioned foreign exchange headwind, which results in approximately $0.85 to $0.95 of EPS pressure year-over-year.
Because of the severity of this transactional currency headwind, and its impact on margins, we expect the company-wide operating margin for 2016 to be relatively flat year-over-year. To put this in perspective, we estimate that the FX headwinds, net of benefits we are receiving from lower commodity costs as well as pricing activities, will cause us to lose 60 to 75 basis points of margin rate improvement in 2016. Our 3-year financial vision presented at the May 2015 investor meeting contemplated a 50 to 75 basis points of margin improvement each year, which assumed a stable foreign exchange environment. So we believe we're continuing to perform in line with that objective, albeit with our improvements offsetting FX rather than resulting in OM rate expansion as we like to see.
A few other items mentioned related to guidance are: We expect our restructuring charges and tax rate to be relatively flat to the prior year. And then finally, as we look to the first quarter, we expect our first quarter EPS percentage of the  full year EPS to be approximately 18.5%, which is very close to the prior 2 year's average. 
Moving to the segment outlook on the right side of the page. I've already touched on most of the drivers behind our organic growth, so I'll spend a minute on margin rate expectations. We expect Tools & Storage margin to be relatively flat year-over-year, and is primarily the result of the FX dynamic I described earlier, netting against the really impressive operating leverage this business continues to achieve.
We expect Security margins to continue to improve modestly versus prior year, reflecting benefits from further progress in field productivity, commercial investments, and the realignment of the cost structure of the business to help drive profitable future growth, another good step forward is anticipated. Industrial margins are expected to be relatively flat, as productivity gains and cost take-out's, particularly, within the Engineered Fastening business, are expected to offset top line pressure, as previously discussed related to key portions of this segment.
Before moving on to the summary of this morning's call, I would like to discuss the potential for a recessionary environment and make a few comments on what actions we would take if, and I emphasize if, if we are faced with deteriorating economic conditions. At this stage, we believe a U.S. recession is low probability in 2016. However, we have established contingency plans to ensure we are adequately prepared. If we were faced with this type of an environment, consistent with our behavior in past similar circumstances, we would execute mitigation plans and they would take the form of headcount reductions, investment delays and further discretionary spending reductions. Specifically, if the environment resulted in us experiencing a flat organic revenue performance versus our current view of 3% growth, we would take cost actions to hold EPS relatively close to our guidance range. Clearly, if a more severe environment were to occur, which appears unlikely at this stage, we would focus on protecting our earnings base as much as possible, similar to the approach we took in 2009.
Now moving on to the summary page. We are very pleased with the businesses performance in 2015. We witnessed strong operational execution overcome a host of external challenges, including $220 million of foreign exchange headwind which delivered ultimately, organic growth of 6% at the top end of our targeted range, a record operating margin rate of 14.2% which was up 90 basis points versus the prior year; and of course, double-digit EPS growth.
We are also encouraged with the progress in our Security business, particularly Security Europe which really made meaningful improvement on all fronts. As we look to 2016, we are focused on positioning the company to manage through another year of turbulent markets and severe foreign exchange headwinds. As such, we remain committed to our core objectives: Maintaining our focus on organic growth through both continued innovation and commercial excellence; ensuring progress within Security segment -- the Security segment to maintain the momentum we saw in 2015, of course, executing on additional cost and pricing actions to help partially offset our FX headwinds and also being prepared to take further actions as conditions warrant. As always, maintaining our perpetual focus on working capital manage -- management and improving that as we move forward, and importantly, leveraging the pillars of SFS 2.0 and to continue driving momentum in 2016 and beyond.
That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Now, I move to Q&A."

The innovation pipeline for Tools & Storage is as robust as it has been at any time since the merger. And what we've been focusing on, if you rewind to 2010 when we put the companies together, there was a lithium-ion problem, they were losing share. We inherited that. Fortunately, they had done a fair amount of corrective action that began to manifest itself in the -- shortly after the merger and we started regaining share. And then we, after that, a year or 2 of that, really came out strong with the DC brushless, a complete redesign of DC brushless products. And that became the fastest-growing segment of cordless. And we became the -- we were growing at about 2x, and still are growing at a very rapid rate vis-à-vis competition. And then at the same time, there was a lot of incremental -- call it incremental innovation going on in Hand Tools & Storage and revitalization of the Black & Decker brand and product lines, the consumer products and accessories as well. So there's been a lot of, I'll call it broad-based but relatively small-scale innovation in addition to the lithium-ion gains and then the DC brushless gains. So that's all really what's driven the NPI -- driven some of the growth here in addition to the commercial excellence that you referred to. Now what's coming is something more on the order of breakthrough innovation, which is the real SFS 2.0. And without getting into the details of exactly what it is, I think if you stay tuned during 2016, you will start to see some pretty interesting innovation that would be more in the category of breakthrough. And in addition to that, we will continue on with the incremental type innovation in the DC brushless and the continuing progress in lithium-ion. So it really is a step-function increase in innovation that is occurring in the tools business. And you'll start to see the manifestation of that, I think, in the second half of the year. As far as Europe, there's a number of things going on in Europe relative to the Black & Decker products, the consumer business, the brushless, which is a big deal over there, and a number of other things. But I'd say Europe is a combination, to the NPI plus just a tremendous thrust into commercial excellence, which as we've described it or as we describe it, involves a multipronged attack into the 7 pillars, if you will of customer-facing processes, which include gaining customer insights, driving innovation, driving brand awareness, being excellent at pricing and promotion, deploying the sales force properly, doing channel partner programs that are very aggressive and successful. And then finally, providing outstanding customer sales and post sales support. And it's a focus on all those various processes. When you put them all together, that's what's really driving the growth in Europe. And I'd say on top of that, you have what I'll call second-order revenue synergies from the Black & Decker merger that are even today manifesting themselves in further growth customer whitespace, distribution channel whitespace, those types of things, brand whitespace are all helping drive the European growth."

The good news is it represents about 20% of our total business, 25%, I guess, with industrial hand tools within Tools & Storage. But if I kind of address, I'll say, the elephant in the room, you're very polite or diplomatic about it, but I think I can answer your question quite helpfully. We strive to grow at 2x the rate of the market in our Tools & Storage business over the long term. And we've met or exceeded that objective over the past 2 years as, Jim, just described as the SFS 2.0 growth initiatives started to gain traction. And this being said, I don't think it's realistic to plan such outsized growth in each and every quarter from any global diversified industrial. So in the fourth quarter, organic growth was lower than we'd planned but the shortfall was in areas you would expect. And a lot of information from, Jim and Don. But to try to summarize it, we did have lower industrial channel volumes in Tools & Storage and Stanley Engineered Fastening, that was the full point of organic growth relative to our expectations. And that's globally across the company. Another full point was lower customer-specific volumes and it's been well in the public domain from a large consumer electronics customer for our Stanley Engineered Fastening business, again, within the Industrial segment. But that contributed almost a full point of slower organic growth than our expectations. Something that's not directly related to industrial channels, emerging market softness, if you will, contributed about 1 point. So relative to the 1% reported, that's about 300 more basis points. And then lastly, Don talked about the fiscal calendar phenomenon, which was another 100 to 200 basis points. So looking at all that way, it's -- I think it's fairly straight forward, without question, the biggest headwind being in industrial markets in general, and those markets in the U.S., in particular because they've been so strong. Conversely, as Jim just talked about, Tools & Storage in the U.S., up mid-single-digits; Europe, up 6% that's driven by construction and retail, even e-commerce, which was way up. Automotive is still strong, we grew 6% in the fourth quarter which is well above the rate of light vehicle production, and Security Europe -- our investments are paying off, it was up 3%. So I think your question is spot on. Our biggest headwind on organic growth, obviously, because that has nothing to do with FX, are the industrial markets. They represent 20% to 30% of our business. And if they're flat, we think that -- the markets are flat, we think that's probably as well as they're going to do. And I think you can do the math from there. So I hope that helps."

And then you have industrial markets such as automotive that are more driven by consumer demand, and those are relatively healthy. So within industrial, you have a dichotomy of markets that are flat out on their back. And then you have other healthy markets.

And really, the essence of my question is, if you believe it's more secular, what does the investment look like to further reposition the footprint of the company geographically to respond to that on a longer-term basis?"

You used the caveat, if you believe it's secular, I'm not sure we do. We could have a long debate about it. But even if we're going to do the same thing irrespective of cyclical or -- cyclical, Jim, Don and I have been doing this a longtime. We just want to talk about the euro, everybody worries about it being at parity. I've done business when it was at $0.85, and we've seen it approach $1.50. That's fairly cyclical. Irrespective, whether it's cyclical or secular, what we can do the most, I think, 2 things: We're not going to double down where the risks are high but we're also not going to walk away from our investments. We're going to stay positioned, particularly in emerging markets, and 50% of our revenues is outside the U.S. in those markets which will continue to grow albeit slower from a lower base, to be in a position to leverage our share and leverage our volume, when and if it turns around. But the biggest thing affecting us and I think, Don touched on it, we always talk about both translational and transactional. And as the transactional aspect grows to more than 50% of our foreign exchange headwind, what we're working very hard to do is move production and sourcing locally. We have a goal to produce 50% or more of what we do in countries where we sell it. And if you take that to the next step, obviously, everyone knows you can't build a plant overnight, nor would you want to, nor would you want to put bricks-and-mortar down if you believe it's secular. But what we can do is a much better job and we're working hard at it, qualifying local, both raw materials and more important critical component suppliers. And if you're working in emerging markets, as I think you're aware, many of our components that are critical to quality are either U.S -- based or U.S. produced or dollar-denominated. To the extent we can qualify local suppliers, protect our IP but produce those critical components locally, to be processed locally, that's going to be a tremendous offset or hedge. Don, may want to add something to that."

I think in that particular point, what John said is exactly the correct. However, the reality is that at this stage in certain parts of the world, Canada and Brazil, being the best examples, there's not a great deal of suppliers that are available that we can do that with. So that's something that we have to think about, is there an Asian company that we are currently working with -- that they can create a plant within Brazil and allow us to have a supplier locally. That is transacting locally? Those are all things that take time. These are not necessarily things that happen overnight. In the meantime, we're doing things as much as we can that make economic sense over the short term and the long term. But I think we do view this as very much a cyclical shift and if that view changes overtime, then obviously, our view of where we manufacture, will have to shift as well. Because if you look at the history of Stanley and, of course, the history of Black & Decker separately, they're both known for pursuing the lowest cost possible and also, maintaining the highest quality. And that's not going to change. So as dynamics shift in the markets around the world and cost shift with it, we have to be flexible and agile to make sure that we're doing the right thing from a supply chain perspective."

And I'll simply say, as multiples come down, I think and valuations come down, there is more out there that could be attractive to us both domestically and outside the U.S. I don't think there are so many bargains out there as we speak that we need to rush to buy something because it's never going to be at a lower price. Our view was always to buy good companies at a fair price.  We've had a hard time meeting or exceeding valuation expectations in the last 6 months but we've seen that -- we see it, I think, as you might expect, coming more in the line, which is that in effect, that we think we have our Security business on the right track, which is what Jim made the point in his piece of the presentation.

We also -- within that business, within Engineered Fastening, where we have a kind of general industrial sector that's about $0.5 billion in revenue on an annualized basis, that has been feeling pressure as well similar to the Industrial Tool business within Tools & Storage. And -- for example, in the fourth quarter, that business was down approximately 10%. And we expect that to continue, at least into the first half. So those 2 things are definitely putting pressure on the top line and the margin. Now offsetting that and going in the opposite direction is what, Jim and both John had mentioned about the automotive production business within Engineered Fastening, is offsetting that, we expect growth probably in the mid-single digits again within that business in 2016. And we also have cost actions and various other productivity actions we're taking across Engineered Fastening to make sure that the margins are flat and hopefully a little bit better than that as the year goes on. And then the 2 smaller pieces of industrial which is the Oil & Gas business and the hydraulic tool business, a combination of what we call infrastructure, we expect those to be relatively flat on the top line, maybe down slightly and then margin flat as well as those markets are pretty slow at this stage. But we think we've gone through the difficult comps as we go into 2016."

So those are positives. Some of the negatives, we will see a little bit of price pressure in different parts of the mature markets as we have dealt with some significant commodity deflation, that's been a benefit to us. We don't expect that to be significant, but those are very kind of surgical strategic decisions that our Tools & Storage team is very savvy at managing and working through as part of the overall offering to our customers."

I guess, I'll just add to that, I think it is important because the very end of your question was more than fair in terms of getting paid for the innovation. We have a history of -- if you will, protecting price are being paid by innovation just for that reason. Specifically, to bring the same product or a minor modest incremental improvement to a customer even in a flat commodity situation, and expect the price increases, unrealistic to say the least, real prices have been declining 2% to 3% a year or 1% to 2% a year for the last 10 years, real prices. So the way to protect price -- and I think it's probably more important understanding why Don has confidence that overall we'll see some modest price is to bring in some cases, meaningful -- incremental but meaningful, and in other cases, to Jim's point, breakthrough innovation to the customers -- if no one else has it, you can charge whatever, you can value price and charge what you believe is appropriate for it. So it's far easier to bring a product improvement at a 5% or 6% higher price point. That way, you cover your inflation, your labor inflation, or anything else that there happens to be there, the incremental cost of that improvement. And you and the customer both wins. Because the customer can take his retail price up, you can take your wholesale price up, and thereby, protecting margins and everybody wins. And it's a fair trade."

When it comes to our retail business in Tools & Storage, there's a lot of ebbs and flows in the quarter that are really dependent on when customers want product, refilling orders, after the holiday season. So from a general market trend, we didn't see anything dramatic within the consumer side of Tools & Storage. On the industrial side, it was pretty much a consistent trend throughout the quarter other than electronics. Obviously, electronics shifted to the negative dramatically in the month of November, and that held into December and its held -- it's holding into the first quarter. So we're not necessarily taking anything as far as market trends in the fourth quarter as a big indicator to the first quarter and beyond, beyond some of the things that we've already discussed such as electronics and general industrial. But I think the only thing that really shifted within the quarter would've been the electronics business with Engineered Fastening."

It's postholiday season. They have a very appropriate objective of reducing or minimizing inventories as the year closes. So simply said, whatever happens in January, we don't ever think of it as a good predictor or indicator of how the year is go to start. We need pretty much a full first quarter, particularly, on the retail side for that reason to get a flavor for where we are or where we're going. Importantly, as Jim pointed out, I think most important, POS was good in the fourth quarter, so inventories are in a good place. So nothing to suggest dire straits, but it's very early days."

As far as the North American Security business, I mean, I think we're finding that in the verticals, the Healthcare vertical is doing absolutely fabulously. It achieved mid-double-digit margins, mid-teens. And the issue with that now is how to grow it faster, so we'll be making some investments to grow it faster and it could be a substantial contributor to organic growth. The retail vertical, I think, is still kind of in the early days, in terms of trying to figure out exactly where the value proposition can be and how big we can make that, how profitable it can be. And so I'd say we're probably in about the third or fourth inning with the retail, but I would expect by mid to late '16, we would make a lot of progress on that front as well. I think the other verticals -- those are the 2 verticals that we're going to be emphasizing this year and really, get them right, get the Healthcare one growing, get the retail strategy fully engaged. And then at that point, we'll decide if we want to add another vertical to our main area of focus."

So, yes, I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, the free cash flow for 2015 came in a little bit lighter than we anticipated, and it was primarily due to less working capital liquidation as a result of the lower organic growth that we saw in the fourth quarter. And its interesting, the timing of how it played out is, usually what happens in our Tools & Storage business in particular is that we have high levels of revenue in October and November, preparing for the holiday season as well as doing kind of refill orders after Black Friday. And then we collect a lot of that by the end of December because we saw a different trend occur in that particular business and obviously a lower organic growth number, then our expectation, the result was that we didn't get the working capital turn that we're anticipating. We're anticipating turns of 9.5 to 9.7. They came in at 9.2 which are actually fantastic. And at this stage, working capital turn improvement becomes harder and harder. The other dynamic is as we grow organically and you saw the significant organic growth we had in 2015, you have to improve your working capital turns even more to get a cash flow benefit. So even with -- if we had achieved an improvement to 9.5 and 9.7, we still would had a slight negative within our cash flow statement for working capital, we would've had to get it much closer to 10 to see a positive. And that's just the reality of what we're going to deal with going forward, that we won't see large working capital benefit in the cash flow statement, and we want to continue to improve working capital and get it over 10 turns over the next few years. And hopefully, when we -- as we do that, the amount of impact to cash flow will be modest. But it likely will be modestly negative as a result, our cash flow on a go-forward basis will be -- will still be very strong. I would -- as I said for 2016, I expect the conversion rate to be about 100%, which would mean it's going to be similar between $900 million to $925 million for 2016. We always look to improve our working capital more than beyond our goals and expectations. So obviously, we'll be driving to try to outperform that, but right now based on where we are with our working capital turn, we can't expect large cash flow benefits from that area. And really, the cash flow is going to come from the earnings performance and operational performance."

Jim will give you a lot more detail on the strong Global Tools & Storage performance in just a second.
Industrial was down 3% as we anticipated, and Security was up 1% as the positive organic growth in Europe continues. It's a trend that we've been very focused on, and we're very pleased to see it carrying on the way it had.
Operating margin rate of 13.1% was 20 basis points below last year. The overwhelming majority of that was the impact of $35 million of currency pressure. Security industrial operating margin rates were up 110 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. And Tools & Storage was down slightly in the face of the currency headwinds. As most of you are aware, the overwhelming majority of our FX does -- impacts our Global Tools & Storage business.  That led to diluted earnings per share of up 20%, $1.28, up 20% versus prior year, solid operating performance, combined with lower share count and lower research and costs, which more than offset the currency impact. So on the back of the first quarter performance, out-performance, we are raising 2016 outlook for EPS to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which is up 5% to 8% versus 2015, and up from our $6 to $6.20 range that we most recently provided.  Concurrently, we're reiterating free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% in net income.
Let's turn briefly to the sources of the growth. During the first quarter. Volume was up 4%. Price was up 1%, leading to the 5% organic growth that I already touched on. Currency was at 3% offset, so a total revenue growth of 2%. This compares to 1% organic growth and a 5% currency-driven revenue decline in the fourth quarter '15. So very, very strong sequential quarterly trend.
Turning to the regions. You can see that all markets contributed. The U.S. was up 6%. Europe, up 3%; total emerging market grew -- was up 3%, which, of course, is led by Global Tools & Storage the very strong performance, and the rest of world was up 1%. So all in all, a really solid first quarter growth performance with strength across virtually every business and in virtually every region.  But let's let them get somebody tells on our 3 segments. There's a lot of good news this morning."

I'll begin with our Tools & Storage business which as John indicated, started the year off with another strong showing, once again, hitting on all cylinders, and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter, against a 1Q '15, over",1346,"Okay. Thank you, John. I'll begin with our Tools & Storage business which as John indicated, started the year off with another strong showing, once again, hitting on all cylinders, and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter, against a 1Q '15, over 10% growth. 
The tools then continue to outperform the market globally as commercial excellence initiatives, supply chain efficiency and a laser focus on innovation and new product development translated into market share gains across product lines and around the world.  This is being accomplished against the volatile and macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by large and unforgettable swings in foreign currencies, geopolitical unrest and anemic global GDP growth. 
Total tools revenue growth was 4%, after absorbing a 4% currency headwind. Currency also impacted operating margin more than offsetting volume leverage, price and modest commodity deflation, resulting in a 40-basis-point decline in the year-over-year operating margin rate. The consistency of organic growth across the regions and SBUs was particularly impressive with North America leading the way, up 10%, followed closely by very strong emerging markets at 9%, and Europe with a solid 5% growth performance.
Regarding the Global Tools & Storage SBUs, Power Tools posted 10% organic growth with its underlying product lines, professional, consumer and accessories, each individually generating 10% growth. The Hand Tools & Storage business delivered a solid performance as well, growing 5% organically with NPD and healthy end markets fueling 10% growth in construction handtools. 
Automotive Repair and industrial was a mixed bag, with continued robust performance in Mac Tools, a flattish more than offsetting anticipated but slightly better-than-expected negative pressure in North American industrial channels.
SKU placements success stories were widespread, with our new Porter Cable cordless nailer gaining listings and multiple outlets -- gains with our mechanics tools and MAC, high assess ratchets and continued momentum within the DeWalt DC brushless and nomadic products.
Within North America, the retail channel posted double-digit gains as strong POS performance was driven by supportive Construction & DIY markets, a  mile winner, especially compared to 2015, and pervasive new product introductions as well as continued share gains from DC brushless and the made in U.S.A. initiative.
The targeted conversion efforts and promotional wins led to high single-digit growth in the commercial channel, while a successful Mac Tools fair helps offset the aforementioned pressure in the industrial channels which remained down, albeit with a sequential improvement in the quarter.
Turning to Europe, which was up 5% organically. And the story continued with nearly all geographic markets again posting positive performances. Share gains, coupled with surgical pricing actions, delivered above-market growth as SFS 2.0 commercial excellence activities continued to take hold. The e-commerce channel was another highlight, as innovations in our Consumer Products Group and the implementation of a broader and a deeper go-to-market approach generated significant year-over-year gains. 
Last but not the least, the emerging market team put together an outstanding order under the circumstances, posting a 9% organic gain for this progress derived from a combination of innovation and new product launches, as part of our mid-price point for MTBE initiative, coupled with aggressive price recovery actions taken early in the year to combat currency declines where appropriate. 
Latin America served up a stellar performance in the quarter, achieving mid-teens growth on the back of expensive commercial excellence initiatives in Mexico, Peru and Argentina, which more than offset ongoing market headwinds in Brazil. High single-digit growth in Asia, combined with the Lat Am performance, more than offset the country-specific pressures in the Middle East and Africa. 
All in all, the Tools & Storage business started the year vigorously, and remains fixated on maintaining its strong growth momentum. The team is leveraging SFS 2.0 initiatives to continue driving article share gains and effecting a digital transformation across the enterprise. And at the same time, they're preparing for a major new power tool product rollout in the second half, as the breakthrough innovation pillar of SFS 2.0 will soon come to life and begin to contribute to our commercial success.  Stay tuned.
Now turning to Security, which continue to progress in multiple fronts in the first quarter. Security posted 1% organic growth made significant progress on profitability and improved year-over-year margins by 110 basis points. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically for the second quarter in a row, achieving its sixth quarter -- sixth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Higher installation revenues in multiple geographies highlighted by gains in France, the Nordics in Central Europe were a primary growth driver. 
Profitability continued to rise as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to year-over-year margin rate increases.  Solid order rates in the quarter and continued progress on the commercial front position us to maintain this momentum.
North American Security also make good strides. Operational improvements from field productivity gains under the Stanley standard field operations initiative drove a year-over-year profitability increase. While the organic revenue declined it, it wasn't a primarily to lower volumes in the automatic doors business, which has good visibility to rebounding sales in 2Q.
The CSS businesses top line was flat year-over-year and backlog remained in a healthy position going into 2Q. And overall, Security posted its highest operating profit rate since the first quarter of 2012, highlighting the growing success of our turnaround initiatives through improved operating performance. Although work remains to be done, which translates to opportunity, we continue to be pleased with Security's trends and development.
Moving on to industrial. Results for the segment were in line with expectations as well as lower violence in engineered fastening industrial and electronics businesses, combined with a tough comp in automotive system sales, lead to an overall 3% organic sales declined for the quarter. Infrastructure was flat as Oil & Gas gains stemming from increased onshore pipeline activity offset continued pressure within hydraulics. Overall Industrial segment profitability improved 120 basis points as productivity and cost controls, particularly within Engineered Fastening, more than offset lower volumes. In this regard, the Engineered Fastening business performed well, notwithstanding the anticipated top line pressures. 
Automotive fasteners sales growth remained healthy and outpaced light vehicle production. Productivity gains stemming from an intense focus on cost management and supply chain efficiency through core SFS, led to the highest first quarter gross margin rate in 5 years. The infrastructure business continued to deliver mixed results with Oil & Gas posting double-digit organic growth while providing good visibility to onshore pipeline projects coming on line over the balance of the year and into 2017. Hydraulics on the other hand, continued to suffer volume declines due to a persistently difficult steel scrap market. 
And in total, both our first quarter results for the company and our ability to guide 2016 upward was a demonstration of the company's underlying growth and earnings power. Robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, coupled with profitability improvements in Security and Industrial, leave us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised 2016 outlook.
And before turning it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that we are also continuing to embed SFS 2.0 into the organization to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion, along with high asset efficiency. We are focusing our activities in 5 key areas: Commercial excellence, digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, functional transformation and core SFS. We have clearly seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in our organic growth and margin expansion. And as I said on our January earnings call and during my earlier Tools & Storage comments, you will begin to see an exciting and growing impact from breakthrough innovation as the year progresses. You may also see some inorganic activity in the near future as we have capital to deploy, and are actively developing an acquisition pipeline with emphasis on bolt-ons and the tools and Industrial segment.
These are truly exciting times for our company with outsized capital efficient growth, solid inorganic growth opportunities ahead and an ever present focus on margin expansion, all contributing to the mix. And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan will provide financial update."
304977,330266406,960454,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Let's begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter, which was an outflow of $158 million and improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year improvement was",1311,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Let's begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter, which was an outflow of $158 million and improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year improvement was a stronger working capital performance specifically within inventory and Accounts Receivable. As our O working capital turns were up 4 turns [ph] before it finishing the quarter at 7 turns. Higher income of the current year quarter serve to offset the majority of increased capitalist managers as well as some negative cash outflows in the other line. The other line items which were primarily a reflection of timing of pension plan and miscellaneous accrual payment as compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality, where our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we are adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed markets. As John mentioned earlier, and as you can see here in the Takeaway, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at a conversion rate of approximately 100% of net income.
So let's turn to Page 10, as I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. By this point, all of you are very familiar with our currency trends chart, which over the last 2 years has consistently depicted worsening FX headwinds on the back of perpetually strengthening U.S. dollar. While for the first time in what seems like quite a while, we actually saw a tempering of the dollar momentum over the quarter, followed by an eventual retreat against some of our key foreign currencies, most notably, the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the euro. While on a full-year basis, we are still seeing significant currency headwinds weighing on our operating margin of approximately $140 million, this does represent a $40 million improvement from the midpoint of our initial 2016 guidance range, which was $170 million to $190 million as we establish that in late January time frame.
As a reminder, we assess our currency headwinds on an operating margin at the current spot rates. It's worth noting that the mix of this $140 million headwind is now comprised of approximately 75% transactional exposure which pressured our margin rate, and 25% translational exposure. This is the shift from the 2/3, 1/3 split we discussed in January, and is given by the $60 million of carryover currency exposures which relate to our 2015 hedging activities.
While we continue to execute on mitigating actions to offset the $140 million of headwind, it's important to note that we do anticipate some pressure on planned pricing actions, particularly in countries where currency have -- currencies rebounded significantly. This will materialize as a slight headwind to organic growth, specifically in the second half of 2016.
Finally, you will notice that on the lower right-hand side of the page, we have presented our sensitivities for several of our most significant foreign currency exposures. These will be useful guides for you going forward to determine how movements of the FX markets are impacting our 2016 operating margin.  So, for example, a 1% increase in the Canadian dollar results in a $2 million to $3 million improvement in the 2016 operating margin on an annual basis. 
Now let's turn to the next slide, which is an update on our 2016 outlook and guidance. We are raising our 2016 EPS outlook to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 from the prior range of $6 to $6.20. This revised range represents approximately 5% to 8% increase over 2015. We are also retreating our free cash flow as I previously mentioned.  The major changes behind the guidance increase are as follows: As you can see, we are now expecting organic growth of 3% to 4% versus the original estimate of approximately 3%. The primary drivers of the change are an increase in our Tools & Storage growth assumption, double-digit and the back of a solid first quarter performance, strong POS data, and signs of continued strength in resi and non-resi construction market.  However, this strength is partially offset by revisions to industrial's organic growth outlook, which we now see as relatively flat, versus an assumption of up slightly in our initial guidance.
This revision is due primarily to lower than anticipated volumes in Engineered Fastening electronics business. As volume expectations for the largest customer in that business continued to decline. 
Additionally, you expect the timing shift around certain Oil & Gas pipeline projects from the second half of 2016 as they move into the first half of 2017. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, there's also some pricing pressure relative to our initial estimates coming from certain foreign markets that have recently seen significant strengthening in their currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we expect all of these put in things around organic growth assumptions to result still the net increased to our EPS of approximately $0.05.
The next item which we discussed in length on the previous slide is the approximately $40 million improvement in the foreign exchange headwind, which we expect to translate to an increase of EPS of approximately $0.20 for the full year. 
And then finally, slightly higher than planned marketing costs related to the Tools & Storage but at launch in the gym alluded to and discussed briefly a few minutes ago are expected to result in approximately 5% -- $0.05 reduction to EPS. The majority of these costs will occur in the second half of 2016.  These 3 assumptions changes results in a net increase of $0.20. 
Turning to the segment outlook for Tools & Storage and Industrial segment's organic growth outlook. Change along the lines I just previously discussed, and Security's organic growth outlook remained low single-digit. In terms of profitability, Tools & Storage is the only change from our January guidance, moving to modestly positive year-over-year from relatively flat. And the driver of that is the reduction in the FF -- FX headwinds primarily. 
We continue to expect securities margin to be modestly positive year-over-year, as operational and field efficiency improvements continues to progress, and then the industrials margin to be relatively flat with productivity gains and cost take-outs being able to offset the top line precious we continue to see.
At that point I'd like to make is related to EPS guidance expectations for the first half of 2016. As you can see, we expect the first half of 2016 operating profits as a percentage of the full year to be slightly above the prior year period. However, lower planned restructuring as well as lower other net expenses and shares will result in the first half EPS being higher as a percentage of the full year than it was in the prior year, specifically, first half 2016 EPS as a percentage of the full year will approximate 48% versus 44% in 2015.
So let's move to the summary page. The first quarter was a strong start of the year with organic growth up 5%, and EPS up 20%. As a result of this strong performance, combined with the improved outlook in the Tools & Storage business and currency markets, we are raising 2016 guidance for the full year to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which represents a 5% to 8% increase in the earnings per share versus 2015.
As we continue to progress through 2016, our focus remains on the following: Driving organic growth across all businesses and sharing continuous improvement in our operational excellence initiatives; maintaining the momentum behind securities margin improvements; and as always, pushing our cells to manage our working capital in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
That concludes the presentation portion of our call. I'll now let's move to Q&A."

The breakthrough innovation initiative is something that we started, really started getting into into the early part of 2014. And the concept behind it is that we do a pretty good job in what we call core innovation. And we did this in both of the legacy Black & Decker and Legacy Stanley. And those are the kind of things that are driving the organic -- big driver behind the organic growth today and some of the new product introductions today I alluded to in the core innovation area. But those are more things like -- in the Hand Tools, business, for instance, we introduced a line of FatMax hammers and and knives and blades, an innovative line, and one of our larger retailers. And another large retailer we introduced -- DeWalt primers bars and pocketknives. And then in Professional Power Tools, contact -- generation tools for our DC brushless, some really interesting innovations in the DeWalt and pneumatics lines. Our Mac impact wrench -- but you get the idea here. This is sort of the day-to-day innovation that just goes on as a matter of course. But I would say the level of activity in this area and the freshness of the company's product lines has never been greater in our recollection. So that goes on. And that drives the kind of growth, the organic growth, along with the commercial excellence initiatives that you've been witnessing now here, along with the -- a little help from the U.S. DIY and construction markets and -- but you can see the growth over the world. So in Europe, which is relatively anemic in terms of its markets. We still are growing in average, of about 6% to 7% over 2, 2.5-year period. And so there's something going on there. And it's really a combination of the core innovation and the commercial excellence. So what is the breakthrough innovation? The breakthrough innovation is a concept where we actually took the people out of the mainstream of the core innovation and set them aside a smaller group of people, 10 or 15 people in that range. And we just said, come up with the next major breakthrough for innovation for Power Tools."" And we gave them a time frame, and we give them resources and support. And lo and behold, in a relatively short period of time, they came up with something very, very interesting. What is that? You'll have to wait and see what that is. But from a scale point of view, we say the breakthrough innovation, and this is sent not the only breakthrough innovation to the best company by the way, this is just the first one. We have 3 more in Oil & Gas, we have 1 in hydraulics, we have work -- 1 up in Engineered Fastening. But we tell them that whatever you come up with, it has to have a scale of at least $100 million of revenue to be interesting to us. And so I can't really get into how big this one could be because we've frankly, we don't know. But we know it's go to be at least, $100 million over time, and it could be far, far greater. So that's going to end of the background and what you have going on now is the commercialization of that. It will begin shortly and you will see it in stores in relatively short order."

And that was a huge performance. But the thing that we never really expected was the revenue synergies that we also beat what we expected to accomplish, but they just keep on coming. And it has to do with the fact that the cultures jibed so well and got so focused on, innovation, commercial excellence, all the kinds of things that I was just talking about, and really put all the BS from the typical integration politics, et cetera, behind them, and focused on the customer, focused on the markets. And then the scale that we achieved by putting these 2 companies together, and going to market with Power Tools and Hand Tools, and going to market with all these incredibly strong brands that we have, just gave us tremendous flexibility.

And really, the improvement that we saw was in all 3 regions of the world. So the big regions are North America and Europe, and emerging markets is relatively small. In both those to large regions, we saw really solid improvement year-over-year in the profitability, as we continued to execute on the initiatives that we've been really discussing almost for 2 years now of improving field productivity in the Electronic Security business, in particular, in both Europe and in North America. And then in Europe specifically, looking at our SG&A, our selling and general and an ministrative costs to making sure they're in line with the revenue of the business, as well as the percentage of revenue. We discussed at as a business that probably, should be somewhere below 30% of revenue for SG&A, and it's above 30% today. So we continue to take actions in those areas to improve the profitability of both businesses. And we're seeing the benefits of that over the last 2 or 3 quarters, in particular, as the profitability of the business year-over-year continues to improve. And at this point, based on our guidance for the year, we're expecting that trend to continue as we expect modest improvement in profitability of the segment for the full year."

Everyone knows that, but the fact that we've had a stable, capable, tested and proven team in Europe and in the U.S, supplemented by a couple of great new hires in the last 6 months or so, it's really, really helped out, first of all, stabilize that business and then ultimately, keep the -- keep both organic growth and margins moving in the direction we want it to."

Part of it is due to the fact that we did have a very strong March, month of March. And so our inventory levels were brought down in line with that performance which was great to see. And we also, were very focused on making sure that we collected the cash throughout the quarter, so our account receivable was down at the right level as well. So with our company, we're going to have a cash outflow, as I mentioned, in the first quarter every year because of the way the Tools & Storage business seasonality impacts the company. But you have to -- you really have to try to minimize that to achieve your objective for the full year, and I think we've done this. This is the best performance we've had in Q1 in 4 years related to Stanley Black & Decker. And so as a result, I feel very good about our ability to achieve 100% conversion rate because we started the year and that regard. Now your question to potentially additional inventory related to the product launch, yes, we will have some additional inventory. However, based on the current sales plans as the year progresses, we would expect those inventory levels vast majority of them to be observed and shipped out to many of our major customers and so we don't expect that to be a challenge for us as the year end. But it could be a little bit of an additional and brutal as we go through the second and the third quarter, which would normally see in the ways in our Tools & Storage business. So at this stage, we feel good about our ability to hit a wedge active a 100% and we'll continue to look at fat to see how we could potentially outperform that as the year goes on."

We have it tested and proven at the original actually came from the DeWalt professional -- industrial channel very, very good person to lead, guide the business and focus on growth as opposed to just margins and things of that nature. So we feel good about it in that perspective. And last but absolutely not the least, recall we just really completed and embedded the change to a third party or independent distribution model versus the direct model. And Jim has talked about this often in past calls. Years ago, we thought that was a distinct competitive advantage, and it was for a time. We made the decision and I think it was the right one that -- what we gained it -- we lost more than we gained as a result of that. It was a 2-year process to, if you will, simply convert our distribution model. That's behind us. It's beginnign to gain traction. So right leader in place, growth focused executive and in the right distribution model in place, product catching up. It gives us cautious optimism that we'll get that growth back in mechanical because it's a great opportunity for us."

Is there are potential for the $140 million to move back towards $180 million? There is a scenario I could play out if the Fed starts talking about potential interest rate increases that would actually result in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the weakening of some of these currencies. However, we also feel like we've built contingency plans to address that scenario if that plays out. So we have certain actions that we would take up to $180 million that we believe would be capable of offsetting that, which is why we felt comfortable making this increase to our guidance."

So if you kind of Wrigley to growth that's not necessarily repeat itself for the next 3 quarters, then you're down to something that's closer to 6% to 6.5%, roughly, and then we had a fantastic performance in emerging markets in the first quarter, up 9%.

Well, I talked about the 5 elements of the SFS.

Well, I talked about the 5 elements of the SFS. And we'll start with the core SFS, which is the -- basically, the continuation of the SFS that we started in 2006, that got us to 9.2 working capital turns last year, and got us customer-facing metrics that we're very, very strong in relation to competition, and make most of our customers very happy. So that core SFS is at the heart of all this and then that's much more of an operations related initiative. And it continues to become deeply rooted 10 years into its existence. And now what we're doing with the core SFS as we are taking it to another level and largely through digitizing the supply chain and -- as well as implementing the Smart factory across the company. That's kind of in the early stages. But nonetheless, it is on the way. And that -- so if we were at 9 turns at the end of the year -- and we typically generate about 4%, 3% to 4% productivity while pause productivity in a year in our factories. And we would expect that to continue on the basis of these investments that we're making in some of the things that I'm talking about, as well as gradually push that working capital turns number up towards 10 and maybe, even someday, maybe even north of 10. So that's the core SFS. Then there are 3 elements that are far more growth oriented and those are the digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation. Talk about breakthrough information I think at length, and I think that's pretty clear. The commercial excellence is really taking some of the continuous improvement concepts that are very familiar to people in business and applying them to the customer-facing processes that drive growth. And so becoming world-class in some of these elements, like sales force effectiveness, like promotion planning, like pricing, pricing excellence and so on. And there's a number of these areas that when we apply continuous improvement principles to them in multiple facets, they just have a ability to generate tactical share gains and also margin expansion. So that's the commercial excellence. And then the digital excellence is one -- we will also see some really interesting things in the marketplace this year in the second half. There probably won't be dramatic revenue drivers but we'll clearly be ways to kind of enhance the marketing prowess and depths of penetration in our company and also, just contemporary our value propositions so that we are, again, leading the marketplace with the technology on the digital front, and as well as taking digital in permitting it into the organization for purposes of efficiency and effectiveness. So that's kind of the -- those are the various elements. The one I didn't mention assumption of transformation, and that's a very extensive initiative led by our finance and IT leaders who are actually taking a clean sheet of paper after having done 100 -- almost 100 acquisitions in 12 years, taking a clean sheet of paper and redesigning our processes in finance, 80, HR, legal, et cetera, to make sure that they are as efficient as possible. We already believe that they're quite effective, but we also believe there's a couple of points of G&A that can come out due to increased efficiency when you start with a clean sheet of paper. That's a long-term initiative we're not want to see a lot of overnight successes there. But it's 1 where we're making some investments and then over the course of the couple of years, we are really go to start to see that as G&A percent come down as a percentage sales, and we're going to take some of the money that comes up of that and reinvest some of the growth initiatives."

But it doesn't mean we stopped looking at assessing and in many cases, keeping targets warm. So there's plenty out there in our previously identified areas of strategic focus. In terms of expectations, not a lot has changed. Remember, much of these -- many of these are not public companies, number 1. But there are always multiple expectations. But in terms of what's out there and what's out there and competition for target, double edged sword, not too much has changed interest rates are usually very, very low, which would help financial sponsors, as they seek to acquire, offset by the fact but that most financial sponsors and most of the targets the we're looking at have limited, if any, synergies. So our opportunity to acquire in spaces where we have a great footprint already to -- arguably, the synergies that we could generate, would more than offset, I'll say, lack of leverage given our desire, insistence on maintaining strong tier investment grade credit rating."

And we did do that in the first quarter, and a significant portion of that organic growth we saw related to price, which is also why we're not necessarily thinking this is a business that's going to grow 9% for the full year, because we are going to see some pricing pressure that I touched on in some of those key markets because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus some of those key currencies. That just occurred over the last 6 to 8 weeks. So because of that, our view is a, I think prudent and it's more reflective of different pricing market because of the currency shift. And then you asked about profitability. margins, yes, in emerging markets for tools.

It is now -- it's doing well. But think of our 3 power brands, Stanley, DeWalt, Black & Decker, their specific and user groups and to each and every one, they're all doing encouragingly well.

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. And for those of you who've had a chance to look at our earnings release, it should point out that we remain strongly focused on generating above-market organic growth, meaningful operating leverage and strong free cash flow conversion.
We've really got a lot of really good news to report on the quarter as well as some real excitement looking forward. So I'm going to be very quick through some of the highlights before turning it over to Jim and Don for more granularity, and then, of course, we'll get on to the Q&A.
Organically, we grew 5%, total growth of 2%, the difference being currency. Really robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, 8%, with significant outperformance in the emerging markets, which was nice to see that come back, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more detail on the strong Global Tools & Storage performance in just a second.
Industrial was down 3%, as we anticipated, and Security was up 1% as the positive organic growth in Europe continues. It's a trend that we've been very focused on, and we're very pleased to see it carrying on the way it has.
Operating margin rate of 13.1% was 20 basis points below last year. The overwhelming majority of that was the impact of $35 million of currency pressure.  Security and Industrial operating margin rates were up 110 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. And Tools & Storage was down slightly in the face of the currency headwinds. As most of you are aware, the overwhelming majority of our FX does -- impacts our Global Tools & Storage business. 
That led to diluted earnings per share of up 20%, $1.28, up 20% versus prior year. Solid operating performance, combined with lower share count and lower restructuring costs, which more than offset the currency impact.
So on the back of the first quarter performance -- outperformance, we are raising 2016 outlook for EPS to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which is up 5% to 8% versus 2015 and up from our $6 to $6.20 range that we most recently provided. Concurrently, we're reiterating free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% in net income.
Let's turn briefly to the sources of the growth during the first quarter. Volume was up 4%. Price was up 1%, leading to the 5% organic growth that I already touched on. Currency was at 3% offset, so a total revenue growth of 2%. This compares to 1% organic growth and a 5% currency-driven revenue decline in the fourth quarter '15. So very, very strong sequential quarterly trend.
Turning to the regions. You can see that all markets contributed. The U.S. was up 6%; Europe, up 3%; total emerging market grew -- was up 3%, which, of course, is led by Global Tools & Storage, the very strong performance, and the rest of world was up 1%. 
So all in all, a really solid first quarter growth performance with strength across virtually every business and in virtually every region.
But let's let Jim get into some of the details on our 3 segments. There's a lot of really good news this morning."
304977,330266406,960771,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, John. I'll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which, as John indicated, started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting on all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q '15 comp o",1338,"Okay. Thank you, John. I'll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which, as John indicated, started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting on all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q '15 comp of 10% growth.
The Tools team continued to outperform the market globally as commercial excellence initiatives, supply chain efficiency and a laser focus on innovation and new product development translated into market share gains across product lines and around the world. This is being accomplished against the volatile macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by large and unpredictable swings in foreign currencies, geopolitical unrest and anemic global GDP growth.
Total Tools revenue growth was 4% after absorbing a 4% currency headwind. Currency also impacted operating margin, more than offsetting volume leverage, price and modest commodity deflation, resulting in a 40 basis point decline in the year-over-year operating margin rate. The consistency of organic growth across the regions and SBUs was particularly impressive, with North America leading the way, up 10%, followed closely by very strong emerging markets at 9% and Europe with a solid 5% growth performance.
Regarding the Global Tools & Storage SBUs, Power Tools posted 10% organic growth with its underlying product lines, professional, consumer and accessories, each individually generating 10% growth. The Hand Tools & Storage business delivered a solid performance as well, growing 5% organically, with NPD and healthy end markets fueling 10% growth in construction hand tools.
Automotive Repair and Industrial was a mixed bag, with continued robust performance in Mac Tools, a flattish Facom, more than offsetting anticipated but slightly better-than-expected negative pressure in North American industrial channels.
SKU placement success stories were widespread, with our new Porter Cable cordless nailer gaining listings in multiple outlets; gains with our mechanics tools and Mac, high-access ratchets; and continued momentum within the DeWalt DC brushless and nomadic products.
Within North America, the retail channel posted double-digit gains as strong POS performance was driven by supportive construction and DIY markets, a  mile winner, especially compared to 2015, and pervasive new product introductions as well as continued share gains from DC brushless and the made in U.S.A. initiative.
The targeted conversion efforts and promotional wins led to high single-digit growth in the commercial channel, while a successful Mac Tools fair helps offset aforementioned pressure in the industrial channels, which remained down albeit with sequential improvement in the quarter.
Turning to Europe, which was up 5% organically. The story continued with nearly all geographic markets, again, posting positive performances. Share gains, coupled with surgical pricing actions, delivered above-market growth as SFS 2.0 commercial excellence activities continued to take hold. The e-commerce channel was another highlight as innovations in our Consumer Products Group and the implementation of a broader and deeper go-to-market approach generated significant year-over-year gains.
Last but not least, the emerging market team put together an outstanding quarter under the circumstances, posting a 9% organic gain. This progress derived from a combination of innovation and new product launches as part of our mid-price point, or MPP, initiative, coupled with aggressive price recovery actions taken early in the year to combat currency declines where appropriate.
Latin America served up a stellar performance in the quarter, achieving mid-teens growth on the back of extensive commercial excellence initiatives in Mexico, Peru and Argentina, which more than offset ongoing market headwinds in Brazil. High single-digit growth in Asia, combined with the Lat Am performance, more than offset country-specific pressures in the Middle East and Africa.
All in all, the Tools & Storage business started the year vigorously and remains fixated on maintaining its strong growth momentum. The team is leveraging SFS 2.0 initiatives to continue driving tactical share gains and effecting a digital transformation across the enterprise. And at the same time, they're preparing for a major new power tool product rollout in the second half as the breakthrough innovation pillar of SFS 2.0 will soon come to life and begin to contribute to our commercial success. Stay tuned.
Now turning to Security, which continued to progress in multiple fronts in the first quarter. Security posted 1% organic growth, made significant progress on profitability and improved year-over-year margins by 110 basis points. Within Europe, the business was up 3% organically for the second quarter in a row, achieving its sixth quarter -- sixth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Higher installation revenues in multiple geographies, highlighted by gains in France, the Nordics and Central Europe, were the primary growth drivers.
Profitability continued to rise as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to year-over-year margin rate increases. Solid order rates in the quarter and continued progress on the commercial front position us to maintain this momentum.
North American Security also made good strides. Operational improvements from field productivity gains under the Stanley standard field operations initiative drove a year-over-year profitability increase. While organic revenue declined, it was attributable primarily to lower volumes in the automatic doors business, which has good visibility to rebounding sales in 2Q.
The CSS business' top line was flat year-over-year, and backlog remained in a healthy position going into 2Q.
And overall, Security posted its highest operating profit rate since the first quarter of 2012, highlighting the growing success of our turnaround initiatives through improved operating performance. Although work remains to be done, which translates to opportunity, we continue to be pleased with Security's trends and development.
Moving on to Industrial. Results for the segment were in line with expectations as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening, Industrial and Electronics businesses, combined with a tough comp in automotive system sales, led to an overall 3% organic sales decline for the quarter. Infrastructure was flat as Oil & Gas gains stemming from increased onshore pipeline activity offset continued pressure within hydraulics.
Overall Industrial segment profitability improved 120 basis points as productivity and cost controls, particularly within Engineered Fastening, more than offset lower volumes. In this regard, the Engineered Fastening business performed well, notwithstanding the anticipated top line pressures.
Automotive fasteners sales growth remained healthy and outpaced light vehicle production. Productivity gains stemming from an intense focus on cost management and supply chain efficiency through core SFS led to the highest first quarter gross margin rate in 5 years.
The Infrastructure business continued to deliver mixed results, with Oil & Gas posting double-digit organic growth while providing good visibility to onshore pipeline projects coming on line over the balance of the year and into 2017. Hydraulics, on the other hand, continued to suffer volume declines due to a persistently difficult steel scrap market.
And in total, both our first quarter results for the company and our ability to guide 2016 upward was a demonstration of the company's underlying growth and earnings power. Robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, coupled with profitability improvements in Security and Industrial, leave us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised 2016 outlook.
And before turning it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that we are also continuing to embed SFS 2.0 into the organization to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion, along with high asset efficiency. We are focusing our activities in 5 key areas: commercial excellence, digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, functional transformation and core SFS. 
We have clearly seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in our organic growth and margin expansion. And as I said on our January earnings call and during my earlier Tools & Storage comments, you will begin to see an exciting and growing impact from breakthrough innovation as the year progresses. You may also see some inorganic activity in the near future as we have capital to deploy and are actively developing an acquisition pipeline with emphasis on bolt-ons in the Tools and Industrial segments.
These are truly exciting times for our company with outsized capital efficient growth, solid inorganic growth opportunities ahead and an ever present focus on margin expansion, all contributing to the mix.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide financial update."
304977,330266406,960771,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Let's begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter, which was an outflow of $158 million and improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year improvement was",1306,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Let's begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter, which was an outflow of $158 million and improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year improvement was a stronger working capital performance, specifically within inventory and accounts receivable, as our working capital turns were up 4 turns, finishing the quarter at 7 turns. Higher income in the current-year quarter served to offset the majority of increased capital expenditures as well as some negative cash outflows in the Other line, the Other line items which were primarily a reflection of timing of pension plan and miscellaneous accrual payments as compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality, where our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we are adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed markets. As John mentioned earlier, and as you can see here in the takeaway, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at a conversion rate of approximately 100% of net income.
So let's turn to Page 10 as I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwind. By this point, all of you are likely very familiar with our currency trends chart, which, over the last 2 years, has consistently depicted worsening FX headwinds on the back of perpetually strengthening U.S. dollar, while for the first time in what seems like quite a while, we actually saw a tempering of the dollar momentum over the quarter, followed by an eventual retreat against some of our key foreign currencies, most notably the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the euro. While on a full year basis we are still seeing significant currency headwinds weighing on our operating margin of approximately $140 million, this does represent a $40 million improvement from the midpoint of our initial 2016 guidance range, which was $170 million to $190 million, as we established that in late January time frame. As a reminder, we assess our currency headwinds on operating margin at the current spot rate.
It's worth noting that the mix of this $140 million headwind is now comprised of approximately 75% transactional exposure, which pressures our margin rate, and 25% translational exposure. This is the shift from the 2/3, 1/3 split we discussed in January and is driven by the $60 million of carryover currency exposures, which relate to our 2015 hedging activities.
While we continue to execute on mitigating actions to offset $140 million of headwind, it's important to note that we do anticipate some pressure on planned pricing actions, particularly in countries where currency have -- currencies have rebounded significantly. This will materialize as a slight headwind to organic growth, specifically in the second half of 2016.
Finally, you will notice that on the lower right-hand side of the page, we have presented our sensitivities for several of our most significant foreign currency exposures. These will be useful guides for you going forward to determine how movements in the FX markets are impacting our 2016 operating margin. So for example, a 1% increase in the Canadian dollar results in a $2 million to $3 million improvement in the 2016 operating margin on an annual basis.
Now let's turn to the next slide, which is an update on our 2016 outlook and guidance. We are raising our 2016 EPS outlook to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 from the prior range of $6 to $6.20. This revised range represents an approximately 5% to 8% increase over 2015. We are also reiterating our free cash flow, as I previously mentioned.
The major changes behind the guidance increase are as follows: As you can see, we are now expecting organic growth of 3% to 4% versus the original estimate of approximately 3%. The primary drivers of the change are an increase in our Tools & Storage growth assumption to mid-single digits on the back of a solid first quarter performance, strong POS data and signs of continued strength in resi and non-resi construction market. However, this strength is partially offset by revisions to Industrial's organic growth outlook, which we now see as relatively flat versus an assumption of up slightly in our initial guidance. This revision is due primarily to lower-than-anticipated volumes in Engineered Fastening Electronics business as volume expectations for the largest customer in that business continue to decline. Additionally, you expect the timing shift around certain Oil & Gas pipeline projects from the second half of 2016 as they move into the first half of 2017.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, there's also some pricing pressure relative to our initial estimates coming from certain foreign markets that have recently seen significant strengthening in their currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we expect all of these puts and takes around our organic growth assumptions to result still in a net increase to our EPS of approximately $0.05.
The next item which we discussed in length on the previous slide is the approximately $40 million improvement in the foreign exchange headwinds, which we expect to translate to an increase of EPS of approximately $0.20 for the full year.
And then finally, slightly higher than planned marketing costs related to the Tools & Storage product launch that Jim alluded to and discussed briefly a few minutes ago are expected to result in approximately 5% -- $0.05 reduction to EPS. The majority of these costs will occur in the second half of 2016. These 3 assumptions changes result in a net increase of $0.20.
Turning to the segment outlook. The Tools & Storage and Industrial segment's organic growth outlook changed along the lines I just previously discussed. And Security's organic growth outlook remained low single digits.
In terms of profitability, Tools & Storage is the only change from our January guidance, moving to modestly positive year-over-year from relatively flat. And the driver of that is the reduction in the FX headwinds primarily.
We continue to expect Security's margin to be modestly positive year-over-year as operational and field efficiency improvements continue to progress; and then the Industrial's margin to be relatively flat, with productivity gains and cost take-outs being able to offset the top line pressures we continue to see.
The last point I'd like to make is related to our EPS guidance expectations for the first half of 2016. As you can see, we expect the first half 2016 operating profits as a percentage of the full year to be slightly above the prior year period. However, lower planned restructuring as well as lower other net expenses and shares will result in the first half EPS being higher as a percentage of the full year than it was in the prior year, specifically first half 2016 EPS as a percentage of the full year will approximate 48% versus 44% in 2015.
So let's move to the summary page. The first quarter was a strong start to the year, with organic growth up 5% and EPS up 20%. As a result of this strong performance, combined with the improved outlooks in the Tools & Storage business and currency markets, we are raising 2016 guidance for the full year to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which represents a 5% to 8% increase in the earnings per share versus 2015.
As we continue to progress through 2016, our focus remains on the following: driving organic growth across all businesses and sharing continuous improvement in our operational excellence initiatives; maintaining the momentum behind Security's margin improvements; and as always, pushing ourselves to manage our working capital in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
That concludes the presentation portion of our call, and now let's move to Q&A."

And those are the kind of things that are driving the organic -- big driver behind the organic growth today and some of the new product introductions that I alluded to in the core innovation area. But those are more things like, in the hand tools business, for instance, we introduced a line of FatMax hammers and pry bars and knives and blades, an innovative line and one of our larger retailers. And another large retailer we introduced, DeWalt pry bars and pocketknives. And then in Professional Power Tools, compact generation tools, DC brushless, some really interesting innovations in the DeWalt pneumatics lines, our Mac impact wrench -- but you get the idea here. This is sort of a day-to-day innovation that just goes on as a matter of course. But I would say the level of activity in this area and the freshness of the company's product lines has never been greater, in our recollection. So that goes on. And that drives the kind of growth, the organic growth, along with the commercial excellence initiatives that you've been witnessing now here, along with the -- a little help from the U.S. DIY and construction markets and -- but you can see the growth all over the world. So in Europe, which is relatively anemic in terms of its markets, we still are growing in average of about 6% to 7% over a 2-, 2.5-year period. And so there's something going on there. And it's really a combination of the core innovation and the commercial excellence. So what is the breakthrough innovation? The breakthrough innovation is a concept where we actually took people out of the mainstream of the core innovation and set them aside -- a smaller group of people, 10 or 15 people in that range. And we just said, ""Come up with the next major breakthrough innovation for power tools."" And we gave them a time frame, and we gave them resources and support. And lo and behold, in a relatively short period of time, they came up with something very, very interesting. What is that? You'll have to wait and see what that is. But from a scale point of view, we say the breakthrough innovation -- and this is not the only breakthrough innovation team in the company, by the way, this was just the first one. We have 3 more in Oil & Gas, we have 1 in Hydraulics, we have -- Stanley went 1 up in Engineered Fastening. But we tell them that whatever you come up with, it has to have a scale of at least $100 million of revenue to be interesting to us. And so I can't really get into how big this one could be because we -- frankly, we don't know, but we know it's going to be at least $100 million over time, and it could be far, far greater. So that's kind of the background, and what you have going on now is the commercialization of that. It will begin shortly, and you will see it in stores in relatively short order."

I think the cost synergies were just the beginning. And we -- I think we signed up for $350 million 6 years ago, and we cut the -- cut off the analysis at about $550 million of cost synergies. And that was a huge outperformance. But the thing that we never really expected was the revenue synergies, that we also beat what we expected to accomplish, but they just keep on coming. And it has to do with the fact that the cultures jibed [ph] so well and got so focused on innovation, commercial excellence, all the kinds of things that I was just talking about, and really put all the BS from the typical integration politics, et cetera, behind them and focused on the customer, focused on the markets. And then the scale that we achieved by putting these 2 companies together and going to market with power tools and hand tools and going to market with all these incredibly strong brands that we have just gave us tremendous flexibility.

And the fact that it continues to grow and margins continue to improve, we've said on many occasions, our single greatest self-help opportunity in terms of margin improvement and earnings growth is restoring Security back to its historical levels. We continue that trend, and that's why Jim expressed the gratification or encouragement that, that trend continued for 6 consecutive quarters. As you know, Europe -- margins in Europe, in general, are lower than the U.S., but the overwhelming majority of the improvement is coming from Europe, albeit from a low base. So we will not forecast margins by subsegment because, a, it's very difficult; and b, there's not much in it for us if we get it right and a lot of explaining to do if we don't. But in terms of the assessment of the category itself, we love the business. We review status with our board every board meeting.

And really, the improvement that we saw was in all 3 regions of the world. So the big regions are North America and Europe. Our emerging markets is relatively small. And in both those 2 large regions, we saw really solid improvement year-over-year in the profitability as we continue to execute on the initiatives that we've been really discussing almost for 2 years now of improving field productivity in the Electronic Security business, in particular, in both Europe and in North America. And then in Europe specifically, looking at our SG&A, our selling and general and administrative costs, to making sure they're in line with the revenue of the business as well as the percentage of revenue. We discussed it as a business that probably should be somewhere below 30% of revenue for SG&A, and it's above 30% today. So we continue to take actions in those areas to improve the profitability of both businesses. And we're seeing the benefits of that over the last 2 or 3 quarters, in particular, as the profitability of the business year-over-year continues to improve. And at this point, based on our guidance for the year, we're expecting that trend to continue as we expect modest improvement in profitability of the segment for the full year."

Part of it was due to the fact that we did have a very strong March, month of March. And so our inventory levels were brought down in line with that performance, which was great to see. And we also were very focused on making sure that we collected the cash throughout the quarter, so our accounts receivable was down at the right level as well. So with our company, we're going to have a cash outflow, as I mentioned, in the first quarter every year because of the way the Tools & Storage business seasonality impacts the company. But you have to -- you really have to try to minimize that to achieve your objective for the full year, and I think we've done this. This is the best performance we've had in Q1 in 4 years related to Stanley Black & Decker. And so as a result, I feel very good about our ability to achieve 100% conversion rate because we started the year in that regard. Now your question to potentially additional inventory related to the product launch, yes, we will have some additional inventory. However, based on the current sales plans as the year progresses, we would expect those inventory levels, the vast majority of them, to be absorbed and shipped out to many of our major customers, and so we don't expect that to be a challenge for us as the year ends. But it could be a little bit of additional inventory as we go through the second and the third quarter, which we would normally see anyways in our Tools & Storage business. So at this stage, we feel good about our ability to hit our objective of 100%, and we'll continue to look at that to see how we could potentially outperform that as the year goes on."

To a large extent, historically, that's been a product issue where we've been -- we have been behind our own expectations in some of the market.

We have a tested and proven individual who actually came from the DeWalt professional -- industrial channel. Very, very good person to lead, guide the business and focused on growth as opposed to just margins and things of that nature. So we feel good about it in that perspective. And last but absolutely not least, recall, we just really completed and embedded a change to a third-party or independent distribution model versus the direct model. And Jim has talked about this often in past calls. Years ago, we thought that was a distinct competitive advantage, and it was for a time. We made the decision, and I think it was the right one that what we gained -- we lost more than we gained as a result of that. It was a 2-year process to, if you will, simply convert our distribution model. That's behind us. It's beginning to gain traction. So right leader in place, growth-focused executive and the right distribution model in place, product catching up, gives us cautious optimism that we'll get that growth back in mechanical because it's a great opportunity for us."

And that -- so if we were at 9 turns at the end of the year, and we typically generate about 4% -- 3% to 4% productivity, well, we'll pause productivity a year in our factories. And we would expect that to continue on the basis of these investments that we're making in some of the things that I'm talking about as well as gradually push that working capital turns number up towards 10 and maybe even someday, north of 10. So that's the core SFS. Then there are 3 elements that are far more growth oriented, and those are the digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation. Talked about breakthrough innovation, I think, at length, and I think that's pretty clear. The commercial excellence is really taking some of the continuous improvement concepts that are very familiar to people in business and applying them to the customer-facing processes that drive growth, and so becoming world-class in some of these elements, like sales force effectiveness, like promotion planning, like pricing, pricing excellence and so on. And there's a number of these areas that when we apply continuous improvement principles to them in multiple facets, they just have an ability to generate tactical share gains and also margin expansion. So that's the commercial excellence. And then the digital excellence is one -- we will also see some really interesting things in the marketplace this year in the second half. They probably won't be dramatic revenue drivers but clearly be ways to kind of enhance the marketing prowess and depth of penetration in our company and also just contemporize our value propositions so that we are, again, leading the marketplace with technology on the digital front and as well as taking digital and permeating it into the organization for purposes of efficiency and effectiveness. So that's kind of the -- those are the various elements. The one I didn't mention is functional transformation, and that's a very extensive initiative led by our finance and IT leaders, who are actually taking a clean sheet of paper after having done 100 -- almost 100 acquisitions in 12 years, taking a clean sheet of paper and redesigning our processes in finance, IT, HR, legal, et cetera, to make sure that they are as efficient as possible. We already believe that they're quite effective, but we also believe there's a couple of points of G&A that can come out due to increased efficiency when you start with a clean sheet of paper. That's a long-term initiative. We're not going to see a lot of overnight successes there, but it's one where we're making some investments. And then over the course of a couple of years, we're really going to start to see that SG&A percent come down as a percent of sales. And we're going to take some of the money that comes out of that and reinvest it in some of the growth initiatives."

We're going to continue to consolidate the Global Tools & Storage industry, and we really, really like our position and our opportunity to grow our Engineered Fastening business. Having said that, I think importantly, our pipeline is quite full. And the reason being, as you know, we've been on somewhat of a moratorium for the -- self-imposed, for the last 18-plus months. But it doesn't mean we stop looking at assessing and, in many cases, keeping targets warm. So there's plenty out there in our previously identified areas of strategic focus. In terms of expectations, not a lot has changed. Remember, much of these -- many of these are not public companies, number one. But there are always multiple expectations. But in terms of what's out there in competition for targets, double-edged sword, not too much has changed. Interest rates are obviously very, very low, which would help financial sponsors as they seek to acquire, offset by the fact that most financial sponsors and most of the targets that we're looking at have limited, if any, synergies. So our opportunity to acquire in spaces where we have a great footprint already arguably, the synergies that we could generate, would more than offset, I'll say, lack of leverage given our desire, insistence on maintaining strong tier up for investment-grade credit rating."

And then we have -- over the last couple of years, as we see these types of movements, we take appropriate price actions where we can to offset that impact, at least partially or, in some cases, close to 100%. And we did do that in the first quarter. And a significant portion of that organic growth we saw largely related to price, which is also why we're not necessarily thinking this is a business that's going to grow 9% for the full year because we are going to see some pricing pressure that I touched on in some of those key markets because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus some of those key currencies. That just occurred over the last 6 to 8 weeks. So because of that, our view is, I think, prudent and it's more reflective of a different pricing market because of the currency shift. And then you asked about profitability, margins, yes, in emerging markets for Tools. That's slightly below line average at this point for Tools & Storage business, but it's an area as we continue to ramp up some of the mid-price point initiatives, and we continue to grow with the markets and outpace them, most likely 1.5 to 2.5x GDP growth that we expect with a leverage opportunity that is, again, very close to line average."

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. And for those of you who've had a chance to look at our earnings release, it should point out that we remain strongly focused on generating above-market organic growth, meaningful operating leverage and strong free cash flow conversion.
We've really got a lot of really good news to report on the quarter as well as some real excitement looking forward. So I'm going to be very quick through some of the highlights before turning it over to Jim and Don for more granularity, and then, of course, we'll get on to the Q&A.
Organically, we grew 5%, total growth of 2%, the difference being currency. Really robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, 8%, with significant outperformance in the emerging markets, which was nice to see that come back, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more detail on the strong Global Tools & Storage performance in just a second.
Industrial was down 3%, as we anticipated, and Security was up 1% as the positive organic growth in Europe continues. It's a trend that we've been very focused on, and we're very pleased to see it carrying on the way it has.
Operating margin rate of 13.1% was 20 basis points below last year. The overwhelming majority of that was the impact of $35 million of currency pressure.  Security and Industrial operating margin rates were up 110 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. And Tools & Storage was down slightly in the face of the currency headwinds. As most of you are aware, the overwhelming majority of our FX does -- impacts our Global Tools & Storage business. 
That led to diluted earnings per share of up 20%, $1.28, up 20% versus prior year. Solid operating performance, combined with lower share count and lower restructuring costs, which more than offset the currency impact.
So on the back of the first quarter performance -- outperformance, we are raising 2016 outlook for EPS to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which is up 5% to 8% versus 2015 and up from our $6 to $6.20 range that we most recently provided. Concurrently, we're reiterating free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.
Let's turn briefly to the sources of the growth during the first quarter. Volume was up 4%. Price was up 1%, leading to the 5% organic growth that I already touched on. Currency was a 3% offset, so a total revenue growth of 2%. This compares to 1% organic growth and a 5% currency-driven revenue decline in the fourth quarter '15. So very, very strong sequential quarterly trend.
Turning to the regions. You can see that all markets contributed. The U.S. was up 6%; Europe, up 3%; total emerging market grew -- was up 3%, which, of course, was led by Global Tools & Storage with a very strong performance, and the rest of world was up 1%. 
So all in all, a really solid first quarter growth performance with strength across virtually every business and in virtually every region.
But let's let Jim get into some of the details on our 3 segments. There's a lot of really good news this morning."
304977,330266406,961035,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, John. I'll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which, as John indicated, started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting on all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q '15 comp o",1335,"Okay. Thank you, John. I'll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which, as John indicated, started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting on all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q '15 comp of 10% growth.
The Tools team continued to outperform the market globally as commercial excellence initiatives, supply chain efficiency and a laser focus on innovation and new product development translated into market share gains across product lines and around the world. This is being accomplished against the volatile macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by large and unpredictable swings in foreign currencies, geopolitical unrest and anemic global GDP growth.
Total Tools revenue growth was 4% after absorbing a 4% currency headwind. Currency also impacted operating margin, more than offsetting volume leverage, price and modest commodity deflation, resulting in a 40 basis point decline in the year-over-year operating margin rate. The consistency of organic growth across the regions and SBUs was particularly impressive with North America leading the way, up 10%, followed closely by very strong emerging markets at 9% and Europe with a solid 5% growth performance.
Regarding the Global Tools & Storage SBUs, Power Tools posted 10% organic growth with its underlying product lines, professional, consumer and accessories, each individually generating 10% growth. The Hand Tools & Storage business delivered a solid performance as well, growing 5% organically, with NPD and healthy end markets fueling 10% growth in construction hand tools.
Automotive Repair and Industrial was a mixed bag, with continued robust performance in Mac Tools, a flattish Facom, more than offsetting anticipated but slightly better-than-expected negative pressure in North American industrial channels.
SKU placement success stories were widespread, with our new Porter Cable cordless nailer gaining listings in multiple outlets; gains with our mechanics tools and Mac high-access ratchets; and continued momentum within the DeWalt DC brushless and pneumatic products.
Within North America, the retail channel posted double-digit gains as strong POS performance was driven by supportive construction and DIY markets, a  mild winter, especially compared to 2015, and pervasive new product introductions as well as continued share gains from DC brushless and the made in U.S.A. initiative.
Targeted conversion efforts and promotional wins led to high single-digit growth in the commercial channel, while a successful Mac Tools fair helped offset aforementioned pressure in the industrial channels, which remained down albeit with sequential improvement in the quarter.
Turning to Europe, which was up 5% organically. The story continued with nearly all geographic markets, again, posting positive performances. Share gains coupled with surgical pricing actions delivered above-market growth as SFS 2.0 commercial excellence activities continued to take hold. The e-commerce channel was another highlight as innovations in our Consumer Products Group and the implementation of a broader and deeper go-to-market approach generated significant year-over-year gains.
Last but not least, the emerging market team put together an outstanding quarter under the circumstances, posting a 9% organic gain. This progress derived from a combination of innovation and new product launches as part of our mid-price point, or MPP, initiative, coupled with aggressive price recovery actions taken early in the year to combat currency declines where appropriate.
Latin America served up a stellar performance in the quarter, achieving mid-teens growth on the back of extensive commercial excellence initiatives in Mexico, Peru and Argentina, which more than offset ongoing market headwinds in Brazil. High single-digit growth in Asia, combined with the LatAm performance, more than offset country-specific pressures in the Middle East and Africa.
All in all, the Tools & Storage business started the year vigorously and remains fixated on maintaining its strong growth momentum. The team is leveraging SFS 2.0 initiatives to continue driving tactical share gains and effecting a digital transformation across the enterprise. And at the same time, they're preparing for a major new power tool product rollout in the second half as the breakthrough innovation pillar of SFS 2.0 will soon come to life and begin to contribute to our commercial success. Stay tuned.
Now turning to Security, which continued to progress on multiple fronts in the first quarter. Security posted 1% organic growth, made significant progress on profitability and improved year-over-year margins by 110 basis points. Within Europe, the business was up 3%, organically, for the second quarter in a row, achieving its sixth quarter -- sixth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Higher installation revenues in multiple geographies, highlighted by gains in France, the Nordics and Central Europe, were the primary growth drivers.
Profitability continued to rise as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to year-over-year margin rate increases. Solid order rates in the quarter and continued progress on the commercial front position us to maintain this momentum.
North American Security also made good strides. Operational improvements from field productivity gains under the Stanley standard field operations initiative drove a year-over-year profitability increase. While organic revenue declined, it was attributable primarily to lower volumes in the automatic doors business, which has good visibility to rebounding sales in 2Q.
The CSS business' top line was flat year-over-year, and backlog remained in a healthy position going into 2Q.
And overall, Security posted its highest operating profit rate since the first quarter of 2012, highlighting the growing success of our turnaround initiatives through improved operating performance. Although work remains to be done, which translates to opportunity, we continue to be pleased with Security's trends and development.
Moving on to Industrial. Results for the segment were in line with expectations as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening, Industrial and Electronics businesses combined with a tough comp in automotive system sales led to an overall 3% organic sales decline for the quarter. Infrastructure was flat as Oil & Gas gains stemming from increased onshore pipeline activity offset continued pressure within hydraulics.
Overall Industrial segment profitability improved 120 basis points as productivity and cost controls, particularly within Engineered Fastening, more than offset lower volumes. In this regard, the Engineered Fastening business performed well, notwithstanding the anticipated top line pressures.
Automotive fastener sales growth remained healthy and outpaced light vehicle production. Productivity gains stemming from an intense focus on cost management and supply chain efficiency through core SFS led to the highest first quarter gross margin rate in 5 years.
The Infrastructure business continued to deliver mixed results, with Oil & Gas posting double-digit organic growth while providing good visibility to onshore pipeline projects coming on line over the balance of the year and into 2017. Hydraulics, on the other hand, continued to suffer volume declines due to a persistently difficult steel scrap market.
And in total, both our first quarter results for the company and our ability to guide 2016 upward was a demonstration of the company's underlying growth and earnings power. Robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, coupled with profitability improvements in Security and Industrial, leave us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised 2016 outlook.
And before turning it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that we are also continuing to embed SFS 2.0 into the organization to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion along with high asset efficiency. We are focusing our activities in 5 key areas: commercial excellence, digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, functional transformation and core SFS. 
We have clearly seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in our organic growth and margin expansion. And as I said on our January earnings call and during my earlier Tools & Storage comments, you will begin to see an exciting and growing impact from breakthrough innovation as the year progresses. You may also see some inorganic activity in the near future as we have capital to deploy and are actively developing an acquisition pipeline with emphasis on bolt-ons in the Tools and Industrial segments.
These are truly exciting times for our company with outsized capital efficient growth, solid inorganic growth opportunities ahead and an ever-present focus on margin expansion all contributing to the mix.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide financial update."
304977,330266406,961035,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Let's begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter, which was an outflow of $158 million, an improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year improvement was",1303,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Let's begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter, which was an outflow of $158 million, an improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year improvement was a stronger working capital performance, specifically within inventory and accounts receivable, as our working capital turns were up 0.4, finishing the quarter at 7 turns. Higher income in the current-year quarter served to offset the majority of increased capital expenditures as well as some negative cash outflows in the other line, the other line items which were primarily a reflection of timing of pension plan and miscellaneous accrual payments as compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality, where our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we are adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed markets. As John mentioned earlier, and as you can see here in the takeaway, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at a conversion rate of approximately 100% of net income.
So let's turn to Page 10 as I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwinds. By this point, all of you are likely very familiar with our currency trends chart, which over the last 2 years has consistently depicted worsening FX headwinds on the back of perpetually strengthening U.S. dollar. Well, for the first time in what seems like quite a while, we actually saw a tempering of the dollar momentum over the quarter, followed by an eventual retreat against some of our key foreign currencies, most notably the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the euro. While on a full year basis we are still seeing significant currency headwinds weighing on our operating margin of approximately $140 million, this does represent a $40 million improvement from the midpoint of our initial 2016 guidance range, which was $170 million to $190 million, as we established that in late January time frame. As a reminder, we assess our currency headwinds on our operating margin at the current spot rate.
It's worth noting that the mix of this $140 million headwind is now comprised of approximately 75% transactional exposure, which pressures our margin rate, and 25% translational exposure. This is a shift from the 2/3, 1/3 split we discussed in January and is driven by the $60 million of carryover currency exposures, which relate to our 2015 hedging activities.
While we continue to execute on mitigating actions to offset $140 million of headwind, it's important to note that we do anticipate some pressure on planned pricing actions, particularly in countries where currency have -- currencies have rebounded significantly. This will materialize as a slight headwind to organic growth, specifically in the second half of 2016.
Finally, you will notice that on the lower right-hand side of the page, we have presented our sensitivities for several of our most significant foreign currency exposures. These will be useful guides for you going forward to determine how movements in the FX markets are impacting our 2016 operating margin. So for example, a 1% increase in the Canadian dollar results in a $2 million to $3 million improvement in the 2016 operating margin on an annual basis.
Now let's turn to the next slide, which is an update on our 2016 outlook and guidance. We are raising our 2016 EPS outlook to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 from the prior range of $6 to $6.20. This revised range represents an approximately 5% to 8% increase over 2015. We are also reiterating our free cash flow, as I previously mentioned.
The major changes behind the guidance increase are as follows: As you can see, we are now expecting organic growth of 3% to 4% versus the original estimate of approximately 3%. The primary drivers of the change are an increase in our Tools & Storage growth assumption to mid-single digits on the back of a solid first quarter performance, strong POS data and signs of continued strength in resi and non-resi construction markets. However, this strength is partially offset by revisions to Industrial's organic growth outlook, which we now see as relatively flat versus an assumption of up slightly in our initial guidance. This revision is due primarily to lower-than-anticipated volumes in Engineered Fastening's electronics business as volume expectations for the largest customer in that business continue to decline. Additionally, you expect the timing shift around certain Oil & Gas pipeline projects from the second half of 2016 as they move into the first half of 2017.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, there's also some pricing pressure relative to our initial estimates coming from certain foreign markets that have recently seen significant strengthening in their currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we expect all these puts and takes around our organic growth assumptions to result still in a net increase to our EPS of approximately $0.05.
The next item which we discussed in length on the previous slide is the approximately $40 million improvement in the foreign exchange headwinds, which we expect to translate to an increase of EPS of approximately $0.20 for the full year.
And then finally, slightly higher than planned marketing costs related to the Tools & Storage product launch that Jim alluded to and discussed briefly a few minutes ago are expected to result in approximately 5% -- $0.05 reduction to EPS. The majority of these costs will occur in the second half of 2016. These 3 assumptions changes result in a net increase of $0.20.
Turning to the segment outlook. The Tools & Storage and Industrial segment's organic growth outlook change along the lines I just previously discussed. And Security's organic growth outlook remains low single digit.
In terms of profitability, Tools & Storage is the only change from our January guidance, moving to modestly positive year-over-year from relatively flat. And the driver of that is the reduction in the FX headwinds, primarily.
We continue to expect Security's margin to be modestly positive year-over-year as operational and field efficiency improvements continue to progress and then the Industrial's margin to be relatively flat, with productivity gains and cost take-outs being able to offset the top line pressures we continue to see.
The last point I'd like to make is related to our EPS guidance expectations for the first half of 2016. As you can see, we expect first half 2016 operating profits as a percentage of the full year to be slightly above the prior year period. However, lower planned restructuring as well as lower other net expenses and shares will result in the first half EPS being higher as a percentage of the full year than it was in the prior year. Specifically, first half 2016 EPS as a percentage of the full year will approximate 48% versus 44% in 2015.
So let's move to the summary page. The first quarter was a strong start to the year, with organic growth up 5% and EPS up 20%. As a result of this strong performance, combined with the improved outlooks in the Tools & Storage business and currency markets, we are raising 2016 guidance for full year to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which represents a 5% to 8% increase in the earnings per share versus 2015.
As we continue to progress through 2016, our focus remains on the following: driving organic growth across all businesses and sharing continuous improvement in our operational excellence initiatives; maintaining the momentum behind Security's margin improvements; and as always, pushing ourselves to manage our working capital in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
That concludes the presentation portion of our call, and now let's move to Q&A."

The breakthrough innovation initiative is something that we started -- really started getting into in the early part of 2014. And the concept behind it is that we do a pretty good job in what we call core innovation. And we did this in both the legacy Black & Decker and legacy Stanley. And those are the kind of things that are driving the organic -- big driver behind the organic growth today and some of the new product introductions that I alluded to in the core innovation area. But those are more things like, in the hand tools business, for instance, we introduced a line of FatMax hammers and pry bars and knives and blades, an innovative line in one of our larger retailers. And another large retailer, we introduced DeWalt pry bars and pocketknives. And then in Professional Power Tools, compact generation tools, DC brushless, some really interesting innovations in the DeWalt pneumatics lines, a Mac impact wrench. But you get the idea here. This is sort of a day-to-day innovation that just goes on as a matter of course. But I would say the level of activity in this area and the freshness of the company's product lines has never been greater, in our recollection. So that goes on. And that drives the kind of growth, the organic growth, along with the commercial excellence initiatives that you've been witnessing now here, along with the -- a little help from the U.S. DIY and construction markets and -- but you can see the growth all over the world. So in Europe, which is relatively anemic in terms of its markets, we still are growing an average of about 6% to 7% over a 2-, 2.5-year period. And so there's something going on there. And it's really a combination of the core innovation and the commercial excellence. So what is the breakthrough innovation? The breakthrough innovation is a concept where we actually took people out of the mainstream of the core innovation and set them aside -- a small group of people, 10 or 15 people in that range. And we just said, ""Come up with the next major breakthrough innovation for power tools."" And we gave them a time frame, and we gave them resources and support. And lo and behold, in a relatively short period of time they came up with something very, very interesting. What is that? You'll have to wait and see what that is. But from a scale point of view, we say the breakthrough innovation -- and this is not the only breakthrough innovation team in the company, by the way, this was just the first one. We have 3 more in Oil & Gas, we have 1 in Hydraulics, we have -- we're standing 1 up in Engineered Fastening. But we tell them that whatever you come up with, it has to have a scale of at least $100 million of revenue to be interesting to us. And so I can't really get into how big this one could be because we -- frankly, we don't know, but we know it's going to be at least $100 million over time, and it could be far, far greater. So that's kind of the background, and what you have going on now is the commercialization of that. It will begin shortly, and you will see it in stores in relatively short order."

I think that what's really going on here is that the Black & Decker and Stanley integration, the merger of the 2 companies and the successful integration, was a major home run, I think well beyond anybody's wildest expectations. I think the cost synergies were just the beginning. And we -- I think we signed up for $350 million 6 years ago, and we cut the -- cut off the analysis at about $550 million of cost synergies. And that was a huge outperformance. But the thing that we never really expected was the revenue synergies, that we also beat what we expected to accomplish, but they just keep on coming. And it has to do with the fact that the cultures gelled so well and got so focused on innovation, commercial excellence, all the kinds of things that I was just talking about, and really put all the BS from the typical integration politics, et cetera, behind them and focused on the customer, focused on the markets. And then the scale that we achieved by putting these 2 companies together and going to market with power tools and hand tools and going to market with all these incredibly strong brands that we have just gave us tremendous flexibility. And we just continue to benefit from that as time goes on."

And really, the improvement that we saw was in all 3 regions of the world. So the big regions are North America and Europe. Our emerging markets is relatively small. And in both those 2 large regions we saw really solid improvement year-over-year in the profitability as we continue to execute on the initiatives that we've been, really, discussing almost for 2 years now. Improving field productivity in the Electronic Security business, in particular, in both Europe and in North America. And then in Europe, specifically, looking at our SG&A, our selling and general and administrative costs, to making sure they're in line with the revenue of the business as well as the percentage of revenue. We discussed it as a business that probably should be somewhere below 30% of revenue for SG&A, and it's above 30% today. So we continue to take actions in those areas to improve the profitability of both businesses. And we're seeing the benefits of that over the last 2 or 3 quarters, in particular, as the profitability of the business year-over-year continues to improve. And at this point, based on our guidance for the year, we're expecting that trend to continue as we expect modest improvement in profitability of the segment for the full year."

And we also were very focused on making sure that we collected the cash throughout the quarter, so our accounts receivable was down at the right level as well. So with our company, we're going to have a cash outflow, as I mentioned, in the first quarter every year because of the way the Tools & Storage business seasonality impacts the company. But you have to -- you really have to try to minimize that to achieve your objective for the full year, and I think we've done this. This is the best performance we've had in Q1 in 4 years related to Stanley Black & Decker. And so as a result, I feel very good about our ability to achieve 100% conversion rate because we started the year in that regard. Now your question to potentially additional inventory related to the product launch, yes, we will have some additional inventory. However, based on the current sales plans, as the year progresses we would expect those inventory levels, the vast majority of them to be absorbed and shipped out to many of our major customers. And so we don't expect that to be a challenge for us as the year ends. But it could be a little bit of additional inventory as we go through the second and the third quarter, which we would normally see anyway in our Tools & Storage business. So at this stage, we feel good about our ability to hit our objective of 100%, and we'll continue to look at that to see how we could potentially outperform that as the year goes on."

To a large extent, historically, that's been a product issue where we've been -- we have been behind our own expectations in some of the market.

We have a tested and proven individual who actually came from the DeWalt professional -- industrial channel. Very, very good person to lead, guide the business and focus on growth as opposed to just margins and things of that nature. So we feel good about it in that perspective. And last but absolutely not least, recall we just really completed and embedded a change to a third-party or independent distribution model versus the direct model. And Jim has talked about this often on past calls. Years ago, we thought that was a distinct competitive advantage and it was for a time. We made the decision, and I think it was the right one that what we gained -- we lost more than we gained as a result of that. It was a 2-year process to, if you will, simply convert our distribution model. That's behind us. It's beginning to gain traction. So right leader in place, growth-focused executive. And the right distribution model in place, product catching up, gives us cautious optimism that we'll get that growth back in mechanical because it's a great opportunity for us."

Sensitivities give you an indication of if currencies move in certain directions for the remainder of the year, what the impact could be to our operating margin. And we have thought through it. Is there a potential for the $140 million to move back towards $180 million? There is a scenario where that could play out. If the Fed starts talking about potential interest rate increases, that could actually result in strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the weakening of some of these currencies. However, we also feel like we've built contingency plans to address that scenario if that plays out. So we have certain actions that we would take up to $180 million that we believe would be capable of offsetting that, which is why we felt comfortable making this increase to our guidance."

And we benefited a point or 2 in our Tools & Storage business from that. So if you kind of regulate the growth, saying that's not going to necessarily repeat itself for the next 3 quarters, then you're down to something that's closer to 6% to 6.5,%, roughly. And then we had a fantastic performance in emerging markets in the first quarter, up 9%. We haven't seen that type of performance in almost 2.5 years. And so we were pleased with that, feel very good about it, but at this stage, we're not necessarily ready to say that's something that's going to repeat itself in the next 3 quarters. We're clearly focused on trying to maximize that opportunity, but to be able to project that and say for sure that's going to happen at this stage would probably be a little bit overly optimistic. And those 2 factors in itself kind of get you down to a mid-single-digit number for the full year for organic growth."

And one of the constraints that we would listen to some of -- are the homebuilders calls, as a good example, was basically securing enough qualified, capable labor. Because so much of it during the financial crisis shifted from construction into energy. As some of that variable labor pool, if I can call it that, shifts back the answer is absolutely yes. If the demand is there but the qualified, capable, technically trained or appropriately trained workers aren't, it's going to be a governor on growth. So simply said, yes, it's having an impact, I think it's the early stages of that, but that's clearly helping the North American residential and we think, ultimately, our commercial construction market."

And we'll start with the core SFS, which is the -- basically, the continuation of the SFS that we started in 2006. That got us to 9.2 working capital turns last year and got us customer-facing metrics that were very, very strong in relation to competition and make most of our customers very happy. So that core SFS is at the heart of all this. And that's much more of an operations-related initiative. And it continues to become deeply rooted 10 years into its existence. And now what we're doing with the core SFS is we are taking it to another level, largely through digitizing the supply chain and as well as implementing the smart factory across the company. That's kind of in the earlier -- early stages, but nonetheless, it is underway. And that -- so if we were at 9 turns at the end of the year, and we typically generate about 4% -- 3% to 4% productivity, 4-wall cost productivity a year in our factories. And we would expect that to continue on the basis of these investments that we're making in some of the things that I'm talking about as well as gradually push that working capital turns number up towards 10 and maybe even someday, north of 10. So that's the core SFS. Then there are 3 elements that are far more growth oriented, and those are the digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation. Talked about breakthrough innovation, I think, at length, and I think that's pretty clear. The commercial excellence is really taking some of the continuous improvement concepts that are very familiar to people in business, and applying them to the customer-facing processes that drive growth and so becoming world-class in some of these elements: like sales force effectiveness, like promotion planning, like pricing, pricing excellence and so on. And there's a number of these areas that when we apply continuous improvement principles to them in multiple facets, they just have an ability to generate tactical share gains and also margin expansion. So that's the commercial excellence. And then the digital excellence is one -- we will also see some really interesting things in the marketplace this year in the second half. They probably won't be dramatic revenue drivers but will clearly be ways to kind of enhance the marketing prowess and depth of penetration in our company and also just contemporize our value propositions. So that we are, again, leading the marketplace with technology on the digital front as well as taking digital and permeating it into the organization for purposes of efficiency and effectiveness. So that's kind of the -- those are the various elements. The one I didn't mention is functional transformation, and that's a very extensive initiative led by our finance and IT leaders, who are actually taking a clean sheet of paper after having done 100 -- almost 100 acquisitions in 12 years, taking a clean sheet of paper and redesigning our processes in finance, IT, HR, legal, et cetera, to make sure that they are as efficient as possible. We already believe that they're quite effective, but we also believe there's a couple of points of G&A that could come out due to increased efficiency when you start with a clean sheet of paper. That's a long-term initiative. We're not going to see a lot of overnight successes there, but it's one where we're making some investments. And then over the course of a couple of years, we're really going to start to see that SG&A percent come down as a percent of sales. And we're going to take some of the money that comes out of that and reinvest it in some of the growth initiatives."

Having said that, I think importantly, our pipeline is quite full. And the reason being, as you know, we've been on somewhat of a moratorium for the -- self-imposed, for the last 18-plus months. But it doesn't mean we stopped looking at, assessing and, in many cases, keeping targets warm. So there's plenty out there in our previously identified areas of strategic focus. In terms of expectations, not a lot has changed. Remember, much of these -- many of these are not public companies, number one. But there are always multiple expectations. But in terms of what's out there in competition for targets, double-edged sword, not too much has changed. Interest rates are obviously very, very low, which would help financial sponsors as they seek to acquire, offset by the fact that most financial sponsors and most of the targets that we're looking at have limited, if any, synergies. So our opportunity to acquire in spaces where we have a great footprint already, arguably, the synergies that we could generate would more than offset, I'll say, lack of leverage given our desire -- insistence on maintaining strong tier, upper investment-grade credit rating."

And then we have over the last couple of years, as we see these types of movements, we take appropriate price actions where we can to offset that impact, at least partially or, in some cases, close to 100%. And we did do that in the first quarter. And a significant portion of that organic growth we saw was related to price, which is also why we're not necessarily thinking this is a business that's going to grow 9% for the full year. Because we are going to see some pricing pressure that I touched on in some of those key markets because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus some of those key currencies that just occurred over the last 6 to 8 weeks. So because of that, our view is, I think, prudent and it's more reflective of a different pricing market because of the currency shift. And then you asked about profitability, margins, yes, in emerging markets for tools. That's slightly below line average at this point for Tools & Storage business, but it's an area as we continue to ramp up some of the mid-price point initiatives, and we continue to grow with the markets and outpace them, most likely 1.5 to 2.5x GDP growth that we expect with a leverage opportunity that it will get very close to line average."

Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. And for those of you who've had a chance to look at our earnings release, it should point out that we remain strongly focused on generating above-market organic growth, meaningful operating leverage and strong free cash flow conversion.
We've really got a lot of really good news to report on the quarter as well as some real excitement looking forward. So I'm going to be very quick through some of the highlights before turning it over to Jim and Don for more granularity, and then, of course, we'll get on to the Q&A.
Organically, we grew 5%, total growth of 2%, the difference being currency. Really robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, 8%, with significant outperformance in the emerging markets, which was nice to see that come back, 9%. Jim will give you a lot more detail on the strong Global Tools & Storage performance in just a second.
Industrial was down 3%, as we anticipated, and Security was up 1% as the positive organic growth in Europe continues. It's a trend that we've been very focused on, and we're very pleased to see it carrying on the way it has.
Operating margin rate of 13.1% was 20 basis points below last year. The overwhelming majority of that was the impact of $35 million of currency pressure. Security and Industrial operating margin rates were up 110 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. And Tools & Storage was down slightly in the face of the currency headwinds. As most of you are aware, the overwhelming majority of our FX does -- impacts our Global Tools & Storage business. 
That led to diluted earnings per share of up 20%, $1.28, up 20% versus prior year. Solid operating performance, combined with lower share count and lower restructuring costs, which more than offset the currency impact.
So on the back of the first quarter performance -- outperformance, we are raising 2016 outlook for EPS to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which is up 5% to 8% versus 2015 and up from our $6 to $6.20 range that we most recently provided. Concurrently, we're reiterating free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% of net income.
Let's turn briefly to the sources of the growth during the first quarter. Volume was up 4%. Price was up 1%, leading to the 5% organic growth that I already touched on. Currency was a 3% offset, so a total revenue growth of 2%. This compares to 1% organic growth and a 5% currency-driven revenue decline in the fourth quarter '15. So very, very strong sequential quarterly trend.
Turning to the regions. You can see that all markets contributed. The U.S. was up 6%; Europe, up 3%; total emerging market grew -- was up 3%, which, of course, was led by Global Tools & Storage with a very strong performance, and the rest of world was up 1%. 
So all in all, a really solid first quarter growth performance with strength across virtually every business and in virtually every region.
But let's let Jim get into some of the details on our 3 segments. There's a lot of really good news this morning."

I'll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which, as John indicated, started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting on all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q '15 comp o",1335,"Okay. Thank you, John. I'll begin with our Tools & Storage business, which, as John indicated, started the year off with another strong showing, once again hitting on all cylinders and growing a robust 8% organically in the quarter against a 1Q '15 comp of 10% growth.
The Tools team continued to outperform the market globally as commercial excellence initiatives, supply chain efficiency and a laser focus on innovation and new product development translated into market share gains across product lines and around the world. This is being accomplished against the volatile macroeconomic backdrop, characterized by large and unpredictable swings in foreign currencies, geopolitical unrest and anemic global GDP growth.
Total Tools revenue growth was 4% after absorbing a 4% currency headwind. Currency also impacted operating margin, more than offsetting volume leverage, price and modest commodity deflation, resulting in a 40 basis point decline in the year-over-year operating margin rate. The consistency of organic growth across the regions and SBUs was particularly impressive with North America leading the way, up 10%, followed closely by very strong emerging markets at 9% and Europe with a solid 5% growth performance.
Regarding the Global Tools & Storage SBUs, Power Tools posted 10% organic growth with its underlying product lines, professional, consumer and accessories, each individually generating 10% growth. The Hand Tools & Storage business delivered a solid performance as well, growing 5% organically, with NPD and healthy end markets fueling 10% growth in construction hand tools.
Automotive Repair and Industrial was a mixed bag, with continued robust performance in Mac Tools, a flattish Facom, more than offsetting anticipated but slightly better-than-expected negative pressure in North American industrial channels.
SKU placement success stories were widespread, with our new Porter Cable cordless nailer gaining listings in multiple outlets; gains with our mechanics tools and Mac high-access ratchets; and continued momentum within the DeWalt DC brushless and pneumatic products.
Within North America, the retail channel posted double-digit gains as strong POS performance was driven by supportive construction and DIY markets, a mild winter, especially compared to 2015, and pervasive new product introductions as well as continued share gains from DC brushless and the made in U.S.A. initiative.
Targeted conversion efforts and promotional wins led to high single-digit growth in the commercial channel, while a successful Mac Tools fair helped offset aforementioned pressure in the industrial channels, which remained down albeit with sequential improvement in the quarter.
Turning to Europe, which was up 5% organically. The story continued with nearly all geographic markets, again, posting positive performances. Share gains coupled with surgical pricing actions delivered above-market growth as SFS 2.0 commercial excellence activities continued to take hold. The e-commerce channel was another highlight as innovations in our Consumer Products Group and the implementation of a broader and deeper go-to-market approach generated significant year-over-year gains.
Last but not least, the emerging market team put together an outstanding quarter under the circumstances, posting a 9% organic gain. This progress derived from a combination of innovation and new product launches as part of our mid-price point, or MPP, initiative, coupled with aggressive price recovery actions taken early in the year to combat currency declines where appropriate.
Latin America served up a stellar performance in the quarter, achieving mid-teens growth on the back of extensive commercial excellence initiatives in Mexico, Peru and Argentina, which more than offset ongoing market headwinds in Brazil. High single-digit growth in Asia, combined with the LatAm performance, more than offset country-specific pressures in the Middle East and Africa.
All in all, the Tools & Storage business started the year vigorously and remains fixated on maintaining its strong growth momentum. The team is leveraging SFS 2.0 initiatives to continue driving tactical share gains and effecting a digital transformation across the enterprise. And at the same time, they're preparing for a major new power tool product rollout in the second half as the breakthrough innovation pillar of SFS 2.0 will soon come to life and begin to contribute to our commercial success. Stay tuned.
Now turning to Security, which continued to progress on multiple fronts in the first quarter. Security posted 1% organic growth, made significant progress on profitability and improved year-over-year margins by 110 basis points. Within Europe, the business was up 3%, organically, for the second quarter in a row, achieving its sixth quarter -- sixth consecutive quarter in positive territory. Higher installation revenues in multiple geographies, highlighted by gains in France, the Nordics and Central Europe, were the primary growth drivers.
Profitability continued to rise as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to year-over-year margin rate increases. Solid order rates in the quarter and continued progress on the commercial front position us to maintain this momentum.
North American Security also made good strides. Operational improvements from field productivity gains under the Stanley standard field operations initiative drove a year-over-year profitability increase. While organic revenue declined, it was attributable primarily to lower volumes in the automatic doors business, which has good visibility to rebounding sales in 2Q.
The CSS business' top line was flat year-over-year, and backlog remained in a healthy position going into 2Q.
And overall, Security posted its highest operating profit rate since the first quarter of 2012, highlighting the growing success of our turnaround initiatives through improved operating performance. Although work remains to be done, which translates to opportunity, we continue to be pleased with Security's trends and development.
Moving on to Industrial. Results for the segment were in line with expectations as lower volumes in Engineered Fastening, Industrial and Electronics businesses combined with a tough comp in automotive system sales led to an overall 3% organic sales decline for the quarter. Infrastructure was flat as Oil & Gas gains stemming from increased onshore pipeline activity offset continued pressure within hydraulics.
Overall Industrial segment profitability improved 120 basis points as productivity and cost controls, particularly within Engineered Fastening, more than offset lower volumes. In this regard, the Engineered Fastening business performed well, notwithstanding the anticipated top line pressures.
Automotive fastener sales growth remained healthy and outpaced light vehicle production. Productivity gains stemming from an intense focus on cost management and supply chain efficiency through core SFS led to the highest first quarter gross margin rate in 5 years.
The Infrastructure business continued to deliver mixed results, with Oil & Gas posting double-digit organic growth while providing good visibility to onshore pipeline projects coming on line over the balance of the year and into 2017. Hydraulics, on the other hand, continued to suffer volume declines due to a persistently difficult steel scrap market.
And in total, both our first quarter results for the company and our ability to guide 2016 upward was a demonstration of the company's underlying growth and earnings power. Robust organic growth in Tools & Storage, coupled with profitability improvements in Security and Industrial, leave us well positioned to achieve our upwardly revised 2016 outlook.
And before turning it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that we are also continuing to embed SFS 2.0 into the organization to enable sustained above-market organic growth and margin expansion along with high asset efficiency. We are focusing our activities in 5 key areas: commercial excellence, digital excellence, breakthrough innovation, functional transformation and core SFS. 
We have clearly seen the manifestation of commercial excellence in our organic growth and margin expansion. And as I said on our January earnings call and during my earlier Tools & Storage comments, you will begin to see an exciting and growing impact from breakthrough innovation as the year progresses. You may also see some inorganic activity in the near future as we have capital to deploy and are actively developing an acquisition pipeline with emphasis on bolt-ons in the Tools and Industrial segments.
These are truly exciting times for our company with outsized capital efficient growth, solid inorganic growth opportunities ahead and an ever-present focus on margin expansion all contributing to the mix.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan, who will provide financial update."
304977,330266406,961972,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Let's begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter, which was an outflow of $158 million, an improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year improvement was",1303,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning. Let's begin with a look at our free cash flow for the first quarter, which was an outflow of $158 million, an improvement of $85 million from the first quarter of 2015. The primary driver of the year-over-year improvement was a stronger working capital performance, specifically within inventory and accounts receivable, as our working capital turns were up 0.4, finishing the quarter at 7 turns. Higher income in the current-year quarter served to offset the majority of increased capital expenditures as well as some negative cash outflows in the other line, the other line items which were primarily a reflection of timing of pension plan and miscellaneous accrual payments as compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, the outflow of cash in the first quarter is normal seasonality, where our Tools & Storage inventory levels rise to ensure we are adequately prepared for the Q2 and Q3 demands of our key customers in the developed markets. As John mentioned earlier, and as you can see here in the takeaway, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at a conversion rate of approximately 100% of net income.
So let's turn to Page 10 as I would like to provide you with an updated outlook on our 2016 foreign exchange headwinds. By this point, all of you are likely very familiar with our currency trends chart, which over the last 2 years has consistently depicted worsening FX headwinds on the back of perpetually strengthening U.S. dollar. Well, for the first time in what seems like quite a while, we actually saw a tempering of the dollar momentum over the quarter, followed by an eventual retreat against some of our key foreign currencies, most notably the Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and the euro. While on a full year basis we are still seeing significant currency headwinds weighing on our operating margin of approximately $140 million, this does represent a $40 million improvement from the midpoint of our initial 2016 guidance range, which was $170 million to $190 million, as we established that in late January time frame. As a reminder, we assess our currency headwinds on our operating margin at the current spot rate.
It's worth noting that the mix of this $140 million headwind is now comprised of approximately 75% transactional exposure, which pressures our margin rate, and 25% translational exposure. This is a shift from the 2/3, 1/3 split we discussed in January and is driven by the $60 million of carryover currency exposures, which relate to our 2015 hedging activities.
While we continue to execute on mitigating actions to offset $140 million of headwind, it's important to note that we do anticipate some pressure on planned pricing actions, particularly in countries where currency have -- currencies have rebounded significantly. This will materialize as a slight headwind to organic growth, specifically in the second half of 2016.
Finally, you will notice that on the lower right-hand side of the page, we have presented our sensitivities for several of our most significant foreign currency exposures. These will be useful guides for you going forward to determine how movements in the FX markets are impacting our 2016 operating margin. So for example, a 1% increase in the Canadian dollar results in a $2 million to $3 million improvement in the 2016 operating margin on an annual basis.
Now let's turn to the next slide, which is an update on our 2016 outlook and guidance. We are raising our 2016 EPS outlook to a range of $6.20 to $6.40 from the prior range of $6 to $6.20. This revised range represents an approximately 5% to 8% increase over 2015. We are also reiterating our free cash flow, as I previously mentioned.
The major changes behind the guidance increase are as follows: As you can see, we are now expecting organic growth of 3% to 4% versus the original estimate of approximately 3%. The primary drivers of the change are an increase in our Tools & Storage growth assumption to mid-single digits on the back of a solid first quarter performance, strong POS data and signs of continued strength in resi and non-resi construction markets. However, this strength is partially offset by revisions to Industrial's organic growth outlook, which we now see as relatively flat versus an assumption of up slightly in our initial guidance. This revision is due primarily to lower-than-anticipated volumes in Engineered Fastening's electronics business as volume expectations for the largest customer in that business continue to decline. Additionally, you expect the timing shift around certain Oil & Gas pipeline projects from the second half of 2016 as they move into the first half of 2017.
Finally, as I mentioned earlier, there's also some pricing pressure relative to our initial estimates coming from certain foreign markets that have recently seen significant strengthening in their currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, we expect all these puts and takes around our organic growth assumptions to result still in a net increase to our EPS of approximately $0.05.
The next item which we discussed in length on the previous slide is the approximately $40 million improvement in the foreign exchange headwinds, which we expect to translate to an increase of EPS of approximately $0.20 for the full year.
And then finally, slightly higher than planned marketing costs related to the Tools & Storage product launch that Jim alluded to and discussed briefly a few minutes ago are expected to result in approximately 5% -- $0.05 reduction to EPS. The majority of these costs will occur in the second half of 2016. These 3 assumptions changes result in a net increase of $0.20.
Turning to the segment outlook. The Tools & Storage and Industrial segment's organic growth outlook change along the lines I just previously discussed. And Security's organic growth outlook remains low single digit.
In terms of profitability, Tools & Storage is the only change from our January guidance, moving to modestly positive year-over-year from relatively flat. And the driver of that is the reduction in the FX headwinds, primarily.
We continue to expect Security's margin to be modestly positive year-over-year as operational and field efficiency improvements continue to progress and then the Industrial's margin to be relatively flat, with productivity gains and cost take-outs being able to offset the top line pressures we continue to see.
The last point I'd like to make is related to our EPS guidance expectations for the first half of 2016. As you can see, we expect first half 2016 operating profits as a percentage of the full year to be slightly above the prior year period. However, lower planned restructuring as well as lower other net expenses and shares will result in the first half EPS being higher as a percentage of the full year than it was in the prior year. Specifically, first half 2016 EPS as a percentage of the full year will approximate 48% versus 44% in 2015.
So let's move to the summary page. The first quarter was a strong start to the year, with organic growth up 5% and EPS up 20%. As a result of this strong performance, combined with the improved outlooks in the Tools & Storage business and currency markets, we are raising 2016 guidance for full year to a range of $6.20 to $6.40, which represents a 5% to 8% increase in the earnings per share versus 2015.
As we continue to progress through 2016, our focus remains on the following: driving organic growth across all businesses and sharing continuous improvement in our operational excellence initiatives; maintaining the momentum behind Security's margin improvements; and as always, pushing ourselves to manage our working capital in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
That concludes the presentation portion of our call, and now let's move to Q&A."

The breakthrough innovation initiative is something that we started -- really started getting into in the early part of 2014. And the concept behind it is that we do a pretty good job in what we call core innovation. And we did this in both the legacy Black & Decker and legacy Stanley. And those are the kind of things that are driving the organic -- big driver behind the organic growth today and some of the new product introductions that I alluded to in the core innovation area. But those are more things like, in the hand tools business, for instance, we introduced a line of FatMax hammers and pry bars and knives and blades, an innovative line in one of our larger retailers. And another large retailer, we introduced DeWalt pry bars and pocketknives. And then in Professional Power Tools, compact generation tools, DC brushless, some really interesting innovations in the DeWalt pneumatics lines, a Mac impact wrench. But you get the idea here. This is sort of a day-to-day innovation that just goes on as a matter of course. But I would say the level of activity in this area and the freshness of the company's product lines has never been greater, in our recollection. So that goes on. And that drives the kind of growth, the organic growth, along with the commercial excellence initiatives that you've been witnessing now here, along with the -- a little help from the U.S. DIY and construction markets and -- but you can see the growth all over the world. So in Europe, which is relatively anemic in terms of its markets, we still are growing an average of about 6% to 7% over a 2-, 2.5-year period. And so there's something going on there. And it's really a combination of the core innovation and the commercial excellence. So what is the breakthrough innovation? The breakthrough innovation is a concept where we actually took people out of the mainstream of the core innovation and set them aside -- a small group of people, 10 or 15 people in that range. And we just said, ""Come up with the next major breakthrough innovation for power tools."" And we gave them a time frame, and we gave them resources and support. And lo and behold, in a relatively short period of time they came up with something very, very interesting. What is that? You'll have to wait and see what that is. But from a scale point of view, we say the breakthrough innovation -- and this is not the only breakthrough innovation team in the company, by the way, this was just the first one. We have 3 more in Oil & Gas, we have 1 in Hydraulics, we have -- we're standing 1 up in Engineered Fastening. But we tell them that whatever you come up with, it has to have a scale of at least $100 million of revenue to be interesting to us. And so I can't really get into how big this one could be because we -- frankly, we don't know, but we know it's going to be at least $100 million over time, and it could be far, far greater. So that's kind of the background, and what you have going on now is the commercialization of that. It will begin shortly, and you will see it in stores in relatively short order."

And that was a huge outperformance. But the thing that we never really expected was the revenue synergies, that we also beat what we expected to accomplish, but they just keep on coming. And it has to do with the fact that the cultures gelled so well and got so focused on innovation, commercial excellence, all the kinds of things that I was just talking about, and really put all the BS from the typical integration politics, et cetera, behind them and focused on the customer, focused on the markets. And then the scale that we achieved by putting these 2 companies together and going to market with power tools and hand tools and going to market with all these incredibly strong brands that we have just gave us tremendous flexibility.

That included yesterday and the day before. 1.5 years ago, we said in the second half -- sometime during the second half of 2016, we would be very public in terms of what our plans were. We're sticking to that, and we're not going to accelerate it. Beyond that, Don, if you want to add a little granularity, please feel free to do so."

So when you look at the first quarter performance, Jim mentioned that we're very pleased with the profitability of the segment. And really, the improvement that we saw was in all 3 regions of the world. So the big regions are North America and Europe. Our emerging markets is relatively small. And in both those 2 large regions we saw really solid improvement year-over-year in the profitability as we continue to execute on the initiatives that we've been, really, discussing almost for 2 years now. Improving field productivity in the Electronic Security business, in particular, in both Europe and in North America. And then in Europe, specifically, looking at our SG&A, our selling and general and administrative costs, to making sure they're in line with the revenue of the business as well as the percentage of revenue. We discussed it as a business that probably should be somewhere below 30% of revenue for SG&A, and it's above 30% today. So we continue to take actions in those areas to improve the profitability of both businesses. And we're seeing the benefits of that over the last 2 or 3 quarters, in particular, as the profitability of the business year-over-year continues to improve. And at this point, based on our guidance for the year, we're expecting that trend to continue as we expect modest improvement in profitability of the segment for the full year."

Part of it was due to the fact that we did have a very strong March, month of March. And so our inventory levels were brought down in line with that performance, which was great to see. And we also were very focused on making sure that we collected the cash throughout the quarter, so our accounts receivable was down at the right level as well. So with our company, we're going to have a cash outflow, as I mentioned, in the first quarter every year because of the way the Tools & Storage business seasonality impacts the company. But you have to -- you really have to try to minimize that to achieve your objective for the full year, and I think we've done this. This is the best performance we've had in Q1 in 4 years related to Stanley Black & Decker. And so as a result, I feel very good about our ability to achieve 100% conversion rate because we started the year in that regard. Now your question to potentially additional inventory related to the product launch, yes, we will have some additional inventory. However, based on the current sales plans, as the year progresses we would expect those inventory levels, the vast majority of them to be absorbed and shipped out to many of our major customers. And so we don't expect that to be a challenge for us as the year ends. But it could be a little bit of additional inventory as we go through the second and the third quarter, which we would normally see anyway in our Tools & Storage business. So at this stage, we feel good about our ability to hit our objective of 100%, and we'll continue to look at that to see how we could potentially outperform that as the year goes on."

To a large extent, historically, that's been a product issue where we've been -- we have been behind our own expectations in some of the market. That being said, our sense is it's going to be offset by 2 things. One is the leadership in that business, we believe, is quite capable. We have a tested and proven individual who actually came from the DeWalt professional -- industrial channel. Very, very good person to lead, guide the business and focus on growth as opposed to just margins and things of that nature. So we feel good about it in that perspective. And last but absolutely not least, recall we just really completed and embedded a change to a third-party or independent distribution model versus the direct model. And Jim has talked about this often on past calls. Years ago, we thought that was a distinct competitive advantage and it was for a time. We made the decision, and I think it was the right one that what we gained -- we lost more than we gained as a result of that. It was a 2-year process to, if you will, simply convert our distribution model. That's behind us. It's beginning to gain traction. So right leader in place, growth-focused executive. And the right distribution model in place, product catching up, gives us cautious optimism that we'll get that growth back in mechanical because it's a great opportunity for us."

Sensitivities give you an indication of if currencies move in certain directions for the remainder of the year, what the impact could be to our operating margin. And we have thought through it. Is there a potential for the $140 million to move back towards $180 million? There is a scenario where that could play out. If the Fed starts talking about potential interest rate increases, that could actually result in strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the weakening of some of these currencies. However, we also feel like we've built contingency plans to address that scenario if that plays out. So we have certain actions that we would take up to $180 million that we believe would be capable of offsetting that, which is why we felt comfortable making this increase to our guidance."

And we benefited a point or 2 in our Tools & Storage business from that. So if you kind of regulate the growth, saying that's not going to necessarily repeat itself for the next 3 quarters, then you're down to something that's closer to 6% to 6.5%, roughly. And then we had a fantastic performance in emerging markets in the first quarter, up 9%. We haven't seen that type of performance in almost 2.5 years. And so we were pleased with that, feel very good about it, but at this stage, we're not necessarily ready to say that's something that's going to repeat itself in the next 3 quarters.

And we'll start with the core SFS, which is the -- basically, the continuation of the SFS that we started in 2006. That got us to 9.2 working capital turns last year and got us customer-facing metrics that were very, very strong in relation to competition and make most of our customers very happy. So that core SFS is at the heart of all this. And that's much more of an operations-related initiative. And it continues to become deeply rooted 10 years into its existence. And now what we're doing with the core SFS is we are taking it to another level, largely through digitizing the supply chain and as well as implementing the smart factory across the company. That's kind of in the earlier -- early stages, but nonetheless, it is underway. And that -- so if we were at 9 turns at the end of the year, and we typically generate about 4% -- 3% to 4% productivity, 4-wall cost productivity a year in our factories. And we would expect that to continue on the basis of these investments that we're making in some of the things that I'm talking about as well as gradually push that working capital turns number up towards 10 and maybe even someday, north of 10. So that's the core SFS. Then there are 3 elements that are far more growth oriented, and those are the digital excellence, commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation. Talked about breakthrough innovation, I think, at length, and I think that's pretty clear. The commercial excellence is really taking some of the continuous improvement concepts that are very familiar to people in business, and applying them to the customer-facing processes that drive growth and so becoming world-class in some of these elements: like sales force effectiveness, like promotion planning, like pricing, pricing excellence and so on. And there's a number of these areas that when we apply continuous improvement principles to them in multiple facets, they just have an ability to generate tactical share gains and also margin expansion. So that's the commercial excellence. And then the digital excellence is one -- we will also see some really interesting things in the marketplace this year in the second half. They probably won't be dramatic revenue drivers but will clearly be ways to kind of enhance the marketing prowess and depth of penetration in our company and also just contemporize our value propositions. So that we are, again, leading the marketplace with technology on the digital front as well as taking digital and permeating it into the organization for purposes of efficiency and effectiveness. So that's kind of the -- those are the various elements. The one I didn't mention is functional transformation, and that's a very extensive initiative led by our finance and IT leaders, who are actually taking a clean sheet of paper after having done 100 -- almost 100 acquisitions in 12 years, taking a clean sheet of paper and redesigning our processes in finance, IT, HR, legal, et cetera, to make sure that they are as efficient as possible. We already believe that they're quite effective, but we also believe there's a couple of points of G&A that could come out due to increased efficiency when you start with a clean sheet of paper. That's a long-term initiative. We're not going to see a lot of overnight successes there, but it's one where we're making some investments. And then over the course of a couple of years, we're really going to start to see that SG&A percent come down as a percent of sales. And we're going to take some of the money that comes out of that and reinvest it in some of the growth initiatives."

But it doesn't mean we stopped looking at, assessing and, in many cases, keeping targets warm. So there's plenty out there in our previously identified areas of strategic focus. In terms of expectations, not a lot has changed. Remember, much of these -- many of these are not public companies, number one. But there are always multiple expectations. But in terms of what's out there in competition for targets, double-edged sword, not too much has changed. Interest rates are obviously very, very low, which would help financial sponsors as they seek to acquire, offset by the fact that most financial sponsors and most of the targets that we're looking at have limited, if any, synergies. So our opportunity to acquire in spaces where we have a great footprint already, arguably, the synergies that we could generate would more than offset, I'll say, lack of leverage given our desire -- insistence on maintaining strong tier, upper investment-grade credit rating."

And we did do that in the first quarter. And a significant portion of that organic growth we saw was related to price, which is also why we're not necessarily thinking this is a business that's going to grow 9% for the full year. Because we are going to see some pricing pressure that I touched on in some of those key markets because of the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus some of those key currencies that just occurred over the last 6 to 8 weeks. So because of that, our view is, I think, prudent and it's more reflective of a different pricing market because of the currency shift. And then you asked about profitability, margins, yes, in emerging markets for tools. That's slightly below line average at this point for Tools & Storage business, but it's an area as we continue to ramp up some of the mid-price point initiatives, and we continue to grow with the markets and outpace them, most likely 1.5 to 2.5x GDP growth that we expect with a leverage opportunity that it will get very close to line average."

But a real driver is DeWalt. It's the brand the pros go to. It's available online. And we were very thoughtful in terms of the extent to which we promote it, make it available, push it, because prior to the Stanley Black & Decker merger, DeWalt actually, other than via a retailer's own online opportunity, DeWalt wasn't offered online. It is now. It's doing well. But think of our 3 power brands, Stanley, DeWalt, Black & Decker, their specific end-user groups and to each and every one, they're all doing encouragingly well. The biggest single dollar percentage, though, would be DeWalt."

I and I say there's some sadness simply because of how much I've enjoyed leading the company and our world-class management team and employees since the first quarter of 2004. But I am pleased to announce that Jim Loree will be succeeding me as Stanley's Chief Executive Officer, and I am extremely confident in the prospects for this organization with Jim at the helm.  For those of you who followed our company over the last several years, this transition will not come as a surprise. I, in conjunction with our Board of Directors, have always viewed the leadership succession plan to be a top priority to ensure consistency and stability throughout the organization, as well as to ensure that we continue to deliver the exceptional shareholder value that our investors have expected -- have come to expect from this company.  And to that end, Jim's uniquely positioned to deliver on each of those things given his tenure with the company and his role in leading that transformation that we've executed over the last decade or so. Furthermore, it's important to note that we have as deep and talented a management team today as we've had at any  point during my 12-year tenure with the company. There are strong confident leaders in place across our various businesses, and we're not anticipating any major changes in strategy or to the team as a result of this announcement.  I'll be staying on as Chairman of the Board through the end of the year and I'll continue as some special adviser to the company to the end of April next year in order to ensure an orderly transition, and of course, to assist the board, Jim and the rest of the management team in any way that I can.
I'm proud of everything the company has accomplished over the last 12-plus years, including compounded annual sales growth of 12% and total shareholder return of over 300%. And while I've enjoyed my time here immensely, I'm looking forward to the next phase of my career, which will include among other things serving on a number of boards, as well as continuing my efforts to impact policy in Washington and around the world to create an environment where manufacturing companies like ours can continue to succeed and to prosper.
I'll turn 65 in September, and rather than think of this since going out of the top, I think of it more as a long-distance relay race where we built a good lead and I'm passing the baton to a colleague and a management team who are well-positioned and fully capable of increasing that lead.  And I'm confident that after you listen to this morning's call, you'll share in my belief that our best times still lie ahead of us. 
So let's dive into the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016.  Here's some of the highlights during the second quarter. Organic growth was 4%, total growth was 2%. We had robust organic growth in our Tools & Storage business, 8%, that continues up an incredible trend, with Europe leading the way at 14% growth during the quarter.  Security was up 1%, as Europe organic growth -- the trend there continues, Europe was up 3% for the quarter. Industrial was off [ph] 6%, mainly due to a single customer volume pressure in the electronics segment of our Engineered Fastening business, and the well-expected lower interest structure volume; as oil and gas and hydraulics remain challenged by the weak energy and scrap steel markets respectively.  Our operating margin rate of 15.8% was up 140 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago, that is a post-merger record despite significant foreign currency pressure. That was led by Tools & Storage performance, which was up 240 basis points to 18.8%. And Security posted a strong sequential increase to 12.6%, while industrial declined marginally but to a very respectable rate of 17%.  Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.84 was up 19% versus prior year on strong operational performance, along with a lower share count. Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT battery system was unveiled in June, delivering the power of corded and the freedom of cordless to professional and consumer end-users worldwide. Some of you have seen the products perform, and you'll have your own well-informed views. But as participated in several of the major introductions and the words game changing have been a common reaction from our customers.  The product will hit the shelves in October this year, and Jim will provide you some more detail on our vision to create a cordless job site.  Given these results, we're raising our 2016 guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50, that's up 6% to 10% versus 2015 and from our prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.40, and concurrently, we're reiterating our free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.
Let's look quickly at the sources of growth. Both volume and price contributed to our growth, which was broad based on a regional basis. During the second quarter, volume was up 3%. We got a positive 1% from price for 4% organic growth, currency was a 2 percentage point offset for revenue growth of 2%. All regions contributed positively to the total performance across the company. You see the U.S. up 3%, Europe, up 10%; emerging markets, flat; rest of the world, up 4%, for again, total organic growth  of 4% for the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Don will show you later baked into our guidance is an increase in organic growth for the year from a range of 3% to 4% to an estimate of 4%.
There were lots of puts and falls within the emerging markets group, volatile markets as you know, but our Latin American group was up 9% with Mexico up 11% and Argentina up 46%, albeit from a low base. The emerging markets were down in the low teens. Tools and Security growth was offset by industrial softness in the Engineered Fastening Consumer Electronics business. But all in all, really strong growth in the quarter.
Let me turn it over to Jim, who's done an update on our game changing DEWALT FLEXVOLT program, as well as some of the details on the segment."

Before that, I just want to thank John for being a trusted colleague and a mentor and a friend, and also for all John has done for this company and our stakeholders over the years. He and I have enjoyed an outstanding business partnership for over 12 years, teaming up to lead the company through a transformation from a small-cap building products company to a large-cap diversified industrial. It is no coincidence that John's arrival in 2004 marked the beginning of a growth renaissance period for Stanley. And I'm honored to be named as our next CEO succeeding John, with a mission to lead us to the next stage of our journey. The company has never been stronger with all its well-established global franchises, agile and deep leadership bench and strong and evolving SFS 2.0 operating system.  Importantly, I want to highlight our world-class management team. This high-performing team to a person is totally dedicated to the success of this company. They have supported me all the way through both their words and their actions, thus enabled us to affect a smooth leadership transition. The impressive results you've seen quarter after quarter from this company are a direct result of this team's experience, commitment and passion for winning. What better way to highlight the immense opportunities present in this next stage of our evolution than to introduce you to the first output from breakthrough innovation, our SFS 2.0 initiative.
The patent protected DEWALT FLEXVOLT system is the most exciting innovation in the power tool industry since Black & Decker unveiled the first cordless tool in the 1960s. It has the potential to revolutionize the jobsite. It allows users to switch from 20 volt to 60 volt to the never before seen 120 volts of cordless power using the same battery pack regardless of the voltage rating. These battery packs are completely backwards-compatible with our existing line of DeWalt 20-volt tools, and when used in these products, the flexible battery combines with our market-leading brushless motors to provide significant runtime and perform its advantages.  FLEXVOLT will ultimately enable professional users to completely eliminate the cord in the jobsite, achieving the freedom of cordless while maintaining all the power and flexibility of corded tools, and at the same time, none of our existing user base is left behind as the flexibility battery packs used on their new 60-volt and 120-volt cordless tools will also enhance the performance of their existing 20-volt products. 
FLEXVOLT is being commercialized as part of our SFS 2.0 commercial excellence initiative with the most global, most digitally enabled and most comprehensive marketing campaign in our history. We have already demonstrated the technology in person to over 700 customers around the globe, including major retailers, distributors and other channel partners. We have also introduced and demonstrated the products to the tools subject matter expert blogger community and have created an enormous social media buzz in anticipation of the product's release to the market in October.  We have coordinated our digital marketing campaign with our sports marketing assets, and we will be conducting a massive end-user demonstration effort as the summer proceeds. This type of breakthrough innovation, coupled with commercial excellence, will provide significant organic growth runway, even as we comp up against several years of top quartile organic growth among peers. In the near term, we will focus on delivering the end-user's long-held dream of the cordless jobsite, and over the intermediate to longer-term, we will be moving up the power curve, exploiting the rapidly advancing technology of electrification and opening up new markets and growth opportunities.
This tremendous accomplishment within our Tools & Storage business is the first example of the output we expect to deliver from SFS 2.0, our enhanced operating system. We are currently taking the same approach to breakthrough innovation and several other businesses across the company. So stay tuned.  I encourage all investors to take a deep dive into both flexible and SFS 2.0 as they are essential to understanding what this company will deliver in the form of continued organic growth and margin expansion. Our Investor Relations team is ready to assist those that are interested in that regard.
And moving on to 2Q, I'll begin with the Tools & Storage business, which continued its forward momentum delivering another high single-digit organic growth performance coming in at 8% and equally as impressively, improving profitability by 240 basis points for a segment profit rate of 18.8%.  Total Tools revenue growth was 5% after absorbing a 3-point currency headwind. Organic growth across all regions in SBUs was once again positive. Europe led the way, up 14%, followed by North America, up 7%; and emerging markets, up 4%. The gains in Europe are particularly impressive, given the flat to very low single-digit growth in environment in those markets and they highlight our ability to continue gaining share and the strength of our pervasive commercial excellence activities and new product development initiatives such as our DC brushless motor products, which exemplify the importance of our very strong core or normal course of business innovation.  This all important core innovation activity has been a key source of organic growth and the hallmark of our culture for quite some time. Core innovation provides a solid base for above-market growth, thus enabling SFS 2.0 breakthrough innovations to turbocharge an already strong base.
Moving to global SBU results, Power Tools delivered another double-digit quarter, up 10%, with consistent strength across professional and consumer tools. Hand tools and storage posted 2% growth as construction hand tools were up in high single digits, driven by our new line of DeWalt and FatMax measuring lasers, offsetting pressure in Proto industrial hand tools. Taking a regional look at the segment, in North America momentum was good across all major retailers, with high single-digit performance from the group. POS data remained very strong and in the mid-teens for the quarter. Ending retailer inventories were in line with or below historical norms.
And turning to Europe, which posted extraordinary 14% organic growth, on the heels of 2 years of 7% compounded growth, the outperformance was widespread. Every major underlying market grew organically, with most up double digits, including a noteworthy performance by the U.K. team, which delivered the highest growth in the region. France also showed unusually strong growth, driven by share gains and professional Power Tools.
And finally, emerging markets were up 4% organically, with Latin America and Asia leading the way. Both up in high single-digits, more than offsetting continued issues in Middle East and North America which was down. Latin America continued to overcome a generally distressed market environment. Within Latin America, Argentina and Mexico turned in strong country performances, with growth in our Tradesman segment and continued penetration of our recently introduced Stanley MPP Cordless Power Tools. e-commerce and pricing excellence initiatives also contributed to drive growth in the region.
Asia also delivered a notable performance, with good organic growth in China, South Korea and Indonesia, and as I noted earlier, we continue to see pressure within Middle East, North America. However, efforts are underway to revitalize the businesses in those markets, which continue to be challenged by severely depressed macroeconomic conditions amidst geopolitical turmoil.
So in summary, Tools & Storage continued its strong momentum this quarter, leveraging SFS 2.0 to drive outsized share gains, while preparing for the largest product launch in the company's history. Despite the challenging macro and several regions of the world, we remain highly constructive on the growth and margin prospects for Tools & Storage as we look forward.
Shifting over to Security, Security delivered its second consecutive quarter of organic growth and its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement, highlighting the solid progress this business has made. Total revenues increased 1% on 1% organic growth, while the operating margin rate improved 220 basis points year-over-year to finish at a healthy 12.6% for the quarter, its highest second quarter rate since 2013.  Europe Security grew 3% organically for the third quarter in a row, marking as its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth and strong performance in the Nordics and Central Europe, drove the top line performance and offset mild pressure in the U.K. and France. Order intake was in line with expectations, the unit continues to successfully manage attrition and stabilize the RMR portfolio. Europe Security profitability continues to improve as volume leverage productivity and cost actions all contributed to margin growth and rate improvement in the quarter.
North American Security also made progress. Solid organic growth in health care and automatic doors was offset by lower volumes in Electronic Security, or CSS. However, CSS is driving growth in its RMR portfolio, with orders and backlog in a healthy position, heading into the second half of the year and attrition is in line with targets. North America also realized margin growth and rate improvement as field efficiency initiatives took hold. In total, Security improved on almost every front, with order rates, backlog and attrition at targeted rates across Europe and North America and the team is well-positioned and motivated to continue driving forward progress.
Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was under some pressure in the quarter as weakness in Engineered Fastening, combined with anticipated pressure in infrastructure resulted in the 6% organic decline. Expense deleveraging on lower volumes, combined with negative FX drove a corresponding profit decline, although segment margin continued to be at impressive well above company line average levels. And within Engineered Fastening, the negative growth was overwhelmingly driven by significantly lower-than-expected volume with one major electronics customer. The general and industrial business was down modestly, in line with expectations, and the automotive segment remains solid, with fastener growth continuing to outpace light vehicle production around the globe.
Infrastructure was down 11% organically, as a slowdown in offshore Oil & Gas activity, combined with continued weakness in hydraulics end markets, resulted in year-over-year declines. Encouragingly, we see sufficient project activity in our onshore business to enable positive growth for Oil & Gas in the second half of the year.  So while industrial posted an eye-opening negative organic growth number for the quarter, it was caused largely by a decline in sales to one specific electronic fastening customer, partially driven by changing end user demand and partially driven by our strategic decision to remain disciplined on price.  Nonetheless, segment profitability remains strong, although the revenue impact of this situation will be felt for a few quarters until it anniversaries. 
So in summary, like all multinational businesses, in today's environment of slowing global growth and unprecedented geopolitical volatility and an ever more rapidly increasing pace of technological change, we face ongoing challenges across our businesses in many of the markets we serve. We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it within organic growth, expand margins and do it all at a capital efficient approach. SFS 2.0 with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front.  We will soon be back on the acquisition trail and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. In today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate, a 15.8% and $418 million of free cash flow, underscores the health and earnings power of the company, while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan who will provide a financial update."

Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million or a year-over-year improvement of $171 million.

Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million or a year-over-year improvement of $171 million. As you can see, the primary drivers of the outperformance were stronger earnings of $44 million and continued improvements in working capital, which generated a positive $58 million of cash in the quarter for a meaningful $108 million of year-over-year improvement.  Our working capital turns were 8.2x at the end of Q2, which was a 1.2x improvement versus the prior year second quarter. 
On a year-to-date basis, this leads our free cash flow $256 million ahead of prior year. Again, with earnings growth and working capital efficiency explaining essentially all of the improvement.  As John noted earlier, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at 100% conversion rate.  This takes into account the incremental inventory build that we expect to undertake in the second half of the year related to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system launch. Even with this modest headwind to working capital in the second half of 2016, we still plan to end the year at approximately 9.5x for working capital turns.
Moving to the next slide, I want to take a moment to address the potential impact of the U.K.'s EU referendum vote, or Brexit on our anticipated business results in 2016 and potentially beyond. As you can see on this page, we are expecting to generate somewhere north of $500 million and pound sterling denominated revenues in the U.K. And more than $1.7 billion in euro-denominated revenues across the Euro region in 2016.  To date, we have not seen any meaningful reduction in demand within the U.K. and more broadly in Europe. It's likely too early to speculate on the demand side impact of Brexit in both the U.K. and the rest of Europe. What I can tell you a at this point is that our plans for the second half of the year continue to contemplate roughly low to mid-single-digit growth organically in the European region as we expect our recent share gain momentum to be further augmented by the FLEXVOLT battery system rollout that Jim discussed in detail earlier.  As you might expect, we are monitoring the situation very closely and will continue to assess the potential impact as events evolve. We will update all of you accordingly as a more definitive picture materializes.
From a currency perspective however, we have seen some impact to our operating margin based on the FX movements following the referendum result. At current spot rates for the euro and pound sterling, we see approximately an $8 million additional currency pressure relative to the $140 million  of FX headwind we disclosed in our April guidance. The uncertainty created by the U.K.'s decision both with regards to the mechanics of their exit, as well as the future of the European Union as a whole, could result in continued currency-related pressure to our operating margin.  I'd like to give you an example of that potential impact. If the euro were to go to parity with the U.S. dollar and the pound were to fall to 1.20, the combination of these moves will generate an incremental $12 million of operating margin pressure to earnings in 2016. This is above and beyond the current $8 million of incremental pressure measured as the spot rates that I just mentioned.  Of course, the longer FX rates hold at current levels, the more muted the impact of any future deterioration will have on 2016 results. I believe this provides an adequate range of the potential worst-case impact for 2016.
On that note, let's move on to Page 14, where we provide an updated view on the net FX impact to the company's operating margin across all currencies. As you can see, net FX headwinds have increased by approximately $10 million to $150 million since our April guidance was issued. This movement is primarily driven by the, total pound and Europe pressures I just mentioned, as well as further devaluation of the Argentinian peso and Canadian dollar. These negatives are slightly offset by the appreciation in the Brazilian real, which is up about 7% against the dollar since our April guidance was communicated.  Finally, I'd like to remind everyone of the statement I made during the April call, where I pointed out that should FX rates again deteriorate in 2016, we have actions and countermeasures at our disposal to maintain our EPS guidance. We continue to have similar plans in place, but as you would expect, the status of the actions we can effectively execute on begins to shrink as the year wears on. As a result, we now have approximately $20 million in contingency plans that can be put into place should they be necessary.
One last point on currency, our hedging actions are now primarily focused on exposures in 2017 and beyond, and we will continue our practice of locking in portions of our largest exposures such as the Canadian dollar and the euro to dampen volatility throughout the year. Based on current spot rates and the existing derivative hedges in place for 2017 volumes, we estimate the carryover impact of currency to be approximately $20 million for 2017.
Let's turn our attention to the next page in our updated 2016 outlook. As John noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising our EPS outlook to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 from the April guidance range of $6.20 to $6.40. The revised range represents the 6% to 10% year-over-year increase in EPS. At the same time, we are reiterating our free cash flow conversion at approximately 100% of net income.  As you can see on the left side of the page, this 10% increase across the range is being driven by an increased organic growth estimate for the full year. Moving to 4% from approximately 3% to 4%, which generates $0.07 of additional EPS. In addition, we believe $0.10 of our incremental productivity and cost actions will stick for the full year. Embedded in this amount is modest incremental growth costs related to SFS 2.0 initiative. Specifically, these costs will fund key incremental commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation activities to help drive above-market growth beyond 2016.  These 2 positive improvements to guidance are partially offset by $0.07 of increased FX headwinds and onetime new CEO costs. Finally, note that we are providing some color on EPS for 3Q, with approximately 25% of the full year EPS expected to be delivered in the third quarter.
Moving to the right-hand side of the page, we get a better sense of the drivers beyond -- behind the organic growth increase. As Tools & Storage is now projected to grow high single-digit for the year on a great momentum we have seen in the first half, combined with the impact of the pending FLEXVOLT launch. However, some of these gains are being partially offset by our Industrial segment, as we continue to see pressure in the general, industrial and electronics businesses, which is now projected to produce low single-digit decline in 2016. The organic growth guidance for the Security segment remains unchanged, with low single-digit growth expected for the full year.
Finally, we expect the Tools & Storage and Security segment to deliver positive year-over-year improvement to their respective operating margin rates. The Industrial segment's operating margin rate will be lower than 2016 versus 2015 as the impact from lower volume and FX pressure more than offset the productivity gains and cost actions being taken by the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure business teams. 
In summary the second quarter was another solid performance for the company as a whole. Despite some additional pressures in our Industrial segment, Tools & Storage delivered an outstanding quarter. And the Security businesses continue to make solid progress and take additional positive steps forward.  Organic growth for the quarter finished up 4% and earnings per share were up 19% versus prior year, coming in at $1.84, excellent operating leverage.
On the back of this outperformance, we are raising EPS guidance the range of $6.30 to $6.50 as we expect the improved organic growth outlook and incremental productivity to more than offset certain pressures.
In June, we introduced the world to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which we expect to revolutionize the construction jobsite, delivering the power of corded to the freedom of cordless to millions of professionals around the world. And finally, we announced the retirement of John as CEO. His tenure has been an era that is characterized by transformational growth and exceptional shareholder return. Among John's many accomplishments as CEO, is the impact he had in building our high integrity, agile winning business culture across our entire executive leadership team.  And as a result, we are well-positioned to deliver outsized growth and margin expansion going forward. And we have a highly energized organization, motivated toward achieving these goals.  On a personal note, I have appreciated John's mentorship and thank him for the support over the past decade. 
That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Let's move to the Q&A."

As we look at the back half, we still see very strong margins. We're certainly not going to see 18.8% at this stage because of some of the reasons that you mentioned. We're also beginning to anniversary the commodity deflation that we've experienced over the last year. That's been a strong benefit for the business and will not be a continued incremental benefit on a go-forward basis. And then FLEXVOLT, as we mentioned, this is an area that is initial pressure point to gross margin that we rolled that out. Over time, they will be accretive to gross margin as we get deeper into the launch next year. And then we also have launch costs that are specific to this program that will continue out through the remainder of '16, which means that the gross margins in the back half of the year will be roughly somewhere between the 15.5% to 16.5% range, most likely because of those dynamics. The ongoing margin, however, from an incremental margins this festive will be continued to be healthy and consistent to what we said in the past that is with the organic growth incrementally, we would expect 30% to 35% drop through end margins sometimes affected by specific quarter activities where it might be slightly lower if we're making investments for certain types of mix that occurs. But our trend line over the long term for Tools & Storage is still positive. They will likely end the year closer to 17% operating margin, if not slightly over [ph]. We'll see how the year progresses. And we would expect that they would continue to improve that on a go forward basis."

We've talked about several of them over the last years. So on different occasions, it's driving more efficient field productivity, really kind of streamline their SG&A to achieve certain objectives over the long term as a percentage of revenue. And they continue to make progress in that regard. And combining that with the fact that they're being much more disciplined around pricing and the new business that they enter into so they ensure the right level of profitability on new business, have allowed us to continue to increase the profitability and you just see in the first half, we had roughly 12% -- just under 12% profitability in Q1 and a 12.6% in Q2, and we think that's a good indicator of the trend that we'll see in the back half. And obviously, the full year, with the hopefully there being close to 100 basis point improvement year-over-year in operating margin rate in that business. And the good news is that we're seeing in all 3 regions, obviously, emerging markets is relatively small. But in the case of North America and Europe, we're seeing traction in both regions in a significant way, and we see more opportunity for additional upside as we continue this disciplined approach on a go-forward basis. As it relates to specifics to electronics business within Engineered Fastening and industrial, yes, I think that's a business that we continue to be very disciplined with around pricing, and we're interested in certainly some aspects of that business. But as a result of some of these decisions as well as some of the customer decisions that have been made over the last year, the business has [indiscernible] dramatically in our prisons close to the $70 million on an annualized basis.

And as far as the volume in North America, they've been working really hard on getting their field execution up to a level where the orders and the backlog can be installed efficiently and in a timely fashion. And I said the one thing that gives us the ability to be what we think is an inflection point is the fact that the field has made a lot of progress in North America. So we actually haven't had that much of an issue generating new orders, and we have the ability to go out and generate even more orders. However, we've been throttling that a little bit as the field was sort of a bottleneck. So that's really the answer is the reason we're more optimistic about our ability to generate modest growth in Electronic Security and North America is because the field execution is improving and the field capacity is therefore improving. Now just as a side note, there's several components of North America which are doing just fine in terms of growth, including the automatic door business and Mechanical Security. So this is the third leg of the stool, if you will. And once we get that moving in a positive direction, I think we'll be in a similar situation that we are in Europe where we're generating organic growth on a more consistent basis."

And in fact, we are thinking along the lines that these types of bolt-on RMR acquisitions, basically that's what they are, will supplement the installation business in terms of generating RMR. And that one of the keys to success in Electronic Security is to get the RMR portfolio that's recurring monthly revenue for those who are unfamiliar with that term, but to get that portfolio sequentially increasing every quarter in both of those geographies, and the combination of installation growth and attrition management and small bolt-on acquisitions, we almost think of them as if they were CapEx for growth in a Security business. So you'll continue to see small ones. As far as major acquisitions in Security, no, there's nothing on the horizon in the medium-term, short- to medium-term for that. We're actually enjoying working on operational excellence and execution in the business to at the customer level, and in particular, to ensure that while all those consolidation is going on in the industry, we are providing the customers with the absolute best value proposition possible. And we think that we can continue to gain share or gaining share already in Europe, and I think we can continue to gain share in Europe in the North American business. We can begin to gain some share along the way with that as a strategy."

So the silver lining in the cloud for us is retail inventory -- from us and our customers, retail inventories are about their lowest levels that they've been in years, but despite that sell-off for decline in inventory, we've been able to grow nicely. And from a customer's perspective, in-stock is just as good as it's been, our field rates are as good as they've ever been. So it's really the power of sharing the data on a collaborative basis and sell through remains good. So we see no issues in terms of inventory adjustment going forward.

And clearly, we think FLEXVOLT is going to see that probably exceeded in a very significant way. So as we look at 2016, we've had initially very high demand for the products. We expect, as Jim said, it to hit the stores in late September, early October. And as a result, I indicated previously that I think we'll probably experience here in 2016 as a percentage for the total company, about 0.5 point of growth when you look at the entire year. And so that would be roughly $50 million to $60 million. That number could creep up as we go throughout the fourth quarter and become closer to 3/4 of a percent, so we'll see how that progresses, but that's kind of the range you should look at initially. As we think about 2017, we would expect this to be probably a multi-$100 million program next year, likely around $200 million. But we'll see as the year progresses and the success of the launch. We think the launch will be very, very successful. What we would be looking at is the sell through and how strong the sell-through is in the initial 90 days and how quickly the inventory turns and we've clearly positioned ourselves on all the things that Jim mentioned around commercial excellence and digital excellence to try to maximize that opportunity."

And the IoT, in particular, the cloud, advanced analytics, these types of things are all impacting our industry. In fact, our industry is extremely well-positioned to exploit some of those technological advances. And we're working very diligently and aggressively on several verticals, including Healthcare and retail, in particular, in the United States and in Europe, we're taking a bit of a different approach where we're working more on specific applications and then trying to market those generally kind of in the $1 million to $5 million annual revenue range, whereas the Healthcare and retail solutions are a little bit higher ticket. The growth from those activities in the higher end verticals, the real key is to create this recurring revenue business model that will provide superior profitability, and therefore, enable us to get paid for the value. That is definitely something that we've been able to accomplish in Healthcare. And now in Healthcare, we're really investing in significant growth because the next challenge that one faces in these types of verticals is scaling. And being able to make those significant investments that enable 10%, 20%, 30% growth. And that's challenging in a business that's in kind of a turnaround profitability mode, but we're going ahead and making some of those investments in fact, Healthcare is one area where we're doing in retail and one we're doing in the states that on the mental growth model in traditional Electronic Security is always very challenging to grow quickly because of the high recurring revenue content of the total revenue base. Which means that -- and also the attrition in the recurring revenue portfolio, which goes back to one  of the reasons I think these bolt-on RMR acquisitions are a good idea because it takes some of the pressure off of the installation growth and the attachment of RMR to that installation revenue and it enables more investment in kind of the high-growth areas. So you will see over time an improvement in a more consistent than the growth rate in the more consistent growth rate coming out of Electronic Security, which is one of the reasons that we like the business because it does have that stable revenue stream once you get it moving in the right direction, and that's what we're really attempting to do right now."

And before we get started, it's with both a sense of accomplishment and admittedly some sadness that we're announcing my retirement today as the CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, effective July 31, 2016. And I say there's some sadness simply because of how much I've enjoyed leading the company and our world-class management team and employees since the first quarter of 2004. But I am pleased to announce that Jim Loree will be succeeding me as Stanley's Chief Executive Officer, and I am extremely confident in the prospects for this organization with Jim at the helm. 
For those of you who followed our company over the last several years, this transition will not come as a surprise. I, in conjunction with our Board of Directors, have always viewed the leadership succession plan to be a top priority to ensure consistency and stability throughout the organization as well as to ensure that we continue to deliver the exceptional shareholder value that our investors have come to expect from this company. And to that end, Jim's uniquely positioned to deliver on each of those things, given his tenure with the company and his role in leading the transformation that we've executed over the last decade or so. 
Furthermore, it's important to note that we have as deep and talented a management team today as we've had at any point during my 12-year tenure with the company. There are strong, competent leaders in place across our various businesses, and we're not anticipating any major changes to the strategy or to the team as a result of this announcement. 
I'll be staying on as Chairman of the Board through the end of the year, and I'll continue as a special adviser to the company through the end of April next year in order to ensure an orderly transition, and of course, to assist the board, Jim and the rest of the management team in any way that I can.
I'm proud of everything the company's accomplished over the last 12-plus years, including compounded annual sales growth of 12% and a total shareholder return of over 300%. And while I've enjoyed my time here immensely, I'm looking forward to the next phase of my career, which will include, among other things, serving on a number of boards as well as continuing my efforts to impact policy in Washington and around the world to create an environment where manufacturing companies like ours can continue to succeed and to prosper.
I'll turn 65 in September. And rather than think of this as going out at the top, I think of it more as a long-distance relay race where we've built a good lead, and I'm passing the baton to a colleague and a management team who are well-positioned and fully capable of increasing that lead. And I'm confident that after you listen to this morning's call, you'll share in my belief that our best days still lie ahead of us. 
So let's dive into the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Here are some of the highlights during the second quarter. Organic growth was 4%, total growth was 2%. We had robust organic growth in our Tools & Storage business, 8%. That continues up an incredible trend, with Europe leading the way at 14% growth during the quarter. Security was up 1%, as Europe organic growth -- the trend there continues, Europe was up 3% for the quarter. Industrial was off 6%, mainly due to single customer volume pressure in the electronics segment of our Engineered Fastening business and the well-expected lower interest structure volume as Oil & Gas and hydraulics remained challenged by the weak energy and scrap steel markets, respectively. 
Our operating margin rate of 15.8% was up 140 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. That is a post-merger record despite significant foreign currency pressure. That was led by Tools & Storage performance, which was up 240 basis points to 18.8%. And Security posted a strong sequential increase to 12.6%, while Industrial declined marginally, but to a very respectable rate of 17%. 
Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.84 was up 19% versus prior year on strong operational performance, along with the lower share count. 
Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT battery system was unveiled in June, delivering the power of corded and the freedom of cordless to professional and consumer end-users worldwide. Some of you have seen the products perform, and you'll have your own well-informed views. But I've participated in several of the major introductions and the words ""game-changing"" have been a common reaction from our customers. The product will hit the shelves in October this year, and Jim will provide you some more detail on our vision to create a cordless job site. 
Given these results, we're raising our 2016 guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50. That's up 6% to 10% versus 2015 and from our prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.40. And concurrently, we're reiterating our free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.
Let's look quickly at the sources of growth. Both volume and price contributed to our growth, which was broad-based on a regional basis. During the second quarter, volume was up 3%. We got a positive 1% from price for 4% organic growth. Currency was a 2 percentage point offset for a revenue growth of 2%. All regions contributed positively to the total performance across the company. You see the U.S. up 3%, Europe, up 10%; emerging markets, flat; rest of the world, up 4%; for again, total organic growth of 4% for the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Don will show you later that baked into our guidance is an increase in organic growth for the year from a range of 3% to 4% to an estimate of 4%.
There were lots of puts and calls within the emerging market group, volatile markets as you know. But our Latin American group was up 9%, with Mexico up 11% and Argentina up 46%, albeit from a low base. The emerging markets were down in the low-teens. Tools and Security growth was offset by industrial softness in the Engineered Fastening consumer electronics business. But all in all, really strong growth in the quarter.
Let me turn it over to Jim, who's got an update on our game-changing DEWALT FLEXVOLT program as well as some of the details on the segment."

Before that, I just want to thank John for being a trusted colleague and a mentor and a friend, and also for all that John has done for this company and our stakeholders over the years. He and I have enjoyed an outstanding business partnership for over 12 years, teaming up to lead the company through a transformation from a small-cap building products company to a large-cap diversified industrial. It is no coincidence that John's arrival in 2004 marked the beginning of a growth renaissance period for Stanley. And I'm honored to be named as our next CEO, succeeding John, with a mission to lead us through the next stage of our journey. The company has never been stronger with all its well-established global franchises, agile and deep leadership bench and strong and evolving SFS 2.0 operating system. 
Importantly, I want to highlight our world-class management team. This high-performing team to a person is totally dedicated to the success of this company. They have supported me all the way, through both their words and their actions, and have thus enabled us to effect a smooth leadership transition. The impressive results you've seen quarter after quarter from this company are a direct result of this team's experience, commitment and passion for winning. What better way to highlight the immense opportunities present in this next stage of our evolution than to introduce you to the first output from breakthrough innovation, our SFS 2.0 initiative.
The patent-protected DEWALT FLEXVOLT system is the most exciting innovation in the power tool industry since Black & Decker unveiled the first cordless tool in the 1960s. It has the potential to revolutionize the job site. It allows users to switch from 20-volt to 60-volt to the never-before-seen 120 volts of cordless power using the same battery pack, regardless of the voltage rating. These battery packs are completely backwards-compatible with our existing line of DeWalt 20-volt tools. And when used in these products, the FLEXVOLT battery combines with our market-leading brushless motors to provide significant run time and perform its advantages. FLEXVOLT will ultimately enable professional users to completely eliminate the cord in the job site, achieving the freedom of cordless while maintaining all the power and flexibility of corded tools. And at the same time, none of our existing user base is left behind as the FLEXVOLT battery packs used on their new 60-volt and 120-volt cordless tools will also enhance the performance of their existing 20-volt products.
FLEXVOLT is being commercialized as part of our SFS 2.0 commercial excellence initiative with the most global, most digitally enabled and most comprehensive marketing campaign in our history. We have already demonstrated the technology in person to over 700 customers around the globe, including major retailers, distributors and other channel partners. We have also introduced and demonstrated the products to the tools subject matter expert blogger community and have created an enormous social media buzz in anticipation of the product's release to the market in October. We have coordinated our digital marketing campaign with our sports marketing assets, and we will be conducting a massive end-user demonstration effort as the summer proceeds. This type of breakthrough innovation, coupled with commercial excellence, will provide significant organic growth runway, even as we comp up against several years of top quartile organic growth among peers. In the near term, we will focus on delivering the end-user's long-held dream of the cordless job site. And over the intermediate to longer-term, we will be moving up the power curve, exploiting the rapidly advancing technology of electrification and opening up new markets and growth opportunities.
This tremendous accomplishment within our Tools & Storage business is the first example of the output we expect to deliver from SFS 2.0, our enhanced operating system. We are currently taking the same approach to breakthrough innovation and several other businesses across the company, so stay tuned. 
I encourage all investors to take a deep dive into both FLEXVOLT and SFS 2.0 as they are essential to understanding what this company will deliver in the form of continued organic growth and margin expansion. Our Investor Relations team is ready to assist those that are interested in that regard.
And moving on to 2Q, I'll begin with the Tools & Storage business, which continued its forward momentum, delivering another high single-digit organic growth performance coming in at 8%, and equally as impressively, improving profitability by 240 basis points for a segment profit rate of 18.8%. Total Tools revenue growth was 5% after absorbing a 3-point currency headwind. Organic growth across all regions and SBUs was once again positive. Europe led the way, up 14%, followed by North America, up 7%; and emerging markets, up 4%. The gains in Europe are particularly impressive, given the flat to very low single-digit growth environment in those markets, and they highlight our ability to continue gaining share on the strength of our pervasive commercial excellence activities and new product development initiatives, such as our DC brushless motor products, which exemplify the importance of our very strong core or normal course of business innovation. This all-important core innovation activity has been a key source of organic growth and a hallmark of our culture for quite some time. Core innovation provides a solid base for above-market growth, thus enabling SFS 2.0 breakthrough innovations to turbocharge an already strong base.
Moving to global SBU results, Power Tools delivered another double-digit quarter, up 10%, with consistent strength across professional and consumer tools. Hand Tools & Storage posted 2% growth as construction hand tools were up in high single digits, driven by our new line of DeWalt and FatMax measuring lasers, offsetting pressure in Proto Industrial Hand Tools. 
And taking a regional look at the segment, in North America, momentum was good across all major retailers with high single-digit performance from the group. POS data remained very strong and in the mid-teens for the quarter. Ending retailer inventories were in line with or below historical norms.
And turning to Europe, which posted extraordinary 14% organic growth, on the heels of 2 years of 7% compounded growth, the outperformance was widespread. Every major underlying market grew organically, with most up double digits, including a noteworthy performance by the U.K. team, which delivered the highest growth in the region. France also showed unusually strong growth, driven by share gains in Professional Power Tools.
And finally, emerging markets were up 4% organically, with Latin America and Asia leading the way, both up in high single-digits, more than offsetting continued issues in Middle East and North America, which was down. Latin America continued to overcome a generally distressed market environment. Within Latin America, Argentina and Mexico turned in strong country performances, with growth in our Tradesman segment and continued penetration of our recently introduced Stanley MPP cordless power tools E-commerce and pricing excellence initiatives also contributed to drive growth in the region.
Asia also delivered a notable performance, with good organic growth in China, South Korea and Indonesia. And as I noted earlier, we continue to see pressure within Middle East, North America. However, efforts are underway to revitalize the businesses in those markets, which continue to be challenged by severely depressed macroeconomic conditions amidst geopolitical turmoil.
So in summary, Tools & Storage continued its strong momentum this quarter, leveraging SFS 2.0 to drive outsized share gains, while preparing for the largest product launch in the company's history. Despite the challenging macro in several regions of the world, we remain highly constructive on the growth and margin prospects for Tools & Storage as we look forward.
Shifting over to Security. Security delivered its second consecutive quarter of organic growth and its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement, highlighting the solid progress this business has made. Total revenues increased 1% on 1% organic growth, while the operating margin rate improved 220 basis points year-over-year to finish at a healthy 12.6% for the quarter, its highest second quarter rate since 2013. 
Europe Security grew 3% organically for the third quarter in a row, marking as its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth. And strong performance in the Nordics and Central Europe drove the top line performance and offset mild pressure in the U.K. and France. Order intake was in line with expectations. The unit continues to successfully manage attrition and stabilize the RMR portfolio. Europe Security profitability continues to improve as volume leverage productivity and cost actions all contributed to margin growth and rate improvement in the quarter.
North American Security also made progress. Solid organic growth in health care and automatic doors was offset by lower volumes in Electronic Security, or CSS. However, CSS is driving growth in its RMR portfolio with orders and backlog in a healthy position heading into the second half of the year and attrition is in line with targets. North America also realized margin growth and rate improvement as field efficiency initiatives took hold. In total, Security improved on almost every front, with order rates, backlog and attrition at targeted rates across Europe and North America, and the team is well-positioned and motivated to continue driving forward progress.
Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was under some pressure in the quarter as weakness in Engineered Fastening, combined with anticipated pressure in infrastructure, resulted in the 6% organic decline. Expense deleveraging on lower volume, combined with negative FX, drove a corresponding profit decline, although segment margin continued to be at impressive well-above company line average levels. 
And within Engineered Fastening, the negative growth was overwhelmingly driven by significantly lower-than-expected volume with one major electronics customer. The general industrial business was down modestly, in line with expectations, and the automotive segment remains solid, with fastener growth continuing to outpace light vehicle production around the globe.
Infrastructure was down 11% organically, as a slowdown in offshore Oil & Gas activity, combined with continued weakness in hydraulics end markets, resulted in year-over-year declines. Encouragingly, we see sufficient project activity in our onshore business to enable positive growth for Oil & Gas in the second half of the year. So while Industrial posted an eye-opening negative organic growth number for the quarter, it was caused largely by a decline in sales to one specific electronic fastening customer, partially driven by changing end-user demand and partially driven by our strategic decision to remain disciplined on price. Nonetheless, segment profitability remains strong, although the revenue impact of this situation will be felt for a few quarters until it anniversaries.
So in summary, like all multinational businesses in today's environment of slowing global growth and unprecedented geopolitical volatility in an evermore rapidly increasing pace of technological change, we face ongoing challenges across our businesses in many of the markets we serve. We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it with inorganic growth, expand margins and do it all in a capital-efficient approach. SFS 2.0, with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front. We will soon be back on the acquisition trail, and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. And today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate, a 15.8% and $418 million of free cash flow underscores the health and earnings power of the company, while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan who will provide a financial update."
304977,370236098,1010731,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million or a year-over-year improvement of $171 million. As you can see, the primary drivers of the outperformance were stronger earnings of $44 million and cont",1511,"Thank you, Jim. Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million or a year-over-year improvement of $171 million. As you can see, the primary drivers of the outperformance were stronger earnings of $44 million and continued improvements in working capital, which generated a positive $58 million of cash in the quarter for a meaningful $108 million of year-over-year improvement. Our working capital turns were 8.2x at the end of Q2, which was a 1.2x improvement versus the prior year second quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, this leaves our free cash flow of $256 million ahead of prior year, again with earnings growth and working capital efficiency explaining essentially all of the improvement. As John noted earlier, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at 100% conversion rate. This takes into account the incremental inventory build that we expect to undertake in the second half of the year related to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system launch. Even with this modest headwind to working capital in the second half of 2016, we still plan to end the year at approximately 9.5x for working capital turns.
Moving to the next slide, I want to take a moment to address the potential impact of the U.K.'s EU referendum vote, or Brexit, on our anticipated business results in 2016 and potentially beyond. As you can see on this page, we are expecting to generate somewhere north of $500 million in pound sterling-denominated revenues in the U.K. and more than $1.7 billion in euro-denominated revenues across the Euro region in 2016. To date, we have not seen any meaningful reduction in demand within the U.K. and more broadly in Europe. It is likely too early to speculate on the demand side impact of Brexit in both the U.K. and the rest of Europe. What I can tell you at this point is that our plans for the second half of the year continue to contemplate roughly low to mid-single-digit growth organically in the European region as we expect our recent share gain momentum to be further augmented by the FLEXVOLT battery system rollout that Jim discussed in detail earlier. As you might expect, we are monitoring this situation very closely and will continue to assess the potential impact as events evolve. We will update all of you accordingly as a more definitive picture materializes.
From a currency perspective, however, we have seen some impact to our operating margin based on the FX movements following the referendum result. At current spot rates for the euro and pound sterling, we see approximately an $8 million additional currency pressure relative to the $140 million of FX headwind we disclosed in our April guidance. The uncertainty created by the U.K.'s decision, both with regards to the mechanics of their exit as well as the future of the European Union as a whole, could result in continued currency-related pressure to our operating margin. 
I'd like to give you an example of that potential impact. If the euro were to go to parity with the U.S. dollar and the pound were to fall to $1.20, the combination of these moves would generate an incremental $12 million of operating margin pressure to earnings in 2016. This is above and beyond the current $8 million of incremental pressure measured as spot rates that I just mentioned. Of course, the longer FX rates hold at current levels, the more muted the impact of any future deterioration will have on 2016 results. I believe this provides an adequate range of the potential worst-case impact for 2016.
On that note, let's move on to Page 14, where we provide an updated view on the net FX impact to the company's operating margin across all currencies. As you can see, net FX headwinds have increased by approximately $10 million to $150 million since our April guidance was issued. This movement is primarily driven by the incremental pound and euro pressures I just mentioned as well as further devaluation of the Argentinian peso and Canadian dollar. These negatives are slightly offset by the appreciation in the Brazilian real, which is up about 7% against the dollar since our April guidance was communicated. 
Finally, I'd like to remind everyone of a statement I made during the April call, where I pointed out that should FX rates again deteriorate in 2016, we have actions and countermeasures at our disposal to maintain our EPS guidance. We continue to have similar plans in place, but as you would expect, the size of the actions we can effectively execute on begins to shrink as the year wears on. As a result, we now have approximately $20 million in contingency plans that can be put into place should they be necessary.
One last point on currency. Our hedging actions are now primarily focused on exposures in 2017 and beyond, and we will continue our practice of locking in portions of our largest exposures, such as the Canadian dollar and the euro, to dampen volatility throughout the year. Based on current spot rates and the existing derivative hedges in place for 2017 volumes, we estimate the carryover impact of currency to be approximately $20 million for 2017.
Let's turn our attention to the next page in our updated 2016 outlook. As John noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising our EPS outlook to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 from the April guidance range of $6.20 to $6.40. The revised range represents the 6% to 10% year-over-year increase in EPS. At the same time, we are reiterating our free cash flow conversion at approximately 100% of net income. As you can see on the left side of the page, this 10% increase across the range is being driven by an increased organic growth estimate for the full year, moving to 4% from approximately 3% to 4%, which generates $0.07 of additional EPS. In addition, we believe $0.10 of our incremental productivity and cost actions will stick for the full year. Embedded in this amount is modest incremental growth costs related to SFS 2.0 initiative. Specifically, these costs will fund key incremental commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation activities that help drive above-market growth beyond 2016. These 2 positive improvements to guidance are partially offset by $0.07 of increased FX headwinds and onetime new CEO costs. Finally, note that we are providing some color on EPS for 3Q with approximately 25% of the full year EPS expected to be delivered in the third quarter.
Moving to the right-hand side of the page, we get a better sense of the drivers behind the organic growth increase as Tools & Storage is now projected to grow high single-digits for the year on a great momentum we have seen in the first half, combined with the impact of the pending FLEXVOLT launch. However, some of these gains are being partially offset by our Industrial segment, as we continue to see pressure in the general, industrial and electronics businesses, which is now projected to produce low single-digit declines in 2016. The organic growth guidance for the Security segment remains unchanged, with low single-digit growth expected for the full year.
Finally, we expect that Tools & Storage and Security segment to deliver positive year-over-year improvements to their respective operating margin rates. The Industrial segment's operating margin rate will be lower in 2016 versus 2015 as the impact from lower volumes and FX pressure more than offsets the productivity gains and cost actions being taken by the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure business teams. 
In summary, the second quarter was another solid performance for the company as a whole. Despite some additional pressures in our Industrial segment, Tools & Storage delivered an outstanding quarter. And the Security businesses continue to make solid progress and take additional positive steps forward. Organic growth for the quarter finished up 4% and earnings per share were up 19% versus prior year, coming in at $1.84, excellent operating leverage.
On the back of this outperformance, we are raising EPS guidance to range of $6.30 to $6.50 as we expect the improved organic growth outlook and incremental productivity to more than offset certain pressures.
In June, we introduced the world to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which we expect to revolutionize the construction job site, delivering the power of corded with the freedom of cordless to millions of professionals around the world. 
And finally, we announced the retirement of John as CEO. His tenure has been an era that is characterized by transformational growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Among John's many accomplishments as CEO is the impact he had on building our high-integrity, agile winning business culture across our entire executive leadership team. And as a result, we are well-positioned to deliver outsized growth and margin expansion going forward. And we have a highly energized organization, motivated toward achieving these goals. On a personal note, I have appreciated John's mentorship and thank him for the support over the past decade. 
That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Let's move to Q&A."

As we look at the back half, we still see very strong margins. We're certainly not going to see 18.8% at this stage because of some of the reasons that you mentioned. We're also beginning to anniversary the commodity deflation that we've experienced over the last year. That's been a strong benefit for the business and will not be a continued incremental benefit on a go-forward basis. And then FLEXVOLT, as you mentioned, is an area that is an initial pressure point to gross margin that we rolled that out. Over time, they will be accretive to gross margin as we get deeper into the launch next year. And then we also have launch costs that are specific to this program that will continue out through the remainder of '16, which means that the gross margins in the back half of the year will be roughly somewhere between at 15.5% to 16.5% range, most likely because of those dynamics. The ongoing margins, however, from an incremental margin perspective will be continued to be healthy and consistent with we've said in the past. That as we see organic growth incrementally, we would expect 30% to 35% drop through end margins some times affected by specific quarter activities where it might be slightly lower if we're making investments or if there's certain types of mix that occurs. But our trend line over the long term for Tools & Storage is still positive. They will likely end the year close to 17% operating margin. If not, slightly over. We'll see how the year progresses. And we would expect that they would continue to improve that on a go-forward basis."

It is really remarkable that we've been able to achieve this kind of accretion in the gross margin rate. And what it really derives from working on everything that we possibly can to impact the margin rate in a positive way. And that starts with productivity and working hard on 4-wall cost productivity, working hard on vendor productivity, G&A productivity, our functional transformational initiative starting to pay some dividends, the commercial excellence initiative from SFS 2.0. We're driving price realization, price optimization. All these things kind of combined, we are very, very focused on managing mix, focused on managing the life cycle of new products or products in general and introducing new products at higher margins as the more mature products kind of margin has a degrading tendency over time. It's a combination of all those things, and we continue to target gross margin improvements over the medium term as well.

So John is absolutely correct, that the Security business continues to generate a positive momentum around various initiatives. Specific to profitability, we've talked about several of them over the last years. So on different occasions, it's driving more efficient field productivity, really kind of streamline their SG&A to achieve certain objectives over the long term as a percentage of revenue. And they continue to make progress in that regard. And combining that with the fact that they're being much more disciplined around pricing and the new business that they enter into so they ensure the right levels of profitability on new business have allowed us to continue to increase the profitability. And you just see in the first half, we had roughly 12% -- just under 12% profitability in Q1 and then 12.6% in Q2. And we think that's a good indicator of the trend that we'll see in the back half. And for, obviously, the full year, with hopefully that being close to 100 basis point improvement year-over-year in operating margin rate in that business. And the good news is that we're seeing it in all 3 regions. Obviously, emerging markets is relatively small. But in the case of North America and Europe, we're seeing traction in both regions in a significant way, and we see more opportunity for additional upside as we continue this disciplined approach on a go-forward basis. As it relates to specifics to electronics business within Engineered Fastening and Industrial, yes, I think that's a business that we continue to be very disciplined with in around pricing, and we're interested in certainly some aspects of that business. But as a result of some of these decisions as well as some of the customer decisions that have been made over the last year, the business has swung dramatically and now represents close to $70 million on an annualized basis. And we think for the long term, that's probably a reasonable number, somewhere between $50 million to $70 million. And -- but we'll see where we go from here.

But we don't expect that to be material in the second half of the year.

Well, the simple one is the second question, which is about 400 basis points of difference at this point time. And as far as the volume in North America, they've been working really hard on getting their field execution up to a level where the orders and the backlog can be installed efficiently and in a timely fashion. And I'd say the one thing that gives us the ability to be at what we think is an inflection point is the fact that the field has made a lot of progress in North America. So we've actually haven't had that much of an issue generating new orders, and we have the ability to go out and generate even more orders. However, we've been throttling that a little bit as the field was sort of a bottleneck. And so that's really the answer, is the reason we're more optimistic about our ability to generate modest growth in Electronic Security in North America is because the field execution is improving and the field capacity is therefore improving. Now just as a side note, there's several components of North America which are doing just fine in terms of growth, including the automatic door business and Mechanical Security. So this is the third leg of the stool, if you will. And once we get that moving in a positive direction, I think we'll be in a similar situation that we are in Europe where we're generating organic growth on a more consistent basis."

And in fact, we are thinking along the lines that these types of bolt-on RMR acquisitions, basically is what they are, will supplement the installation business in terms of generating RMR. And that one of the keys to success in Electronic Security is to get the RMR portfolio that's recurring monthly revenue, for those that are unfamiliar with that term, but to get that portfolio sequentially increasing every quarter in both of those geographies. And the combination of installation growth and attrition management and small bolt-on acquisitions, we almost think of them as if they were CapEx for growth in the Security business. So you'll continue to see small ones. As far as major acquisitions in Security, no. I don't -- there's nothing on the horizon in the medium-term, short- to medium-term for that. We're actually enjoying working on operational excellence and execution in the business to -- at the customer level. And in particular, to ensure that while all this consolidation is going on in the industry, we are providing the customers with the absolute best value proposition possible.

So the silver lining in the cloud for us is retail inventory -- from us and our customers, retail inventories are at about their lowest levels that they've been in years.

And clearly, we think FLEXVOLT is going to exceed that, probably exceeded it in a very significant way. So as we look at 2016, we've had initially very high demand for the product. We expect, as Jim said, for it to hit the stores in late September, early October. And as a result, I indicated previously that I think we'll probably experience here in 2016 for our -- as a percentage for the total company, about 0.5% of growth for the -- when you look at the entire year. And so that would be roughly $50 million to $60 million. That number could creep up as we go throughout the fourth quarter and could become closer to 0.75%, so we'll see how that progresses. But that's kind of the range you should look at initially. As we think about 2017, we would expect this to be probably a multi-hundred million program next year, likely around $200 million. But we'll see as the year progresses and the success of the launch. We think the launch will be very, very successful. What we'd be looking at is the sell through and how strong the sell-through is in the initial 90 days and how quickly the inventory turns. And we've clearly positioned ourselves through all the things that Jim mentioned around commercial excellence and digital excellence to try to maximize that opportunity."

I -- this industry that we're talking about, the Electronic Security is in very rapid flux right now, as I think most people know. And the IoT, in particular, the cloud, advanced analytics, these types of things are all impacting our industry. In fact, our industry is extremely well-positioned to exploit some of those technological advances. And we're working very diligently and aggressively on several verticals, including health care and retail, in particular, in the United States and in Europe. We're taking a bit of a different approach where we're working more on specific applications and then trying to market those generally kind of in the $1 million to $5 million annual revenue range, whereas the health care and retail solutions are a little bit higher ticket. The growth from those activities in the higher end verticals, the real key is to create this recurring revenue business model that will provide superior profitability, and therefore, enable us to get paid for the value. That is definitely something that we've been able to accomplish in health care. And now in health care, we're really investing in significant growth because the next challenge that one faces in these types of verticals is scaling and being able to make those significant investments that enable 10%, 20%, 30% growth. And that's challenging in a business that's in kind of a turnaround profitability mode, but we're going ahead and making some of those investments. In fact, health care is one area where we're doing it, retail's another one here in the states. Now the fundamental growth model in traditional Electronic Security, it's always very challenging to grow it quickly because of the high recurring revenue content of the total revenue base, that -- which means that -- and also, the attrition in the recurring revenue portfolio, which goes back to one of the reasons I think these bolt-on RMR acquisitions are a good idea because it takes some of the pressure off of the installation growth and the attachment of RMR to that installation revenue. And it enables more investment in kind of the high-growth areas. So you will see, over time, an improvement in a more consistent -- in the growth rate -- in a more consistent growth rate coming out of Electronic Security, which is one of the reasons that we like the business because it does have that stable revenue stream once you get it moving in the right direction, and that's what we're really attempting to do right now."

And before we get started, it's with both a sense of accomplishment and admittedly some sadness that we're announcing my retirement today as the CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, effective July 31, 2016. And I say there's some sadness simply because of how much I've enjoyed leading the company and our world-class management team and employees since the first quarter of 2004. But I am pleased to announce that Jim Loree will be succeeding me as Stanley's Chief Executive Officer, and I am extremely confident in the prospects for this organization with Jim at the helm. 
For those of you who followed our company over the last several years, this transition will not come as a surprise. I, in conjunction with our Board of Directors, have always viewed the leadership succession plan to be a top priority to ensure consistency and stability throughout the organization as well as to ensure that we continue to deliver the exceptional shareholder value that our investors have come to expect from this company. And to that end, Jim's uniquely positioned to deliver on each of those things, given his tenure with the company and his role in leading the transformation that we've executed over the last decade or so. 
Furthermore, it's important to note that we have as deep and talented a management team today as we've had at any point during my 12-year tenure with the company. There are strong, competent leaders in place across our various businesses, and we're not anticipating any major changes to the strategy or to the team as a result of this announcement. 
I'll be staying on as Chairman of the Board through the end of the year, and I'll continue as a special adviser to the company through the end of April next year in order to ensure an orderly transition, and of course, to assist the board, Jim and the rest of the management team in any way that I can.
I'm proud of everything the company's accomplished over the last 12-plus years, including compounded annual sales growth of 12% and a total shareholder return of over 300%. And while I've enjoyed my time here immensely, I'm looking forward to the next phase of my career, which will include, among other things, serving on a number of boards as well as continuing my efforts to impact policy in Washington and around the world to create an environment where manufacturing companies like ours can continue to succeed and to prosper.
I'll turn 65 in September. And rather than think of this as going out at the top, I think of it more as a long-distance relay race where we've built a good lead, and I'm passing the baton to a colleague and a management team who are well positioned and fully capable of increasing that lead. And I'm confident that after you listen to this morning's call, you'll share in my belief that our best days still lie ahead of us. 
So let's dive into the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Here are some of the highlights during the second quarter. Organic growth was 4%, total growth was 2%. We had robust organic growth in our Tools & Storage business, 8%. That continues an incredible trend, with Europe leading the way at 14% growth during the quarter. Security was up 1%, as Europe organic growth -- the trend there continues, Europe was up 3% for the quarter. Industrial was off 6%, mainly due to single customer volume pressure in the electronics segment of our Engineered Fastening business and the well-expected lower Infrastructure volume as Oil & Gas and hydraulics remained challenged by the weak energy and scrap steel markets, respectively. 
Our operating margin rate of 15.8% was up 140 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. That is a post-merger record despite significant foreign currency pressure. That was led by Tools & Storage performance, which was up 240 basis points to 18.8%. And Security posted a strong sequential increase to 12.6%, while Industrial declined marginally, but to a very respectable rate of 17%. 
Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.84 was up 19% versus prior year on strong operational performance, along with the lower share count. 
Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT battery system was unveiled in June, delivering the power of corded and the freedom of cordless to professional and consumer end-users worldwide. Some of you have seen the products perform, and you'll have your own well-informed views. But I've participated in several of the major introductions and the words ""game-changing"" have been a common reaction from our customers. The product will hit the shelves in October this year, and Jim will provide you some more detail on our vision to create a cordless job site. 
Given these results, we're raising our 2016 guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50. That's up 6% to 10% versus 2015 and from our prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.40. And concurrently, we're reiterating our free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.
Let's look quickly at the sources of growth. Both volume and price contributed to our growth, which was broad based on a regional basis. During the second quarter, volume was up 3%. We got a positive 1% from price for 4% organic growth. Currency was a 2 percentage point offset for a revenue growth of 2%. All regions contributed positively to the total performance across the company. You see the U.S. up 3%; Europe, up 10%; emerging markets, flat; rest of the world, up 4%; for again, total organic growth of 4% for the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Don will show you later that baked into our guidance is an increase in organic growth for the year from a range of 3% to 4% to an estimate of 4%.
There were lots of puts and calls within the emerging market group, volatile markets as you know. But our Latin American group was up 9%, with Mexico up 11% and Argentina up 46%, albeit from a low base. The emerging markets were down in the low-teens. Tools and Security growth was offset by industrial softness in the Engineered Fastening consumer electronics business. But all in all, really strong growth in the quarter.
Let me turn it over to Jim, who's got an update on our game-changing DEWALT FLEXVOLT program as well as some of the details on the segment."

Importantly, I want to highlight our world-class management team. This high-performing team to a person is totally dedicated to the success of this company.

The patent-protected DEWALT FLEXVOLT system is the most exciting innovation in the power tool industry since Black & Decker unveiled the first cordless tool in the 1960s. It has the potential to revolutionize the job site. It allows users to switch from 20-volt to 60-volt to the never-before-seen 120 volts of cordless power using the same battery pack, regardless of the voltage rating. These battery packs are completely backwards-compatible with our existing line of DeWalt 20-volt tools. And when used in these products, the FLEXVOLT battery combines with our market-leading brushless motors to provide significant run time and performance advantages. FLEXVOLT will ultimately enable professional users to completely eliminate the cord on the job site, achieving the freedom of cordless while maintaining all the power and flexibility of corded tools. And at the same time, none of our existing user base is left behind as the FLEXVOLT battery packs used on their new 60-volt and 120-volt cordless tools will also enhance the performance of their existing 20-volt products.
FLEXVOLT is being commercialized as part of our SFS 2.0 commercial excellence initiative with the most global, most digitally enabled and most comprehensive marketing campaign in our history. We have already demonstrated the technology in person to over 700 customers around the globe, including major retailers, distributors and other channel partners. We have also introduced and demonstrated the products to the tool subject matter expert blogger community and have created an enormous social media buzz in anticipation of the product's release to the market in October. We have coordinated our digital marketing campaign with our sports marketing assets, and we will be conducting a massive end-user demonstration effort as the summer proceeds. This type of breakthrough innovation, coupled with commercial excellence, will provide significant organic growth runway, even as we comp up against several years of top quartile organic growth among peers. In the near term, we will focus on delivering the end-user's long-held dream of the cordless job site. And over the intermediate to longer term, we will be moving up the power curve, exploiting the rapidly advancing technology of electrification and opening up new markets and growth opportunities.
This tremendous accomplishment within our Tools & Storage business is the first example of the output we expect to deliver from SFS 2.0, our enhanced operating system. We are currently taking the same approach to breakthrough innovation at several other businesses across the company, so stay tuned. 
I encourage all investors to take a deep dive into both FLEXVOLT and SFS 2.0 as they are essential to understanding what this company will deliver in the form of continued organic growth and margin expansion. Our Investor Relations team is ready to assist those that are interested in that regard.
And moving on to 2Q, I'll begin with the Tools & Storage business, which continued its forward momentum, delivering another high single-digit organic growth performance coming in at 8%, and equally as impressively, improving profitability by 240 basis points for a segment profit rate of 18.8%. Total Tools revenue growth was 5% after absorbing a 3 point currency headwind. Organic growth across all regions and SBUs was once again positive. Europe led the way, up 14%; followed by North America, up 7%; and emerging markets, up 4%. The gains in Europe are particularly impressive, given the flat to very low single-digit growth environment in those markets, and they highlight our ability to continue gaining share on the strength of our pervasive commercial excellence activities and new product development initiatives, such as our DC brushless motor products, which exemplify the importance of our very strong core or normal course-of-business innovation. This all-important core innovation activity has been a key source of organic growth and a hallmark of our culture for quite some time. Core innovation provides a solid base for above-market growth, thus enabling SFS 2.0 breakthrough innovations to turbocharge an already strong base.
Moving to global SBU results, Power Tools delivered another double-digit quarter, up 10%, with consistent strength across professional and consumer tools. Hand Tools & Storage posted 2% growth as construction hand tools were up in high single digits, driven by our new line of DeWalt and FatMax measuring lasers, offsetting pressure in Proto Industrial Hand Tools. 
And taking a regional look at the segment, in North America, momentum was good across all major retailers with high single-digit performance from the group. POS data remained very strong and in the mid-teens for the quarter. Ending retailer inventories were in line with or below historical norms.
And turning to Europe, which posted extraordinary 14% organic growth on the heels of 2 years of 7% compounded growth, the outperformance was widespread. Every major underlying market grew organically, with most up double digits, including a noteworthy performance by the U.K. team, which delivered the highest growth in the region. France also showed unusually strong growth, driven by share gains in Professional Power Tools.
And finally, emerging markets were up 4% organically, with Latin America and Asia leading the way, both up in high single digits, more than offsetting continued issues in Middle East and North America, which was down. Latin America continued to overcome a generally distressed market environment. Within Latin America, Argentina and Mexico turned in strong country performances, with growth in our Tradesman segment and continued penetration of our recently introduced Stanley MPP cordless power tools E-commerce and pricing excellence initiatives also contributed to drive growth in the region.
Asia also delivered a notable performance, with good organic growth in China, South Korea and Indonesia. And as I noted earlier, we continue to see pressure within Middle East, North America. However, efforts are underway to revitalize the businesses in those markets, which continue to be challenged by severely depressed macroeconomic conditions amidst geopolitical turmoil.
So in summary, Tools & Storage continued its strong momentum this quarter, leveraging SFS 2.0 to drive outsized share gains, while preparing for the largest product launch in the company's history. Despite the challenging macro in several regions of the world, we remain highly constructive on the growth and margin prospects for Tools & Storage as we look forward.
Shifting over to Security. Security delivered its second consecutive quarter of organic growth and its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement, highlighting the solid progress this business has made. Total revenues increased 1% on 1% organic growth, while the operating margin rate improved 220 basis points year-over-year to finish at a healthy 12.6% for the quarter, its highest second quarter rate since 2013. 
Europe Security grew 3% organically for the third quarter in a row, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth. And strong performance in the Nordics and Central Europe drove the top line performance and offset mild pressure in the U.K. and France. Order intake was in line with expectations. The unit continues to successfully manage attrition and stabilize the RMR portfolio. Europe Security profitability continues to improve as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to margin growth and rate improvement in the quarter.
North American Security also made progress. Solid organic growth in health care and automatic doors was offset by lower volumes in Electronic Security, or CSS. However, CSS is driving growth in its RMR portfolio with orders and backlog in a healthy position heading into the second half of the year, and attrition is in line with targets. North America also realized margin growth and rate improvement as field efficiency initiatives took hold. In total, Security improved on almost every front, with order rates, backlog and attrition at targeted rates across Europe and North America, and the team is well positioned and motivated to continue driving forward progress.
Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was under some pressure in the quarter as weakness in Engineered Fastening, combined with anticipated pressure in Infrastructure, resulted in the 6% organic decline. Expense deleveraging on lower volume, combined with negative FX, drove a corresponding profit decline, although segment margin continued to be at impressive, well above company line average levels. 
And within Engineered Fastening, the negative growth was overwhelmingly driven by significantly lower-than-expected volume with one major electronics customer. The general industrial business was down modestly, in line with expectations, and the automotive segment remains solid, with fastener growth continuing to outpace light vehicle production around the globe.
Infrastructure was down 11% organically, as a slowdown in offshore Oil & Gas activity, combined with continued weakness in hydraulics end markets, resulted in year-over-year declines. Encouragingly, we see sufficient project activity in our onshore business to enable positive growth for Oil & Gas in the second half of the year. So while Industrial posted an eye-opening negative organic growth number for the quarter, it was caused largely by a decline in sales to one specific electronic fastening customer, partially driven by changing end-user demand and partially driven by our strategic decision to remain disciplined on price. Nonetheless, segment profitability remains strong, although the revenue impact of this situation will be felt for a few quarters until it anniversaries.
So in summary, like all multinational businesses in today's environment of slowing global growth and unprecedented geopolitical volatility and an ever more rapidly increasing pace of technological change, we face ongoing challenges across our businesses in many of the markets we serve. We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it with inorganic growth, expand margins and do it all in a capital-efficient approach. SFS 2.0, with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front. We will soon be back on the acquisition trail, and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. And today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate of 15.8% and $418 million of free cash flow underscores the health and earnings power of the company while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan who will provide a financial update."
304977,370236098,1010853,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million for a year-over-year improvement of $171 million. As you can see, the primary drivers of the outperformance were stronger earnings of $44 million and con",1511,"Thank you, Jim. Let's start with free cash flow for the second quarter, which came in at $418 million for a year-over-year improvement of $171 million. As you can see, the primary drivers of the outperformance were stronger earnings of $44 million and continued improvements in working capital, which generated a positive $58 million of cash in the quarter for a meaningful $108 million of year-over-year improvement. Our working capital turns were 8.2x at the end of Q2, which was a 1.2x improvement versus the prior year second quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, this leaves our free cash flow $256 million ahead of prior year, again with earnings growth and working capital efficiency explaining essentially all of the improvement. As John noted earlier, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at 100% conversion rate. This takes into account the incremental inventory build that we expect to undertake in the second half of the year related to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system launch. Even with this modest headwind to working capital in the second half of 2016, we still plan to end the year at approximately 9.5x for working capital turns.
Moving to the next slide, I want to take a moment to address the potential impact of the U.K.'s EU referendum vote, or Brexit, on our anticipated business results in 2016 and potentially beyond. As you can see on this page, we are expecting to generate somewhere north of $500 million in pound sterling-denominated revenues in the U.K. and more than $1.7 billion in euro-denominated revenues across the Euro region in 2016. To date, we have not seen any meaningful reduction in demand within the U.K. and more broadly in Europe. It is likely too early to speculate on the demand-side impact of Brexit in both the U.K. and the rest of Europe. What I can tell you at this point is that our plans for the second half of the year continue to contemplate roughly low to mid-single-digit growth organically in the European region as we expect our recent share gain momentum to be further augmented by the FLEXVOLT battery system rollout that Jim discussed in detail earlier. As you might expect, we are monitoring this situation very closely and will continue to assess the potential impact as events evolve. We will update all of you accordingly as a more definitive picture materializes.
From a currency perspective, however, we have seen some impact to our operating margin based on the FX movements following the referendum result. At current spot rates for the euro and pound sterling, we see approximately an $8 million additional currency pressure relative to the $140 million of FX headwind we disclosed in our April guidance. The uncertainty created by the U.K.'s decision, both with regards to the mechanics of their exit as well as the future of the European Union as a whole, could result in continued currency-related pressure to our operating margin. 
I'd like to give you an example of that potential impact. If the euro were to go to parity with the U.S. dollar and the pound were to fall to $1.20, the combination of these moves would generate an incremental $12 million of operating margin pressure to earnings in 2016. This is above and beyond the current $8 million of incremental pressure measured at spot rates that I just mentioned. Of course, the longer FX rates hold at current levels, the more muted the impact of any future deterioration will have on 2016 results. I believe this provides an adequate range of the potential worst-case impact for 2016.
On that note, let's move on to Page 14, where we provide an updated view on the net FX impact to the company's operating margin across all currencies. As you can see, net FX headwinds have increased by approximately $10 million to $150 million since our April guidance was issued. This movement is primarily driven by the incremental pound and euro pressures I just mentioned as well as further devaluation of the Argentinian peso and Canadian dollar. These negatives are slightly offset by the appreciation in the Brazilian real, which is up about 7% against the dollar since our April guidance was communicated. 
Finally, I'd like to remind everyone of a statement I made during the April call, where I pointed out that should FX rates again deteriorate in 2016, we have actions and countermeasures at our disposal to maintain our EPS guidance. We continue to have similar plans in place, but as you would expect, the size of the actions we can effectively execute on begins to shrink as the year wears on. As a result, we now have approximately $20 million in contingency plans that can be put into place should they be necessary.
One last point on currency. Our hedging actions are now primarily focused on exposures in 2017 and beyond, and we will continue our practice of locking in portions of our largest exposures, such as the Canadian dollar and the euro, to dampen volatility throughout the year. Based on current spot rates and the existing derivative hedges in place for 2017 volumes, we estimate the carryover impact of currency to be approximately $20 million for 2017.
Let's turn our attention to the next page in our updated 2016 outlook. As John noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising our EPS outlook to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 from the April guidance range of $6.20 to $6.40. The revised range represents a 6% to 10% year-over-year increase in EPS. At the same time, we are reiterating our free cash flow conversion at approximately 100% of net income. As you can see on the left side of the page, this 10% increase across the range is being driven by an increased organic growth estimate for the full year, moving to 4% from approximately 3% to 4%, which generates $0.07 of additional EPS. In addition, we believe $0.10 of our incremental productivity and cost actions will stick for the full year. Embedded in this amount is modest incremental growth costs related to SFS 2.0 initiatives. Specifically, these costs will fund key incremental commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation activities that help drive above-market growth beyond 2016. These 2 positive improvements to guidance are partially offset by $0.07 of increased FX headwinds and onetime new CEO costs. Finally, note that we are providing some color on EPS for 3Q with approximately 25% of the full year EPS expected to be delivered in the third quarter.
Moving to the right-hand side of the page, we get a better sense of the drivers behind the organic growth increase, as Tools & Storage is now projected to grow high single-digits for the year on the great momentum we have seen in the first half, combined with the impact of the pending FLEXVOLT launch. However, some of these gains are being partially offset by our Industrial segment, as we continue to see pressure in the general industrial and electronics businesses, which is now projected to produce low single-digit declines in 2016. The organic growth guidance for the Security segment remains unchanged, with low single-digit growth expected for the full year.
Finally, we expect the Tools & Storage and Security segments to deliver positive year-over-year improvements to their respective operating margin rates. The Industrial segment's operating margin rate will be lower in 2016 versus 2015 as the impact from lower volumes and FX pressure more than offsets the productivity gains and cost actions being taken by the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure business teams. 
In summary, the second quarter was another solid performance for the company as a whole. Despite some additional pressures in our Industrial segment, Tools & Storage delivered an outstanding quarter. And the Security businesses continue to make solid progress and take additional positive steps forward. Organic growth for the quarter finished up 4% and earnings per share were up 19% versus prior year, coming in at $1.84, excellent operating leverage.
On the back of this outperformance, we are raising EPS guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 as we expect the improved organic growth outlook and incremental productivity to more than offset certain pressures.
In June, we introduced the world to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which we expect to revolutionize the construction job site, delivering the power of corded with the freedom of cordless to millions of professionals around the world. 
And finally, we announced the retirement of John as CEO. His tenure has been an era that is characterized by transformational growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Among John's many accomplishments as CEO is the impact he had on building our high-integrity, agile winning business culture across our entire executive leadership team. And as a result, we are well positioned to deliver outsized growth and margin expansion going forward. And we have a highly energized organization, motivated toward achieving these goals. On a personal note, I have appreciated John's mentorship and thank him for his support over the past decade. 
That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Let's move to Q&A."

As we look at the back half, we still see very strong margins. We're certainly not going to see 18.8% at this stage because of some of the reasons that you mentioned. We're also beginning to anniversary the commodity deflation that we've experienced over the last year. That's been a strong benefit for the business and will not be a continued incremental benefit on a go-forward basis. And then FLEXVOLT, as you mentioned, is an area that is an initial pressure point to gross margins as we roll that out. Over time, they will be accretive to gross margins as we get deeper into the launch next year. And then we also have launch costs that are specific to this program that will continue out through the remainder of '16, which means that the gross margins in the back half of the year will be roughly somewhere between the 15.5% to 16.5% range, most likely because of those dynamics. The ongoing margins, however, from an incremental margin perspective, will continue to be healthy and consistent with we've said in the past, that as we see organic growth incrementally, we would expect 30% to 35% drop through in margins, sometimes affected by specific quarter activities where it might be slightly lower if we're making investments or if there's certain types of mix that occurs. But our trend line over the long term for Tools & Storage is still positive. They will likely end the year close to 17% operating margin, if not, slightly over. We'll see how the year progresses. And we would expect that they would continue to improve from that on a go-forward basis."

So John is absolutely correct, that the Security business continues to generate a positive momentum around various initiatives specific to profitability. We've talked about several of them over the last years. So on different occasions, it's driving more efficient field productivity, really kind of streamlining their SG&A to achieve certain objectives over the long term as a percentage of revenue. And they continue to make progress in that regard. And combining that with the fact that they're being much more disciplined around pricing and the new business that they enter into so they ensure the right levels of profitability on new business have allowed us to continue to increase the profitability. And you just see in the first half, we had roughly 12% -- just under 12% profitability in Q1 and then 12.6% in Q2. And we think that's a good indicator of the trend that we'll see in the back half. And for, obviously, the full year, with hopefully that being close to 100 basis point improvement year-over-year in operating margin rate in that business. And the good news is that we're seeing it in all 3 regions. Obviously, emerging markets is relatively small. But in the case of North America and Europe, we're seeing traction in both regions in a significant way, and we see more opportunity for additional upside as we continue this disciplined approach on a go-forward basis. As it relates to specifics to electronics business within Engineered Fastening and Industrial, yes, I think that's a business that we continue to be very disciplined with around pricing, and we're interested in certainly some aspects of that business. But as a result of some of these decisions as well as some of the customer decisions that have been made over the last year, the business has shrunk dramatically and now represents close to $70 million on an annualized basis. And we think for the long term, that's probably a reasonable number, somewhere between $50 million to $70 million. And -- but we'll see where we go from here. But that's kind of how we're viewing the business at this stage."

And so in the back half of the year, we don't expect incremental improvement, and we might even see a little bit of pressure in certain commodities, as you just touched on a couple of them. But we don't expect that to be material in the second half of the year. We have mentioned previously that we had locked into a lot of our commodity-based contracts with certain key vendors earlier this year for the remainder of 2016. So that will clearly probably create a little bit of pressure in 2017. At this stage, we think it's a manageable number, below $25 million for the full year.

Well, the simple one is the second question, which is about 400 basis points of difference at this point in time. And as far as the volume in North America, they've been working really hard on getting their field execution up to a level where the orders and the backlog can be installed efficiently and in a timely fashion. And I'd say the one thing that gives us the ability to be at what we think is an inflection point is the fact that the field has made a lot of progress in North America. So we actually haven't had that much of an issue generating new orders, and we have the ability to go out and generate even more orders. However, we've been throttling that a little bit as the field was sort of a bottleneck. And so that's really the answer, is the reason we're more optimistic about our ability to generate modest growth in Electronic Security in North America is because the field execution is improving and the field capacity is therefore improving. Now just as a side note, there's several components of North America which are doing just fine in terms of growth, including the automatic door business and Mechanical Security. So this is the third leg of the stool, if you will. And once we get that moving in a positive direction, I think we'll be in a similar situation that we are in Europe, where we're generating organic growth on a more consistent basis."

And in fact, we are thinking along the lines that these types of bolt-on RMR acquisitions, basically is what they are, will supplement the installation business in terms of generating RMR. And that one of the keys to success in Electronic Security is to get the RMR portfolio -- that's recurring monthly revenue, for those that are unfamiliar with that term -- but to get that portfolio sequentially increasing every quarter in both of those geographies. And the combination of installation growth and attrition management and small bolt-on acquisitions, we almost think of them as if they were CapEx for growth in the Security business. So you'll continue to see small ones. As far as major acquisitions in Security, no. I don't -- there's nothing on the horizon in the medium term, short to medium term for that. We're actually enjoying working on operational excellence and execution in the business to -- at the customer level. And in particular, to ensure that while all this consolidation is going on in the industry, we are providing the customers with the absolute best value proposition possible.

So the silver lining in the cloud for us is retail inventory -- for us and our customers, retail inventories are at about their lowest levels that they've been in years. But despite that sell-off or decline in inventory, we've been able to grow nicely. And from the customer's perspective, in-stock is as good as it's been.

And clearly, we think FLEXVOLT is going to exceed that, probably exceed it in a very significant way. So as we look at 2016, we've had initially very high demand for the product. We expect, as Jim said, for it to hit the stores in late September, early October. And as a result, I indicated previously that I think we'll probably experience here in 2016 for our -- as a percentage for the total company, about 0.5 point of growth for the -- when you look at the entire year. And so that would be roughly $50 million to $60 million. That number could creep up as we go throughout the fourth quarter and could become closer to 0.75%, so we'll see how that progresses. But that's kind of the range you should look at initially. As we think about 2017, we would expect this to be probably a multi-hundred million-dollar program next year, likely around $200 million. But we'll see as the year progresses and the success of the launch. We think the launch will be very, very successful. What we'd be looking at is the sell-through and how strong the sell-through is in the initial 90 days and how quickly the inventory turns. And we've clearly positioned ourselves through all the things that Jim mentioned around commercial excellence and digital excellence to try to maximize that opportunity."

We, frankly, really began that evaluation in the early parts of this year, with last year more focused on continued improvement of the operational performance across the board, and we're starting to see some of the fruits from that labor. And we had a good discussion at this board meeting, and we will likely have another one in October. Hopefully, that will solidify our discussion and will be able to announce something post-October. But we've looked at, obviously, the 3 options we've discussed previously, which is keeping the entire business, potentially selling or spinning the entire business or divesting a portion of it. And then we specifically had mentioned our mechanical lock business as a potential candidate for that. So we continue to evaluate those. I would say that it's getting very close to the finish line. And I would imagine the next 90 to 120 days, we'll have something very clear to say on that."

Keeping the Security questions going, which is kind of unusual for all these -- after all these years. Looking at the various components of what makes up the Electronic Security side of your business and looking at some of the smaller parts of it that have been added and you've been showing off at trade shows, such as health care and Sonitrol and tracking, things like that, you're talking still about fairly slow growth though, but consistent growth, on the electronic side. Is there going to be a point at which some of these higher-growing areas begin to start affecting the overall growth of Electronic Security, particularly in North America or indeed in Europe, if they begin to add to that as you begin to try to start adding more value and offering more value to your customers out there?"

I -- this industry that we're talking about, the Electronic Security is in very rapid flux right now, as I think most people know. And the IoT, in particular, the cloud, advanced analytics, these types of things are all impacting our industry. In fact, our industry is extremely well positioned to exploit some of those technological advances. And we're working very diligently and aggressively on several verticals, including health care and retail, in particular, in the United States. And in Europe, we're taking a bit of a different approach where we're working more on specific applications and then trying to market those, generally kind of in the $1 million to $5 million annual revenue range, whereas the health care and retail solutions are a little bit higher ticket. The growth from those activities in the higher-end verticals, the real key is to create this recurring revenue business model that will provide superior profitability, and therefore, enable us to get paid for the value. That is definitely something that we've been able to accomplish in health care. And now in health care, we're really investing in significant growth because the next challenge that one faces in these types of verticals is scaling and being able to make those significant investments that enable 10%, 20%, 30% growth. And that's challenging in a business that's in kind of a turnaround profitability mode, but we're going ahead and making some of those investments. In fact, health care is one area where we're doing it, retail's another one here in the States. Now the fundamental growth model in traditional Electronic Security, it's always very challenging to grow it quickly because of the high recurring revenue content of the total revenue base, that -- which means that -- and also, the attrition in the recurring revenue portfolio, which goes back to one of the reasons I think these bolt-on RMR acquisitions are a good idea because it takes some of the pressure off of the installation growth and the attachment of RMR to that installation revenue, and it enables more investment in kind of the high-growth areas. So you will see, over time, an improvement in a more consistent -- in the growth rate -- in a more consistent growth rate coming out of Electronic Security, which is one of the reasons that we like the business because it does have that stable revenue stream once you get it moving in the right direction, and that's what we're really attempting to do right now."

And before we get started, it's with both a sense of accomplishment and admittedly some sadness that we're announcing my retirement today as the CEO of Stanley Black & Decker, effective July 31, 2016. And I say there's some sadness simply because of how much I've enjoyed leading the company and our world-class management team and employees since the first quarter of 2004. But I am pleased to announce that Jim Loree will be succeeding me as Stanley's Chief Executive Officer, and I am extremely confident in the prospects for this organization with Jim at the helm. 
For those of you who followed our company over the last several years, this transition will not come as a surprise. I, in conjunction with our Board of Directors, have always viewed the leadership succession plan to be a top priority to ensure consistency and stability throughout the organization as well as to ensure that we continue to deliver the exceptional shareholder value that our investors have come to expect from this company. And to that end, Jim's uniquely positioned to deliver on each of those things, given his tenure with the company and his role in leading the transformation that we've executed over the last decade or so. 
Furthermore, it's important to note that we have as deep and talented a management team today as we've had at any point during my 12-year tenure with the company. There are strong, competent leaders in place across our various businesses, and we're not anticipating any major changes to the strategy or to the team as a result of this announcement. 
I'll be staying on as Chairman of the Board through the end of the year, and I'll continue as a special adviser to the company through the end of April next year in order to ensure an orderly transition, and of course, to assist the board, Jim and the rest of the management team in any way that I can.
I'm proud of everything the company's accomplished over the last 12-plus years, including compounded annual sales growth of 12% and a total shareholder return of over 300%. And while I've enjoyed my time here immensely, I'm looking forward to the next phase of my career, which will include, among other things, serving on a number of boards as well as continuing my efforts to impact policy in Washington and around the world to create an environment where manufacturing companies like ours can continue to succeed and to prosper.
I'll turn 65 in September. And rather than think of this as going out at the top, I think of it more as a long-distance relay race where we've built a good lead, and I'm passing the baton to a colleague and a management team who are well positioned and fully capable of increasing that lead. And I'm confident that after you listen to this morning's call, you'll share in my belief that our best days still lie ahead of us. 
So let's dive into the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Here are some of the highlights during the second quarter. Organic growth was 4%, total growth was 2%. We had robust organic growth in our Tools & Storage business, 8%. That continues an incredible trend, with Europe leading the way at 14% growth during the quarter. Security was up 1%, as Europe organic growth -- the trend there continues, Europe was up 3% for the quarter. Industrial was off 6%, mainly due to single customer volume pressure in the electronics segment of our Engineered Fastening business and the well-expected lower Infrastructure volume as Oil & Gas and hydraulics remained challenged by the weak energy and scrap steel markets, respectively. 
Our operating margin rate of 15.8% was up 140 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. That is a post-merger record despite significant foreign currency pressure. That was led by Tools & Storage performance, which was up 240 basis points to 18.8%. And Security posted a strong sequential increase to 12.6%, while Industrial declined marginally, but to a very respectable rate of 17%. 
Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.84 was up 19% versus prior year on strong operational performance, along with the lower share count. 
Our DEWALT FLEXVOLT battery system was unveiled in June, delivering the power of corded and the freedom of cordless to professional and consumer end-users worldwide. Some of you have seen the products perform, and you'll have your own well-informed views. But I've participated in several of the major introductions and the words ""game-changing"" have been a common reaction from our customers. The product will hit the shelves in October this year, and Jim will provide you some more detail on our vision to create a cordless job site. 
Given these results, we're raising our 2016 guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50. That's up 6% to 10% versus 2015 and from our prior guidance of $6.20 to $6.40. And concurrently, we're reiterating our free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.
Let's look quickly at the sources of growth. Both volume and price contributed to our growth, which was broad based on a regional basis. During the second quarter, volume was up 3%. We got a positive 1% from price for 4% organic growth. Currency was a 2 percentage point offset for a revenue growth of 2%. All regions contributed positively to the total performance across the company. You see the U.S. up 3%; Europe, up 10%; emerging markets, flat; rest of the world, up 4%; for again, total organic growth of 4% for the quarter and 4% for the first half of the year. Don will show you later that baked into our guidance is an increase in organic growth for the year from a range of 3% to 4% to an estimate of 4%.
There were lots of puts and calls within the emerging market group, volatile markets as you know. But our Latin American group was up 9%, with Mexico up 11% and Argentina up 46%, albeit from a low base. The emerging markets were down in the low-teens. Tools and Security growth was offset by industrial softness in the Engineered Fastening consumer electronics business. But all in all, really strong growth in the quarter.
Let me turn it over to Jim, who's got an update on our game-changing DEWALT FLEXVOLT program as well as some of the details on the segment."

Before that, I just want to thank John for being a trusted colleague and a mentor and a friend, and also for all that John has done for this company and our stakeholders over the years. He and I have enjoyed an outstanding business partnership for over 12 years, teaming up to lead the company through a transformation from a small-cap building products company to a large-cap diversified industrial. It is no coincidence that John's arrival in 2004 marked the beginning of a growth renaissance period for Stanley. And I'm honored to be named as our next CEO, succeeding John, with a mission to lead us through the next stage of our journey. The company has never been stronger with all its well-established global franchises, agile and deep leadership bench and strong and evolving SFS 2.0 operating system. 
Importantly, I want to highlight our world-class management team. This high-performing team to a person is totally dedicated to the success of this company. They have supported me all the way, through both their words and their actions, and have thus enabled us to effect a smooth leadership transition. The impressive results you've seen quarter after quarter from this company are a direct result of this team's experience, commitment and passion for winning. What better way to highlight the immense opportunities present in this next stage of our evolution than to introduce you to the first output from breakthrough innovation, our SFS 2.0 initiative.
The patent-protected DEWALT FLEXVOLT system is the most exciting innovation in the power tool industry since Black & Decker unveiled the first cordless tool in the 1960s. It has the potential to revolutionize the job site. It allows users to switch from 20-volt to 60-volt to the never-before-seen 120 volts of cordless power using the same battery pack, regardless of the voltage rating. These battery packs are completely backwards-compatible with our existing line of DeWalt 20-volt tools. And when used in these products, the FLEXVOLT battery combines with our market-leading brushless motors to provide significant run time and performance advantages. FLEXVOLT will ultimately enable professional users to completely eliminate the cord on the job site, achieving the freedom of cordless while maintaining all the power and flexibility of corded tools. And at the same time, none of our existing user base is left behind as the FLEXVOLT battery packs used on their new 60-volt and 120-volt cordless tools will also enhance the performance of their existing 20-volt products.
FLEXVOLT is being commercialized as part of our SFS 2.0 commercial excellence initiative with the most global, most digitally enabled and most comprehensive marketing campaign in our history. We have already demonstrated the technology in person to over 700 customers around the globe, including major retailers, distributors and other channel partners. We have also introduced and demonstrated the products to the tool subject matter expert blogger community and have created an enormous social media buzz in anticipation of the product's release to the market in October. We have coordinated our digital marketing campaign with our sports marketing assets, and we will be conducting a massive end-user demonstration effort as the summer proceeds. This type of breakthrough innovation, coupled with commercial excellence, will provide significant organic growth runway, even as we comp up against several years of top quartile organic growth among peers. In the near term, we will focus on delivering the end-user's long-held dream of the cordless job site. And over the intermediate to longer term, we will be moving up the power curve, exploiting the rapidly advancing technology of electrification and opening up new markets and growth opportunities.
This tremendous accomplishment within our Tools & Storage business is the first example of the output we expect to deliver from SFS 2.0, our enhanced operating system. We are currently taking the same approach to breakthrough innovation at several other businesses across the company, so stay tuned. 
I encourage all investors to take a deep dive into both FLEXVOLT and SFS 2.0 as they are essential to understanding what this company will deliver in the form of continued organic growth and margin expansion. Our Investor Relations team is ready to assist those that are interested in that regard.
And moving on to 2Q, I'll begin with the Tools & Storage business, which continued its forward momentum, delivering another high single-digit organic growth performance coming in at 8%, and equally as impressively, improving profitability by 240 basis points for a segment profit rate of 18.8%. Total Tools revenue growth was 5% after absorbing a 3 point currency headwind. Organic growth across all regions and SBUs was once again positive. Europe led the way, up 14%; followed by North America, up 7%; and emerging markets, up 4%. The gains in Europe are particularly impressive, given the flat to very low single-digit growth environment in those markets, and they highlight our ability to continue gaining share on the strength of our pervasive commercial excellence activities and new product development initiatives, such as our DC brushless motor products, which exemplify the importance of our very strong core or normal course-of-business innovation. This all-important core innovation activity has been a key source of organic growth and a hallmark of our culture for quite some time. Core innovation provides a solid base for above-market growth, thus enabling SFS 2.0 breakthrough innovations to turbocharge an already strong base.
Moving to global SBU results, Power Tools delivered another double-digit quarter, up 10%, with consistent strength across professional and consumer tools. Hand Tools & Storage posted 2% growth as construction hand tools were up in high single digits, driven by our new line of DeWalt and FatMax measuring lasers, offsetting pressure in Proto Industrial Hand Tools. 
And taking a regional look at the segment, in North America, momentum was good across all major retailers with high single-digit performance from the group. POS data remained very strong and in the mid-teens for the quarter. Ending retailer inventories were in line with or below historical norms.
And turning to Europe, which posted extraordinary 14% organic growth on the heels of 2 years of 7% compounded growth, the outperformance was widespread. Every major underlying market grew organically, with most up double digits, including a noteworthy performance by the U.K. team, which delivered the highest growth in the region. France also showed unusually strong growth, driven by share gains in Professional Power Tools.
And finally, emerging markets were up 4% organically, with Latin America and Asia leading the way, both up in high single digits, more than offsetting continued issues in Middle East and North America, which was down. Latin America continued to overcome a generally distressed market environment. Within Latin America, Argentina and Mexico turned in strong country performances, with growth in our Tradesman segment and continued penetration of our recently introduced Stanley MPP cordless power tools E-commerce and pricing excellence initiatives also contributed to drive growth in the region.
Asia also delivered a notable performance, with good organic growth in China, South Korea and Indonesia. And as I noted earlier, we continue to see pressure within Middle East, North America. However, efforts are underway to revitalize the businesses in those markets, which continue to be challenged by severely depressed macroeconomic conditions amidst geopolitical turmoil.
So in summary, Tools & Storage continued its strong momentum this quarter, leveraging SFS 2.0 to drive outsized share gains, while preparing for the largest product launch in the company's history. Despite the challenging macro in several regions of the world, we remain highly constructive on the growth and margin prospects for Tools & Storage as we look forward.
Shifting over to Security. Security delivered its second consecutive quarter of organic growth and its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement, highlighting the solid progress this business has made. Total revenues increased 1% on 1% organic growth, while the operating margin rate improved 220 basis points year-over-year to finish at a healthy 12.6% for the quarter, its highest second quarter rate since 2013. 
Europe Security grew 3% organically for the third quarter in a row, marking its seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth. And strong performance in the Nordics and Central Europe drove the top line performance and offset mild pressure in the U.K. and France. Order intake was in line with expectations. The unit continues to successfully manage attrition and stabilize the RMR portfolio. Europe Security profitability continues to improve as volume leverage, productivity and cost actions all contributed to margin growth and rate improvement in the quarter.
North American Security also made progress. Solid organic growth in health care and automatic doors was offset by lower volumes in Electronic Security, or CSS. However, CSS is driving growth in its RMR portfolio with orders and backlog in a healthy position heading into the second half of the year, and attrition is in line with targets. North America also realized margin growth and rate improvement as field efficiency initiatives took hold. In total, Security improved on almost every front, with order rates, backlog and attrition at targeted rates across Europe and North America, and the team is well positioned and motivated to continue driving forward progress.
Moving on to Industrial. Industrial revenue was under some pressure in the quarter as weakness in Engineered Fastening, combined with anticipated pressure in Infrastructure, resulted in the 6% organic decline. Expense deleveraging on lower volume, combined with negative FX, drove a corresponding profit decline, although segment margin continued to be at impressive, well above company line average levels. 
And within Engineered Fastening, the negative growth was overwhelmingly driven by significantly lower-than-expected volume with one major electronics customer. The general industrial business was down modestly, in line with expectations, and the automotive segment remains solid, with fastener growth continuing to outpace light vehicle production around the globe.
Infrastructure was down 11% organically, as a slowdown in offshore Oil & Gas activity, combined with continued weakness in hydraulics end markets, resulted in year-over-year declines. Encouragingly, we see sufficient project activity in our onshore business to enable positive growth for Oil & Gas in the second half of the year. So while Industrial posted an eye-opening negative organic growth number for the quarter, it was caused largely by a decline in sales to one specific electronic fastening customer, partially driven by changing end-user demand and partially driven by our strategic decision to remain disciplined on price. Nonetheless, segment profitability remains strong, although the revenue impact of this situation will be felt for a few quarters until it anniversaries.
So in summary, like all multinational businesses in today's environment of slowing global growth and unprecedented geopolitical volatility and an ever more rapidly increasing pace of technological change, we face ongoing challenges across our businesses in many of the markets we serve. We view these challenges as opportunities. Our continuing goal is to achieve outsized organic growth, supplement it with inorganic growth, expand margins and do it all in a capital-efficient approach. SFS 2.0, with its sharp focus on breakthrough innovation, digital excellence and commercial excellence, will continue to enable us to outperform on the organic growth front. We will soon be back on the acquisition trail, and our pipeline is full with solid opportunities to deploy capital to inorganic growth. And today's announcement of 4% organic growth, 19% earnings per share growth, a record operating margin rate of 15.8% and $418 million of free cash flow underscores the health and earnings power of the company while highlighting the strength and agility of our management team. I look forward to leading the company in the coming months and years as we tackle the challenges and opportunities ahead and continue to drive positive momentum.
And with that, I will now turn it over to Don Allan who will provide a financial update."

On a year-to-date basis, this leaves our free cash flow $256 million ahead of prior year, again with earnings growth and working capital efficiency explaining essentially all of the improvement. As John noted earlier, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at 100% conversion rate. This takes into account the incremental inventory build that we expect to undertake in the second half of the year related to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system launch. Even with this modest headwind to working capital in the second half of 2016, we still plan to end the year at approximately 9.5x for working capital turns.
Moving to the next slide, I want to take a moment to address the potential impact of the U.K.'s EU referendum vote, or Brexit, on our anticipated business results in 2016 and potentially beyond. As you can see on this page, we are expecting to generate somewhere north of $500 million in pound sterling-denominated revenues in the U.K. and more than $1.7 billion in euro-denominated revenues across the Euro region in 2016. To date, we have not seen any meaningful reduction in demand within the U.K. and more broadly in Europe. It is likely too early to speculate on the demand-side impact of Brexit in both the U.K. and the rest of Europe. What I can tell you at this point is that our plans for the second half of the year continue to contemplate roughly low to mid-single-digit growth organically in the European region as we expect our recent share gain momentum to be further augmented by the FLEXVOLT battery system rollout that Jim discussed in detail earlier. As you might expect, we are monitoring this situation very closely and will continue to assess the potential impact as events evolve. We will update all of you accordingly as a more definitive picture materializes.
From a currency perspective, however, we have seen some impact to our operating margin based on the FX movements following the referendum result. At current spot rates for the euro and pound sterling, we see approximately an $8 million additional currency pressure relative to the $140 million of FX headwind we disclosed in our April guidance. The uncertainty created by the U.K.'s decision, both with regards to the mechanics of their exit as well as the future of the European Union as a whole, could result in continued currency-related pressure to our operating margin. 
I'd like to give you an example of that potential impact. If the euro were to go to parity with the U.S. dollar and the pound were to fall to $1.20, the combination of these moves would generate an incremental $12 million of operating margin pressure to earnings in 2016. This is above and beyond the current $8 million of incremental pressure measured at spot rates that I just mentioned. Of course, the longer FX rates hold at current levels, the more muted the impact of any future deterioration will have on 2016 results. I believe this provides an adequate range of the potential worst-case impact for 2016.
On that note, let's move on to Page 14, where we provide an updated view on the net FX impact to the company's operating margin across all currencies. As you can see, net FX headwinds have increased by approximately $10 million to $150 million since our April guidance was issued. This movement is primarily driven by the incremental pound and euro pressures I just mentioned as well as further devaluation of the Argentinian peso and Canadian dollar. These negatives are slightly offset by the appreciation in the Brazilian real, which is up about 7% against the dollar since our April guidance was communicated. 
Finally, I'd like to remind everyone of a statement I made during the April call, where I pointed out that should FX rates again deteriorate in 2016, we have actions and countermeasures at our disposal to maintain our EPS guidance. We continue to have similar plans in place, but as you would expect, the size of the actions we can effectively execute on begins to shrink as the year wears on. As a result, we now have approximately $20 million in contingency plans that can be put into place should they be necessary.
One last point on currency. Our hedging actions are now primarily focused on exposures in 2017 and beyond, and we will continue our practice of locking in portions of our largest exposures, such as the Canadian dollar and the euro, to dampen volatility throughout the year. Based on current spot rates and the existing derivative hedges in place for 2017 volumes, we estimate the carryover impact of currency to be approximately $20 million for 2017.
Let's turn our attention to the next page in our updated 2016 outlook. As John noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising our EPS outlook to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 from the April guidance range of $6.20 to $6.40. The revised range represents a 6% to 10% year-over-year increase in EPS. At the same time, we are reiterating our free cash flow conversion at approximately 100% of net income. As you can see on the left side of the page, this 10% increase across the range is being driven by an increased organic growth estimate for the full year, moving to 4% from approximately 3% to 4%, which generates $0.07 of additional EPS. In addition, we believe $0.10 of our incremental productivity and cost actions will stick for the full year. Embedded in this amount is modest incremental growth costs related to SFS 2.0 initiatives. Specifically, these costs will fund key incremental commercial excellence and breakthrough innovation activities that help drive above-market growth beyond 2016. These 2 positive improvements to guidance are partially offset by $0.07 of increased FX headwinds and onetime new CEO costs. Finally, note that we are providing some color on EPS for 3Q with approximately 25% of the full year EPS expected to be delivered in the third quarter.
Moving to the right-hand side of the page, we get a better sense of the drivers behind the organic growth increase, as Tools & Storage is now projected to grow high single-digits for the year on the great momentum we have seen in the first half, combined with the impact of the pending FLEXVOLT launch. However, some of these gains are being partially offset by our Industrial segment, as we continue to see pressure in the general industrial and electronics businesses, which is now projected to produce low single-digit declines in 2016. The organic growth guidance for the Security segment remains unchanged, with low single-digit growth expected for the full year.
Finally, we expect the Tools & Storage and Security segments to deliver positive year-over-year improvements to their respective operating margin rates. The Industrial segment's operating margin rate will be lower in 2016 versus 2015 as the impact from lower volumes and FX pressure more than offsets the productivity gains and cost actions being taken by the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure business teams. 
In summary, the second quarter was another solid performance for the company as a whole. Despite some additional pressures in our Industrial segment, Tools & Storage delivered an outstanding quarter. And the Security businesses continue to make solid progress and take additional positive steps forward. Organic growth for the quarter finished up 4% and earnings per share were up 19% versus prior year, coming in at $1.84, excellent operating leverage.
On the back of this outperformance, we are raising EPS guidance to a range of $6.30 to $6.50 as we expect the improved organic growth outlook and incremental productivity to more than offset certain pressures.
In June, we introduced the world to the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which we expect to revolutionize the construction job site, delivering the power of corded with the freedom of cordless to millions of professionals around the world. 
And finally, we announced the retirement of John as CEO. His tenure has been an era that is characterized by transformational growth and exceptional shareholder returns. Among John's many accomplishments as CEO is the impact he had on building our high-integrity, agile winning business culture across our entire executive leadership team. And as a result, we are well positioned to deliver outsized growth and margin expansion going forward. And we have a highly energized organization, motivated toward achieving these goals. On a personal note, I have appreciated John's mentorship and thank him for his support over the past decade. 
That concludes the presentation portion of the call. Let's move to Q&A."

And then in the back half, we expect that trend to continue as we get over a more difficult comp related to some of the equipment sales that we had in the first half related to the automotive system business.

As we look at the back half, we still see very strong margins. We're certainly not going to see 18.8% at this stage because of some of the reasons that you mentioned. We're also beginning to anniversary the commodity deflation that we've experienced over the last year. That's been a strong benefit for the business and will not be a continued incremental benefit on a go-forward basis. And then FLEXVOLT, as you mentioned, is an area that is an initial pressure point to gross margins as we roll that out. Over time, they will be accretive to gross margins as we get deeper into the launch next year. And then we also have launch costs that are specific to this program that will continue out through the remainder of '16, which means that the gross margins in the back half of the year will be roughly somewhere between the 15.5% to 16.5% range, most likely because of those dynamics. The ongoing margins, however, from an incremental margin perspective, will continue to be healthy and consistent with we've said in the past, that as we see organic growth incrementally, we would expect 30% to 35% drop through in margins, sometimes affected by specific quarter activities where it might be slightly lower if we're making investments or if there's certain types of mix that occurs. But our trend line over the long term for Tools & Storage is still positive. They will likely end the year close to 17% operating margin, if not, slightly over. We'll see how the year progresses. And we would expect that they would continue to improve from that on a go-forward basis."

So John is absolutely correct, that the Security business continues to generate a positive momentum around various initiatives specific to profitability. We've talked about several of them over the last years. So on different occasions, it's driving more efficient field productivity, really kind of streamlining their SG&A to achieve certain objectives over the long term as a percentage of revenue. And they continue to make progress in that regard. And combining that with the fact that they're being much more disciplined around pricing and the new business that they enter into so they ensure the right levels of profitability on new business have allowed us to continue to increase the profitability. And you just see in the first half, we had roughly 12% -- just under 12% profitability in Q1 and then 12.6% in Q2. And we think that's a good indicator of the trend that we'll see in the back half. And for, obviously, the full year, with hopefully that being close to 100 basis point improvement year-over-year in operating margin rate in that business. And the good news is that we're seeing it in all 3 regions. Obviously, emerging markets is relatively small. But in the case of North America and Europe, we're seeing traction in both regions in a significant way, and we see more opportunity for additional upside as we continue this disciplined approach on a go-forward basis. As it relates to specifics to electronics business within Engineered Fastening and Industrial, yes, I think that's a business that we continue to be very disciplined with around pricing, and we're interested in certainly some aspects of that business. But as a result of some of these decisions as well as some of the customer decisions that have been made over the last year, the business has shrunk dramatically and now represents close to $70 million on an annualized basis. And we think for the long term, that's probably a reasonable number, somewhere between $50 million to $70 million. And -- but we'll see where we go from here.

Well, the simple one is the second question, which is about 400 basis points of difference at this point in time. And as far as the volume in North America, they've been working really hard on getting their field execution up to a level where the orders and the backlog can be installed efficiently and in a timely fashion. And I'd say the one thing that gives us the ability to be at what we think is an inflection point is the fact that the field has made a lot of progress in North America. So we actually haven't had that much of an issue generating new orders, and we have the ability to go out and generate even more orders. However, we've been throttling that a little bit as the field was sort of a bottleneck. And so that's really the answer, is the reason we're more optimistic about our ability to generate modest growth in Electronic Security in North America is because the field execution is improving and the field capacity is therefore improving. Now just as a side note, there's several components of North America which are doing just fine in terms of growth, including the automatic door business and Mechanical Security. So this is the third leg of the stool, if you will. And once we get that moving in a positive direction, I think we'll be in a similar situation that we are in Europe, where we're generating organic growth on a more consistent basis."

And in fact, we are thinking along the lines that these types of bolt-on RMR acquisitions, basically is what they are, will supplement the installation business in terms of generating RMR. And that one of the keys to success in Electronic Security is to get the RMR portfolio -- that's recurring monthly revenue, for those that are unfamiliar with that term -- but to get that portfolio sequentially increasing every quarter in both of those geographies. And the combination of installation growth and attrition management and small bolt-on acquisitions, we almost think of them as if they were CapEx for growth in the Security business. So you'll continue to see small ones. As far as major acquisitions in Security, no. I don't -- there's nothing on the horizon in the medium term, short to medium term for that. We're actually enjoying working on operational excellence and execution in the business to -- at the customer level. And in particular, to ensure that while all this consolidation is going on in the industry, we are providing the customers with the absolute best value proposition possible.

So the silver lining in the cloud for us is retail inventory -- for us and our customers, retail inventories are at about their lowest levels that they've been in years. But despite that sell-off or decline in inventory, we've been able to grow nicely. And from the customer's perspective, in-stock is as good as it's been.

And clearly, we think FLEXVOLT is going to exceed that, probably exceed it in a very significant way. So as we look at 2016, we've had initially very high demand for the product. We expect, as Jim said, for it to hit the stores in late September, early October. And as a result, I indicated previously that I think we'll probably experience here in 2016 for our -- as a percentage for the total company, about 0.5 point of growth for the -- when you look at the entire year. And so that would be roughly $50 million to $60 million. That number could creep up as we go throughout the fourth quarter and could become closer to 0.75%, so we'll see how that progresses. But that's kind of the range you should look at initially. As we think about 2017, we would expect this to be probably a multi-hundred million-dollar program next year, likely around $200 million. But we'll see as the year progresses and the success of the launch. We think the launch will be very, very successful. What we'd be looking at is the sell-through and how strong the sell-through is in the initial 90 days and how quickly the inventory turns. And we've clearly positioned ourselves through all the things that Jim mentioned around commercial excellence and digital excellence to try to maximize that opportunity."

I -- this industry that we're talking about, the Electronic Security is in very rapid flux right now, as I think most people know. And the IoT, in particular, the cloud, advanced analytics, these types of things are all impacting our industry. In fact, our industry is extremely well positioned to exploit some of those technological advances. And we're working very diligently and aggressively on several verticals, including health care and retail, in particular, in the United States. And in Europe, we're taking a bit of a different approach where we're working more on specific applications and then trying to market those, generally kind of in the $1 million to $5 million annual revenue range, whereas the health care and retail solutions are a little bit higher ticket. The growth from those activities in the higher-end verticals, the real key is to create this recurring revenue business model that will provide superior profitability, and therefore, enable us to get paid for the value. That is definitely something that we've been able to accomplish in health care. And now in health care, we're really investing in significant growth because the next challenge that one faces in these types of verticals is scaling and being able to make those significant investments that enable 10%, 20%, 30% growth. And that's challenging in a business that's in kind of a turnaround profitability mode, but we're going ahead and making some of those investments. In fact, health care is one area where we're doing it, retail's another one here in the States. Now the fundamental growth model in traditional Electronic Security, it's always very challenging to grow it quickly because of the high recurring revenue content of the total revenue base, that -- which means that -- and also, the attrition in the recurring revenue portfolio, which goes back to one of the reasons I think these bolt-on RMR acquisitions are a good idea because it takes some of the pressure off of the installation growth and the attachment of RMR to that installation revenue, and it enables more investment in kind of the high-growth areas. So you will see, over time, an improvement in a more consistent -- in the growth rate -- in a more consistent growth rate coming out of Electronic Security, which is one of the reasons that we like the business because it does have that stable revenue stream once you get it moving in the right direction, and that's what we're really attempting to do right now."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. In the third quarter, we continued to perform at a high level, delivering modestly above-market organic growth.

In the third quarter, we continued to perform at a high level, delivering modestly above-market organic growth. We also achieved another quarter of margin expansion despite a challenging external backdrop, which included slow global growth, dollar strength and geopolitical and other volatility. 
In a few minutes, Don will provide color on each business segment, but first, here's a few highlights. Total company organic growth was 3% in the quarter, and revenues were up 2% net of currency. Tools & Storage led the way, up 5%, with the European team contributing a remarkable second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, up 11%. 
The Security segment continued to make good progress, up 2% organically, with all regions contributing. The North American business delivered 1 point of organic growth to go along with noteworthy year-to-date margin improvement. Industrial was weighed down by the impact of 1 major electronics customer and, to a lesser extent, by general industrial market conditions. As a result, the segment continued to experience top line contraction, in this case, 4%.  
On a very positive note, total company operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 15.2% as a strong operating performance more than offset the impact of currency headwinds and the cost impact of growth investments. Diluted EPS was $1.68, up 8% year-over-year, on continued revenue growth and solid operating leverage driven by disciplined price management and cost control, productivity gains and commodity deflation, among other factors.  
The third quarter also marked the beginning of the exciting launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, the first breakthrough innovation coming out of SFS 2.0. This introduction has been met with unbridled enthusiasm across our professional customer base. The magnitude of the technological accomplishment in conjunction with the sheer breadth and depth of the marketing campaign has driven strong early momentum. We expect the success of this initiative to continue into the fourth quarter through 2017 and for years to come.  
In fact, the early returns suggest that this will be the largest and most successful power tool product rollout in our company's history. This success will likely enable us to continue our strong Tools & Storage organic growth track record into 2017 despite having to overcome comps from 2014, '15 and '16 averaging 7% annually.  
And finally, I'm pleased to note that we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2016 EPS guidance by $0.05 from $6.40 to $6.45 and tightened the full year EPS range to $6.40 and $6.50. It was previously $6.30 to $6.50.  Don will cover this increase in the midpoint in more detail during his remarks.
Moving over to M&A. As many of you know, on October 12, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase the Newell Tools business, including the Irwin and Lenox brands, from Newell Brands, Inc. I'd like to spend a few minutes sharing some thoughts on this transaction. I'll start by saying that we are very excited by the growth and margin expansion opportunities this deal brings. 
In addition to clearly identified and achievable cost synergies, there is tremendous strategic value here. We see significant opportunities for revenue synergies in both the short term and the long term. 
Opportunities include channel optimization, cross-branding of product lines and geographic expansion. These opportunities are very similar on a somewhat smaller scale to the ones we were so successful in pursuing with regard to Black & Decker, a gift which keeps on giving.  And we are fortunate to have the same tools senior leadership team in place that integrated Black & Decker, and that team is now focused on the Newell business. 
We also really liked the assets. The Lenox and Irwin brands are among the best in their respective categories and are attractive and powerful additions to our portfolio. The product offerings are highly complementary to our existing tools product line and significantly increase the size of our Hand Tools and Power Tools accessories businesses. Newell Tools also extends our channel presence in the plumbing and electrical trades, which are both attractive adjacencies to our legacy core markets.  
You can see a breakdown of revenues by region and product mix as well as by brand on the right-hand side of the page, and this transaction brings top-tier positions globally in both the bandsaw blade and linear edge markets, where the Lenox brand reigns supreme, while also meaningfully bolstering our pliers and accessories product lines, among others.  
And as we noted on the deal announcement call, this transaction marks the end of our nearly 3-year self-imposed M&A moratorium. And over that time, we significantly strengthened the foundation of our core businesses; implemented a new enhanced operating system, SFS 2.0; drove gains in organic growth and margin expansion while advancing our incremental and breakthrough innovation processes, all of which position the company for strong performance over the last few years and into the future. And I'm pleased that our first acquisition after this break is a business that lines up so well with our strategic growth framework and our core competencies. 
In line with that framework and our financial criteria, we expect EPS to be accretive year 1, delivering $0.15 a share and growing to at least $0.50 a share in year 3, both on an ex-charges basis. The transition and integration planning is now underway, with closing expected some time in 2017, most likely in the first half. 
And at this point, I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who will cover more detail on segment performance as well as provide the financial update. Don?"

We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segments. As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth, u",2125,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segments. 
As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth, up  5%, as we saw continued significant share gains in Europe, which was up 11% and a solid performance in North America, which grew at 4%. The emerging markets were up modestly in the quarter as declines in the Middle East and Northern Africa offset mid- to high single-digit growth in Latin America and Asia. Over the last few quarters, we have been adding commercial and leadership resources to the Middle East and North Africa team and expect that business to swing back to the positive organic growth trajectory in the coming year.
In North America, share gains were driven by U.S. retail, up high single digit, despite inventory reductions by certain retail partners. And we had a very strong performance in Canada, also up high single digit. In the aggregate, this strong performance more than offset persistent weakness in the North American industrial tool channel. Within our U.S. retail channels, POS remained healthy and excitement around the FLEXVOLT launch had lapped the expectations, leading this product line on track to deliver on our 2016 revenue expectation.  
We have talked quite a bit over the last few quarters about how an incredible technological accomplishment the tools team has been able to deliver with this new product platform, developing FLEXVOLT from scratch through our breakthrough innovation process and driving it from concept to store shelves in just under 2 years.  But I also wanted to highlight how proud we are of the commercial team's efforts in coordinating this rollout, which was the first and largest global product launch in our company's 170-plus-year history. The excitement and enthusiasm that they have been able to generate globally while, no doubt, aided by the unparalleled technological accomplishment of this product has nonetheless been simply extraordinary. This launch also serves as a perfect example of how the digital and commercial excellence pillars of SFS 2.0 combine with and enhance the breakthrough and incremental innovation processes, compounding our engineering achievements through superior marketing, targeting and commercial effort and paving the way for significant organic growth opportunities.
The European team continued their commercialization efforts throughout the region to drive tremendous share gains once again. When you consider the third quarter's impressive 11% organic growth against the backdrop of a 14% gain in the second quarter and high single-digit organic growth in 2014 and 2015, the magnitude of this achievement comes into focus and is truly extraordinary. Gains continued to be widespread throughout the region within the U.K., France and Central Europe, all delivering strong performances from new product development, growth investments and an ever-increasing retail footprint.
Turning to the SBUs. Power Tools were up 8% on the back of the FLEXVOLT launch and commercial successes that I just discussed. While the Hand Tools & Storage business declined by 3% as pressure in the industrial tool channel more than offset growth in Mac Tools and strong performances in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. From a profitability perspective, the tools business continues to impress, expanding its operating margin 70 basis points in the quarter and delivering $330 million of operating profit.  These results were achieved despite continued currency pressure and while balancing growth-related investments, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive operating leverage as we grow. 
And I'll just make one final comment on the Tools & Storage business. When you think about the results the team delivered over the last few years in this challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, you can understand more clearly why we are so excited about the Newell Tools acquisition. There is a significant value-creation opportunity presented by folding these powerful brands and high-quality products into our best-in-class Tools & Storage operation.
Moving on to Security. The segment delivered its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, up 2%, with all regions contributing. As Jim mentioned, North America posted its first quarter of growth since Q2 of 2015, led by higher volume within the Commercial Electronic Security and automatic door businesses. It is very encouraging to see the North American team combine the field productivity and profitability improvements they have made over the last few years with budding organic growth as the business continues to progress forward.  
In the Europe, the team continued its organic growth trend of close to 1.5 points in the quarter, making this the eighth consecutive quarter of organic growth. Higher installation volume and a strong performance in the Nordics and Germany helped to drive top line growth and offset the pressure that we've seen in the U.K., where we are continuing to see some negative impacts on CapEx spend and commercial decisions relating to Brexit. We also saw organic growth from Security's emerging markets operation, a positive sign for this relatively small portion of the segment.
Margins in the Security segment continued to improve, up 180 basis points in the quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by the North American team's continuous success with its field efficiency and productivity efforts as well as continued focus on tight controls over SG&A across the entire segment. Margins were also favorably influenced by more intense rigor over the profitability requirements of our commercial opportunities that we implemented in the past year, the benefits of which we are now beginning to see within our operating margin rate as backlog orders are converting to revenue.
Let's move to the Industrial segment. Revenues were down in the quarter, as anticipated, on the impact of 1 large electronics customer, and still weak industrial market conditions adversely impacted Engineered Fastening volume. This decline more than offset the mid-single-digit growth in Infrastructure, resulting in an overall 4% organic decline for the segment. Within Engineered Fastening, the organic revenue decline was largely expected. However, the global automotive business continued to perform well with solid growth in Europe and Asia, which outpaced light vehicle production. This growth more than offset some slowness that we've experienced in the North American automotive business in Q3.
The impact associated with the volume declines tied to 1 large electronics customer had a significant impact on Engineered Fastening as well as the overall segment's organic growth for the quarter. If you exclude this impact, Engineered Fastening's organic growth would have been slightly positive and the Industrial segment's organic growth would have been 1% for the quarter. 
Infrastructure posted organic growth of 5%, driven by higher Oil & Gas onshore project activity, which more than offset continued weakness in the Hydraulic Tool business. However, that's beginning to show some signs of stabilizing. Finally, while profitability in the Industrial segment declined by 40 basis points year-over-year, the segment still managed to achieve a very healthy 17.4% OM rate as a result of significant productivity gains and cost-control actions, which managed to largely offset the negative margin impact from the top line decline.
So let's move to Slide 7 and talk about our free cash flow, which came in at $169 million for the third quarter, in line with our prior year performance. The year-over-year improvement in net income of $21 million was offset by a slightly larger expansion in working capital and a higher capital -- CapEx investment of $10 million each. However, and very importantly, working capital turns in the quarter improved by 0.7 turns to 7.1x as the slight increase in working capital dollars covered a greater year-over-year revenue base.  
Year-to-date free cash flow performance remains very strong, coming in at $428 million through the third quarter as high earnings, combined with significantly lower expansion in working capital of approximately $200 million, have absorbed $42 million of additional CapEx investments to deliver a solid $254 million outperformance versus the prior year. The working capital discipline has been particularly impressive given the strong organic growth we have seen throughout 2016, not to mention the inventory build related to the FLEXVOLT launch, which commenced in Q3.  
Based on our year-to-date performance, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at approximately 100% conversion rate. As in the past, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter on the back of solid earnings growth and the seasonal working capital liquidations we experience within our Tools & Storage business.
So let's shift to guidance on Slide 8. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance and tightening the range, $6.40 to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. The revised range represents an 8% to 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share. This raise is our third in as many quarters for 2016 and is representative of the continued strong performance by Tools & Storage and solid improvement in our Security segment profitability profile. These outperformances have more than offset a difficult performance in our Industrial segment.
As you can see on the left side of the chart, the $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our guidance is driven by improved operating performance, primarily within Tools & Storage. These improvements relate to continued indirect cost controls and slightly higher levels of cost productivity than originally estimated. Please note that this guidance does exclude any potential acquisition costs, which could occur in the fourth quarter, related to the Newell Tools deal. 
Let's shift to the segment outlook on the page. Tools & Storage is still expected to generate high single-digit growth for the full year as we see continued share gains across the globe, combined with the FLEXVOLT launch in the second half of 2016. We are still estimating the revenue impact of FLEXVOLT to be slightly under $100 million in 2016.  
Security is expected to grow low single digits as momentum in North America and emerging markets offset some modest pressure we are seeing in Europe related primarily to Brexit dynamics within the U.K., which is impacting certain large financial customers. 
Finally, we now expect a mid-single-digit full year decline in industrial revenue as our Engineered Fastening business continues to work through the lost revenue from the previously mentioned major electronics customer, which, by the way, will anniversary in Q4. And additionally, they experienced market-driven headwinds within the general industrial business. Another set of factors to be aware of in Industrial is that we expect the North American automotive business to reflect the slowing market as we end 2016, combined with a weak Oil & Gas pipeline construction market in Q4.
Turning to operating margin rate. All segments remain in line with previous expectations as Tools & Storage and Security's profitability improves year-over-year and the Industrial segment declines, driven by top line contraction.  Our operating performance in 2016 has been strong, with EPS growth expected to be 8% to 10% despite absorbing another year of significant currency headwinds, which total $150 million or approximately $0.75 of earnings per share. We are very pleased with the team's performance to date and now are squarely focused on wrapping up a great year, highlighted by a strong performance on both organic revenue and earnings growth.
In summary, the third quarter was another solid performance for the company as organic growth finished up 3% and earnings per share up 8% versus the prior year. Tools & Storage delivered another outstanding performance. Likewise, the Security segment continues to progress, driving both organic growth and margin rate expansion. Based on this quarter's performance -- or outperformance that is, we are raising the midpoint of and tightening the EPS guidance range to $6.40 up to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. 
The third quarter marked the anxiously awaited launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which was met with tremendous excitement from professionals, tradesmen and tool enthusiasts around the world, our first of what we believe will be many successful breakthrough innovations in the future. On October 12, we ended our nearly 3-year self-imposed BD moratorium with the announcement of our agreement to acquire the Newell Tools business, including the iconic Lenox and solid Irwin brands, a highly strategic and financially attractive transaction. Lastly, we are continuing with our review of the Security business. As we have previously noted, we expect to provide an update at some point during the fourth quarter reporting period.
There are a number of exciting things happening at Stanley Black & Decker today. The opportunities presented by the FLEXVOLT launch and Newell Tools transaction are significant and robust as we look ahead into 2017, we remain committed to delivering solid organic growth and EPS operating leverage, consistent with our 3-year annual financial objectives previously communicated. 
That concludes the presentation portion of today's call, so now let's move to Q&A."

As far as M&A goes, we're -- historically, if we go back 15 years or so and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A. And the other 50%",280,"Okay. Well, I'll start. It's Jim. As far as M&A goes, we're -- historically, if we go back 15 years or so and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A. And the other 50%, we've given back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. And during that time frame, we more than quintupled the size of the company and gave back a lot of cash along the way, and returns to shareholders were very, very solid, 400%, 500% over that time frame. So we like that formula. And we -- when we took the break, it really was an opportunity to digest many of the acquisitions that we did over that time frame, and now we're back. And we intend to kind of continue with that 50% allocation of excess capital to M&A, and it's not an organizational bandwidth issue. I think Newell, despite its relatively significant size, is a -- really a bolt-on acquisition for the tool business. So  I'm not underestimating the importance of getting that integration right at all. It's a top priority for us, but there are other businesses in the portfolio and there's also some other activity going on in the tool industry that might lead to further consolidation, which we would intend to be a part of. So we'll do more deals as we go forward, and it will be a contributor to our growth. We expect our organic growth to be 4% to 6% over a long period of -- long term, and we expect acquisitions to contribute another 5%, 6% annually above that."

And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our view of '17.

And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our view of '17. I mean, maybe what I can do is build upon my comment at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to '17. As I presented back in the -- our Investor Day in May of 2015, we gave kind of a 3-year perspective. Annual objectives for 3 years was basically what it was. And we said organic growth at a profile of 4% to 6%. Organic EPS growth would be 6% to 8%, so really demonstrating that operating leverage. And then, obviously, acquisitions, we presented something in excess of 10% EPS growth if you included acquisitions. The -- our thoughts right now is that we think we're in that range. We're probably, on the organic growth side, at the low end of the range, which should be similar to the profile that we've experienced during 2016, around 4%. We think that's probably a good proxy at this stage for next year. And then the EPS number is probably in that -- around that midpoint of that range I just mentioned at this stage. The other thing to keep in mind is that as you start to look at the different segments for organic growth in particular, our tools business will probably grow about 7% this year by the time the year is done. Our Security business will be around 1% organic growth, and we'll see mid-single-digit decline in industrial. Keeping in mind industrial does have that kind of difficult confidence in dealing with a major customer, if you exclude that impact, it was probably down about 2% [indiscernible]. I think that's a good framework, frankly, for next year with maybe tools being a little bit lower from that 7%, but we'll see how positive the impact of FlexVolt is. It's still early days, but as Jim mentioned, it's very positive at this stage. So we'll see if it's a little bit higher than our expectation. We previously communicated that we think it will be $200 million roughly of revenue next year. And the one factor we don't know yet is the cannibalization impact. And then the other 2 segments, I think, you'll see 1% or 2% growth probably in security and a modest decline, most likely industrial continuing as probably work through to continued difficult industrial market. I think that's a good framework to start with, and we'll see how the year ends. We haven't provided specific input around currency and commodities, but at this point, based on current rates, currency is probably you get $20 million to $30 million pressure next year and commodities is probably a similar amount at this stage. So we don't see that as a major headwind going into 2017, which is why we still think we can achieve reasonable operating leverage."

And as Don said, we'll be in the $100 million range for the 4 months of September through December, which meets our expectations. And I'd say there's probably more customer demand growing as we fill the channel and they start to see the early signs of their end user pull. And so we're expecting a pretty good growth as we go into 2017, as Don mentioned. And as far as the margin elements, I'll have Don, you can tackle that one."

That's going to continue most likely into the first quarter. We don't see that as a major pressure point. As you see, the business had 17.4% margins in the third quarter, very strong and up 70 basis points year-over-year. And so we don't see that as a major drag, but it certainly -- when you look at it sequentially versus Q2 as an example, it's one of the reasons why we're at 17.4% versus 18.8% in the second quarter. So as we enter the back half of next year, margins will regulate and get to [indiscernible] averages or above which FlexVolt product category."

Oil & Gas, you've alluded that, that tends to weaken in 4Q, hydraulics you said si stabilizing and your Apple is forecasting growth in 4Q. So I was wondering whether you can give us a little bit of a road map on how you see the moving parts for industrial tracking into 4Q and '17?"

Those comments that I made we're not factoring any decision related to Security because obviously, there's different things that are being evaluated. However, if you look at the 3 opt",440,"Yes, so let me start with thoughts about '17 as it related to Security. Those comments that I made we're not factoring any decision related to Security because obviously, there's different things that are being evaluated. However, if you look at the 3 options we've discussed, one is obviously keeping the business, which would have no impact. Second option was to do something with the entire Security business, which is obviously have a significant impact to what I described; and then the third option was an evaluation of our mechanical lock business in determining potential divestiture of that. If that business -- if that was a choice that we chose, then there would be, I would say, a modest dilutive impact to that. However, the proceeds of the money we receive could partially be used to do a buyback to minimize that dilution. So our view is we don't think, under that scenario, we don't think we would have a large impact on the numbers that I described. So that gives you a little bit of framework on our thoughts there. On the kind of industrial breakdown, you said Apple had broke the fourth quarter, I think you're referring Apple the company, not our business, but we're not projecting growth in our business, so that's probably part of your question. But what I said was that we are seeing -- we saw slowing in the North American auto business in the third quarter. We expect that to continue as we're starting to see, especially with the big 4, a little lighter production schedule for the fourth quarter. So we're going to probably continue to see pressure there. The current projections for next year for light vehicle production are still positive, although they're very modest, with just over 0.5% year-over-year. So North America right now appears to be a modest growth number for light vehicle production, which we intend now to [indiscernible], but we have to watch that very closely as the year ends. Looking at Oil & Gas, it is weakening, and it's weakening primarily because there's a large project in the Dakotas of the U.S. that has been dealing with protesters and other activities that have shut down a lot of that pipeline construction. And that has impacted us modestly in Q3, but we see that as a larger impact in Q4. And so those are 2 factors that we're seeing in Q4 that are creating our view of guidance and why we have not raised our guidance beyond the $0.05 kind of drop through of what we outperformed or the large part of what we outperformed in Q3."

And so we will buy small bolt-on acquisitions, typically in the $20 million to $50 million kind of range. It's almost like CapEx, it's a bit of a steady-state, but it helps supplement the recurring revenue growth because as you can imagine, when you have a recurring revenue portfolio and there's attrition in the 7% to 12% range, depending on the type of portfolio, that you have to originate all that just to keep the recurring revenue portfolio even. And then you have to originate more to grow the recurring revenue portfolio. So growing the recurring revenue portfolio is assisted by supplementing it with small acquisitions, but it's really not a very material amount of money to the overall corporation that we're spending on them."

And then there's what I would say the normal ongoing activity that we do in our businesses and have been doing for quite some time, which is around what I typically call surgical or strategic pricing actions, which is really looking at different products, different product categories, looking at the competitive pricing dynamics, look at the value proposition and the differentiation we might have in these categories, and then really setting a pricing that we think is more appropriate for the value that we provide to the consumer and the customer. And we've been doing that, we continue to do that, and that's something that I think even in a modest commodity inflation environment next year, and it will be modest, remember my comments we're not -- our expectations are that this is not something that's going to be a significant commodity inflation market, I just don't think the demand is there to really stimulate that type of activity. But that being said, these surgical marketing or pricing approaches are things that we will continue to do. And so although we'll probably see a little bit of price pressure here and there on certain products or because of what we experienced with commodity this year, having a modest inflationary environment actually is helpful when you're having some of these surgical pricing conditions."

So an interesting walk around them, Latin America, which is pretty significantly over-indexed for us, and has been pretty difficult over the last few years for reasons that relate mostly to political instability and also commodity bust and the impact that had on those markets, and of course, the effects that came, along with those problems, the currency pressures, but in any event, what we see in Latin America in general is some pretty positive indications, nothing robust at this point in time. But I -- if I were betting, I would bet that the Latin American markets are going to be in general better in 2017 than they have been in recent years, in the sense that Argentina, with [indiscernible] and some of his reforms are starting to take route, and then you have the long drawn out Brazilian political drama with the scandals and so forth that have unseated leader and that all is going to I think of ultimately result in more stability and more reforms as we go forward. And then some of the traditional stronger, the ones that have been traditionally stronger in recent years such as Mexico will probably continue to chug along at the rate that they have been. Don't see any major dislocation there. And then as commodities have stabilized, the Western countries in Latin America like Chile and Peru have seem to have stabilized as well. So on balance, I think the Latin America -- Latin American situation is pretty bright for us as we go forward. The -- if we move over to Asia, the non-Chinese developing markets in Asia in general are stable to slightly positive. China is a big question mark. We don't have a tremendous amount of volume in China, but the market itself is very questionable, I think, right now. Hard to really believe the data that comes out related to GDP, and what we see is industrial is very weak in China and we see no real reason to become bullish on industrial in China, so it's quite negative. And sooner or later, I think the chickens may come home to roost in terms of the reality in China would be my guess. And so -- and then we just take some of the other countries like Russia. That's pretty much a crapshoot in terms of what's going to happen there. Comps are very easy right now in terms of as we go forward, but then again, what does the future portend? I think the political situation there is very questionable. And then the same is true as you get into Turkey and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. And so that's -- in India, again, we don't have much in India, but India is a good place to be in right now from an economic perspective. So hopefully that's helpful."

And so we've been able to fill that white space and put forth different products. The other item that I did mention was also putting the Stanley FatMax brand on mid-price point Power Tools in Europe. So that was another opportunity that was leveraging the effect of synergies of the 2 companies, and Europe is probably the best example and then maybe emerging markets after that of a combination of the revenue synergies from the merger and then the great benefits that we're starting to see in the first couple of years from SFS 2.0."

Europe made great progress over the last few years but now Europe's kind of hitting the threshold of being close to 10% profitability and then taking in the next up, which is closer to the low to mid-teens, that's hard to work and it takes more effort and we also have to have a continued top line organic growth performance to get some leverage effect as well. But I think each region has made great progress. The Europe journey, the improvement that's been going on a little bit longer than North America. But I still see, at this point, we're probably going to end the year close to 13% profitability for the segment, probably just under 13%. And at this stage, we still see a path for it to get to close to 15% as we communicated back in our Investor Day in May of '15. And we're probably 2 to 3 years away from achieving that objective because we're continuing to do a lot of heavy lifting and one of the value proposition items that we see in electronic security is the ability to really differentiate the customer service, and that's what the team has been focused on for the last year or 2.

And at that point, we've seen it begin to drop sequentially higher, and where we stand on weeks of sale in total is the weeks of sale our substantially lower right now than they were last year. And I think part of that has to do with good sell-through in increasing sell-through maybe even beating expectations of the retailers.

304977,403612733,1062985,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Greg.

In the third quarter, we continued to perform at a high level, delivering modestly above-market organic growth. We also achieved another quarter of margin expansion despite a challenging external backdrop, which included slow global growth, dollar strength and geopolitical and other volatility. 
In a few minutes, Don will provide color on each business segment, but first, here's a few highlights. Total company organic growth was 3% in the quarter, and revenues were up 2% net of currency. Tools & Storage led the way, up 5%, with the European team contributing a remarkable second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, up 11%. 
The Security segment continued to make good progress, up 2% organically, with all regions contributing. The North American business delivered 1 point of organic growth to go along with noteworthy year-to-date margin improvement. Industrial was weighed down by the impact of 1 major electronics customer and, to a lesser extent, by general industrial market conditions. As a result, the segment continued to experience top line contraction, in this case, 4%.  
On a very positive note, total company operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 15.2% as a strong operating performance more than offset the impact of currency headwinds and the cost impact of growth investments. Diluted EPS was $1.68, up 8% year-over-year, on continued revenue growth and solid operating leverage driven by disciplined price management and cost control, productivity gains and commodity deflation, among other factors.  
The third quarter also marked the beginning of the exciting launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, the first breakthrough innovation coming out of SFS 2.0. This introduction has been met with unbridled enthusiasm across our professional customer base. The magnitude of the technological accomplishment in conjunction with the sheer breadth and depth of the marketing campaign has driven strong early momentum. We expect the success of this initiative to continue into the fourth quarter through 2017 and for years to come.  
In fact, the early returns suggest that this will be the largest and most successful power tool product rollout in our company's history. This success will likely enable us to continue our strong Tools & Storage organic growth track record into 2017 despite having to overcome comps from 2014, '15 and '16 averaging 7% annually.  
And finally, I'm pleased to note that we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2016 EPS guidance by $0.05 from $6.40 to $6.45 and tightened the full year EPS range to $6.40 and $6.50. It was previously $6.30 to $6.50.  Don will cover this increase in the midpoint in more detail during his remarks.
Moving over to M&A. As many of you know, on October 12, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase the Newell Tools business, including the Irwin and Lenox brands, from Newell Brands, Inc. I'd like to spend a few minutes sharing some thoughts on this transaction. I'll start by saying that we are very excited by the growth and margin expansion opportunities this deal brings. 
In addition to clearly identified and achievable cost synergies, there is tremendous strategic value here. We see significant opportunities for revenue synergies in both the short term and the long term. 
Opportunities include channel optimization, cross-branding of product lines and geographic expansion. These opportunities are very similar on a somewhat smaller scale to the ones we were so successful in pursuing with regard to Black & Decker, a gift which keeps on giving.  And we are fortunate to have the same tools senior leadership team in place that integrated Black & Decker, and that team is now focused on the Newell business. 
We also really liked the assets. The Lenox and Irwin brands are among the best in their respective categories and are attractive and powerful additions to our portfolio. The product offerings are highly complementary to our existing tools product line and significantly increase the size of our Hand Tools and Power Tools accessories businesses. Newell Tools also extends our channel presence in the plumbing and electrical trades, which are both attractive adjacencies to our legacy core markets.  
You can see a breakdown of revenues by region and product mix as well as by brand on the right-hand side of the page, and this transaction brings top-tier positions globally in both the bandsaw blade and linear edge markets, where the Lenox brand reigns supreme, while also meaningfully bolstering our pliers and accessories product lines, among others.  
And as we noted on the deal announcement call, this transaction marks the end of our nearly 3-year self-imposed M&A moratorium. And over that time, we significantly strengthened the foundation of our core businesses; implemented a new enhanced operating system, SFS 2.0; drove gains in organic growth and margin expansion while advancing our incremental and breakthrough innovation processes, all of which position the company for strong performance over the last few years and into the future. And I'm pleased that our first acquisition after this break is a business that lines up so well with our strategic growth framework and our core competencies. 
In line with that framework and our financial criteria, we expect EPS to be accretive year 1, delivering $0.15 a share and growing to at least $0.50 a share in year 3, both on an ex-charges basis. The transition and integration planning is now underway, with closing expected some time in 2017, most likely in the first half. 
And at this point, I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who will cover more detail on segment performance as well as provide the financial update. Don?"

We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segments. As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth, u",2125,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segments. 
As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth, up  5%, as we saw continued significant share gains in Europe, which was up 11% and a solid performance in North America, which grew at 4%. The emerging markets were up modestly in the quarter as declines in the Middle East and Northern Africa offset mid- to high single-digit growth in Latin America and Asia. Over the last few quarters, we have been adding commercial and leadership resources to the Middle East and North Africa team and expect that business to swing back to the positive organic growth trajectory in the coming year.
In North America, share gains were driven by U.S. retail, up high single digit, despite inventory reductions by certain retail partners. And we had a very strong performance in Canada, also up high single digit. In the aggregate, this strong performance more than offset persistent weakness in the North American industrial tool channel. Within our U.S. retail channels, POS remained healthy and excitement around the FLEXVOLT launch had lapped the expectations, leading this product line on track to deliver on our 2016 revenue expectation.  
We have talked quite a bit over the last few quarters about how an incredible technological accomplishment the tools team has been able to deliver with this new product platform, developing FLEXVOLT from scratch through our breakthrough innovation process and driving it from concept to store shelves in just under 2 years.  But I also wanted to highlight how proud we are of the commercial team's efforts in coordinating this rollout, which was the first and largest global product launch in our company's 170-plus-year history. The excitement and enthusiasm that they have been able to generate globally while, no doubt, aided by the unparalleled technological accomplishment of this product has nonetheless been simply extraordinary. This launch also serves as a perfect example of how the digital and commercial excellence pillars of SFS 2.0 combine with and enhance the breakthrough and incremental innovation processes, compounding our engineering achievements through superior marketing, targeting and commercial effort and paving the way for significant organic growth opportunities.
The European team continued their commercialization efforts throughout the region to drive tremendous share gains once again. When you consider the third quarter's impressive 11% organic growth against the backdrop of a 14% gain in the second quarter and high single-digit organic growth in 2014 and 2015, the magnitude of this achievement comes into focus and is truly extraordinary. Gains continued to be widespread throughout the region within the U.K., France and Central Europe, all delivering strong performances from new product development, growth investments and an ever-increasing retail footprint.
Turning to the SBUs. Power Tools were up 8% on the back of the FLEXVOLT launch and commercial successes that I just discussed. While the Hand Tools & Storage business declined by 3% as pressure in the industrial tool channel more than offset growth in Mac Tools and strong performances in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. From a profitability perspective, the tools business continues to impress, expanding its operating margin 70 basis points in the quarter and delivering $330 million of operating profit.  These results were achieved despite continued currency pressure and while balancing growth-related investments, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive operating leverage as we grow. 
And I'll just make one final comment on the Tools & Storage business. When you think about the results the team delivered over the last few years in this challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, you can understand more clearly why we are so excited about the Newell Tools acquisition. There is a significant value-creation opportunity presented by folding these powerful brands and high-quality products into our best-in-class Tools & Storage operation.
Moving on to Security. The segment delivered its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, up 2%, with all regions contributing. As Jim mentioned, North America posted its first quarter of growth since Q2 of 2015, led by higher volume within the Commercial Electronic Security and automatic door businesses. It is very encouraging to see the North American team combine the field productivity and profitability improvements they have made over the last few years with budding organic growth as the business continues to progress forward.  
In the Europe, the team continued its organic growth trend of close to 1.5 points in the quarter, making this the eighth consecutive quarter of organic growth. Higher installation volume and a strong performance in the Nordics and Germany helped to drive top line growth and offset the pressure that we've seen in the U.K., where we are continuing to see some negative impacts on CapEx spend and commercial decisions relating to Brexit. We also saw organic growth from Security's emerging markets operation, a positive sign for this relatively small portion of the segment.
Margins in the Security segment continued to improve, up 180 basis points in the quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by the North American team's continuous success with its field efficiency and productivity efforts as well as continued focus on tight controls over SG&A across the entire segment. Margins were also favorably influenced by more intense rigor over the profitability requirements of our commercial opportunities that we implemented in the past year, the benefits of which we are now beginning to see within our operating margin rate as backlog orders are converting to revenue.
Let's move to the Industrial segment. Revenues were down in the quarter, as anticipated, on the impact of 1 large electronics customer, and still weak industrial market conditions adversely impacted Engineered Fastening volume. This decline more than offset the mid-single-digit growth in Infrastructure, resulting in an overall 4% organic decline for the segment. Within Engineered Fastening, the organic revenue decline was largely expected. However, the global automotive business continued to perform well with solid growth in Europe and Asia, which outpaced light vehicle production. This growth more than offset some slowness that we've experienced in the North American automotive business in Q3.
The impact associated with the volume declines tied to 1 large electronics customer had a significant impact on Engineered Fastening as well as the overall segment's organic growth for the quarter. If you exclude this impact, Engineered Fastening's organic growth would have been slightly positive and the Industrial segment's organic growth would have been 1% for the quarter. 
Infrastructure posted organic growth of 5%, driven by higher Oil & Gas onshore project activity, which more than offset continued weakness in the Hydraulic Tool business. However, that's beginning to show some signs of stabilizing. Finally, while profitability in the Industrial segment declined by 40 basis points year-over-year, the segment still managed to achieve a very healthy 17.4% OM rate as a result of significant productivity gains and cost-control actions, which managed to largely offset the negative margin impact from the top line decline.
So let's move to Slide 7 and talk about our free cash flow, which came in at $169 million for the third quarter, in line with our prior year performance. The year-over-year improvement in net income of $21 million was offset by a slightly larger expansion in working capital and a higher capital -- CapEx investment of $10 million each. However, and very importantly, working capital turns in the quarter improved by 0.7 turns to 7.1x as the slight increase in working capital dollars covered a greater year-over-year revenue base.  
Year-to-date free cash flow performance remains very strong, coming in at $428 million through the third quarter as high earnings, combined with significantly lower expansion in working capital of approximately $200 million, have absorbed $42 million of additional CapEx investments to deliver a solid $254 million outperformance versus the prior year. The working capital discipline has been particularly impressive given the strong organic growth we have seen throughout 2016, not to mention the inventory build related to the FLEXVOLT launch, which commenced in Q3.  
Based on our year-to-date performance, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at approximately 100% conversion rate. As in the past, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter on the back of solid earnings growth and the seasonal working capital liquidations we experience within our Tools & Storage business.
So let's shift to guidance on Slide 8. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance and tightening the range, $6.40 to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. The revised range represents an 8% to 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share. This raise is our third in as many quarters for 2016 and is representative of the continued strong performance by Tools & Storage and solid improvement in our Security segment profitability profile. These outperformances have more than offset a difficult performance in our Industrial segment.
As you can see on the left side of the chart, the $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our guidance is driven by improved operating performance, primarily within Tools & Storage. These improvements relate to continued indirect cost controls and slightly higher levels of cost productivity than originally estimated. Please note that this guidance does exclude any potential acquisition costs, which could occur in the fourth quarter, related to the Newell Tools deal. 
Let's shift to the segment outlook on the page. Tools & Storage is still expected to generate high single-digit growth for the full year as we see continued share gains across the globe, combined with the FLEXVOLT launch in the second half of 2016. We are still estimating the revenue impact of FLEXVOLT to be slightly under $100 million in 2016.  
Security is expected to grow low single digits as momentum in North America and emerging markets offset some modest pressure we are seeing in Europe related primarily to Brexit dynamics within the U.K., which is impacting certain large financial customers. 
Finally, we now expect a mid-single-digit full year decline in industrial revenue as our Engineered Fastening business continues to work through the lost revenue from the previously mentioned major electronics customer, which, by the way, will anniversary in Q4. And additionally, they experienced market-driven headwinds within the general industrial business. Another set of factors to be aware of in Industrial is that we expect the North American automotive business to reflect the slowing market as we end 2016, combined with a weak Oil & Gas pipeline construction market in Q4.
Turning to operating margin rate. All segments remain in line with previous expectations as Tools & Storage and Security's profitability improves year-over-year and the Industrial segment declines, driven by top line contraction.  Our operating performance in 2016 has been strong, with EPS growth expected to be 8% to 10% despite absorbing another year of significant currency headwinds, which total $150 million or approximately $0.75 of earnings per share. We are very pleased with the team's performance to date and now are squarely focused on wrapping up a great year, highlighted by a strong performance on both organic revenue and earnings growth.
In summary, the third quarter was another solid performance for the company as organic growth finished up 3% and earnings per share up 8% versus the prior year. Tools & Storage delivered another outstanding performance. Likewise, the Security segment continues to progress, driving both organic growth and margin rate expansion. Based on this quarter's performance -- or outperformance that is, we are raising the midpoint of and tightening the EPS guidance range to $6.40 up to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. 
The third quarter marked the anxiously awaited launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which was met with tremendous excitement from professionals, tradesmen and tool enthusiasts around the world, our first of what we believe will be many successful breakthrough innovations in the future. On October 12, we ended our nearly 3-year self-imposed BD moratorium with the announcement of our agreement to acquire the Newell Tools business, including the iconic Lenox and solid Irwin brands, a highly strategic and financially attractive transaction. Lastly, we are continuing with our review of the Security business. As we have previously noted, we expect to provide an update at some point during the fourth quarter reporting period.
There are a number of exciting things happening at Stanley Black & Decker today. The opportunities presented by the FLEXVOLT launch and Newell Tools transaction are significant and robust as we look ahead into 2017, we remain committed to delivering solid organic growth and EPS operating leverage, consistent with our 3-year annual financial objectives previously communicated. 
That concludes the presentation portion of today's call, so now let's move to Q&A."

As far as M&A goes, we're -- historically, if we go back 15 years or so and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A. And the other 50%",280,"Okay. Well, I'll start. It's Jim. As far as M&A goes, we're -- historically, if we go back 15 years or so and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A. And the other 50%, we've given back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. And during that time frame, we more than quintupled the size of the company and gave back a lot of cash along the way, and returns to shareholders were very, very solid, 400%, 500% over that time frame. So we like that formula. And we -- when we took the break, it really was an opportunity to digest many of the acquisitions that we did over that time frame, and now we're back. And we intend to kind of continue with that 50% allocation of excess capital to M&A, and it's not an organizational bandwidth issue. I think Newell, despite its relatively significant size, is a -- really a bolt-on acquisition for the tool business. So  I'm not underestimating the importance of getting that integration right at all. It's a top priority for us, but there are other businesses in the portfolio and there's also some other activity going on in the tool industry that might lead to further consolidation, which we would intend to be a part of. So we'll do more deals as we go forward, and it will be a contributor to our growth. We expect our organic growth to be 4% to 6% over a long period of -- long term, and we expect acquisitions to contribute another 5%, 6% annually above that."

And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our view of '17. I mean, maybe what I can do is build upon my comment at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to '17. As I",487,"Yes. And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our view of '17. I mean, maybe what I can do is build upon my comment at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to '17. As I presented back in the -- our Investor Day in May of 2015, we gave kind of a 3-year perspective. Annual objectives for 3 years was basically what it was. And we said organic growth at a profile of 4% to 6%. Organic EPS growth would be 6% to 8%, so really demonstrating that operating leverage. And then, obviously, acquisitions, we presented something in excess of 10% EPS growth if you included acquisitions. The -- our thoughts right now is that we think we're in that range. We're probably, on the organic growth side, at the low end of the range, which should be similar to the profile that we've experienced during 2016, around 4%. We think that's probably a good proxy at this stage for next year. And then the EPS number is probably in that -- around that midpoint of that range I just mentioned at this stage. The other thing to keep in mind is that as you start to look at the different segments for organic growth in particular, our tools business will probably grow about 7% this year by the time the year is done. Our Security business will be around 1% organic growth, and we'll see mid-single-digit declines in Industrial. Keeping in mind Industrial does have that kind of difficult comp but it's been dealing with a major customer. Thus, if you exclude that impact, it's probably down about 2% instead. I think that's a good framework, frankly, for next year with maybe tools being a little bit lower from that 7%, but we'll see how positive the impact of FLEXVOLT is. It's still early days, but as Jim mentioned, it's very positive at this stage. So we'll see if that's a little bit higher than our expectation. We previously communicated that we think it will be $200 million roughly of revenue next year. And the one factor we don't know yet is the cannibalization impact. And then the other 2 segments, I think you'll see 1% or 2% growth probably in Security and a modest decline, most likely, in Industrial continuing as we probably work through continued difficult industrial market. I think that's a good framework to start with, and we'll see how the year ends. We haven't provided specific input around currency and commodities, but at this point, based on current rates, currency is probably a $20 million to $30 million pressure next year, and commodities is probably a similar amount at this stage. So we don't see that as a major headwind going into 2017, which is why we still think we can achieve reasonable operating leverage."

That's going to continue most likely into the first quarter. We don't see that as a major pressure point. As you see, the business had 17.4% margins in the third quarter, very, strong and up 70 basis points year-over-year. And so we don't see it as a major drag. But it certainly -- when you look at it sequentially versus Q2 as an example, it's one of the reasons why we're at 17.4% versus 18.8% in the second quarter. But as we enter the back half of next year, margins will regulate and get to more like line averages or above, depending on which FLEXVOLT product category."

So I was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit of a road map on how you see the moving parts for Industrial tracking into 4Q and '17."

So let me start with thoughts about '17 as it related to Security. We have not  -- in those comments that I made, we are not factoring in any decision related to Security because, obviously, there's different things that are being evaluated. However,",456,"Yes. So let me start with thoughts about '17 as it related to Security. We have not  -- in those comments that I made, we are not factoring in any decision related to Security because, obviously, there's different things that are being evaluated. However, if you look at the 3 options we've discussed: one is obviously keeping the business, which would have no impact. Second option was to do something with the entire Security business, which, obviously, have a significant impact to what I described. And then the third option was an evaluation of our mechanical lock business and determining potential divestiture of that. If that business -- if that was a choice that we chose, then there would be, I would say, a modest dilutive impact to that. However, the proceeds of the money we receive could partially be used to do a buyback to minimize that dilution. So our view is we don't think -- under that scenario, we don't think it we would be -- it would have a large impact on the numbers that I described. So that gives you a little bit of framework on our thoughts there. On the kind of Industrial breakdown, you said Apple had growth in the fourth quarter. I think you were referring to Apple the company, not our business. But we're not projecting growth in our business, so that's probably part of your question. But what I said was that we are seeing -- we saw slowing in the North American auto business in the third quarter. We expect that to continue as we're starting to see, especially with the big 4, a little lighter production schedule for the fourth quarter. So we're going to probably continue to see pressure there. The current projections for next year for light vehicle production are still positive, although they're very modest. They're just over about 0.5% year-over-year. So North America right now appears to be a modest growth number for light vehicle production, which we tend to outperform. But we'll have to watch that very closely as the year ends. Looking at Oil & Gas, it is weakening, and it's weakening primarily because there is a large project in the Dakotas of the U.S. that has been dealing with protesters and other activities that have shut down a lot of that pipeline construction. And that impacted us modestly in Q3, but we do see that as a larger impact in Q4. And so those are 2 factors that we're seeing in Q4 that are creating our view of guidance and why we have not raised our guidance beyond the $0.05 kind of drop-through of what we outperformed -- or a large part of what we outperformed in Q3."

And so we will buy small bolt-on acquisitions, typically in the $20 million to $50 million kind of range. It's almost like CapEx, it's a bit of a steady state, but it helps supplement the recurring revenue growth. Because, as you can imagine, when you have a recurring revenue portfolio and there's attrition in the 7% to 12% range, depending on the type of portfolio, that you have to originate all that just to keep the recurring revenue portfolio even. And then you have to originate more to grow the recurring revenue portfolio. So growing the recurring revenue portfolio is assisted by supplementing it with small acquisitions, but it's really not a very material amount of money to the overall corporation that we're spending on them."

And that historically has been -- depending on the year, can be anywhere from 40 to 80 basis points of a drop when you look at Q3. If you factor in the FLEXVOLT activities, that, most likely, will be another 30 to 50 basis points on top of that. So the other thing that we're seeing is that we are seeing a little bit of modest commodity inflation as we exit the year. It's not dramatically impacting the rate, but that could be 1/10 or so of 1 point as well or 10 basis points. That kind of gives you a little bit of granularity around that."

One, you certainly are getting a lot of price benefit to offset the currency pressure that you're seeing primarily in emerging markets. So by taking those price actions, that's a big part of what that 1% is. And then there's the -- what I would say, the normal ongoing activity that we do in all our businesses and have been doing for quite some time, which is around what I typically call the surgical or strategic pricing actions, which is really looking at different products -- different product categories, looking at the competitive pricing dynamics, look at the value proposition and the differentiation we might have in these categories and then really setting a pricing that we think is more appropriate for the value that we provide to the consumer or the customer. And we've been doing that. We continue to do that. And that's something that I think, even in a modest commodity inflation environment next year -- and it will be modest. Remember my comments were not -- my -- our expectations are that this is not something that's going to be a significant commodity inflation market. I just don't think the demand is there to really stimulate that type of activity. But that being said, these surgical marketing or pricing approaches are things that we will continue to do. And so although we'll probably see a little bit of price pressure here and there on certain products or because of what we experienced with commodity this year, having a modest inflationary environment actually is helpful when you're having some of these surgical pricing decisions."

There is definitely some incremental distribution that we're picking up, particularly in the plumbing and trades, in electrical trades. So we really like that kind of distribution.

So that would be in the -- kind of in the staffed channel and some of the other -- those types of channels outside of the home centers and mass merchants. But then there's a lot of overlap, so it's kind of a nice balance. We pick up some incremental distribution, but we also have the ability to consolidate within our existing channels and gain synergies and so on."

I think the Stanley Black & Decker merger positioned us to be able to really blanket the markets with distribution coverage. And in addition to that, we've organized in a way that enables us to both get intimate local market knowledge and coverage and, at the same time, be able to introduce products and make marketing moves across the entire universe of the emerging markets. So interesting walk around them. Latin America, which is pretty significantly over-indexed for us and has been pretty difficult over the last few years for reasons that relate mostly to political instability and also commodity bust and the impact that, that had on those markets and, of course, the FX that came along with those problems, the currency pressures, but in any event, what we see in Latin America in general is some pretty positive indications, nothing robust at this point in time. But I -- if I were betting, I would bet that the Latin American markets are going to be, in general, better in 2017 than they have been in recent years, in the sense that Argentina with Macri and some of his reforms is starting to take root and then you have the long drawn-out Brazilian political drama with the scandals and so forth that have unseated the leader. And that all is going to, I think, ultimately result in more stability and more reforms as we go forward. And then some of the traditional stronger -- the ones that have been traditionally stronger in recent years, such as Mexico, will probably continue to chug along at the rate that they have been. I don't see any major dislocation there. And then as commodities have stabilized, the western countries in Latin America like Chile and Peru have seem to have stabilized as well. So on balance, I think the Latin America -- Latin American situation is pretty bright for us as we go forward. The -- if we move over to Asia, the non-Chinese developing markets in Asia in general are stable to slightly positive. China is a big question mark. We don't have a tremendous amount of volume in China, but the market itself is very questionable. I think, right now, hard to really believe the data that comes out related to GDP, and what we see is industrial is very weak in China. And as -- we see no real reason to become bullish on industrial in China, so it's quite negative. And sooner or later, I think the chickens may come home to roost in terms of the reality in China, would be my guess. And so -- and then we just take some of the other countries like Russia. That's pretty much a crapshoot in terms of what's going to happen there. Comps are very easy right now in terms of as we go forward. But then again, what does the future portend? I think the political situation there is very questionable. And then the same is true as you get into Turkey and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. And so that's -- and India, we don't -- again, we don't have much in India, but India is a good place to be in right now from an economic perspective. So hopefully, that's helpful."

Yes, I mean, as both Jim and I mentioned in our comments, we're very, very pleased with the organic growth profile that we've seen in Europe. And frankly, this is a trend that's been going on for almost 3 years now, where we've seen really consistent anywhere from mid- to high single-digit organic growth. This quarter was 11%, so even better, in low double digit. And I think when we look at it, it started out as some revenue synergies that came out of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger that we really were leveraging and having a positive impact in that region. Then we started getting deeper into SFS 2.0 and some of the commercial excellence efforts, and now we're getting into the digital components of that, with digital marketing and more e-commerce activities over there. And then you combine it with the fact that with new technologies, like brushless, as an example, in the cordless power tools space, and innovation that we brought to the marketplace, we've created an opportunity to fill a lot of white space within a certain base of our customers. And so we've been able to fill that white space and put forth different products. The other item that I didn't mention was also putting the Stanley FatMax brand on mid-price point power tools in Europe. And so that was another opportunity that was leveraging the effect of the synergies of the 2 companies. And Europe is probably the best example, and then maybe emerging markets after that, of a combination of the revenue synergies from the merger and then the great benefits that we're starting to see in the first couple of years from SFS 2.0."

That's hard work, and it takes more effort. And you also have to have a continued top line organic growth performance to get some leverage effect as well. But I think each region has made great progress. The Europe journey, the improvement has been going on a little bit longer than in North America. But I still see -- at this point, we're probably going to end the year close to 13% profitability for the segment, probably just under 13%. And at this stage, we still see a path for it to get to close to 15%, as we communicated back in our Investor Day in May of '15. And we're probably 2 to 3 years away from achieving that objective because we're continuing to do a lot of heavy lifting. And one of the value proposition items that we see in Electronics Security is the ability to really differentiate with customer service, and that's what the team has been focused on for the last year or 2. But we still see a world of opportunity in that space to make it better and better, which is only going to enhance our productivity as time goes on."

But it was definitely trending sequentially lower up until the FLEXVOLT launch, and at that point, we've seen it begin to track sequentially higher. And where we stand on weeks of sale in total is the weeks of sale are substantially lower right now than they were last year. And I think part of that has to do with good sell-through and increasing sell-through, maybe even beating expectations of the retailers.

In the third quarter, we continued to perform at a high level, delivering modestly above-market organic growth. We also achieved another quarter of margin expansion despite a challenging external backdrop, which included slow global growth, dollar strength and geopolitical and other volatility. 
In a few minutes, Don will provide color on each business segment, but first, here's a few highlights. Total company organic growth was 3% in the quarter, and revenues were up 2% net of currency. Tools & Storage led the way, up 5%, with the European team contributing a remarkable second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, up 11%. 
The Security segment continued to make good progress, up 2% organically, with all regions contributing. The North American business delivered 1 point of organic growth to go along with noteworthy year-to-date margin improvement. Industrial was weighed down by the impact of 1 major electronics customer and, to a lesser extent, by general industrial market conditions. As a result, the segment continued to experience top line contraction, in this case, 4%.  
On a very positive note, total company operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 15.2% as a strong operating performance more than offset the impact of currency headwinds and the cost impact of growth investments. Diluted EPS was $1.68, up 8% year-over-year, on continued revenue growth and solid operating leverage driven by disciplined price management and cost control, productivity gains and commodity deflation, among other factors.  
The third quarter also marked the beginning of the exciting launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, the first breakthrough innovation coming out of SFS 2.0. This introduction has been met with unbridled enthusiasm across our professional customer base. The magnitude of the technological accomplishment in conjunction with the sheer breadth and depth of the marketing campaign has driven strong early momentum. We expect the success of this initiative to continue into the fourth quarter through 2017 and for years to come.  
In fact, the early returns suggest that this will be the largest and most successful power tool product rollout in our company's history. This success will likely enable us to continue our strong Tools & Storage organic growth track record into 2017 despite having to overcome comps from 2014, '15 and '16 averaging 7% annually.  
And finally, I'm pleased to note that we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2016 EPS guidance by $0.05, from $6.40 to $6.45, and tightened the full year EPS range to $6.40 and $6.50. It was previously $6.30 to $6.50.  Don will cover this increase in the midpoint in more detail during his remarks.
Moving over to M&A. As many of you know, on October 12, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase the Newell Tools business, including the Irwin and Lenox brands, from Newell Brands, Inc. I'd like to spend a few minutes sharing some thoughts on this transaction. I'll start by saying that we are very excited by the growth and margin expansion opportunities this deal brings. 
In addition to clearly identified and achievable cost synergies, there is tremendous strategic value here. We see significant opportunities for revenue synergies in both the short term and the long term. 
Opportunities include channel optimization, cross-branding of product lines and geographic expansion. These opportunities are very similar on a somewhat smaller scale to the ones we were so successful in pursuing with regard to Black & Decker, a gift which keeps on giving.  And we are fortunate to have the same tools senior leadership team in place that integrated Black & Decker, and that team is now focused on the Newell business. 
We also really liked the assets. The Lenox and Irwin brands are among the best in their respective categories and are attractive and powerful additions to our portfolio. The product offerings are highly complementary to our existing tools product line and significantly increase the size of our Hand Tools and Power Tools accessories businesses. Newell Tools also extends our channel presence in the plumbing and electrical trades, which are both attractive adjacencies to our legacy core markets.  
You can see a breakdown of revenues by region and product mix as well as by brand on the right-hand side of the page, and this transaction brings top-tier positions globally in both the bandsaw blade and linear edge markets, where the Lenox brand reigns supreme, while also meaningfully bolstering our pliers and accessories product lines, among others.  
And as we noted on the deal announcement call, this transaction marks the end of our nearly 3-year self-imposed M&A moratorium. And over that time, we significantly strengthened the foundation of our core businesses; implemented a new enhanced operating system, SFS 2.0; drove gains in organic growth and margin expansion while advancing our incremental and breakthrough innovation processes, all of which positioned the company for strong performance over the last few years and into the future. And I'm pleased that our first acquisition after this break is a business that lines up so well with our strategic growth framework and our core competencies. 
In line with that framework and our financial criteria, we expect EPS to be accretive year 1, delivering $0.15 a share and growing to at least $0.50 a share in year 3, both on an ex-charges basis. The transition and integration planning is now under way, with closing expected some time in 2017, most likely in the first half. 
And at this point, I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who will cover more detail on segment performance as well as provide the financial update. Don?"

We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segments. As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth, u",2123,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segments. 
As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth, up 5%, as we saw continued significant share gains in Europe, which was up 11% and a solid performance in North America, which grew at 4%. The emerging markets were up modestly in the quarter as declines in the Middle East and Northern Africa offset mid- to high single-digit growth in Latin America and Asia. Over the last few quarters, we have been adding commercial and leadership resources to the Middle East and North Africa teams and expect that business to swing back to the positive organic growth trajectory in the coming year.
In North America, share gains were driven by U.S. retail, up high single digit, despite inventory reductions by certain retail partners. And we had a very strong performance in Canada, also up high single digits. In the aggregate, this strong performance more than offset persistent weakness in the North American industrial tool channel. Within our U.S. retail channels, POS remains healthy and excitement around the FLEXVOLT launch met lofty expectations, leading this product line on track to deliver on our 2016 revenue expectation.  
We have talked quite a bit over the last few quarters about how an incredible technological accomplishment the tools team has been able to deliver with this new product platform, developing FLEXVOLT from scratch through our breakthrough innovation process and driving it from concept to store shelves in just under 2 years.  But I also wanted to highlight how proud we are of the commercial team's efforts in coordinating this rollout, which was the first and largest global product launch in our company's 170-plus-year history. The excitement and enthusiasm that they have been able to generate globally while, no doubt, aided by the unparalleled technological accomplishment of this product has nonetheless been simply extraordinary. This launch also serves as a perfect example of how the digital and commercial excellence pillars of SFS 2.0 combine with and enhance the breakthrough and incremental innovation processes, compounding our engineering achievements through superior marketing, targeting and commercial efforts and paving the way for significant organic growth opportunities.
The European team continued their commercialization efforts throughout the region to drive tremendous share gains once again. When you consider the third quarter's impressive 11% organic growth against the backdrop of a 14% gain in the second quarter and high single-digit organic growth in 2014 and 2015, the magnitude of this achievement comes into focus and is truly extraordinary. Gains continued to be widespread throughout the region within the U.K., France and Central Europe, all delivering strong performances from new product development, growth investments and an ever-increasing retail footprint.
Turning to the SBUs. Power Tools were up 8% on the back of the FLEXVOLT launch and commercial successes that I just discussed. While the Hand Tools & Storage business declined by 3%, as pressure in the industrial tool channels more than offset growth in Mac Tools and strong performances in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. From a profitability perspective, the tools business continues to impress, expanding its operating margin 70 basis points in the quarter and delivering $330 million of operating profit.  These results were achieved despite continued currency pressure and while balancing growth-related investments, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive operating leverage as we grow. 
And I'll just make one final comment on the Tools & Storage business. When you think about the results the team delivered over the last few years in this challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, you can understand more clearly why we are so excited about the Newell Tools acquisition. There is a significant value-creation opportunity presented by folding these powerful brands and high-quality products into our best-in-class Tools & Storage operations.
Moving on to Security. The segment delivered its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, up 2%, with all regions contributing. As Jim mentioned, North America posted its first quarter of growth since Q2 of 2015, led by higher volume within the Commercial, Electronic, Security and automatic door businesses. It is very encouraging to see the North American team combine the field productivity and profitability improvements they have made over the last few years with budding organic growth as the business continues to progress forward.  
In Europe, the team continued its organic growth trend of close to 1.5 points in the quarter, making this the eighth consecutive quarter of organic growth. Higher installation volumes and a strong performance in the Nordics and Germany helped to drive top line growth and offset the pressures that we've seen in the U.K., where we are continuing to see some negative impacts on CapEx spend and commercial decisions relating to Brexit. We also saw organic growth from Security's emerging markets operation, a positive sign for this relatively small portion of the segment.
Margins in the Security segment continued to improve, up 180 basis points in the quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by the North American team's continued success with its field efficiency and productivity efforts as well as continued focus on tight controls over SG&A across the entire segment. Margins were also favorably influenced by more intense rigor over the profitability requirements of our commercial opportunities that we implemented in the past year, the benefits of which we are now beginning to see within our operating margin rate as backlog orders are converting to revenue.
Let's move to the Industrial segment. Revenues were down in the quarter, as anticipated, as the impact of 1 large electronics customer and still weak industrial market conditions adversely impacted Engineered Fastening volume. This decline more than offset the mid-single-digit growth in Infrastructure, resulting in an overall 4% organic decline for the segment. Within Engineered Fastening, the organic revenue decline was largely expected. However, the global automotive business continued to perform well, with solid growth in Europe and Asia, which outpaced light vehicle production. This growth more than offset some slowness that we've experienced in the North American automotive business in Q3.
The impact associated with the volume declines tied to 1 large electronics customer had a significant impact on Engineered Fastening as well as the overall segment's organic growth for the quarter. If you exclude this impact, Engineered Fastening's organic growth would have been slightly positive and the Industrial segment's organic growth would have been 1% for the quarter. 
Infrastructure posted organic growth of 5%, driven by higher Oil & Gas onshore project activity, which more than offset continued weakness in the Hydraulic Tool business. However, that's beginning to show some signs of stabilizing. Finally, while profitability in the Industrial segment declined by 40 basis points year-over-year, the segment still managed to achieve a very healthy 17.4% OM rate as a result of significant productivity gains and cost-control actions, which managed to largely offset the negative margin impact from the top line decline.
So let's move to Slide 7 and talk about our free cash flow, which came in at $169 million for the third quarter, in line with our prior year performance. The year-over-year improvement in net income of $21 million was offset by a slightly larger expansion in working capital and a higher capital -- CapEx investment of $10 million each. However, and very importantly, working capital turns in the quarter improved by 0.7 turns to 7.1x as the slight increase in working capital dollars covered a greater year-over-year revenue base.  
Year-to-date free cash flow performance remains very strong, coming in at $428 million through the third quarter as higher earnings combined with significantly lower expansion in working capital of approximately $200 million have absorbed $42 million of additional CapEx investments to deliver a solid $254 million outperformance versus the prior year. The working capital discipline has been particularly impressive given the strong organic growth we have seen throughout 2016, not to mention the inventory build related to the FLEXVOLT launch, which commenced in Q3.  
Based on our year-to-date performance, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at approximately 100% conversion rate. As in the past, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter on the back of solid earnings growth and the seasonal working capital liquidations we experience within our Tools & Storage business.
So let's shift to guidance on Slide 8. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance and tightening the range, $6.40 to $6.50, from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. The revised range represents an 8% to 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share. This raise is our third in as many quarters for 2016 and is representative of the continued strong performance by Tools & Storage and solid improvement in our Security segment profitability profile. These outperformances have more than offset a difficult performance in our Industrial segment.
As you can see on the left side of the chart, the $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our guidance is driven by improved operating performance, primarily within Tools & Storage. These improvements relate to continued indirect cost controls and slightly higher levels of cost productivity than originally estimated. Please note that this guidance does exclude any potential acquisition costs, which could occur in the fourth quarter, related to the Newell Tools deal. 
Let's shift to the segment outlook on the page. Tools & Storage is still expected to generate high single-digit growth for the full year as we see continued share gains across the globe, combined with the FLEXVOLT launch in the second half of 2016. We are still estimating the revenue impact of FLEXVOLT to be slightly under $100 million in 2016.  
Security is expected to grow low single digits as momentum in North America and emerging markets offset some modest pressure we are seeing in Europe related primarily to Brexit dynamics within the U.K., which is impacting certain large financial customers. 
Finally, we now expect a mid-single-digit full year decline in industrial revenues as our Engineered Fastening business continues to work through the lost revenue from the previously mentioned major electronics customer, which, by the way, will anniversary in Q4. And additionally, they experienced market-driven headwinds within the general industrial business. Another set of factors to be aware of in Industrial is that we expect the North American automotive business to reflect the slowing market as we end 2016, combined with a weak Oil & Gas pipeline construction market in Q4.
Turning to operating margin rate. All segments remain in line with previous expectations as Tools & Storage and Security's profitability improves year-over-year and the Industrial segment declines, driven by top line contraction.  Our operating performance in 2016 has been strong, with EPS growth expected to be 8% to 10% despite absorbing another year of significant currency headwinds, which total $150 million or approximately $0.75 of earnings per share. We are very pleased with the team's performance to date and now are squarely focused on wrapping up a great year, highlighted by a strong performance on both organic revenue and earnings growth.
In summary, the third quarter was another solid performance for the company as organic growth finished up 3% and earnings per share up 8% versus the prior year. Tools & Storage delivered another outstanding performance. Likewise, the Security segment continues to progress, driving both organic growth and margin rate expansion. Based on this quarter's performance -- or outperformance, that is, we are raising the midpoint of and tightening the EPS guidance range to $6.40 up to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. 
The third quarter marked the anxiously awaited launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which was met with tremendous excitement from professionals, tradesmen and tool enthusiasts around the world, our first of what we believe will be many successful breakthrough innovations in the future. On October 12, we ended our nearly 3-year self-imposed BD moratorium with the announcement of our agreement to acquire the Newell Tools business, including the iconic Lenox and solid Irwin brands, a highly strategic and financially attractive transaction. Lastly, we are continuing with our review of the Security business. As we have previously noted, we expect to provide an update at some point during the fourth quarter reporting period.
There are a number of exciting things happening at Stanley Black & Decker today. The opportunities presented by the FLEXVOLT launch and Newell Tools transaction are significant and robust. As we look ahead into 2017, we remain committed to delivering solid organic growth and EPS operating leverage, consistent with our 3-year annual financial objectives previously communicated. 
That concludes the presentation portion of today's call, so now let's move to Q&A."

As far as M&A goes, we're -- historically, if we go back 15 years or so and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A. And the other 50%",281,"Okay. Well, I'll start. It's Jim. As far as M&A goes, we're -- historically, if we go back 15 years or so and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A. And the other 50%, we've given back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. And during that time frame, we more than quintupled the size of the company and gave back a lot of cash along the way, and returns to shareholders were very, very solid, 400%, 500% over that time frame. So we like that formula. And we -- when we took the break, it really was an opportunity to digest many of the acquisitions that we did over that time frame, and now we're back. And we intend to kind of continue with that 50% allocation of excess capital to M&A, and it's not an organizational bandwidth issue. I think Newell, despite its relatively significant size, is a -- really a bolt-on acquisition for the tool business. So I'm not underestimating the importance of getting that integration right at all. It's a top priority for us, but there are other businesses in the portfolio and there's also some other activity going on in the tool industry that might lead to further consolidation, which we would intend to be a part of. So we'll do more deals as we go forward, and it will be a contributor to our growth. We expect our organic growth to be 4% to 6% over the long period of -- the long term, and we expect acquisitions to contribute another 5%, 6% annually above that."

And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our view of '17. Maybe what I can do is build upon my comment at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to '17. As I present",485,"Yes. And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our view of '17. Maybe what I can do is build upon my comment at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to '17. As I presented back in the -- our Investor Day in May of 2015, we gave kind of a 3-year perspective. Annual objectives for 3 years was basically what it was. And we said organic growth at a profile of 4% to 6%. Organic EPS growth would be 6% to 8%, so really demonstrating that operating leverage. And then, obviously, acquisitions, we presented something in excess of 10% EPS growth if you included acquisitions. The -- our thoughts right now is that we think we're in that range. We're probably, on the organic growth side, at the low end of the range, which should be similar to the profile that we've experienced during 2016, around 4%. We think that's probably a good proxy at this stage for next year. And then the EPS number is probably in that -- around that midpoint of that range I just mentioned at this stage. The other thing to keep in mind is that as you start to look at the different segments for organic growth in particular, our Tools business will probably grow about 7% this year by the time the year is done. Our Security business will be around 1% organic growth, and we'll see mid-single-digit declines in Industrial. Keeping in mind Industrial does have that kind of difficult comp but it's been dealing with a major customer. Thus, if you exclude that impact, it's probably down about 2% instead. I think that's a good framework, frankly, for next year, with maybe Tools being a little bit lower from that 7%, but we'll see how positive the impact of FLEXVOLT is. It's still early days, but as Jim mentioned, it's very positive at this stage. So we'll see if that's a little bit higher than our expectation. We previously communicated that we think it will be $200 million, roughly, of revenue next year. And the one factor we don't know yet is the cannibalization impact. And then the other 2 segments, I think you'll see 1% or 2% growth probably in Security and a modest decline, most likely, in Industrial continuing as we probably work through continued difficult industrial market. I think that's a good framework to start with, and we'll see how the year ends. We haven't provided specific input around currency and commodities, but at this point, based on current rates, currency is probably a $20 million to $30 million pressure next year, and commodities is probably a similar amount at this stage. So we don't see that as a major headwind going into 2017, which is why we still think we can achieve reasonable operating leverage."

That's going to continue most likely into the first quarter. We don't see that as a major pressure point. As you see, the business had 17.4% margins in the third quarter, very strong and up 70 basis points year-over-year. And so we don't see it as a major drag. But it certainly -- when you look at it sequentially versus Q2, as an example, it's one of the reasons why we're at 17.4% versus 18.8% in the second quarter. But as we enter the back half of next year, margins will regulate and we get to more like line averages or above, depending on which FLEXVOLT product category."

Hydraulics, you said, is stabilizing. And your -- Apple is forecasting growth in 4Q. So I was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit of a road map on how you see the moving parts for Industrial tracking into 4Q and '17."

So let me start with thoughts about '17 as it related to Security. We have not -- in those comments that I made, we are not factoring in any decision related to Security because, obviously, there's different things that are being evaluated. However,",457,"Yes. So let me start with thoughts about '17 as it related to Security. We have not -- in those comments that I made, we are not factoring in any decision related to Security because, obviously, there's different things that are being evaluated. However, if you look at the 3 options we've discussed: one is obviously keeping the business, which would have no impact. Second option was to do something with the entire Security business, which, obviously, would have a significant impact to what I described. And then the third option was an evaluation of our mechanical lock business and determining potential divestiture of that. If that business -- if that was a choice that we chose, then there would be, I would say, a modest dilutive impact to that. However, the proceeds of the money we receive could partially be used to do a buyback to minimize that dilution. So our view is we don't think -- under that scenario, we don't think it we would be -- it would have a large impact on the numbers that I described. So that gives you a little bit of framework on our thoughts there. On the kind of Industrial breakdown, you said Apple had growth in the fourth quarter. I think you were referring to Apple, the company, not our business. But we're not projecting growth in our business, so that's probably part of your question. But what I said was that we are seeing -- we saw slowing in the North American auto business in the third quarter. We expect that to continue as we're starting to see, especially with the big 4, a little lighter production schedule for the fourth quarter. So we're going to probably continue to see pressure there. The current projections for next year for light vehicle production are still positive, although they're very modest. They're just over about 0.5% year-over-year. So North America right now appears to be a modest growth number for light vehicle production, which we tend to outperform. But we'll have to watch that very closely as the year ends. Looking at Oil & Gas, it is weakening, and it's weakening primarily because there is a large project in the Dakotas of the U.S. that has been dealing with protesters and other activities that have shut down a lot of that pipeline construction. And that's impacted us modestly in Q3, but we do see that as a larger impact in Q4. And so those are 2 factors that we're seeing in Q4 that are creating our view of guidance and why we have not raised our guidance beyond the $0.05 kind of drop-through of what we outperformed -- or a large part of what we outperformed in Q3."

And so we will buy small bolt-on acquisitions, typically in the $20 million to $50 million kind of range. It's almost like CapEx. It's a bit of a steady state, but it helps supplement the recurring revenue growth. Because, as you can imagine, when you have a recurring revenue portfolio and there's attrition in the 7% to 12% range, depending on the type of portfolio, that you have to originate all that just to keep the recurring revenue portfolio even. And then you have to originate more to grow the recurring revenue portfolio. So growing the recurring revenue portfolio is assisted by supplementing it with small acquisitions, but it's really not a very material amount of money to the overall corporation that we're spending on them."

And that historically has been -- depending on the year, can be anywhere from 40 to 80 basis points of a drop when you look at Q3. If you factor in the FLEXVOLT activities, that, most likely, will be another 30 to 50 basis points on top of that. So the other thing that we're seeing is that we are seeing a little bit of modest commodity inflation as we exit the year. It's not dramatically impacting the rate, but that could be 0.1 points or so as well as our 10 basis points. That kind of gives you a little bit of granularity around that."

The pressure is coming from what we call the Industrial Tool business, which are the brands of Proto, Facom, our storage business, which is under Vidmar and Lista. And then the Mac Tools business is in that category. However, they're serving primarily the automotive aftermarket, and they continue to demonstrate kind of low to mid-single-digit organic growth. And that's been a trend that they've been on for a while. So we're seeing pressure in those tool channels. That's been -- since it started in probably the early part to mid-part of the fourth quarter of last year, that pressure continues. It anniversaries, obviously, in the fourth quarter. We're not expecting to see growth in that profile in the fourth quarter, but certainly, the amount of retraction should be much smaller. And hopefully, we move beyond that into next year and it becomes -- doesn't become a pressure point. And it's more of  can it go beyond flat and how do we gain share and maybe demonstrate some modest growth in that space."

So I mean, this year, we're going to show about 1 point of positive price. And that was in a market that was primarily a good part of the year was more of a deflation commodity situation, although the amount was not really significant. So we don't -- we were able to get a lot of this price from 2 different areas. One, you certainly are getting a lot of price benefit to offset the currency pressure that you're seeing primarily in emerging markets. So by taking those price actions, that's a big part of what that 1% is. And then there's the -- what I would say, the normal ongoing activity that we do in all our businesses and have been doing for quite some time, which is around what I typically call the surgical or strategic pricing actions, which is really looking at different products -- different product categories, looking at the competitive pricing dynamics, look at the value proposition and the differentiation we might have in these categories and then really setting a pricing that we think is more appropriate for the value that we provide to the consumer or the customer. And we've been doing that. We continue to do that. And that's something that I think, even in a modest commodity inflation environment next year -- and it will be modest. Remember my comments were not -- my -- our expectations are that this is not something that's going to be a significant commodity inflation market. I just don't think the demand is there to really stimulate that type of activity. But that being said, these surgical marketing or pricing approaches are things that we will continue to do. And so although we'll probably see a little bit of price pressure here and there on certain products or because of what we experienced with commodity this year, having a modest inflationary environment actually is helpful when you're having some of these surgical pricing decisions."

And in addition to that, we've organized in a way that enables us to both get intimate local market knowledge and coverage and, at the same time, be able to introduce products and make marketing moves across the entire universe of the emerging markets. So interesting walk around them. Latin America, which is pretty significantly over-indexed for us and has been pretty difficult over the last few years for reasons that relate mostly to political instability and also commodity bust and the impact that, that had on those markets and, of course, the FX that came along with those problems, the currency pressures, but in any event, what we see in Latin America in general is some pretty positive indications, nothing robust at this point in time. But I -- if I were betting, I would bet that the Latin American markets are going to be, in general, better in 2017 than they have been in recent years, in the sense that Argentina with Macri and some of his reforms is starting to take root and then you have the long drawn-out Brazilian political drama with the scandals and so forth that have unseated the leader. And that all is going to, I think, ultimately result in more stability and more reforms as we go forward. And then some of the traditional stronger -- the ones that have been traditionally stronger in recent years, such as Mexico, will probably continue to chug along at the rate that they have been. I don't see any major dislocation there. And then as commodities have stabilized, the western countries in Latin America like Chile and Peru have seem to have stabilized as well. So on balance, I think the Latin America -- Latin American situation is pretty bright for us as we go forward. The -- if we move over to Asia, the non-Chinese developing markets in Asia in general are stable to slightly positive. China is a big question mark. We don't have a tremendous amount of volume in China, but the market itself is very questionable. I think, right now, hard to really believe the data that comes out related to GDP, and what we see is industrial is very weak in China. And as -- we see no real reason to become bullish on industrial in China, so it's quite negative. And sooner or later, I think the chickens may come home to roost in terms of the reality in China, would be my guess. And so -- and then if we just take some of the other countries like Russia. That's pretty much a crapshoot in terms of what's going to happen there. Comps are very easy right now in terms of as we go forward. But then again, what does the future portend? I think the political situation there is very questionable. And then the same is true as you get into Turkey and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. And so that's -- and India, we don't -- again, we don't have much in India, but India is a good place to be right now from an economic perspective. So hopefully, that's helpful."

Yes, I mean, as both Jim and I mentioned in our comments, we're very, very pleased with the organic growth profile that we've seen in Europe. And frankly, this is a trend that's been going on for almost 3 years now, where we've seen really consistent anywhere from mid- to high single-digit organic growth. This quarter it was 11%, so even better, in low double digit. And I think when we look at it, it started out as some revenue synergies that came out of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger that we really were leveraging and having a positive impact in that region. Then we started getting deeper into SFS 2.0 and some of the commercial excellence efforts, and now we're getting into the digital components of that, with digital marketing and more e-commerce activities over there. And then you combine it with the fact that with new technologies, like brushless, as an example, in the cordless power tools space, and innovation that we brought to the marketplace, we've created an opportunity to fill a lot of white space within a certain base of our customers. And so we've been able to fill that white space and put forth different products. The other item that I didn't mention was also putting the Stanley FatMax brand on mid-price-point power tools in Europe. And so that was another opportunity that was leveraging the effect of the synergies of the 2 companies. And Europe is probably the best example, and then maybe emerging markets after that, of a combination of the revenue synergies from the merger and then the great benefits that we're starting to see in the first couple of years from SFS 2.0."

Europe made great progress over the last 2 years, but now they're -- Europe is kind of hitting the threshold of being close to 10% profitability and then taking it to the next step, which is closer to the low to mid-teens. That's hard work, and it takes more effort. And you also have to have a continued top line organic growth performance to get some leverage effect as well. But I think each region has made great progress. The Europe journey, the improvement has been going on a little bit longer than in North America. But I still see -- at this point, we're probably going to end the year close to 13% profitability for the segment, probably just under 13%. And at this stage, we still see a path for it to get to close to 15%, as we communicated back at our Investor Day in May of '15. And we're probably 2 to 3 years away from achieving that objective, because we're continuing to do a lot of heavy lifting. And one of the value proposition items that we see in Electronics Security is the ability to really differentiate with customer service, and that's what the team has been focused on for the last year or 2. But we still see a world of opportunity in that space to make it better and better, which is only going to enhance our productivity as time goes on."

But it was definitely trending sequentially lower up until the FLEXVOLT launch, and at that point, we've seen it begin to track sequentially higher. And where we stand on weeks of sale in total is the weeks of sale are substantially lower right now than they were last year. And I think part of that has to do with good sell-through and increasing sell-through maybe even beating expectations of the retailers.

In the third quarter, we continued to perform at a high level, delivering modestly above-market organic growth. We also achieved another quarter of margin expansion despite a challenging external backdrop, which included slow global growth, dollar strength and geopolitical and other volatility. 
In a few minutes, Don will provide color on each business segment, but first, here's a few highlights. Total company organic growth was 3% in the quarter, and revenues were up 2% net of currency. Tools & Storage led the way, up 5%, with the European team contributing a remarkable second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, up 11%. 
The Security segment continued to make good progress, up 2% organically, with all regions contributing. The North American business delivered 1 point of organic growth to go along with noteworthy year-to-date margin improvement. Industrial was weighed down by the impact of 1 major electronics customer and, to a lesser extent, by general industrial market conditions. As a result, the segment continued to experience top line contraction, in this case, 4%. 
On a very positive note, total company operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year to 15.2% as a strong operating performance more than offset the impact of currency headwinds and the cost impact of growth investments. Diluted EPS was $1.68, up 8% year-over-year, on continued revenue growth and solid operating leverage driven by disciplined price management and cost control, productivity gains and commodity deflation, among other factors. 
The third quarter also marked the beginning of the exciting launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, the first breakthrough innovation coming out of SFS 2.0. This introduction has been met with unbridled enthusiasm across our professional customer base. The magnitude of the technological accomplishment in conjunction with the sheer breadth and depth of the marketing campaign has driven strong early momentum. We expect the success of this initiative to continue into the fourth quarter through 2017 and for years to come. 
In fact, the early returns suggest that this will be the largest and most successful power tool product rollout in our company's history. This success will likely enable us to continue our strong Tools & Storage organic growth track record into 2017 despite having to overcome comps from 2014, '15 and '16 averaging 7% annually. 
And finally, I'm pleased to note that we have raised the midpoint of our full year 2016 EPS guidance by $0.05 from $6.40 to $6.45 and tightened the full year EPS range to $6.40 and $6.50. It was previously $6.30 to $6.50. Don will cover this increase in the midpoint in more detail during his remarks.
Moving over to M&A. As many of you know, on October 12, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase the Newell Tools business, including the Irwin and Lenox brands, from Newell Brands, Inc. I'd like to spend a few minutes sharing some thoughts on this transaction. I'll start by saying that we are very excited by the growth and margin expansion opportunities this deal brings. 
In addition to clearly identified and achievable cost synergies, there is tremendous strategic value here. We see significant opportunities for revenue synergies in both the short term and the long term. 
Opportunities include channel optimization, cross-branding of product lines and geographic expansion. These opportunities are very similar on a somewhat smaller scale to the ones we were so successful in pursuing with regard to Black & Decker, a gift which keeps on giving. And we are fortunate to have the same tools senior leadership team in place that integrated Black & Decker, and that team is now focused on the Newell business. 
We also really liked the assets. The Lenox and Irwin brands are among the best in their respective categories and are attractive and powerful additions to our portfolio. The product offerings are highly complementary to our existing tools product line and significantly increase the size of our Hand Tools and Power Tools accessories businesses. Newell Tools also extends our channel presence in the plumbing and electrical trades, which are both attractive adjacencies to our legacy core markets. 
You can see a breakdown of revenues by region and product mix as well as by brand on the right-hand side of the page, and this transaction brings top-tier positions globally in both the bandsaw blade and linear edge markets, where the Lenox brand reigns supreme, while also meaningfully bolstering our pliers and accessories product lines, among others. 
And as we noted on the deal announcement call, this transaction marks the end of our nearly 3-year self-imposed M&A moratorium. And over that time, we significantly strengthened the foundation of our core businesses; implemented a new enhanced operating system, SFS 2.0; drove gains in organic growth and margin expansion while advancing our incremental and breakthrough innovation processes, all of which positioned the company for strong performance over the last few years and into the future. And I'm pleased that our first acquisition after this break is a business that lines up so well with our strategic growth framework and our core competencies. 
In line with that framework and our financial criteria, we expect EPS to be accretive year 1, delivering $0.15 a share and growing to at least $0.50 a share in year 3, both on an ex-charges basis. The transition and integration planning is now under way, with closing expected sometime in 2017, most likely in the first half. 
And at this point, I'll turn it over to Don Allan, who will cover more detail on segment performance as well as provide the financial update. Don?"
304977,403612733,1064114,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segments. As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth, u",2123,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We'll now take a more in-depth look at our third quarter performance across the segments. 
As previously mentioned by Jim, the Tools & Storage business delivered another outstanding quarter of organic growth, up 5%, as we saw continued significant share gains in Europe, which was up 11% and a solid performance in North America, which grew at 4%. The emerging markets were up modestly in the quarter as declines in the Middle East and Northern Africa offset mid- to high single-digit growth in Latin America and Asia. Over the last few quarters, we have been adding commercial and leadership resources to the Middle East and North Africa teams and expect that business to swing back to the positive organic growth trajectory in the coming year.
In North America, share gains were driven by U.S. retail, up high single digit, despite inventory reductions by certain retail partners. And we had a very strong performance in Canada, also up high single digits. In the aggregate, this strong performance more than offset persistent weakness in the North American industrial tool channel. Within our U.S. retail channels, POS remains healthy and excitement around the FLEXVOLT launch met lofty expectations, leading this product line on track to deliver on our 2016 revenue expectation. 
We have talked quite a bit over the last few quarters about how an incredible technological accomplishment the tools team has been able to deliver with this new product platform, developing FLEXVOLT from scratch through our breakthrough innovation process and driving it from concept to store shelves in just under 2 years. But I also wanted to highlight how proud we are of the commercial team's efforts in coordinating this rollout, which was the first and largest global product launch in our company's 170-plus-year history. The excitement and enthusiasm that they have been able to generate globally while, no doubt, aided by the unparalleled technological accomplishment of this product has nonetheless been simply extraordinary. This launch also serves as a perfect example of how the digital and commercial excellence pillars of SFS 2.0 combine with and enhance the breakthrough and incremental innovation processes, compounding our engineering achievements through superior marketing, targeting and commercial efforts and paving the way for significant organic growth opportunities.
The European team continued their commercialization efforts throughout the region to drive tremendous share gains once again. When you consider the third quarter's impressive 11% organic growth against the backdrop of a 14% gain in the second quarter and high single-digit organic growth in 2014 and 2015, the magnitude of this achievement comes into focus and is truly extraordinary. Gains continued to be widespread throughout the region within the U.K., France and Central Europe, all delivering strong performances from new product development, growth investments and an ever-increasing retail footprint.
Turning to the SBUs. Power Tools were up 8% on the back of the FLEXVOLT launch and commercial successes that I just discussed. While the Hand Tools & Storage business declined by 3% as pressure in the industrial tool channels more than offset growth in Mac Tools and strong performances in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. From a profitability perspective, the tools business continues to impress, expanding its operating margin 70 basis points in the quarter and delivering $330 million of operating profit. These results were achieved despite continued currency pressure and while balancing growth-related investments, a clear demonstration of our ability to drive operating leverage as we grow. 
And I'll just make one final comment on the Tools & Storage business. When you think about the results the team delivered over the last few years in this challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, you can understand more clearly why we are so excited about the Newell Tools acquisition. There is a significant value-creation opportunity presented by folding these powerful brands and high-quality products into our best-in-class Tools & Storage operations.
Moving on to Security. The segment delivered its third consecutive quarter of organic growth, up 2%, with all regions contributing. As Jim mentioned, North America posted its first quarter of growth since Q2 of 2015, led by higher volume within the Commercial, Electronic, Security and automatic door businesses. It is very encouraging to see the North American team combine the field productivity and profitability improvements they have made over the last few years with budding organic growth as the business continues to progress forward. 
In Europe, the team continued its organic growth trend of close to 1.5 points in the quarter, making this the eighth consecutive quarter of organic growth. Higher installation volumes and a strong performance in the Nordics and Germany helped to drive top line growth and offset the pressures that we've seen in the U.K., where we are continuing to see some negative impacts on CapEx spend and commercial decisions relating to Brexit. We also saw organic growth from Security's emerging markets operation, a positive sign for this relatively small portion of the segment.
Margins in the Security segment continued to improve, up 180 basis points in the quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by the North American team's continued success with its field efficiency and productivity efforts as well as continued focus on tight controls over SG&A across the entire segment. Margins were also favorably influenced by more intense rigor over the profitability requirements of our commercial opportunities that we implemented in the past year, the benefits of which we are now beginning to see within our operating margin rate as backlog orders are converting to revenue.
Let's move to the Industrial segment. Revenues were down in the quarter, as anticipated, as the impact of 1 large electronics customer and still weak industrial market conditions adversely impacted Engineered Fastening volume. This decline more than offset the mid-single-digit growth in Infrastructure, resulting in an overall 4% organic decline for the segment. Within Engineered Fastening, the organic revenue decline was largely expected. However, the global automotive business continued to perform well, with solid growth in Europe and Asia, which outpaced light vehicle production. This growth more than offset some slowness that we've experienced in the North American automotive business in Q3.
The impact associated with the volume declines tied to 1 large electronics customer had a significant impact on Engineered Fastening as well as the overall segment's organic growth for the quarter. If you exclude this impact, Engineered Fastening's organic growth would have been slightly positive and the Industrial segment's organic growth would have been 1% for the quarter. 
Infrastructure posted organic growth of 5%, driven by higher Oil & Gas onshore project activity, which more than offset continued weakness in the Hydraulic Tool business. However, that's beginning to show some signs of stabilizing. Finally, while profitability in the Industrial segment declined by 40 basis points year-over-year, the segment still managed to achieve a very healthy 17.4% OM rate as a result of significant productivity gains and cost-control actions, which managed to largely offset the negative margin impact from the top line decline.
So let's move to Slide 7 and talk about our free cash flow, which came in at $169 million for the third quarter, in line with our prior year performance. The year-over-year improvement in net income of $21 million was offset by a slightly larger expansion in working capital and a higher capital -- CapEx investment of $10 million each. However, and very importantly, working capital turns in the quarter improved by 0.7 turns to 7.1x as the slight increase in working capital dollars covered a greater year-over-year revenue base. 
Year-to-date free cash flow performance remains very strong, coming in at $428 million through the third quarter as higher earnings combined with significantly lower expansion in working capital of approximately $200 million have absorbed $42 million of additional CapEx investments to deliver a solid $254 million outperformance versus the prior year. The working capital discipline has been particularly impressive given the strong organic growth we have seen throughout 2016, not to mention the inventory build related to the FLEXVOLT launch, which commenced in Q3. 
Based on our year-to-date performance, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance at approximately 100% conversion rate. As in the past, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the fourth quarter on the back of solid earnings growth and the seasonal working capital liquidations we experience within our Tools & Storage business.
So let's shift to guidance on Slide 8. As Jim noted at the beginning of the call, we are raising the midpoint of our EPS guidance and tightening the range, $6.40 to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. The revised range represents an 8% to 10% year-over-year increase in earnings per share. This raise is our third in as many quarters for 2016 and is representative of the continued strong performance by Tools & Storage and solid improvement in our Security segment profitability profile. These outperformances have more than offset a difficult performance in our Industrial segment.
As you can see on the left side of the chart, the $0.05 increase to the midpoint of our guidance is driven by improved operating performance, primarily within Tools & Storage. These improvements relate to continued indirect cost controls and slightly higher levels of cost productivity than originally estimated. Please note that this guidance does exclude any potential acquisition costs, which could occur in the fourth quarter, related to the Newell Tools deal. 
Let's shift to the segment outlook on the page. Tools & Storage is still expected to generate high single-digit growth for the full year as we see continued share gains across the globe, combined with the FLEXVOLT launch in the second half of 2016. We are still estimating the revenue impact of FLEXVOLT to be slightly under $100 million in 2016. 
Security is expected to grow low single digits as momentum in North America and emerging markets offset some modest pressure we are seeing in Europe related primarily to Brexit dynamics within the U.K., which is impacting certain large financial customers. 
Finally, we now expect a mid-single-digit full year decline in industrial revenues as our Engineered Fastening business continues to work through the lost revenue from the previously mentioned major electronics customer, which, by the way, will anniversary in Q4. And additionally, they experienced market-driven headwinds within the general industrial business. Another set of factors to be aware of in Industrial is that we expect the North American automotive business to reflect the slowing market as we end 2016, combined with a weak Oil & Gas pipeline construction market in Q4.
Turning to operating margin rate. All segments remain in line with previous expectations as Tools & Storage and Security's profitability improves year-over-year and the Industrial segment declines, driven by top line contraction. Our operating performance in 2016 has been strong, with EPS growth expected to be 8% to 10% despite absorbing another year of significant currency headwinds, which total $150 million or approximately $0.75 of earnings per share. We are very pleased with the team's performance to date and now are squarely focused on wrapping up a great year, highlighted by a strong performance on both organic revenue and earnings growth.
In summary, the third quarter was another solid performance for the company as organic growth finished up 3% and earnings per share up 8% versus the prior year. Tools & Storage delivered another outstanding performance. Likewise, the Security segment continues to progress, driving both organic growth and margin rate expansion. Based on this quarter's performance -- or outperformance that is, we are raising the midpoint of and tightening the EPS guidance range to $6.40 up to $6.50 from the previous range of $6.30 to $6.50. 
The third quarter marked the anxiously awaited launch of the DEWALT FLEXVOLT system, which was met with tremendous excitement from professionals, tradesmen and tool enthusiasts around the world, our first of what we believe will be many successful breakthrough innovations in the future. On October 12, we ended our nearly 3-year self-imposed BD moratorium with the announcement of our agreement to acquire the Newell Tools business, including the iconic Lenox and solid Irwin brands, a highly strategic and financially attractive transaction. Lastly, we are continuing with our review of the Security business. As we have previously noted, we expect to provide an update at some point during the fourth quarter reporting period.
There are a number of exciting things happening at Stanley Black & Decker today. The opportunities presented by the FLEXVOLT launch and Newell Tools transaction are significant and robust. As we look ahead into 2017, we remain committed to delivering solid organic growth and EPS operating leverage, consistent with our 3-year annual financial objectives previously communicated. 
That concludes the presentation portion of today's call, so now let's move to Q&A."

As far as M&A goes, we're -- historically, if we go back 15 years or so and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A. And the other 50%",281,"Okay. Well, I'll start. It's Jim. As far as M&A goes, we're -- historically, if we go back 15 years or so and we look at the capital allocation of the company, we've taken almost exactly 50% of our excess capital and allocated it to M&A. And the other 50%, we've given back to the shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchases. And during that time frame, we more than quintupled the size of the company and gave back a lot of cash along the way, and returns to shareholders were very, very solid, 400%, 500% over that time frame. So we like that formula. And we -- when we took the break, it really was an opportunity to digest many of the acquisitions that we did over that time frame, and now we're back. And we intend to kind of continue with that 50% allocation of excess capital to M&A, and it's not an organizational bandwidth issue. I think Newell, despite its relatively significant size, is a -- really a bolt-on acquisition for the tool business. So I'm not underestimating the importance of getting that integration right at all. It's a top priority for us, but there are other businesses in the portfolio and there's also some other activity going on in the tool industry that might lead to further consolidation, which we would intend to be a part of. So we'll do more deals as we go forward, and it will be a contributor to our growth. We expect our organic growth to be 4% to 6% over the long period of -- the long term, and we expect acquisitions to contribute another 5%, 6% annually above that."

And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our view of '17. Maybe what I can do is build upon my comment at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to '17. As I present",485,"Yes. And I'll address your second question, Rich, which is about kind of our view of '17. Maybe what I can do is build upon my comment at the end of the presentation and give a little bit of a framework of our current thoughts related to '17. As I presented back in the -- our Investor Day in May of 2015, we gave kind of a 3-year perspective. Annual objectives for 3 years was basically what it was. And we said organic growth at a profile of 4% to 6%. Organic EPS growth would be 6% to 8%, so really demonstrating that operating leverage. And then, obviously, acquisitions, we presented something in excess of 10% EPS growth if you included acquisitions. The -- our thoughts right now is that we think we're in that range. We're probably, on the organic growth side, at the low end of the range, which should be similar to the profile that we've experienced during 2016, around 4%. We think that's probably a good proxy at this stage for next year. And then the EPS number is probably in that -- around that midpoint of that range I just mentioned at this stage. The other thing to keep in mind is that as you start to look at the different segments for organic growth in particular, our Tools business will probably grow about 7% this year by the time the year is done. Our Security business will be around 1% organic growth, and we'll see mid-single-digit declines in Industrial. Keeping in mind Industrial does have that kind of difficult comp but it's been dealing with a major customer. Thus, if you exclude that impact, it's probably down about 2% instead. I think that's a good framework, frankly, for next year, with maybe Tools being a little bit lower from that 7%, but we'll see how positive the impact of FLEXVOLT is. It's still early days, but as Jim mentioned, it's very positive at this stage. So we'll see if that's a little bit higher than our expectation. We previously communicated that we think it will be $200 million roughly of revenue next year. And the one factor we don't know yet is the cannibalization impact. And then the other 2 segments, I think you'll see 1% or 2% growth probably in Security and a modest decline, most likely, in Industrial continuing as we probably work through continued difficult industrial market. I think that's a good framework to start with, and we'll see how the year ends. We haven't provided specific input around currency and commodities, but at this point, based on current rates, currency is probably a $20 million to $30 million pressure next year, and commodities is probably a similar amount at this stage. So we don't see that as a major headwind going into 2017, which is why we still think we can achieve reasonable operating leverage."

That's going to continue most likely into the first quarter. We don't see that as a major pressure point. As you see, the business had 17.4% margins in the third quarter, very strong and up 70 basis points year-over-year. And so we don't see it as a major drag. But it certainly -- when you look at it sequentially versus Q2, as an example, it's one of the reasons why we're at 17.4% versus 18.8% in the second quarter. But as we enter the back half of next year, margins will regulate and we get to more like line averages or above, depending on which FLEXVOLT product category."

So I was wondering if maybe you could give us a little bit of a road map on how you see the moving parts for Industrial tracking into 4Q and '17."

So let me start with thoughts about '17 as it related to Security. We have not -- in those comments that I made, we are not factoring in any decision related to Security because, obviously, there's different things that are being evaluated. However,",457,"Yes. So let me start with thoughts about '17 as it related to Security. We have not -- in those comments that I made, we are not factoring in any decision related to Security because, obviously, there's different things that are being evaluated. However, if you look at the 3 options we've discussed: one is obviously keeping the business, which would have no impact. Second option was to do something with the entire Security business, which, obviously, would have a significant impact to what I described. And then the third option was an evaluation of our mechanical lock business and determining potential divestiture of that. If that business -- if that was a choice that we chose, then there would be, I would say, a modest dilutive impact to that. However, the proceeds of the money we receive could partially be used to do a buyback to minimize that dilution. So our view is we don't think -- under that scenario, we don't think it we would be -- it would have a large impact on the numbers that I described. So that gives you a little bit of framework on our thoughts there. On the kind of Industrial breakdown, you said Apple had growth in the fourth quarter. I think you were referring to Apple, the company, not our business. But we're not projecting growth in our business, so that's probably part of your question. But what I said was that we are seeing -- we saw slowing in the North American auto business in the third quarter. We expect that to continue as we're starting to see, especially with the big 4, a little lighter production schedule for the fourth quarter. So we're going to probably continue to see pressure there. The current projections for next year for light vehicle production are still positive, although they're very modest. They're just over about 0.5% year-over-year. So North America right now appears to be a modest growth number for light vehicle production, which we tend to outperform. But we'll have to watch that very closely as the year ends. Looking at Oil & Gas, it is weakening, and it's weakening primarily because there is a large project in the Dakotas of the U.S. that has been dealing with protesters and other activities that have shut down a lot of that pipeline construction. And that's impacted us modestly in Q3, but we do see that as a larger impact in Q4. And so those are 2 factors that we're seeing in Q4 that are creating our view of guidance and why we have not raised our guidance beyond the $0.05 kind of drop-through of what we outperformed -- or a large part of what we outperformed in Q3."

There's an element in growth in the Security business, which is supplementing our RMR portfolio, our recurring monthly revenue portfolio. And so we will buy small bolt-on acquisitions, typically in the $20 million to $50 million kind of range. It's almost like CapEx. It's a bit of a steady state, but it helps supplement the recurring revenue growth. Because, as you can imagine, when you have a recurring revenue portfolio and there's attrition in the 7% to 12% range, depending on the type of portfolio, that you have to originate all that just to keep the recurring revenue portfolio even. And then you have to originate more to grow the recurring revenue portfolio. So growing the recurring revenue portfolio is assisted by supplementing it with small acquisitions, but it's really not a very material amount of money to the overall corporation that we're spending on them."

And that historically has been -- depending on the year, can be anywhere from 40 to 80 basis points of a drop when you look at Q3. If you factor in the FLEXVOLT activities, that, most likely, will be another 30 to 50 basis points on top of that. So the other thing that we're seeing is that we are seeing a little bit of modest commodity inflation as we exit the year. It's not dramatically impacting the rate, but that could be 0.1 points or so as well as our 10 basis points. That kind of gives you a little bit of granularity around that."

And that was in a market that was primarily a good part of the year was more of a deflation commodity situation, although the amount was not really significant. So we don't -- we were able to get a lot of this price from 2 different areas. One, you certainly are getting a lot of price benefit to offset the currency pressure that you're seeing primarily in emerging markets. So by taking those price actions, that's a big part of what that 1% is. And then there's the -- what I would say, the normal ongoing activity that we do in all our businesses and have been doing for quite some time, which is around what I typically call the surgical or strategic pricing actions, which is really looking at different products -- different product categories, looking at the competitive pricing dynamics, look at the value proposition and the differentiation we might have in these categories and then really setting a pricing that we think is more appropriate for the value that we provide to the consumer or the customer. And we've been doing that. We continue to do that. And that's something that I think, even in a modest commodity inflation environment next year -- and it will be modest. Remember my comments were not -- my -- our expectations are that this is not something that's going to be a significant commodity inflation market. I just don't think the demand is there to really stimulate that type of activity. But that being said, these surgical marketing or pricing approaches are things that we will continue to do. And so although we'll probably see a little bit of price pressure here and there on certain products or because of what we experienced with commodity this year, having a modest inflationary environment actually is helpful when you're having some of these surgical pricing decisions."

And in addition to that, we've organized in a way that enables us to both get intimate local market knowledge and coverage and, at the same time, be able to introduce products and make marketing moves across the entire universe of the emerging markets. So interesting walk around them. Latin America, which is pretty significantly over-indexed for us and has been pretty difficult over the last few years for reasons that relate mostly to political instability and also commodity bust and the impact that, that had on those markets and, of course, the FX that came along with those problems, the currency pressures, but in any event, what we see in Latin America in general is some pretty positive indications, nothing robust at this point in time. But I -- if I were betting, I would bet that the Latin American markets are going to be, in general, better in 2017 than they have been in recent years, in the sense that Argentina with Macri and some of his reforms is starting to take root and then you have the long drawn-out Brazilian political drama with the scandals and so forth that have unseated the leader. And that all is going to, I think, ultimately result in more stability and more reforms as we go forward. And then some of the traditional stronger -- the ones that have been traditionally stronger in recent years, such as Mexico, will probably continue to chug along at the rate that they have been. I don't see any major dislocation there. And then as commodities have stabilized, the western countries in Latin America like Chile and Peru have seem to have stabilized as well. So on balance, I think the Latin America -- Latin American situation is pretty bright for us as we go forward. The -- if we move over to Asia, the non-Chinese developing markets in Asia in general are stable to slightly positive. China is a big question mark. We don't have a tremendous amount of volume in China, but the market itself is very questionable. I think, right now, hard to really believe the data that comes out related to GDP, and what we see is industrial is very weak in China. And as -- we see no real reason to become bullish on industrial in China, so it's quite negative. And sooner or later, I think the chickens may come home to roost in terms of the reality in China, would be my guess. And so -- and then if we just take some of the other countries like Russia. That's pretty much a crapshoot in terms of what's going to happen there. Comps are very easy right now in terms of as we go forward. But then again, what does the future portend? I think the political situation there is very questionable. And then the same is true as you get into Turkey and some of the other Middle Eastern countries. And so that's -- and India, we don't -- again, we don't have much in India, but India is a good place to be right now from an economic perspective. So hopefully, that's helpful."

This quarter it was 11%, so even better, in low double digit. And I think when we look at it, it started out as some revenue synergies that came out of the Stanley and Black & Decker merger that we really were leveraging and having a positive impact in that region. Then we started getting deeper into SFS 2.0 and some of the commercial excellence efforts, and now we're getting into the digital components of that, with digital marketing and more e-commerce activities over there. And then you combine it with the fact that with new technologies, like brushless, as an example, in the cordless power tools space, and innovation that we brought to the marketplace, we've created an opportunity to fill a lot of white space within a certain base of our customers. And so we've been able to fill that white space and put forth different products. The other item that I didn't mention was also putting the Stanley FatMax brand on mid-price point power tools in Europe. And so that was another opportunity that was leveraging the effect of the synergies of the 2 companies. And Europe is probably the best example, and then maybe emerging markets after that, of a combination of the revenue synergies from the merger and then the great benefits that we're starting to see in the first couple of years from SFS 2.0."

That's hard work, and it takes more effort. And you also have to have a continued top line organic growth performance to get some leverage effect as well. But I think each region has made great progress. The Europe journey, the improvement has been going on a little bit longer than in North America. But I still see -- at this point, we're probably going to end the year close to 13% profitability for the segment, probably just under 13%. And at this stage, we still see a path for it to get to close to 15%, as we communicated back at our Investor Day in May of '15. And we're probably 2 to 3 years away from achieving that objective because we're continuing to do a lot of heavy lifting.

And I think part of that has to do with good sell-through and increasing sell-through maybe even beating expectations of the retailers. But I think also there is an element of structural change that's going on with supply chains at some of the major retailers. So hopefully, that gives you some color on POS and sell-through."
