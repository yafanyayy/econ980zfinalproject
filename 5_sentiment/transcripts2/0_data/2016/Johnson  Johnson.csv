I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, C",1983,"Good morning, and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. 
I'll begin by briefly reviewing results for the corporation and our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on 2015 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. 
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available to the company and on our website. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in cooperation with strategic partners or license for other companies. This slide list acknowledgment of those relationships not otherwise referenced in today's presentations. 
Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 2.4% versus fourth quarter of 2014. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.4% and currency have a negative impact of 6.8%. In the U.S., sales were up 8%. 
In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 1.2%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 12.9%. 
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew 2.8%, while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 0.9% and [indiscernible] grew 0.8%. Growth in all regions is negatively impacted by the divestiture of the Cordis business with Europe, Latin America and Canada also negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was 7.8% worldwide, 13.4% in the U.S. and 2.9% outside the U.S. 
I would like to point out that our 2015 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during the holiday period, we did not achieved a full week of sales, however, we did have a few more shipping these. These additional shipment dates added approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1.2 to the annual growth rate. The additional sales are more heavily skewed to the U.S. 
While these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week worth of operating costs, therefore the bottom line impact was negligible. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $3.2 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.15 versus $0.89 a year ago. 
As referenced in the tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $220 million and a net charge of $608 million for after-tax special items. 
2014 fourth quarter net earnings [indiscernible] include after-tax amortization expense of $275 million and a charge of approximately $1.1 billion after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $1.44, representing increase at 4% and 5.1%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2014. 
Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 12.4%. 
Now turning to the financial highlights for the full year of 2015. Consolidated sales to customers for the year of 2015 were $17.1 billion, a decrease of 5.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. 
On an annual basis, sales grew 1.8% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 7.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 6.5% worldwide, 10.6% in the U.S. and 3% outside the U.S. 
Turning now to earnings. 2015 annual net earnings were $15.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $5.48. 
For the year 2015 adjusted net earnings were $17.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $6.20, down 4.8% and 3%, respectively, versus the 2014 results. 
On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.8%. Estimated free cash flow for the year was strong at $15.9 billion, up $1.1 billion versus 2014. 
Turning now to quarterly business segment highlights, please note percentage of quote that represent operational sales changes in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the impact of currency translation. 
I'll begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.3 billion increased 1.8% with U.S. sales down 4.9%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 5.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures underlying growth of approximately 4.7% worldwide, 1.7% in the U.S. and 6.3% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by worldwide OTC and Oral Care as well as Women's Health outside the U.S. 
OTC sales results in the U.S. were driven by the ZYRTEC and product relaunches for desk of health products. 
Strong growth for analgesics was partially offset by timing of inventory builds as noted in the third quarter and a slower start to the flu season. 
In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 13.5%, up from approximately 11.5% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 45.5%, up from approximately 42% a year ago. 
Results outside a U.S. were driven by strong sales of upper respiratory products and the relaunch of anti-smoking products. 
Strong sales momentum driven by successful marketing campaigns and geographic expansion for new products drove results for LISTERINE and Oral Care and in Women's Health products outside the U.S. 
Moving now to our pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.1 billion increased 6.5%, with U.S. sales up 12.7% and sales outside the U.S. down 0.9%. 
Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 11.1% worldwide and 21% in the U.S. 
Sales outside the U.S. declined approximately 0.2%, with strong growth of new and core products offset primarily by lower sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI to our distribution partner. 
Important contributors to growth were STELARA, INVOKANA/INVOKAMET, IMBRUVICA, and U.S. sales of [indiscernible]. 
STELARA achieved strong growth across all the major regions, driven by robust market growth and increase penetration with the psoriatic arthritis indication. 
Strong momentum in market share drove results for INVOKANA/INVOKAMET. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET achieved 6.5% total prescriptions share or TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, up from 4.2% last year. 
TRx with endocrinologist was 12.8% for the quarter and 5.8% in primary care. Strong patient uptake was demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second line CLL and MCL. 
Outside the U.S., results were driven primarily by Europe with strong patient uptake and shared momentum. IMBRUVICA is now approved in over 60 countries. As an update on our oncology pipeline, we received FDA approval for DARZALEX in November. DARZALEX is off to a robust start with strong underlying demand. 
INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results in all major regions primarily due to increased market share and the launch earlier this year of INVEGA Trinza. 
Continued share growth drove results to sales results with TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market of 16.1%, up nearly 1.5 points from a year ago. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product co-pay. 
REMICADE in the U.S. benefited from strong market growth, partially offset by lower market share. REMICADE U.S. export sales and international sales were negatively impacted by lower distribution partners sales due to the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe, partially offset by a higher inventory reduction last year.  Strong results were achieved in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S. 
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. As a reminder, we announced last week that we will use a new format for the reporting of sales in the Medical Devices segment, and we provided historical sales results in a new format at that time. The historical sales are available on our website. 
Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 3.4%. U.S. sales increased 6.7%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 5.8% worldwide, with the U.S. up 8% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by surgery, orthopedics, electrophysiology and Vision Care, partially offset by the divestiture of the Cordis business. 
Growth in our surgery business was driven by strong results for the advanced products with endocutters growth of 15%, biosurgical's growth of 9% and energy growth of 5%. 
In addition, ASP and mental products and in our specialty products made significant contributions to sales in the quarter. 
Market growth, additional selling days and new products drove strong results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. 
The successful introduction in early 2015 at the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the success of the in knees, our primary stent platform in hips and ORTHOVISC MONOVISC in spine or other made important information contributions to the results. 
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by result in China due to softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Spine, other and trauma were the categories most impacted. 
Our electrophysiology business grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by the success of Dr. MacColl stretch SmartTouch catheter. 
Vision Care results were driven by very strong growth in the U.S. due to the introduction of new products as well as the trade inventory build. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter of 2015. For your reference, there was some notable developments in the fourth quarter, which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your models. 
Lastly, to assist you in updating your models for the full year 2015 on our website, you will find annual sales highlights by segment. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?"

We had a strong finish to 2015 with a healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest for future growth. Our core business is very strong, and we expect the number of additional new products and in line extensions in the coming year. 
Now as we enter 2016, we look forward to: First, continued growth of core products across our segments; next, a rich near term pipeline and our pharmaceutical segment; positive momentum in our consumer segment with a the full portfolio of OTC's back on the market; setting a strong foundation for sustainable growth with the bold actions we are taken in our Medical Devices segment; and continued financial strength and strong free cash flows to return capital to shareholders and take disciplined and decisive actions regarding M&A that contributed to sustainable growth and long-term value creation. 
Now I'll share more specifics in my discussion with you today about the health care environment, our 2015 results and why we're so optimistic and confident about the future for the enterprise in each of our business segments. But with that as a backdrop, I'd like to begin where I always do by talking about our credo. 
Our credo is the beginning of everything at Johnson & Johnson. It guides all of our decisions, and I believe it sets us apart. 
This year's Johnson & Johnson's 130th year, think of that for a moment. 130 years of working to balance our mission of helping people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives, and I'm proud to see the employees of Johnson & Johnson around the world continuing to uphold the imperatives of our credo everyday, through both our philanthropy initiatives as recent commitment to supporting the immediate ongoing needs of Syrian refugees in partnership with Save the Children as well as to our commitments of the health care community with investments that will accelerate how we address global health crises like a Ebola, AIDS and mental health. 
You even heard me say that I believe health care is one of society's greatest challenges. And this global challenge grows with aging populations, rising cost in developed world and growing middle classes in emerging economies, we have increasing expectations for access to quality care. Now as the world's largest and most broadly based health care company, it's not just an opportunity for us to help manage this transformation, it is our responsibility to help lead the way to a better future. 
Now in this environment, ensuring access to important medicines and medical procedures remains a key objective for us. As government officials, politicians and other stakeholders debate significant issues around the world, we're pleased to see the health care is such a focus on the the dialog, and we believe that our goals, and those of the policymakers are aligned to find the best ways to ensure the delivery of quality health care and the best patient outcomes and a high quality and sustainable manner. Now in this discussion, it's a responsibility of all stakeholders to consider the economic and financial implications of health care. We got to look at the whole picture, drugs, devices and share of hospitals and governments put the patient in the center and reward innovation to drive better outcomes. 
Here in the United States, prescription drugs represent approximately 12% of total health care costs and Medical Devices for percent around 6%. These cures and treatments not only improved quality of life for many patients, extend life for others and contribute to the productivity of our society, but they can also help to reduce caregiver burden, disability and health care spending overall. The promise of innovation and health care is great. It will remain great if we can take a holistic approach to reforming the health care system. 
At Johnson & Johnson, we believe in this holistic approach to health care solutions. It's a vital to developing the best innovations, to meeting the needs of our stakeholders and to sustaining our legacy of strong and consistent business performance. Our consumer medical devices and pharmaceuticals segments were increasingly interconnected businesses, and we believe that being broadly based in health care has been and will continue to be a significant factor in Johnson & Johnson's success as a positions as well to lead and grow our business with the evolving health care landscape. Our broad global footprint enables us to reach more patients and consumers in fast developing and changing markets. In fact, Johnson & Johnson's operating in 60 countries today, and we're continuing to invest in implementing new operating models, forging strong relationships with local governments and health systems and further accelerating growth through strategic acquisitions and partnerships with local companies. 
Because of our broad-based across health care, we are uniquely positioned to be a partner of choice. Now let me just go over a few examples. With large health systems, we are taken more of the business to business model to help them with innovative contracting strategies, integrated services and solutions and with dedicated customer-focused teams. We're working with technology companies like Google, IBM and Apple, we're advancing medical innovation through an infusion of technology that can benefit from the deep health care expertise Johnson & Johnson can uniquely provide. 
We're continuing to support biotech and med tech start-ups who appreciate the value we place on innovation and the reach and breadth of our footprint in the health care market. And with public health organizations, we have a tremendous opportunity to address the gaps that remain in innovation, access and delivery of effective prevention and treatment. We're collaborating more than ever before to meet the world's most pressing public health challenges. 
Our scale, financial flexibility and business and health care expertise make Johnson & Johnson a key partner for a number of our stakeholders. And our relationships with these partners will help Johnson & Johnson continue to be a leader in the future. 
Applying our expertise in design thinking, strategic innovation models and a commitment to collaborating with all stakeholders, we've developed a number of cross segment innovations. 
For example, we've created the China Lung Cancer Center, which is developing a holistic approach to treat lung cancer in China where the disease is particularly prevalent. We're pioneering cell therapy for age-related macular degeneration, combining technologies from pharma and from our Vision business to find a way to address this condition. 
And we're leveraging capabilities from our Medical Devices, pharma and consumer businesses to treat obesity and diabetes in the ways. 
In fact, almost everyone of our programs can benefit from the advantages of our broad base. 
Over the past several years, we've also been leveraging our scale by developing enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our sectors, targeting as much as $1 billion in operational savings by 2018 to support our growth. And we believe innovation is taking place within our supply chain and quality systems is actually creating a competitive advantage for Johnson & Johnson. 
But the bottom line, well, it's the bottom line. In this broad-based structure has helped us deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance. Let's consider some of the numbers. 
First, 53 consecutive years of dividend increases at Johnson & Johnson. That means we have provided steady dividend increases since we first put a man in space. And 32 years of consecutive adjusted operational earnings growth more than 3 decades. 
Over the past 10 years, we have returned approximately 70% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And today, 70% of our revenues come from brands that are #1 or #2 in their markets. We have 24 brands that represent billion dollar platforms. If you think about that, 1999, the entire corporation had revenues of $24 billion and about 25% of our sales come from brands launched in the last 5 years. That's a result of constant learning, collaboration and innovation. 
Our corporate structure, our broad-based is a strategic choice and one that is grounded our performance, not just our heritage. We know it has been a significant driver in the past and expect it will be more important in the future. 
As we've said, we see global health care growing at 3% to 5% over the next 5 years, and we have a clear objective that Johnson & Johnson should grow sales organically at a faster rate than the market. We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. 
In addition, we will continue to create value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that generate additional growth. All of this, coupled with our strong dividend yield, and you're a looking at the very compelling total shareholder return. 
As part of our performance-driven strategy, we regularly review the structure and portfolio of our businesses to a valid how dare delivering on our responsibilities to stakeholders outlined in our credo, meeting evolving health care needs and achieving performance expectations. Johnson & Johnson has a rigorous and disciplined portfolio review program focused on creating long-term shareholder value, and this applies to all our businesses. We have a track record of evolving our business and taking decisive actions when necessary to meet changing industry and consumer dynamics, and we'll continue to do so in the future. We're actively looking for the right opportunities to create greater value for our shareholders. We are seeking companies with a mutual desire to partner, but we're also patients. We will only act when we see the right value-creating deal at a right price and with the right partners. 
Now historically, about half of our growth has come from M&A and half from internal development, which we fully expect to continue and with our strong balance sheet, we've got the resources to do just that. 
Now let me take a few minutes to review the priorities we laid out for you last year. One, we will continue to be focused on delivering on our financial equality commitments; two, in pharmaceuticals, our objective, as always, is constant innovation. We're building in our launch excellence and continuing to develop a robust pipeline of transformational medicines. 
In our Consumer business, we positioned our entire portfolio to focus on key geographies, need states and mega- brands. We're prioritizing and investing to expand our market leadership and key consumer segments in OTC, Oral Care, Baby and Beauty. 
And as you heard through our announcement last week, our priority in Medical Devices is accelerating growth through strategic investments in innovation and by transforming our go-to-market models. We're confident that these priorities will deliver the results that you expect from us. And just as importantly, the results that we expect from ourselves. 
As we've said, we are pleased with our 2015 performance. In 2015, we generated sales of $70.1 billion, reflecting strong underlying operational growth across our enterprise. Our end market portfolio and pharmaceuticals delivered strong growth. We built positive momentum in our consumer segment and we've just announced bold actions to accelerate growth in our medical device segment. 
Throughout the year, you've heard from each of our business segment leaders about the strategies we put in place to meet our commitments, so I'll touch on just a few of the recent actions we've taken to advance those strategies. 
As Joaquin Duato laid out for you at our pharmaceuticals business review in May, our pharmaceuticals business has a clear strategy focused on 5 therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need, a robust innovation engine, improving commercial capabilities. Joaquin talked to you about how we're investing in our future with 10 new products we plan to file by 2019, each with a potential to exceed $1 billion in annual sales. And in fact, we are already delivering one of those promising medicines to the market, 4 months ahead of schedule with the U.S. approval for DARZALEX, the first human monoclonal antibody to be approved anywhere in the road for patients with multiple myeloma, which is off to a very good start. 
In the near term, I know many of you are keeping an eye on potential biosimilar completion of the United States. As you've heard us say, biosimilars are not generics. With more than 2.4 million people having been treated with REMICADE and about 70% of the current patients receiving sustained and effective treatment, we believe doctors will be reluctant to switch them off with that level of success. 
And we've seen this play out in many markets where biosimilars have already been introduced. And we also have a patent for REMICADE that expires in September 2018 that will obviously continue to vigorously defend. 
We consider our Immunology products part of an important and robust portfolio for patients, physicians and payers. So when you consider our continued expectations for REMICADE as well as the future potential of products like STELARA and SIMPONI and the pending submissions of [indiscernible] and [indiscernible], we are confident in our ability to continue driving strong growth from our Immunology portfolio. 
When you combine these advances with additional line extension approvals expected in 2016 like those for IMBRUVICA, STELARA, INVOKANA and DARZALEX approval in the EU, our new term pipeline is incredibly robust and may not be fully appreciated in the market. With the combined strength of our end market portfolio and a deep late stage pipeline, we expect to deliver above industry compound average growth through 2019. 
Our consumer expertise, insight and access are becoming increasingly valuable to payers and providers as demographic and technology trends in health care are moving the system toward more consumer driven decision-making and in some cases, self-care alternatives. We see this as a key differentiator for our company, and we're investing in technologies that help us exploit this expertise across our broad base. Troy and our other consumer business leaders will share more details of our consumer business review this may. 
For 2015, our U.S. OTC business continue to grow faster than the market, and we're happy to report that nearly all of our OTC products will return to shelves, and we are proud the quality system improvements we have put into place. 
Our consumer medical device businesses, the Johnson & Johnson diabetes Solution Companies and Johnson & Johnson Vision Care made progress in 2015 to improve our competitiveness. Both businesses, which command global leadership positions in their respective categories, focused their 2015 turnarounds on launching new products, solidifying their base businesses and accelerating growth.  And both businesses have regained stub less market share and market leadership and introduced important new product such as Animas Vibe and ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day with hydro lacks in the U.S. 
In our broader Medical Device businesses, last week, we announced a strategic restructuring initiative designed to directly support and accelerate the strategy Gary Pruden laid out for you on our third quarter earnings call. We are allocating resources to priority platforms like endocutters, knees, trauma and EP and recent history showed that when we doubled down in an area, we are able to accelerate meaningful innovation and outcomes as we saw with our endocutters portfolio, which is now the fastest growing platform in our medical devices segment. 
Additionally, we're making progress on transforming our go-to-market models of our cross-selling efforts between Ethicon and DePuy Synthes joined reconstructions of spine which resulted in over 600 leads through 2015. We are now co-selling in over 1,200 accounts and all sales teams will be trained covering all markets and by the end of the first quarter. 
And finally, our recent acquisition of the Herrick's medical in the area of atrial fibrilation and surgical robotics collaboration with Verily, formerly Google Life Sciences, are examples of the type of focus and strategic investments that you will see us make more off in the future. 
Our goal is to reach more patients, outperform the markets in which we compete and consistently identify build and acquire new platforms for growth. 
Moving forward into 2016, we will continue to take bold but appropriate steps to put our Medical Device business in the best position to deliver more value for customers and for our company and for our shareholders. 
In summary, we believe that improved universal access to quality health care, rewarding innovation and a more vital culture of health, wellness and prevention are the keys to the future where people are healthier and businesses and economies are stronger. Our broad based experience and scale uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader and partner of choice and the movement towards outcomes and episodes of care some-based approaches and ultimately, a healthier society. We are optimistic about the future opportunities in health care and confident in the strength of our business. 
In 2016, we will remain focused on our near-term priorities and continue to advance our longer-term growth drivers, enabling us to continue delivering shareholder value year after year. 
With the guidance of our credo, we'll continue to meet our responsibilities to all stakeholders. That's been true for 129 years of breakthrough, life-saving innovation, and we are confident Johnson & Johnson is well positioned to continue meeting those responsibilities for the next 130 years. 
Thank you. I look forward to further dialogue during the Q&A session. But first, I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso, who will talk more about our results and expectations for 2016. Dominic?"

As you've heard from Alex, we're very pleased with our 2015 performance. We believe we managed our business well and I provided you insights during the year in a transparent manner that allowed all of you to understand our plans and expectations. We finished the year strong, and we're carrying that momentum into 2016. 
We ended the year at the top end of our operational guidance range for both sales and earnings, and exceeded estimates for earnings as published by first call. 
Turning to the next slide. You can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the full year 2015. I'd first like to remind you about some of the key assumptions in our guidance for 2015. At the beginning of the year, we discussed that, while we reinvested some of the profitability from OLYSIO sales, our earnings in 2014 did benefit by approximately $0.20 per share even after those investments, making 2015 comparison to 2014 results more challenging. 
Additionally, currency headwinds increased quite substantially in 2015, negatively impacting both sales and earnings for 2015 by approximately 8%. 
Given those expected headwinds, last January, we guided that we would deliver operational sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%. 
As you can see, well reported sales results showed a decrease of 5.7%, on an operational basis, we ended up at the high end of our guidance where operational sales growth at 1.8%. 
We also provided you with an estimate of our underlying operational sales growth for 2015, which excluded the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of hepatitis C sales. We expected that underlying operational growth will be approximately 6%, and we exceeded that estimate, delivering 6.5%. 
On earnings, our adjusted operational EPS growth in our original 2015 guidance was expected to range between 2.3% and 4.7%. 
As reported this morning, our EPS of 6.20, reflects operational growth of 5.8% and is at the top of the updated EPS guidance range we gave in October. 
And finally, our adjusted net income margin improved to 24.9%. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of our earnings for the quarter. Turning to the next slide. You can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015. 
As we expected, direct comparisons to our fourth quarter of 2014 will be challenging to the stronger OLYSIO sales that we benefited from last year as well as divestitures and currency headwinds in 2015. Our results on an operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and excluding the impact of hep C sales are up 7.8% for the quarter. 
As Louise noted, sales did benefit from additional shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. 
Adjusted net earnings were $4 billion in the quarter, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 and adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 versus $1.37 a year ago are up 5.1%. And the adjusted EPS results exceeded the meaning of the analysts estimate as published by first call. 
Excluding the impact of translational currency, our operational adjusted EPS was $1.54 or up 12.4% for the fourth quarter. 
In the quarter, we incurred intangible amortization expense of $200 million on an after-tax basis as well as after-tax special charges of $600 million, which included an expense of $400 million related to the restructuring of our Medical Device business, which we announced last week and in process research and development charge of $200 million. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold was 30 basis points lower than the same period last year, impacted by changes in our business and product mix. Selling marketing and administrative expenses were 33.1% of sales. This is 120 basis points higher than last year as we continue to invest to drive growth in our key brands. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales were 16.1% in the quarter and 170 basis points higher than the prior year as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth. 
In fact, in the fourth quarter, we entered into important new licensing agreements, made milestone payments and increased spending to advance our R&D portfolio, which are all positive developments as we continued to strengthen our pipeline. 
Interest expense, net of interest income, was slightly lower, reflecting higher earnings on our investments. Other income and expense was a net gain of $1.2 billion in the quarter compared to a net charge of approximately $1 billion in the same period last year. Of course, this line item includes several special items in both years. Excluding those special items, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion compared to a net gain of approximately $130 million in the prior year period. This year's fourth quarter reflects the gain on the previously announced divestitures of Cordis. 
As a reminder, we indicated that any gains from divestitures, which are reflected in the other income and expense line would largely be reinvested in the business as well as used to mitigate the negative impact of currency and the lower level of income in 2015 from reduced OLYSIO sales. And therefore, our pretax operating margin would be expected to be lower in 2015 versus 2014. And 
our 2015 results reflect just that. We funded important investments with a higher level of other income that will benefit us going forward. 
The adjusted fourth quarter effort tax rate for 2015 was 17.7%. This was lower than the rate in the previous 9 months due to the passing of legislation, which renewed the R&D tax credit and look through provisions. The R&D tax credit and look through provisions were always included in our annual guidance. 
The adjusted full year effective tax rate for 2015 was 20.7%, slightly below guidance due to the mix of income from higher to lower tax jurisdictions. 
Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. Adjusted income before tax for the entire enterprise improved from 30.7% of sales at '14 to 31.4% of sales in 2015. 
Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment. Medical Devices expanded 360 basis points due primarily to the gain associated with the Cordis divestiture, while pharmaceutical margins contracted 50 basis points due to the lower OLYSIO sales and increased investments in research and development, partially offset by the gain earlier in the year of divestiture of NUCYNTA. 
Consumer margins contracted 110 basis points due to lower divestitures gains in 2015 versus 2014 as well as important investments for future growth as we returned our iconic consumer brands to the market. 
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I'll first give you some guidance on items we know may be difficult to forecast. 
I first like to address our cash position and remind you about our capital acquisition approach. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.5 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $38.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $20 billion of debt. This is a higher level of cash than we typically hold and as Alex said earlier, we're actively looking for the right opportunities to deploy that capital to create greater value for our shareholders. But we are patient. We are seeking companies with a mutual desire to partner and will only act when we see the right value-creating deal at the right price with the right partners. 
We have a transparent and disciplined capital allocation strategy that starts with evidence to our shareholders, followed by value creating M&A and then we consider other put in place to return value to shareholders such a share repurchase programs. And due to our strong balance sheet, we had a financial strength and flexibility to execute on all 3 of these capital allocation priorities simultaneously. 
During Q4, 2015,, we used approximately $1 billion to repurchase shares of our stock in connection with our $10 billion share repurchase program that we announced in October. 
Although we are continuing to evaluate external value-creating opportunities in line with the strategy, the purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, we suggest you consider modeling 2016 net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. 
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses, providing such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. 
We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Although we expect to have a significantly lower level of other income in 2016 versus 2015, our pretax operating margin in 2016 is expected to expand by more than 200 basis points. 
As we've discussed several times during the year, we continue to evaluate our portfolio, and we expected at any gains from divestitures would be lower than the level we saw in 2015. However, we also discussed that we would nonetheless, improve on earnings as we see the benefits of good expense management and meaningful investments we made in 2015. 
And now a word on taxes. We're very pleased that the R&D tax credit was made permanent and approved by Congress this last year. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016 excluding special items of approximately 19.5% to 20.5%. 
Turning to sales and earnings guidance. Our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrance for Procreate and REMICADE in the U.S. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, word and INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrance for INVEGA and [indiscernible]. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance first based on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operation. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business and will also provide an estimate of our sales and earnings and EPS results for 2016 with the impact of exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
For the full year 2016, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. 
Additionally, while we have comparison to how we describe our sale results in 2015, our 2015 operating sales growth, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales was approximately 6.5%. After adjusting for extra shipping days in 2015, that underlying growth rate was approximately 5.5% 2015. 
Our sales guidance for '16 on a same basis is expected to continue at a similar growth rate of around 5.5%. 
While the euro has been fairly stable over the last few months, many of the other currencies have been volatile. Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro at 1.09, our guidance for sales growth would decrease by approximately 1.5%. We are watching the other currencies closely as it is uncertain as to how they will settle after the year. Of course, we will update this assessment as we progress through out the year. 
Plus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 1% to 2% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $70.8 billion to $71.5 billion. 
Now turning to earnings. By continue to impact our earnings guidance for 2016 is the impact of currency movements on transactions, which, although hedged, is still somewhat negative. We expect transaction currency impact and negatively impact our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $6.53 to $6.68 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth rates of 5% to 8%. Again, we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS with the euro at 1.09. Our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.43 to $6.58 per share. At this early-stage in the year, we would do comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range, which at approximately 5%, is higher in current consensus estimate. 
So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I'd like to make a few points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 2.5% and 3.5%, we're pleased to note when excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales, our operational sales growth is expected to be around 5.5% for the full year 2016. 
With regards to expected EPS growth on an operational basis, our adjusted EPS growth guidance is strong in the range of 5% to 8%. 
Also for 2016, pretax operating margins are expected to expand by more than 200 basis points based on the guidance I just provided. The margin expansion is driven by combination of investments we've made in 2015, coupled with the benefit of disciplined expense management across the enterprise. 
Moving into 2016. We are confident in the strength of our business. As we execute on our growth plans and near-term priorities that Alex laid out for you this morning, we're well-positioned with the strong balance sheet to deliver solid results, while continuing to invest in innovation, which will ensure our future growth and success. Our goal remains to grow our sales organically at a rate faster than the markets, in which we compete, grow our earnings faster than sales and create value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that generate additional growth. 
All these, coupled with our strong dividend yield, provides a very compelling long-term shareholder return. Finally, before I turn it over to Louise for Q&A, just a reminder to please save the date for our Consumer and Medical Device Business Review on Wednesday, May 18. 
Thank you. Now back to Louise."

And there's 2 parts for the question. So if I look at MD&D and where you ended up with pretax margins in 2015, they were at 35.6%, and observed would say these are very high margins. And for the overall company, you're guiding to 200 basis points plus of pretax margin improvement, which would make 2016 the biggest year margin expansion in the last 15. So talk about the decision to be as aggressive as you are being in 2016 on operating cost.

So in 2016, we have a lower level of those investments consistent with a lower level of the other income that we just guided to. Also, it's important to point out that those investments we made in 2015 we're seeing the benefits of those already in 2016, so we think they are wise investments. And finally, we've talked a lot about our various programs of reducing our cost structure and Alex today mentioned the program that we're embarking -- that we embarked on several years ago that will reduce costs by $1 billion by 2018. While we're well on our way in implementing that program after several years of investment, in 2016, we'll see a year where the actual benefit associated with that program outlay any incremental investments. And maybe, Alex, comment on the MD&D restructuring and why that's appropriate for us to do today."

And so we see this as the next logical step in that overall process. Our Medical Device businesses one that we remain very committed to.

Look, overall, we feel that we're still in the very early innings what I would call as the market evolution that we clearly expect to see over the next 3, 5 and even 10 years. Now for all the reasons that we've discussed around increasing demands based on demographics certainly here in the U.S. and the rising middle class and demographics outside the United States and the pressure that, that's likely going to put on payers and governments and others in between, we realize that there is an opportunity for us to participate, not only in bringing great innovations, going to outpatient, but also doing it in a value-added way. And clearly, the consumer, the patient, is weighing in much heavier in these decisions as they take on higher co-pays, as they can get more information that's available online. And frankly, they just have higher expectations about their ability to participate in that health care decision-making process. So what we see is a range of customers, but we see some customers who are still very innovation focused. And to be clear, we remain very innovation focused. We think at the end of the day, what we do best is bring new products, new solutions to our customers that are going to ultimately have better outcomes for patients. And so that's an area where we are very focused on, and we'll continue to be focused on. We are starting I'd also see hospital systems. And I think one important point here is it's certainly taking place in the United States, but it's also definitely taking place in places like Europe and even some of the developing and emerging markets that frankly don't have the history of the legacy of some of the infrastructure that you see in the more developed markets. And there, what we see is an evolution more towards the business to business relationship where U.S. customers want to see innovation but they also want to see how you're going to interact, how can you assist them in working with our supply chain to make it more efficient, how can we work together as part of a broader partnership that ultimately is focusing not just on our product sell, but actually and an out, on an episodic care for the patient, and it creates a much broader partnership. We are seeing those organizations becoming more and more interested, and that's why we are adapting to make sure that we are part of that. So I think, overall, it's important that we continue to innovate, we continue to operate with a lot of excellence in the current environment. At the same time, it's important that we set the stage for this evolution that's taking place out there to make sure that we cannot only be successful, but we'll actually be a leader as the market evolves as well."

I think what we would say overall is we continue to see, -- let's say, a slightly increasing positive trends. So we saw hospital admissions, I believe, up around 2%, we saw surgical procedures up a little over 1% in the U.S., that the most recent data that we have. If you go outside a U.S., we think rates in Europe have been pretty steady. And even in the markets in which we compete most significantly in the developing markets, we haven't seen a major impact from secular shifts perhaps from China some, but not dramatic. And then putting it in the context what that represents overall in our business, we don't see it as a major indicator. As I look towards 2016, look, there's a few things that cost as to be optimistic about our Medical Device business. It really starts with innovation. And we've got about 30 products that we'll be launching by the end of 2016, over half of those have either been launched or well underway as we speak. And what we're seeing is bringing new technologies to market like our new contact lenses, like our new insulin pump, like our new energy instrumentation, like the tune knee, we're seeing very good uptake and in fact, in those categories, we're seeing share gains and certainly in areas like electrophysiology, endocutters, the same thing. And so we believe that the market that still reward significant innovation when we are introducing it. So that's one aspect. The second aspect, frankly, is one just improved execution. And I think if you look across all our device businesses, if you think about Diabetes Care, the major price resets that we have there a couple of years ago and as all of you know, when you take that kind of a reduction, resizing your business, going back in each and every line, in setting up for the new marketplace caused us an tremendous amount of change. If you look at our Vision Care business last year, we went in, and we really increased the cadence out of our innovation pipeline, launching 5 new products. We did a price resets there to make us more competitive with the ECPs, we made a lot of other internally adjustments to improve our selling and marketing. We are definitely seeing the impact of that now, not only on the sales results about 8% but as maybe more importantly, if you look at the leading indicators as far as new shares being generated and new patient starts in the offices, those things are positive. Louise mentioned earlier the improvement that we're seeing across the Orthopaedics business. Look, this is one where we know that when you bring large organizations together, when you standardized quality systems, manufacturing systems, we think that we've made a lot of progress there. And frankly, when you compound that with the innovation roll out that we've seen in Orthopaedics, the knee, the hip, the TFNA nail, we're starting to see that come back as well as some of frankly the approaches that we're taking that Gary will be talking more about in May where at Ethicon and our DePuy Synthes team are actually co-selling, co-contracting a number of their innovative ways. Compounded with the fact that, look, we think some of the performance issues related to China in our Orthopaedics are more of a onetime event. That's getting normalized. So as we burn our way through those and head into 2016 overall, we think that innovation, we think changes in our commercial model, we think improved execution, all those things make us more optimistic about the growth prospects as we head into 2016."

We think there's a few things to keep in consideration about this. First and foremost, is that as Dominic stated earlier, biosimilars are very different from generics. And particularly in this category, keeping the patient in the center of all these, we've got a tremendous amount of experience in the biologics category going back to, REMICADE one day, we think the differences between molecules can have manifested themselves in significant ways with patients. So making sure I think things that we'll be watching for the AC or what kind of data that the biosimilars actually have, what kind of indications, what will be the guidance around substitutability. All those frankly sitting here today are known so we'll need more clarification. But we think each of those means that the expected uptake even when a biosimilar does launch will lead to a significantly different curve in what you see with generics. We think secondly, it's very important to actually think about it from a patient perspective, and we know, for example, there's about 2.5 million patients with REMICADE. About 70% of those are either continuing therapy and have pretty high satisfaction rates. So if you look at the available population, there's likely to be switched, we think it's in the 30% range. And last but certainly, not least, there's the whole issue of the business model and the way that we actually work with customers in this setting. And this is an area where we've got a lot of experience in contracting, we've got some great relationships with providers in this area right now. We also have a very broad product portfolio. If you think about what REMICADE does, if you look more broadly at the performance recently of a product like STELARA, a multibillion dollar compound, growing at 20-plus percent rate. If you look at SIMPONI, same thing, SIMPONI ARIA, in particular, the great dosing convenience that they provide, that's another multibillion addition that we have been that portfolio and you augment that with the submissions that we have in 2016 plan for [indiscernible] and IL 23 and IL-6, we think that, that positions us very well with our portfolio from a contracting point of view with large providers and payers and certainly in the U.S. was also abroad. Now what we're seeing outside the United States, eh most of the markets we introduced is a relatively minor impact. We're seeing that we're holding onto about 90%-plus or minus, it varies by market. You have to look at each 1 individually. And it's difficult to project exactly what that impact will be going forward. But I think when we think of it broadly across all those different areas, what's the clinical data show, what ultimately the labeling, the regulatory aspects, what about our contracting, the business aspects, and we think all those are very important will result in a different impact from biosimilars and ultimately, we'll continue to defend our intellectual property as well to what we believe is the right path and in September of 2018."

Just trying to understand the difference between consensus estimates for 2016 in your guidance, do you have a sense for what the Street was assuming for nonoperating income? When I go back historically, that's been in the $500 million to $600 million range. Clearly it was $2 billion last year but just curious to know what consensus models had assumed for that. Secondly, did your guidance assume that the medical device tax will be suspended as I think within the said other device companies. Just curious know if that savings reinvested a in the business or if that is part of the guidance. And then for you, Alex, just curious to know your thoughts on pricing. I mean, we heard Bernie tell you last night go after pricing again and I think that's also something we're going to hear from the Republican candidate. What are your expectations in terms of pricing in 2016 and 2017? Do you expect that there will be a change in terms of list prices going forward?"

You were referring to our nonoperating, let's call it the other income and expense line for 2016, what was assumed an analyst models versus what we have provided in guidance. When we look at the analyst consensus models, overall, it looked like that number average in the high $900 million, so nearly $1 billion. And our guidance, of course, is somewhere at $1.1 billion to $1.2. billion So our guidance are slightly higher than the analyst models. But just as a reminder, we always take the opportunity to our portfolio choices to use any of those gains to offset some other expenses we like to invest in. And then with respect to the medical device tax, we have assumed that it would be a benefit in 2016. But I must say the benefit for us is very, very minor. Remember when the medical device tax is incurred, it's incurred upon the first manufacturer of a product and therefore, it can be, for example, orthopedic companies hung up in inventory for quite some time. So the overall impact of not having a medical device tax in 2016 is not significant for Johnson & Johnson, it may be significant for certain other company that may be of pure orthopedic players, but not overall significant for us. And secondly, I would say that whatever benefit we see there, we've already assume that would be reinvested in innovation as, of course, during the time that the medical device tax was a drag on earnings, obviously, decisions have to be made on where to invest, now we're happy that would that easement of the device tax for a couple of years, we'll be able to actually invest more on medical the motivation on the medical device."

And we believe that it's important to consider it just in that way. As we think about pharmaceuticals, for example, they currently make up about 12% of health care spending in the United States, slightly higher in Europe. If you think about medical devices, they represent about 6%. And if you go beyond those areas, of course, there's a lot of other cost built into the system, ranging from hospital, patient care, insurance companies, many other people, particularly in an environment today where frankly we're seeing such transformational outcomes and moving more and more towards cures, disease prevention, interception than we ever have because of some of the great science that's been produced. So we understand and would certainly expect there to be a continued spotlight in this area. Obviously, we're working with a lot of stakeholders to try and make sure that we look at it in a very holistic way. And it's very, I think, difficult at this point in time, to try to project was going to happen in 2016 or 2017. All of us know that the health care system, not only here in the United States but frankly around the, world is complex. There's a lot of other -- a lot of issues that are intertwined, but it's obviously a conversation that we'll be participating in. And ultimately where we want to be a part of the solution."

Look, I just picked up what Dominic has just said about our consumer business is that I'm really proud of the work we've done on the Consent Decree and the great strides that they have taken around quality. In fact, I think in working closely and partnering with FDA, we likely have a benchmark organization now, and we're really proud having done that. At the same time, I think as they begin to shift from only remediation to remediation and relaunch across a number of these areas, while certainly keeping a very high eye on quality, as we increase our volumes, as we are able to deepen our relationships that allow the major trade partners, that's where we see a great growth opportunity as well, and obviously, that's going to have an impact in our margins as we go forward. I also think of the other thing that team is doing is we're transitioning more and more to online marketing versus just traditional marketing. The way we are partnering with some of the large customers, I think, there's a lot of opportunities not only to drive share and volume, but actually to improve efficiencies on our back end as well. As a step back and look more broadly, we think the 3 areas that we're in, consumer medical devices and pharmaceuticals are all great platform and great businesses. Of course, we would look -- first for areas that what is the next ZYTIGA, what's the next Vision Care platform, what's the next NEUTROGENA? That would certainly be our focus. And other would be, are there chances to grow and perhaps some of the faster growing developing markets with the right kind of opportunity? Those are things that we would be interested in. And then what are ways to consummate our existing business? I think the way that you pointed out as the markets evolve, we are looking, not only at M&A, but also broader partnerships that we've done, for example, with companies like Google and barely where we see a big opportunity to really have transform robotics surgery space in a pretty significantly longer term. And then, I guess, the final option there would be for us to actually acquire something outside the current 3. And again, if it something where we thought there was a lot of unmet patient or consumer need, if we feel that it's consistent with the capabilities that we can bring to bear actually have it be a successful business, if the financials work, then we would take that step."

But any short-term changes in their economy is unlikely to have any significant impact on our results. And then on the 200 basis point improvement, Bob, it's actually across all 3 lines of the P&L, COGS, selling, marketing as well as R&D. So in the case of COGS where we have a long-term program that we we've executing on to reduce footprint, we're accelerating some of those programs that will benefit us in the COGS line when the selling, marketing and administrative line I talked earlier about, the fact that we have a program in place for a couple of years shooting for $1 billion of cost savings by 2018, we're well on our way. We'll see cost reductions in that line. In R&D, that depends on the individual licensing deals that we have and the timing of when we would spend those milestone payments or enter into new licensing agreement. But as it looks today, the advancement in the portfolio in 2015 from the milestone payments, et cetera, are not expected to be at the same level in '16 that they were in '15. So  it's across all 3 lines in the P&L, and I can't give you an exact number on the amount of investment we made in '15, extra investment made in '15. But just to say that we had $2.8 billion of other income in 2015 well above the year has passed, and we still improved overall income before tax by not quite that amount, right? So most of it was reinvested in the business."

And ultimately, about making sure that we're more competitive in delivering in the markets.

Frankly, that's what helped us create the number of billion dollars blockbuster that we've been able to launches his 2009 I think 16 new products and 7 of which are right at $1 billion or certainly will be. And so we think that's a good model. In Medical Devices, we've done tuck-ins as well as large and look, I think in both cases, whether it's pharma or Medical Devices, the smaller tuck-ins our frankly more straightforward to get done. We haven't shied -- we wont shy away from large why we think it's makes for a significant opportunity and something that we'll continue to look at in Consumer. As far as the question that's underperforming, I think it depends on why it's underperforming. If it's a market -- if it's an in exogenous market shift, there's something else, then obviously, that would not necessarily have shy away from that particular area. On the other hand, if it's an internal, more executional issue, absolutely, we'd want to make sure that we've got the meeting where we need it before we add on to that particular opportunity. So that's the way we tend to look at it. But again, it's part of a broader strategic question really on how we're managing the portfolio across the enterprise."

Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
I'll begin by briefly reviewing results for the corporation and for our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on 2015 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes.
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies. This slide lists acknowledgment of those relationships not otherwise referenced in today's presentations.
Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 2.4% versus fourth quarter of 2014. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.4% and currency had a negative impact of 6.8%. In the U.S., sales were up 8%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 1.2%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 12.9%.
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew 2.8%, while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 0.9% and Europe grew 0.8%. Growth in all regions was negatively impacted by the divestiture of the Cordis business with Europe, Latin America and Canada also negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was 7.8% worldwide, 13.4% in the U.S. and 2.9% outside the U.S.
I'd like to point out that our 2015 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during a holiday period, we did not achieve a full week of sales. However, we did have a few more shipping days. These additional shipment days added approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1 point to the annual growth rate. The additional sales are more heavily skewed to the U.S. While these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week's worth of operating costs, therefore, the bottom line impact was negligible.
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $3.2 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.15 versus $0.89 a year ago. As referenced in the tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $220 million and a net charge of $608 million for after-tax special items. 2014 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $275 million and a charge of approximately $1.1 billion for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $1.44, representing increases of 4% and 5.1%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 12.4%.
Now turning to the financial highlights for the full year of 2015. Consolidated sales to customers for the year of 2015 were $70.1 billion, a decrease of 5.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis, sales grew 1.8% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 7.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 6.5% worldwide, 10.6% in the U.S. and 3% outside the U.S.
Turning now to earnings. 2015 annual net earnings were $15.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $5.48. For the year, 2015 adjusted net earnings were $17.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $6.20, down 4.8% and 3%, respectively, versus the 2014 results. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.8%. Estimated free cash flow for the year was strong at $15.9 billion, up $1.1 billion versus 2014.
Turning now to quarterly business segment highlights. Please note, percentage of quote [ph] represent operational sales changes in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.
I'll begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.3 billion increased 1.8%, with U.S. sales down 4.9%, while outside the U.S., sales grew 5.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 4.7% worldwide, 1.7% in the U.S. and 6.3% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by worldwide OTC and Oral Care as well as Women's Health outside the U.S. OTC sales results in the U.S. were driven by the ZYRTEC and product relaunches for the depth of [ph] health products.
Strong growth for analgesics was partially offset by timing of inventory builds as noted in the third quarter and a slower start to the flu season. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 13.5%, up from approximately 11.5% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 45.5%, up from approximately 42% a year ago.
Results outside a U.S. were driven by strong sales of upper respiratory products and the relaunch of anti-smoking products. Strong sales momentum, driven by successful marketing campaigns and geographic expansion for new products, drove results for LISTERINE and Oral Care and in Women's Health products outside the U.S.
Moving now to our pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.1 billion increased 6.5%, with U.S. sales up 12.7% and sales outside the U.S. down 0.9%. Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 11.1% worldwide and 21% in the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. declined approximately 0.2%, with strong growth of new and core products, offset primarily by lower sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI to our distribution partner.
Important contributors to growth were STELARA, INVOKANA/INVOKAMET, IMBRUVICA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and XEPLION, XARELTO and U.S. sales of REMICADE. STELARA achieved strong growth across all the major regions, driven by robust market growth and increased penetration with the psoriatic arthritis indication. Strong momentum in market share drove results for INVOKANA/INVOKAMET. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET achieved 6.5% total prescriptions share or TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, up from 4.2% last year. TRx with endocrinologists was 12.8% for the quarter and 5.8% in primary care. Strong patient uptake with demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second-line CLL and MCL.
Outside the U.S., results were driven primarily by Europe with strong patient uptake and shared momentum. IMBRUVICA is now approved in over 60 countries. As an update on our oncology pipeline, we received FDA approval for DARZALEX in November. DARZALEX is off to a robust start with strong underlying demand. INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results in all major regions primarily due to increased market share and the launch earlier this year of INVEGA TRINZA.
Continued share growth drove XARELTO sales results with TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market of 16.1%, up nearly 1.5 points from a year ago. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product copay.
REMICADE in the U.S. benefited from strong market growth, partially offset by lower market share. REMICADE U.S. export sales and international sales were negatively impacted by lower distribution partner sales due to the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe, partially offset by a higher inventory reduction last year. Strong results were achieved in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S.
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. As a reminder, we announced last week that we will use a new format for the reporting of sales in the Medical Devices segment, and we provided historical sales results in the new format at that time. The historical sales are available on our website.
Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 3.4%. U.S. sales increased 6.7%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 5.8% worldwide, with the U.S. up 8% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by surgery, orthopedics, electrophysiology and Vision Care, partially offset by the divestiture of the Cordis business.
Growth in our surgery business was driven by strong results for the advanced products with endocutters growth of 15%, biosurgical's growth of 9% and energy growth of 5%. In addition, ASP and Mentor products and our specialty products made significant contributions to sales in the quarter.
Market growth, additional selling days and new products drove strong results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The successful introduction in early 2015 of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the success of the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stent platform in hips and ORTHOVISC, MONOVISC in spine or other made important information contributions to the results.
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by result in China due to softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Spine, other and trauma were the categories most impacted. Our electrophysiology business grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by the success of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter. Vision Care results were driven by very strong growth in the U.S. due to the introduction of new products as well as the trade inventory build.
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter of 2015. For your reference, there were some notable developments in the fourth quarter, which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your models. Lastly, to assist you in updating your models for the full year 2015, on our website, you will find annual sales highlights by segment 
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?"

Let me start by saying how optimistic and confident I am as we enter 2016. We had a strong finish to 2015. With our healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest for future growth. Our core business is very strong, and we expect a number of additional new products and line extensions in the coming year.
Now as we enter 2016, we look forward to: First, continued growth of core products across our segments; next, a rich near-term pipeline in our Pharmaceutical segment; positive momentum in our Consumer segment with a full portfolio of OTCs back on the market; setting a strong foundation for sustainable growth with the bold actions we are taking in our Medical Devices segment; and continued financial strength and strong free cash flows to return capital to shareholders and take disciplined and decisive actions regarding M&A that contribute to sustainable growth and long-term value creation.
Now I'll share more specifics in my discussion with you today about the health care environment, our 2015 results and why we're so optimistic and confident about the future for the enterprise in each of our business segments. But with that as a backdrop, I'd like to begin where I always do by talking about our credo.
Our credo is the beginning of everything at Johnson & Johnson. It guides all of our decisions, and I believe it sets us apart. This year's Johnson & Johnson's 130th year, think of that for a moment. 130 years of working to balance our mission of helping people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives. And I'm proud to see the employees of Johnson & Johnson around the world continuing to uphold the imperatives of our credo every day, through both our philanthropy initiatives and recent commitment to supporting the immediate and ongoing needs of Syrian refugees in partnership with Save the Children as well as to our commitments of the health care community with investments that will accelerate how we address global health crises like Ebola, AIDS and mental health.
You undoubtedly heard me say that I believe health care is one of society's greatest challenges. And this global challenge grows with aging populations, rising cost in developed world and growing middle classes in emerging economies. We have increasing expectations for access to quality care. Now as the world's largest and most broadly based health care company, it's not just an opportunity for us to help manage this transformation. It is our responsibility to help lead the way to a better future.
Now in this environment, ensuring access to important medicines and medical procedures remains a key objective for us. As government officials, politicians and other stakeholders debate significant issues around the world, we're pleased to see that health care is such a focus in the dialogue. And we believe that our goals and those of public policymakers are aligned to find the best ways to ensure the delivery of quality health care and the best patient outcomes in a high quality and sustainable manner. Now in this discussion, it's a responsibility of all stakeholders to consider the economic and financial implications of health care. We got to look at the whole picture, drugs, devices and share [ph] of hospitals and governments put the patient in the center and reward innovations that drive better outcomes.
Here in the United States, prescription drugs represent approximately 12% of total health care costs and medical devices represent around 6%. These cures and treatments not only improve quality of life for many patients, extend life for others and contribute to the productivity of our society, but they can also help to reduce caregiver burden, disability and health care spending overall. The promise of innovation and health care is great. It will remain great if we can take a holistic approach to reforming the health care system.
At Johnson & Johnson, we believe in this holistic approach to health care solutions. It's vital to developing the best innovations, to meeting the needs of our stakeholders and to sustaining our legacy of strong and consistent business performance. Our consumer Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals segments are increasingly interconnected businesses. And we believe that being broadly based in health care has been and will continue to be a significant factor in Johnson & Johnson's success as it positions us well to lead and grow our business with the evolving health care landscape.
Our broad global footprint enables us to reach more patients and consumers in fast-developing and changing markets. In fact, Johnson & Johnson is operating in 60 countries today, and we are continuing to invest in implementing new operating models, forging strong relationships with local governments and health systems and further accelerating growth through strategic acquisitions and partnerships with local companies.
Because of our broad base across health care, we are uniquely positioned to be a partner of choice. Now let me just go over a few examples. With large health systems, we are taking more of a business-to-business model to help them with innovative contracting strategies, integrated services and solutions and with dedicated customer-focused teams. We're working with technology companies like Google, IBM and Apple. We're advancing medical innovation through an infusion of technology that can benefit from the deep health care expertise Johnson & Johnson can uniquely provide.
We're continuing to support biotech and med tech start-ups who appreciate the value we place on innovation and the reach and breadth of our footprint in the health care market. And with public health organizations, we have a tremendous opportunity to address the gaps that remain in innovation, access and delivery of effective prevention and treatment. We're collaborating more than ever before to meet the world's most pressing public health challenges.
Our scale, financial flexibility and business and health care expertise make Johnson & Johnson a key partner for a number of our stakeholders, and our relationships with these partners will help Johnson & Johnson continue to be a leader in the future. Applying our expertise in design thinking, strategic innovation models and a commitment to collaborating with all stakeholders, we've developed a number of cross-segment innovations.
For example, we've created the China Lung Cancer Center, which is developing a holistic approach to treat lung cancer in China where the disease is particularly prevalent. We're pioneering cell therapy for age-related macular degeneration, combining technologies from Pharma and from our Vision business to find a way to address this condition. And we're leveraging capabilities from our Medical Devices, Pharma and Consumer businesses to treat obesity and diabetes in new ways. In fact, almost every one of our programs can benefit from the advantages of our broad base.
Over the past several years, we've also been leveraging our scale by developing enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our sectors, targeting as much as $1 billion in operational savings by 2018 to support our growth. And we believe the innovation that is taking place within our supply chain and quality systems is actually creating a competitive advantage for Johnson & Johnson.
But the bottom line, well, it's the bottom line. And this broad-based structure has helped us deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance. Let's consider some of the numbers.
First, 53 consecutive years of dividend increases at Johnson & Johnson. That means we have provided steady dividend increases since we first put a man in space. And 32 years of consecutive adjusted operational earnings growth, more than 3 decades.
Over the past 10 years, we have returned approximately 70% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And today, 70% of our revenues come from brands that are #1 or #2 in their markets. We have 24 brands that represent billion-dollar platforms. If you think about that, in 1999, the entire corporation had revenues of $24 billion, and about 25% of our sales come from brands launched in the last 5 years. That's a result of constant learning, collaboration and innovation.
Our corporate structure, our broad base is a strategic choice and one that is grounded our performance, not just our heritage. We know it has been a significant driver in the past and expect it will be more important in the future.
As we've said, we see global health care growing at 3% to 5% over the next 5 years, and we have a clear objective that Johnson & Johnson should grow sales organically at a faster rate than the market. We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. In addition, we will continue to create value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that generate additional growth. All of this, coupled with our strong dividend yield, and you are a looking at a very compelling long-term total shareholder return.
As part of our performance-driven strategy, we regularly review the structure and portfolio of our businesses to evaluate how they're delivering on our responsibilities to the stakeholders outlined in our credo, meeting evolving health care needs and achieving performance expectations. Johnson & Johnson has a rigorous and disciplined portfolio review program focused on creating long-term shareholder value, and this applies to all our businesses.
We have a track record of evolving our business and taking decisive actions when necessary to meet changing industry and consumer dynamics, and we'll continue to do so in the future. We're actively looking for the right opportunities to create greater value for our shareholders. We are seeking companies with the mutual desire to partner, but we're also patient. We will only act when we see the right value-creating deal at the right price and with the right partners.
Now historically, about half of our growth has come from M&A and half from internal development, which we fully expect to continue, and with our strong balance sheet, we've got the resources to do just that.
Now let me take a few minutes to review the priorities we laid out for you last year. One, we will continue to be focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. Two, in Pharmaceuticals, our objective, as always, is constant innovation. We're building on our launch excellence and continuing to develop a robust pipeline of transformational medicines.
In our Consumer business, we positioned our entire portfolio to focus on key geographies, need states and mega-brands. We are prioritizing and investing to expand our market leadership in key consumer segments in OTC, Oral Care, Baby and Beauty. And as you heard through our announcement last week, our priority in Medical Devices is accelerating growth through the strategic investments in innovation and by transforming our go-to-market models. We're confident that these priorities will deliver the results that you expect from us and just as importantly, the results that we expect from ourselves.
As we've said, we are pleased with our 2015 performance. In 2015, we generated sales of $70.1 billion, reflecting strong underlying operational growth across our enterprise. Our end market portfolio and Pharmaceuticals delivered strong growth. We built positive momentum in our Consumer segment, and we've just announced bold actions to accelerate growth in our Medical Device segment.
Throughout the year, you've heard from each of our business segment leaders about the strategies we put in place to meet our commitments, so I'll touch on just a few of the recent actions we've taken to advance those strategies.
As Joaquin Duato laid out for you at our pharmaceuticals business review in May, our Pharmaceuticals business has a clear strategy focused on 5 therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need, a robust innovation engine, improving commercial capabilities. Joaquin talked to you about how we're investing in our future with 10 new products we plan to file by 2019, each with a potential to exceed $1 billion in annual sales. And in fact, we are already delivering one of those promising medicines to the market, 4 months ahead of schedule with the U.S. approval for DARZALEX, the first human monoclonal antibody to be approved anywhere in the world for patients with multiple myeloma, which is off to a very good start.
In the near term, I know many of you are keeping an eye on potential biosimilar completion in the United States. As you've heard us say, biosimilars are not generics. With more than 2.4 million people having been treated with REMICADE and about 70% of the current patients receiving sustained and effective treatment, we believe doctors will be reluctant to switch them off with that level of success. And we've seen this play out in many markets where biosimilars have already been introduced. And we also have a patent for REMICADE that expires in September 2018 that we'll obviously continue to vigorously defend.
We consider our Immunology products part of an important and robust portfolio for patients, physicians and payers. So when you consider our continued expectations for REMICADE as well as the future potential of products like STELARA and SIMPONI and the pending submissions of guselkumab and sirukumab, we are confident in our ability to continue driving strong growth from our Immunology portfolio.
When you combine these advances with additional line extension approvals expected in 2016 like those for IMBRUVICA, STELARA and INVOKANA and DARZALEX approval in the EU, our near-term pipeline is incredibly robust and may not be fully appreciated in the market. With the combined strength of our end market portfolio and deep late-stage pipeline, we expect to deliver above-industry compound average growth through 2019.
Our consumer expertise, insight and access are becoming increasingly valuable to payers and providers as demographic and technology trends in health care are moving the system toward more consumer-driven decision-making and in some cases, self-care alternatives. We see this as a key differentiator for our company, and we're investing in technologies that help us exploit this expertise across our broad base. Jorge Mesquita and our other consumer business leaders will share more details at our consumer business review this May.
For 2015, our U.S. OTC business continue to grow faster than the market, and we're happy to report that nearly all of our OTC products have returned to shelves, and we are proud of the quality system improvements we have put into place.
Our consumer Medical Device businesses, the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Solution companies and Johnson & Johnson Vision Care made progress in 2015 to improve our competitiveness. Both businesses, which command global leadership positions in their respective categories, focused their 2015 turnarounds on launching new products, solidifying their base businesses and accelerating growth.  And both businesses have regained or stabilized market share and market leadership and introduced important new product such as Animas Vibe and ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day with HydraLuxe in the U.S.
In our broader Medical Device businesses, last week, we announced a strategic restructuring initiative designed to directly support and accelerate the strategy Gary Pruden laid out for you on our third quarter earnings call. We are reallocating resources to priority platforms like endocutters, knees, trauma and EP. And recent history showed that when we doubled down in an area, we are able to accelerate meaningful innovation and outcomes as we saw with our endocutters portfolio, which is now the fastest-growing platform in our Medical Devices segment.
Additionally, we're making progress on transforming our go-to-market models like our cross-selling efforts between Ethicon and DePuy Synthes' joint reconstruction and spine, which resulted in over 600 leads through 2015. We are now co-selling in over 1,200 accounts, and all sales teams will be trained, covering all markets by the end of the first quarter.
And finally, our recent acquisition of Coherex Medical in the area of atrial fibrillation and the surgical robotics collaboration with Verily, formerly Google Life Sciences, are examples of the type of focus and strategic investments that you will see us make more of in the future.
Our goal is to reach more patients, outperform the markets in which we compete and consistently identify, build and acquire new platforms for growth. Moving forward into 2016, we will continue to take bold but appropriate steps to put our Medical Device business in the best position to deliver more value for customers and for our company and for our shareholders.
In summary, we believe that improved universal access to quality health care, rewarding innovation and a more vital culture of health, wellness and prevention are the keys to a future where people are healthier and businesses and economies are stronger. Our broad-based experience and scale uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader and partner of choice in the movement towards outcomes and episodes of care based approaches and ultimately, a healthier society. We are optimistic about the future opportunities in health care and confident in the strength of our business.
In 2016, we will remain focused on our near-term priorities and continue to advance our longer-term growth drivers, enabling us to continue delivering shareholder value year after year. With the guidance of our credo, we'll continue to meet our responsibilities to all stakeholders. That's been true for 129 years of breakthrough, life-saving innovation, and we are confident Johnson & Johnson is well positioned to continue meeting those responsibilities for the next 130 years.
Thank you. I look forward to further dialogue during the Q&A session. But first, I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso, who will talk more about our results and expectations for 2016. Dominic?"

As you've heard from Alex, we're very pleased with our 2015 performance. We believe we managed our business well, and I provided you insights during the year in a transparent manner that allowed all of you to understand our plans and expectations. We finished the year strong and we're carrying that momentum into 2016. We ended the year at the top end of our operational guidance range for both sales and earnings and exceeded estimates for earnings as published by our first call.
Turning to the next slide. You can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the full year 2015. I'd first like to remind you about some of the key assumptions in our guidance for 2015. At the beginning of the year, we discussed that, while we reinvested some of the profitability from OLYSIO sales, our earnings in 2014 did benefit by approximately $0.20 per share even after those investments, making 2015 comparisons to 2014 results more challenging.
Additionally, currency headwinds increased quite substantially in 2015, negatively impacting both sales and earnings for 2015 by approximately 8%. Given those expected headwinds, last January, we guided that we would deliver operational sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%. As you can see, well reported sales results show a decrease of 5.7%, on an operational basis, we ended up at the high end of our guidance with operational sales growth at 1.8%.
We also provided you with an estimate of our underlying operational sales growth for 2015, which excluded the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of hepatitis C sales. We expected that underlying operational growth would be approximately 6%, and we exceeded that estimate, delivering 6.5%.
On earnings, our adjusted operational EPS growth in our original 2015 guidance was expected to range between 2.3% and 4.7%. As reported this morning, our EPS of $6.20 reflects operational growth of 5.8% and is at the top of the updated EPS guidance range we gave in October. And finally, our adjusted net income margin improved to 24.9%.
Now let's take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. Turning to the next slide. You can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015.
As we expected, direct comparisons to our fourth quarter of 2014 will be challenging to the stronger OLYSIO sales that we benefited from last year as well as divestitures and currency headwinds in 2015. Our results on an operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and excluding the impact of hep C sales, were up 7.8% for the quarter. As Louise noted, sales did benefit from additional shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Please now direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings were $4 billion in the quarter, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 versus $1.37 a year ago are up 5.1%. And the adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by first call. Excluding the impact of translational currency, our operational adjusted EPS was $1.54 or up 12.4% for the fourth quarter.
In the quarter, we incurred intangible amortization expense of $200 million on an after-tax basis as well as after-tax special charges of $600 million, which included an expense of $400 million related to the restructuring of our Medical Device business, which we announced last week and in-process research and development charge of $200 million.
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold was 30 basis points lower than the same period last year, impacted by changes in our business and product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 33.1% of sales. This is 120 basis points higher than last year as we continued to invest to drive growth in our key brands 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales were 16.1% in the quarter and 170 basis points higher than the prior year as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we entered into important new licensing agreements, made milestone payments and increased spending to advance our R&D portfolio, which are all positive developments as we continue to strengthen our pipeline.
Interest expense net of interest income was slightly lower, reflecting higher earnings on our investments. Other income and expense was a net gain of $1.2 billion in the quarter compared to a net charge of approximately $1 billion in the same period last year. Of course, this line item includes several special items of both years. Excluding those special items, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion compared to a net gain of approximately $130 million in the prior year period. This year's fourth quarter reflects the gain on the previously announced divestiture of Cordis.
As a reminder, we indicated that any gains from divestitures, which are reflected in the other income and expense line, would largely be reinvested in the business as well as used to mitigate the negative impact of currency and the lower level of income in 2015 from reduced OLYSIO sales. And therefore, our pretax operating margin would be expected to be lower in 2015 versus 2014. And our 2015 results reflect just that. We funded important investments with the higher level of other income that will benefit us going forward.
The adjusted fourth quarter effective tax rate for 2015 was 17.7%. This was lower than the rate in the previous 9 months due to the passing of legislation which renewed the R&D tax credit and look-through provisions. The R&D tax credit and look-through provisions were always included in our annual guidance. The adjusted full year effective tax rate for 2015 was 20.7%, slightly below guidance due to the mix of income from higher to lower tax jurisdictions.
Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. Adjusted income before tax for the entire enterprise improved from 30.7% of sales in '14 to 31.4% of sales in 2015.
Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment. Medical Devices expanded 360 basis points, due primarily to the gain associated with the Cordis divestiture, while Pharmaceutical margins contracted 50 basis points due to the lower OLYSIO sales and increased investments in research and development, partially offset by the gain earlier in the year of divestiture of NUCYNTA.
Consumer margins contracted 110 basis points due to lower divestitures gains in 2015 versus 2014 as well as important investments for future growth as we returned our iconic consumer brands to the market.
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I'll first give you some guidance on items we know may be difficult to forecast.
I would first like to address our cash position and remind you about our capital allocation approach. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.5 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $38.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $20 billion of debt. This is a higher level of cash than we typically hold. And as Alex said earlier, we are actively looking for the right opportunities to deploy that capital to create greater value for our shareholders. But we are patient. We are seeking companies with a mutual desire to partner and will only act when we see the right value-creating deal at the right price with the right partners.
We have a transparent and disciplined capital allocation strategy that starts with dividends to our shareholders, followed by value-creating M&A and then we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as share repurchase programs. And due to our strong balance sheet, we have the financial strength and flexibility to execute on all 3 of these capital allocation priorities simultaneously.
During Q4 2015, we used approximately $1 billion to repurchase shares of our stock in connection with our $10 billion share repurchase program that we announced in October. Although we are continuing to evaluate external value-creating opportunities in line with this strategy, the purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, we suggest you consider modeling 2016 net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million.
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses, providing from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs.
We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Although we expect to have a significantly lower level of other income in 2016 versus 2015, our pretax operating margin in 2016 is expected to expand by more than 200 basis points.
As we've discussed several times during the year, we continue to evaluate our portfolio, and we expected at any gains from divestitures would be lower than the level we saw in 2015. However, we also discussed that we would nonetheless improve on earnings as we see the benefits of good expense management and meaningful investments we made in 2015.
And now a word on taxes. We're very pleased that the R&D tax credit was made permanent and approved by Congress this last year. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016 excluding special items of approximately 19.5% to 20.5%.
Turning to sales and earnings guidance. Our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrance for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrance for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO.
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be first based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business and will also provide an estimate of our sales and earnings and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.
For the full year of 2016, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. Additionally, while we have comparison to how we describe our sales and results in 2015, our 2015 operating sales growth, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales, was approximately 6.5%. After adjusting for extra shipping days in 2015, that underlying growth rate was approximately 5.5% 2015. Our sales guidance for '16 on the same basis is expected to continue at a similar growth rate of around 5.5%.
While the euro has been fairly stable over the last few months, many of the other currencies have been volatile. Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro at $1.09, our guidance for sales growth would decrease by approximately 1.5%. We are watching the other currencies closely as it is uncertain as to how they will settle out for the year. Of course, we will update the assessment as we progress throughout the year.
Plus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 1% to 2% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $70.8 billion to $71.5 billion.
Now turning to earnings. A continuing factor impacting earnings guidance for 2016 is the impact of currency movements on transactions, which, although hedged, is still somewhat negative. We expect transaction currency impacts to negatively impact our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $6.53 to $6.68 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth rates of 5% to 8%.
Again, we're not predicting the impact of currency movements. But to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, with the euro at $1.09, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.43 to $6.58 per share. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range, which, at approximately 5%, is higher than current consensus estimate.
So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I'd like to make a few points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 2.5% and 3.5%, we're pleased to note, when excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales, our operational sales growth is expected to be around 5.5% for the full year 2016. With regards to expected EPS growth on an operational basis, our adjusted EPS growth guidance is strong in the range of 5% to 8%.
Also for 2016, pretax operating margins are expected to expand by more than 200 basis points based on the guidance I just provided. The margin expansion is driven by a combination of investments we made in 2015, coupled with the benefit of disciplined expense management across the enterprise.
Moving into 2016. We are confident in the strength of our business. As we execute our growth plans and near-term priorities that Alex laid out for you this morning, we're well positioned with the strong balance sheet to deliver solid results while continuing to invest in innovation, which will ensure our future growth and success. Our goal remains to grow our sales organically at a rate faster than the markets in which we compete, grow our earnings faster than sales and create value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that generate additional growth. All of this, coupled with our strong dividend yield, provides a very compelling long-term shareholder return 
Finally, before I turn it over to Louise for Q&A, just a reminder to please save the date for our Consumer and Medical Device Business Review on Wednesday, May 18.

And finally, we have talked a lot about our various programs of reducing our cost structure. And Alex today mentioned the program that we're embarking -- that we embarked on several years ago that will reduce costs by $1 billion by 2018. Well, we're well on our way in implementing that program after several years of investment.

At the same time, we've been making changes internally with the way that our organizations are innovating as well as in the way that they're going to market. And so we see this as the next logical step in that overall process. Our Medical Device business is one that we remain very committed to. We believe that it's got an exciting future, a lot of new innovation coming, new ways of dealing with our customers.

Look, overall, we feel that we're still in the very early innings out of what I would call as the market evolution that we clearly expect to see over the next 3, 5 and even 10 years. Now for all the reasons that we've discussed around increasing demands based on demographics, certainly here in the U.S., and a rising middle class and demographics outside the United States and the pressure that, that's likely going to put on payers and governments and others in between, we realize that there is an opportunity for us to participate, not only in bringing great innovations that's going to help patients, but also doing it in a value-added way. And clearly, the consumer, the patient, is weighing in much heavier in these decisions as they take on higher copays as they can get more information that's available online. And frankly, they just have higher expectations about their ability to participate in that health care decision-making process. So what we see is a range of customers, but we see some customers who are still very innovation focused. And to be clear, we remain very innovation focused. We think, at the end of the day, what we do best is bring new products, new solutions to our customers that are going to ultimately have better outcomes for patients. And so that's an area where we are very focused on and we'll continue to be focused on. We are though starting to [ph] also see hospital systems. And I think one important point here is it's certainly taking place in the United States, but it's also definitely taking place in places like Europe and even some of the developing and emerging markets that frankly don't have the history and the legacy of some of the infrastructure that you see in the more developed markets. In there, it -- what we see is an evolution more towards the business-to-business relationship where yes, customers want to see innovation, but they also want to see how are you going to interact, how can you assist in working with our supply chain to make it more efficient, how can we work together as part of a broader partnership that ultimately is focusing not just on a product sell, but actually on outcome, on an episodic care for the patient and it creates a much broader partnership. We are seeing those organizations becoming more and more interested, and that's why we're adapting to make sure that we're part of that. So I think, overall, it's important that we continue to innovate, we continue to operate with a lot of excellence in the current environment. At the same time, it's important that we set the stage for this evolution that's taking place out there to make sure that we cannot only be successful, that we're -- but we'll actually be a leader as that market evolves as well."

I think what we would say overall is we continue to see, let's say, a slightly increasing positive trends. So we saw hospital admissions, I believe, up around 2%, we saw surgical procedures up a little over 1% in the U.S., that's the most recent data that we have. If you go outside a U.S., we think rates in Europe have been pretty steady. And even in the markets in which we compete most significantly, in the developing markets, we haven't seen a major impact from secular shifts perhaps in China some, but not dramatic. And then putting that into context, what that represents overall on our business, we don't see it as a major indicator. As I look towards 2016, look, there's a few things that cause us to be optimistic about our Medical Device business. It really starts with innovation. And we've got about 30 products that we'll be launching by the end of 2016. Over half of those have either been launched or well on their way as we speak. And what we're seeing is when we're bringing new technologies to the market like our new contact lenses, like our new insulin pump, like our new energy instrumentation, like the ATTUNE Knee, we're seeing very good uptake. And in fact, in those categories, we're seeing share gains. And certainly, in areas like electrophysiology, endocutters, the same thing. And so we believe that the market does still reward significant innovation when we're introducing it. So that's one aspect. The second aspect, frankly, is one, just improved execution. And I think if you look across all of our device businesses, if you think about diabetes care, the major price reset that we had there a couple of years ago -- and as all of you know, when you're -- when you take that kind of a reduction, resizing your business, going back in each and every line and setting it for the new marketplace caused us an tremendous amount of change. If you look at our Vision Care business last year, we went in and we really increased the cadence out of our innovation pipeline, launching 5 new products. We did a price reset there to make us more competitive with the ECPs. We made a lot of other internal adjustments to improve our selling and marketing. We are definitely seeing the impact of that now, not only on the sales results of about 8%, but as -- maybe even more importantly, if you look at the leading indicators as far as new share that's being generated and new patient starts in the offices, those things are positive. Louise mentioned earlier the improvement that we're seeing across the Orthopaedics business. And look, this is one where we know that when you bring large organizations together, when you standardize quality systems, manufacturing systems, we think that we've made a lot of progress there. And frankly, when you compound that with the innovation rollout that we've seen in Orthopaedics of the ATTUNE Knee, the CORAIL Hip, the TFNA nail, we're starting to see that come back as well as some of the, frankly, the new approaches that we're taking that Gary will be talking more about in May where our Ethicon and our DePuy Synthes teams were actually co-selling, co-contracting in a number of very innovative ways, compounded with the fact that -- look, we think some of the performance issues related to China in our Orthopaedics are more of a onetime event. That's getting normalized. So as we burn our way through those and head into 2016 overall, we think that innovation, we think changes in our commercial model, we think improved execution, all those things are -- make us more optimistic about the growth prospects as we head into 2016."

And we think there's a few things to keep in consideration about this. And first and foremost is that as Dominic stated earlier, biosimilars are very different from generics. And particularly, in this category, I think keeping the patient in the center of all these -- we've got a tremendous amount of experience in the biologics category going back to PROCRIT, REMICADE some of our days. And we think the differences between molecules can have -- manifest themselves in significant ways with patients. So making sure -- and I think things that we'll be watching for the AC or what kind of data that the biosimilars actually have, what kind of indications, what will be the guidance around substitutability. All those, frankly, sitting here today, are unknowns. We'll need more clarification. But we think each of those means that the expected uptake, even when a biosimilar does launch, will lead to a significantly different curve than what you see with generics. We think, secondly, it's very important -- if you actually think about it from a patient perspective. And we know, for example, there's about 2.5 million patients with REMICADE, and about 70% of those are either continuing therapy and have a pretty high satisfaction rate. So if you look at the available population who's likely to be switched, we think it's in the 30% range. And last but certainly not least, there's the whole issue of the business model and the way that we actually work with customers in this setting. And this is an area where we've got a lot of experience in contracting. We've got some great relationships with providers in this area right now. We also have a very broad portfolio. If you think about what REMICADE does, but you look more broadly at the performance recently of a product like STELARA, a multibillion dollar compound, growing at 20-plus percent rate; if you look at SIMPONI, same thing, SIMPONI ARIA, in particular, the great dosing convenience that it provides, that's another multibillion addition that we have to that portfolio, then you augment that with the submissions that we have in 2016 planned for, guselkumab, sirukumab and IL 23 and then IL-6, we think that, that positions us very well with our portfolio and from a contracting point of view with large providers and payers in certainly in the U.S. but also abroad. What we're seeing outside the United States is that most of the markets where they're introduced is a relatively minor impact. We're seeing that we're holding on to about 90% plus or minus. It varies by market. You have to look at each one individually. And it's difficult to project exactly what that impact will be going forward. But I think when we think of it broadly across all those different areas, what's the clinical data show, what ultimately is the labeling, the regulatory aspects, what about our contracting, the business aspects, and we think all those are very important, will result in a different impact from biosimilars. And ultimately, we'll continue to defend our intellectual property as well through what we believe is the right path in September of 2018."

Do you have a sense for what The Street was assuming for nonoperating income? When I go back historically, that's been in the $500 million to $600 million range.

Just curious know if that savings is reinvested in the business or if that is part of the guidance. And then for you, Alex, just curious to know your thoughts on pricing. I mean, we heard Bernie and Hillary last night go after drug pricing again. And I think that's also something we're going to hear from the Republican candidates.

Jami, let me try to take the first 2 and then have Alex -- maybe he'll comment on the drug pricing. You were referring to our nonoperating, now let's call it the other income and expense line for 2016, what was assumed in analyst models versus what we have provided in guidance. When we looked at the analyst consensus models, overall, it looks like that number averaged in the high $900 million, so nearly $1 billion. And our guidance, of course, is somewhere at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. So our guidance is slightly higher than the analyst models. But just as a reminder, we always take the opportunity to -- these are portfolio choices to use any of those gains to offset some other expenses we'd like to invest in. And then with respect to the Medical Device Tax, the -- we have assumed that it would be a benefit in 2016. But I must say, the benefit for us is very, very minor. Remember, when the Medical Device Tax is incurred, it's incurred upon the first manufacturer of a product and therefore, it can be, for example, orthopedic companies hung up in inventory for quite some time. So the overall impact of not having a Medical Device Tax in 2016 is not significant for Johnson & Johnson. It may be significant for certain other companies that maybe are pure orthopedic players, but not overall significant for us. And secondly, I would say that whatever benefit we see there, we've already assumed would be reinvested in innovation as, of course, during the time that the Medical Device Tax was a drag on earnings, obviously, decisions had to be made on where to invest.

And we believe that it's important to consider it just in that way. As we think about pharmaceuticals, for example, they currently make up about 12% of health care spending in the United States, slightly higher in Europe. If you think about medical devices, they represent about 6%. And if you go beyond those areas, of course, there's a lot of other cost built into that system, ranging from hospital, patient care, insurance companies, many other people and particularly, in an environment today, where frankly, we're seeing such transformational outcomes and moving more and more towards cures, disease prevention, interception than we ever have because of some of the great science that's being produced. So we understand and would certainly expect there to be a continued spotlight in this area. Obviously, we're working with a lot of stakeholders to try and make sure that we look at it in a very holistic way. And it's very, I think, difficult, at this point in time, to try to project what's going to happen in 2016 or 2017. All of us know that the health care system, not only here in the United States, but frankly, around the world, is complex. There's a lot of other -- a lot of issues that are intertwined and -- but it's obviously a conversation that we'll be participating in and ultimately, where we want to be a part of the solution."

Look, I just picked up what Dominic had just said about our Consumer business is that I'm really proud of the work that we've done on the Consent Decree and the great strides that they have taken around quality. In fact, I think in working closely and partnering with the FDA, we likely have a benchmark organization now, and we're really proud having done that. At the same time, I think as they begin to shift from only remediation to remediation and relaunch, across a number of these areas, while certainly keeping a very high eye on quality, as we increase our volumes, as we are able to deepen our relationships with a lot of the major trade partners, that's where we see a great growth opportunity as well and obviously, that's going to have an impact in our margins as we go forward. I also think that the other thing that, that team is doing is as we're transitioning more and more to online marketing versus just traditional marketing, the way we're partnering with some of the large customers, I think there's a lot of opportunities not only to drive share and volume, but actually to improve efficiencies on our back end as well. As I step back and look more broadly, look, we think the 3 areas that we're in, consumer, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, are all great platform and great businesses. Of course, we would look, first, for areas that -- what is the next ZYTIGA? What's the next Vision Care platform? What's the next NEUTROGENA? That would certainly be our focus. Another would be, are there chances to grow in perhaps some of the faster-growing developing markets with the right kind of opportunity? Those are things that we would be interested in. And then what are ways to complement our existing businesses? I think the way that you point it out, as the markets evolve, we are looking, not only at M&A, but also broader partnerships that we've done, for example, with companies like Google, barely where we see a big opportunity to really help transform the robotics surgery space in a pretty significant way longer term. And then, I guess, so the final option there would be for us to actually acquire something outside the current 3. And again, if it's something where we thought there was a lot of unmet patient or consumer need, if we feel that it's consistent with the capabilities that we can bring to bear to actually have it be a successful business, if the financials work, then we would take that step."

Our plans are for improved growth in China in 2016. But I just want to put China in perspective. It's less than 5% of our sales. It's an important market for us longer term with 1.3 billion people and lots of health care needs, et cetera. But any short-term changes in their economy is unlikely to have any significant impact on our results. And then on the 200 basis point improvement, Bob, it's actually across all 3 lines of the P&L, COGS, selling, marketing as well as R&D. So in the case of COGS where we have a long-term program that we've been executing on to reduce footprint, we're accelerating some of those programs that will benefit us in the COGS line, on the selling, marketing and administrative line. I talked earlier about the fact that we had a program in place for a couple of years, shooting for $1 billion of cost savings by 2018, we're well on our way. We'll see cost reductions in that line. In R&D, that depends on the individual licensing deals that we have and the timing of when we would spend those milestone payments or enter into new licensing agreements. But as it looks today, the advancement in the portfolio in 2015 from the milestone payments, et cetera, are not expected to be at the same level in '16 that they were in '15. So it's across all 3 lines in the P&L. And I can't give you an exact number on the amount of investment we made in '15, extra investment made in '15. But just to say that we had $2.8 billion of other income in 2015, well above the year that's passed, and we still improved overall income before tax by not quite that amount, right? So most of it was reinvested in the business."

And obviously, as we think about it, for example, in our Pharmaceutical group, we think that the model that we pull together, while we try to find the next INVOKANA, the next DARZALEX, very early compounds, where frankly we've got solid scientific insights, we bring it inside. And because of our clinical development, our regulatory capabilities, we can launch, and then very strong sales marketing and reimbursement practices around that. Frankly, that's what helped us create the number of billion-dollar blockbusters that we've been able to launch since 2009, I think 16 new products and 7 of which are like right at $1 billion or shortly will be. And so we think that's a good model. In Medical Devices, we've done tuck-ins as well as large. And look, I think in both cases, whether it's Pharma or Medical Devices, the smaller tuck-ins are frankly more straightforward to get done. We haven't shied -- we won't shy away from large where we think it makes for a significant opportunity, and it's something that we'll continue to look at in Consumer. As far as the question that it's underperforming, now I think it depends on why it's underperforming. If it's a market -- if it's an in exogenous market shift or something else, then obviously, that would not necessarily have a shy away from that particular area. On the other hand, if it's an internal, more executional issue, absolutely, we'd want to make sure that we've got the knitting where we need it before we add on to that particular opportunity. So that's the way we tend to look at it. But again, it's part of a broader strategic question really on how we're managing the portfolio across the enterprise."

Joining me on the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
I'll begin by briefly reviewing results for the corporation and for our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on 2015 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes.
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies. This slide lists acknowledgment of those relationships not otherwise referenced in today's presentations.
Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2015. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015, down 2.4% versus fourth quarter of 2014. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.4% and currency had a negative impact of 6.8%. In the U.S., sales were up 8%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 1.2%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 12.9%.
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew 2.8%, while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 0.9% and Europe grew 0.8%. Growth in all regions was negatively impacted by the divestiture of the Cordis business with Europe, Latin America and Canada also negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was 7.8% worldwide, 13.4% in the U.S. and 2.9% outside the U.S.
I'd like to point out that our 2015 fiscal year included an additional week. Since this week occurred during a holiday period, we did not achieve a full week of sales. However, we did have a few more shipping days. These additional shipment days added approximately 4 points to the quarterly sales growth rate and 1 point to the annual growth rate. The additional sales are more heavily skewed to the U.S. While these few shipping days added to sales, we also had a full week's worth of operating costs, therefore, the bottom line impact was negligible.
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $3.2 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.15 versus $0.89 a year ago. As referenced in the tables reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2015 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $220 million and a net charge of $608 million for after-tax special items. 2014 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $275 million and a charge of approximately $1.1 billion for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $1.44, representing increases of 4% and 5.1%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2014. Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 12.4%.
Now turning to the financial highlights for the full year of 2015. Consolidated sales to customers for the year of 2015 were $70.1 billion, a decrease of 5.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis, sales grew 1.8% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 7.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 6.5% worldwide, 10.6% in the U.S. and 3% outside the U.S.
Turning now to earnings. 2015 annual net earnings were $15.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $5.48. For the year, 2015 adjusted net earnings were $17.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $6.20, down 4.8% and 3%, respectively, versus the 2014 results. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 5.8%. Estimated free cash flow for the year was strong at $15.9 billion, up $1.1 billion versus 2014.
Turning now to quarterly business segment highlights. Please note, percentage of quota  represent operational sales changes in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2014 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation.
I'll begin with the consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.3 billion increased 1.8%, with U.S. sales down 4.9%, while outside the U.S., sales grew 5.5%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 4.7% worldwide, 1.7% in the U.S. and 6.3% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by worldwide OTC and Oral Care as well as Women's Health outside the U.S. OTC sales results in the U.S. were driven by ZYRTEC and product relaunches for digestive health products.
Strong growth for analgesics was partially offset by timing of inventory builds as noted in the third quarter and a slower start to the flu season. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 13.5%, up from approximately 11.5% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 45.5%, up from approximately 42% a year ago.
Results outside the U.S. were driven by strong sales of upper respiratory products and the relaunch of anti-smoking products. Strong sales momentum, driven by successful marketing campaigns and geographic expansion for new products, drove results for LISTERINE and Oral Care and in Women's Health products outside the U.S.
Moving now to our pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.1 billion increased 6.5%, with U.S. sales up 12.7% and sales outside the U.S. down 0.9%. Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales results. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 11.1% worldwide and 21% in the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. declined approximately 0.2%, with strong growth of new and core products, offset primarily by lower sales of REMICADE and SIMPONI to our distribution partner.
Important contributors to growth were STELARA, INVOKANA/INVOKAMET, IMBRUVICA, INVEGA SUSTENNA and XEPLION, XARELTO and U.S. sales of REMICADE. STELARA achieved strong growth across all the major regions, driven by robust market growth and increased penetration with the psoriatic arthritis indication. Strong momentum in market share drove results for INVOKANA/INVOKAMET. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET achieved 6.5% total prescriptions share or TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, up from 4.2% last year. TRx with endocrinologists was 12.8% for the quarter and 5.8% in primary care. Strong patient uptake with demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. IMBRUVICA is the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second-line CLL and MCL.
Outside the U.S., results were driven primarily by Europe with strong patient uptake and shared momentum. IMBRUVICA is now approved in over 60 countries. As an update on our oncology pipeline, we received FDA approval for DARZALEX in November. DARZALEX is off to a robust start with strong underlying market demand. INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved strong results in all major regions primarily due to increased market share and the launch earlier this year of INVEGA TRINZA.
Continued share growth drove XARELTO sales results with TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market of 16.1%, up nearly 1.5 points from a year ago. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product copay.
REMICADE in the U.S. benefited from strong market growth, partially offset by lower market share. REMICADE U.S. export sales and international sales were negatively impacted by lower distribution partner sales due to the weakening of the euro and the loss of exclusivity in Europe, partially offset by a higher inventory reduction last year. Strong results were achieved in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S.
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. As a reminder, we announced last week that we will use a new format for the reporting of sales in the Medical Devices segment, and we provided historical sales results in the new format at that time. The historical sales are available on our website.
Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 3.4%. U.S. sales increased 6.7%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was approximately 5.8% worldwide, with the U.S. up 8% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by surgery, orthopedics, electrophysiology and Vision Care, partially offset by the divestiture of the Cordis business.
Growth in our surgery business was driven by strong results for the advanced products with endocutters growth of 15%, biosurgical's growth of 9% and energy growth of 5%. In addition, ASP and Mentor products and our specialty products made significant contributions to sales in the quarter.
Market growth, additional selling days and new products drove strong results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The successful introduction in early 2015 of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the success of the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stent platform in hips and ORTHOVISC, MONOVISC in spine or other made important information contributions to the results.
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by result in China due to softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Spine, other and trauma were the categories most impacted. Our electrophysiology business grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by the success of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH Catheter. Vision Care results were driven by very strong growth in the U.S. due to the introduction of new products as well as the trade inventory build.
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter of 2015. For your reference, there were some notable developments in the fourth quarter, which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your models. Lastly, to assist you in updating your models for the full year 2015, on our website, you will find annual sales highlights by segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?"

Let me start by saying how optimistic and confident I am as we enter 2016. We had a strong finish to 2015. With our healthy balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue to invest for future growth. Our core business is very strong, and we expect a number of additional new products and line extensions in the coming year.
Now as we enter 2016, we look forward to: First, continued growth of core products across our segments; next, a rich near-term pipeline in our Pharmaceutical segment; positive momentum in our Consumer segment with a full portfolio of OTCs back on the market; setting a strong foundation for sustainable growth with the bold actions we are taking in our Medical Devices segment; and continued financial strength and strong free cash flows to return capital to shareholders and take disciplined and decisive actions regarding M&A that contribute to sustainable growth and long-term value creation.
Now I'll share more specifics in my discussion with you today about the health care environment, our 2015 results and why we're so optimistic and confident about the future for the enterprise in each of our business segments. But with that as a backdrop, I'd like to begin where I always do by talking about our credo.
Our credo is the beginning of everything at Johnson & Johnson. It guides all of our decisions, and I believe it sets us apart. This year's Johnson & Johnson's 130th year, think of that for a moment. 130 years of working to balance our mission of helping people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives. And I'm proud to see the employees of Johnson & Johnson around the world continuing to uphold the imperatives of our credo every day, through both our philanthropy initiatives and recent commitment to supporting the immediate and ongoing needs of Syrian refugees in partnership with Save the Children as well as to our commitments of the health care community with investments that will accelerate how we address global health crises like Ebola, AIDS and mental health.
You undoubtedly heard me say that I believe health care is one of society's greatest challenges. And this global challenge grows with aging populations, rising cost in developed world and growing middle classes in emerging economies. We have increasing expectations for access to quality care. Now as the world's largest and most broadly based health care company, it's not just an opportunity for us to help manage this transformation. It is our responsibility to help lead the way to a better future.
Now in this environment, ensuring access to important medicines and medical procedures remains a key objective for us. As government officials, politicians and other stakeholders debate significant issues around the world, we're pleased to see that health care is such a focus in the dialogue. And we believe that our goals and those of public policymakers are aligned to find the best ways to ensure the delivery of quality health care and the best patient outcomes in a high quality and sustainable manner. Now in this discussion, it's a responsibility of all stakeholders to consider the economic and financial implications of health care. We got to look at the whole picture, drugs, devices, insurers, hospitals and governments put the patient in the center and reward innovations that drive better outcomes.
Here in the United States, prescription drugs represent approximately 12% of total health care costs and medical devices represent around 6%. These cures and treatments not only improve quality of life for many patients, extend life for others and contribute to the productivity of our society, but they can also help to reduce caregiver burden, disability and health care spending overall. The promise of innovation and health care is great. It will remain great if we can take a holistic approach to reforming the health care system.
At Johnson & Johnson, we believe in this holistic approach to health care solutions. It's vital to developing the best innovations, to meeting the needs of our stakeholders and to sustaining our legacy of strong and consistent business performance. Our consumer Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals segments are increasingly interconnected businesses. And we believe that being broadly based in health care has been and will continue to be a significant factor in Johnson & Johnson's success as it positions us well to lead and grow our business with the evolving health care landscape.
Our broad global footprint enables us to reach more patients and consumers in fast-developing and changing markets. In fact, Johnson & Johnson is operating in 60 countries today, and we are continuing to invest in implementing new operating models, forging strong relationships with local governments and health systems and further accelerating growth through strategic acquisitions and partnerships with local companies.
Because of our broad base across health care, we are uniquely positioned to be a partner of choice. Now let me just go over a few examples. With large health systems, we are taking more of a business-to-business model to help them with innovative contracting strategies, integrated services and solutions and with dedicated customer-focused teams. We're working with technology companies like Google, IBM and Apple. We're advancing medical innovation through an infusion of technology that can benefit from the deep health care expertise Johnson & Johnson can uniquely provide.
We're continuing to support biotech and med tech start-ups who appreciate the value we place on innovation and the reach and breadth of our footprint in the health care market. And with public health organizations, we have a tremendous opportunity to address the gaps that remain in innovation, access and delivery of effective prevention and treatment. We're collaborating more than ever before to meet the world's most pressing public health challenges.
Our scale, financial flexibility and business and health care expertise make Johnson & Johnson a key partner for a number of our stakeholders, and our relationships with these partners will help Johnson & Johnson continue to be a leader in the future. Applying our expertise in design thinking, strategic innovation models and a commitment to collaborating with all stakeholders, we've developed a number of cross-segment innovations.
For example, we've created the China Lung Cancer Center, which is developing a holistic approach to treat lung cancer in China where the disease is particularly prevalent. We're pioneering cell therapy for age-related macular degeneration, combining technologies from Pharma and from our Vision business to find a way to address this condition. And we're leveraging capabilities from our Medical Devices, Pharma and Consumer businesses to treat obesity and diabetes in new ways. In fact, almost every one of our programs can benefit from the advantages of our broad base.
Over the past several years, we've also been leveraging our scale by developing enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our sectors, targeting as much as $1 billion in operational savings by 2018 to support our growth. And we believe the innovation that is taking place within our supply chain and quality systems is actually creating a competitive advantage for Johnson & Johnson.
But the bottom line, well, it's the bottom line. And this broad-based structure has helped us deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance. Let's consider some of the numbers.
First, 53 consecutive years of dividend increases at Johnson & Johnson. That means we have provided steady dividend increases since we first put a man in space. And 32 years of consecutive adjusted operational earnings growth, more than 3 decades.
Over the past 10 years, we have returned approximately 70% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And today, 70% of our revenues come from brands that are #1 or #2 in their markets. We have 24 brands that represent billion-dollar platforms. If you think about that, in 1999, the entire corporation had revenues of $24 billion, and about 25% of our sales come from brands launched in the last 5 years. That's a result of constant learning, collaboration and innovation.
Our corporate structure, our broad base is a strategic choice and one that is grounded our performance, not just our heritage. We know it has been a significant driver in the past and expect it will be more important in the future.
As we've said, we see global health care growing at 3% to 5% over the next 5 years, and we have a clear objective that Johnson & Johnson should grow sales organically at a faster rate than the market. We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. In addition, we will continue to create value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that generate additional growth. All of this, coupled with our strong dividend yield, and you are a looking at a very compelling long-term total shareholder return.
As part of our performance-driven strategy, we regularly review the structure and portfolio of our businesses to evaluate how they're delivering on our responsibilities to the stakeholders outlined in our credo, meeting evolving health care needs and achieving performance expectations. Johnson & Johnson has a rigorous and disciplined portfolio review program focused on creating long-term shareholder value, and this applies to all our businesses.
We have a track record of evolving our business and taking decisive actions when necessary to meet changing industry and consumer dynamics, and we'll continue to do so in the future. We're actively looking for the right opportunities to create greater value for our shareholders. We are seeking companies with the mutual desire to partner, but we're also patient. We will only act when we see the right value-creating deal at the right price and with the right partners.
Now historically, about half of our growth has come from M&A and half from internal development, which we fully expect to continue, and with our strong balance sheet, we've got the resources to do just that.
Now let me take a few minutes to review the priorities we laid out for you last year. One, we will continue to be focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. Two, in Pharmaceuticals, our objective, as always, is constant innovation. We're building on our launch excellence and continuing to develop a robust pipeline of transformational medicines.
In our Consumer business, we positioned our entire portfolio to focus on key geographies, need states and mega-brands. We are prioritizing and investing to expand our market leadership in key consumer segments in OTC, Oral Care, Baby and Beauty. And as you heard through our announcement last week, our priority in Medical Devices is accelerating growth through the strategic investments in innovation and by transforming our go-to-market models. We're confident that these priorities will deliver the results that you expect from us and just as importantly, the results that we expect from ourselves.
As we've said, we are pleased with our 2015 performance. In 2015, we generated sales of $70.1 billion, reflecting strong underlying operational growth across our enterprise. Our end market portfolio and Pharmaceuticals delivered strong growth. We built positive momentum in our Consumer segment, and we've just announced bold actions to accelerate growth in our Medical Device segment.
Throughout the year, you've heard from each of our business segment leaders about the strategies we put in place to meet our commitments, so I'll touch on just a few of the recent actions we've taken to advance those strategies.
As Joaquin Duato laid out for you at our pharmaceuticals business review in May, our Pharmaceuticals business has a clear strategy focused on 5 therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need, a robust innovation engine, and proven commercial capabilities. Joaquin talked to you about how we're investing in our future with 10 new products we plan to file by 2019, each with a potential to exceed $1 billion in annual sales. And in fact, we are already delivering one of those promising medicines to the market, 4 months ahead of schedule with the U.S. approval for DARZALEX, the first human monoclonal antibody to be approved anywhere in the world for patients with multiple myeloma, which is off to a very good start.
In the near term, I know many of you are keeping an eye on potential biosimilar completion in the United States. As you've heard us say, biosimilars are not generics. With more than 2.4 million people having been treated with REMICADE and about 70% of the current patients receiving sustained and effective treatment, we believe doctors will be reluctant to switch them off with that level of success. And we've seen this play out in many markets where biosimilars have already been introduced. And we also have a patent for REMICADE that expires in September 2018 that we'll obviously continue to vigorously defend.
We consider our Immunology products part of an important and robust portfolio for patients, physicians and payers. So when you consider our continued expectations for REMICADE as well as the future potential of products like STELARA and SIMPONI and the pending submissions of guselkumab and sirukumab, we are confident in our ability to continue driving strong growth from our Immunology portfolio.
When you combine these advances with additional line extension approvals expected in 2016 like those for IMBRUVICA, STELARA and INVOKANA and DARZALEX approval in the EU, our near-term pipeline is incredibly robust and may not be fully appreciated in the market. With the combined strength of our end market portfolio and deep late-stage pipeline, we expect to deliver above-industry compound average growth through 2019.
Our consumer expertise, insight and access are becoming increasingly valuable to payers and providers as demographic and technology trends in health care are moving the system toward more consumer-driven decision-making and in some cases, self-care alternatives. We see this as a key differentiator for our company, and we're investing in technologies that help us exploit this expertise across our broad base. Jorge Mesquita and our other consumer business leaders will share more details at our consumer business review this May.
For 2015, our U.S. OTC business continue to grow faster than the market, and we're happy to report that nearly all of our OTC products have returned to shelves, and we are proud of the quality system improvements we have put into place.
Our consumer Medical Device businesses, the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Solution companies and Johnson & Johnson Vision Care made progress in 2015 to improve our competitiveness. Both businesses, which command global leadership positions in their respective categories, focused their 2015 turnarounds on launching new products, solidifying their base businesses and accelerating growth.  And both businesses have regained or stabilized market share and market leadership and introduced important new product such as Animas Vibe and ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day with HydraLuxe in the U.S.
In our broader Medical Device businesses, last week, we announced a strategic restructuring initiative designed to directly support and accelerate the strategy Gary Pruden laid out for you on our third quarter earnings call. We are reallocating resources to priority platforms like endocutters, knees, trauma and EP. And recent history showed that when we doubled down in an area, we are able to accelerate meaningful innovation and outcomes as we saw with our endocutters portfolio, which is now the fastest-growing platform in our Medical Devices segment.
Additionally, we're making progress on transforming our go-to-market models like our cross-selling efforts between Ethicon and DePuy Synthes' joint reconstruction and spine, which resulted in over 600 leads through 2015. We are now co-selling in over 1,200 accounts, and all sales teams will be trained, covering all markets by the end of the first quarter.
And finally, our recent acquisition of Coherex Medical in the area of atrial fibrillation and the surgical robotics collaboration with Verily, formerly Google Life Sciences, are examples of the type of focus and strategic investments that you will see us make more of in the future.
Our goal is to reach more patients, outperform the markets in which we compete and consistently identify, build and acquire new platforms for growth. Moving forward into 2016, we will continue to take bold but appropriate steps to put our Medical Device business in the best position to deliver more value for customers and for our company and for our shareholders.
In summary, we believe that improved universal access to quality health care, rewarding innovation and a more vital culture of health, wellness and prevention are the keys to a future where people are healthier and businesses and economies are stronger. Our broad-based experience and scale uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader and partner of choice in the movement towards outcomes and episodes of care based approaches and ultimately, a healthier society. We are optimistic about the future opportunities in health care and confident in the strength of our business.
In 2016, we will remain focused on our near-term priorities and continue to advance our longer-term growth drivers, enabling us to continue delivering shareholder value year after year. With the guidance of our credo, we'll continue to meet our responsibilities to all stakeholders. That's been true for 129 years of breakthrough, life-saving innovation, and we are confident Johnson & Johnson is well positioned to continue meeting those responsibilities for the next 130 years.
Thank you. I look forward to further dialogue during the Q&A session. But first, I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso, who will talk more about our results and expectations for 2016. Dominic?"

As you've heard from Alex, we're very pleased with our 2015 performance. We believe we managed our business well, and have provided you insights during the year in a transparent manner that allowed all of you to understand our plans and expectations. We finished the year strong and we're carrying that momentum into 2016. We ended the year at the top end of our operational guidance range for both sales and earnings and exceeded estimates for earnings as published by our first call.
Turning to the next slide. You can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the full year 2015. I'd first like to remind you about some of the key assumptions in our guidance for 2015. At the beginning of the year, we discussed that, while we reinvested some of the profitability from OLYSIO sales, our earnings in 2014 did benefit by approximately $0.20 per share even after those investments, making 2015 comparisons to 2014 results more challenging.
Additionally, currency headwinds increased quite substantially in 2015, negatively impacting both sales and earnings for 2015 by approximately 8%. Given those expected headwinds, last January, we guided that we would deliver operational sales growth in the range of 1% to 2%. As you can see, while reported sales results show a decrease of 5.7%, on an operational basis  we ended up at the high end of our guidance with operational sales growth at 1.8%.
We also provided you with an estimate of our underlying operational sales growth for 2015, which excluded the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of hepatitis C sales. We expected that underlying operational growth would be approximately 6%, and we exceeded that estimate, delivering 6.5%.
On earnings, our adjusted operational EPS growth in our original 2015 guidance was expected to range between 2.3% and 4.7%. As reported this morning, our EPS of $6.20 reflects operational growth of 5.8% and is at the top of the updated EPS guidance range we gave in October. And finally, our adjusted net income margin improved to 24.9%.
Now let's take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. Turning to the next slide. You can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015.
As we expected, direct comparisons to our fourth quarter of 2014 will be challenging to the stronger OLYSIO sales that we benefited from last year as well as divestitures and currency headwinds in 2015. Our results on an operational basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and excluding the impact of hep C sales, were up 7.8% for the quarter. As Louise noted, sales did benefit from additional shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Please now direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items and intangible asset amortization expense. Adjusted net earnings were $4 billion in the quarter, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 versus $1.37 a year ago are up 5.1%. And the adjusted EPS results exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as published by first call. Excluding the impact of translational currency, our operational adjusted EPS was $1.54 or up 12.4% for the fourth quarter.
In the quarter, we incurred intangible amortization expense of $200 million on an after-tax basis as well as after-tax special charges of $600 million, which included an expense of $400 million related to the restructuring of our Medical Device business, which we announced last week and in-process research and development charge of $200 million.
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold was 30 basis points lower than the same period last year, impacted by changes in our business and product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 33.1% of sales. This is 120 basis points higher than last year as we continued to invest to drive growth in our key brands.
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales were 16.1% in the quarter and 170 basis points higher than the prior year as we continue to make important investments in our pipeline for future growth. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we entered into important new licensing agreements, made milestone payments and increased spending to advance our R&D portfolio, which are all positive developments as we continue to strengthen our pipeline.
Interest expense net of interest income was slightly lower, reflecting higher earnings on our investments. Other income and expense was a net gain of $1.2 billion in the quarter compared to a net charge of approximately $1 billion in the same period last year. Of course, this line item includes several special items of both years. Excluding those special items, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $1.3 billion compared to a net gain of approximately $130 million in the prior year period. This year's fourth quarter reflects the gain on the previously announced divestiture of Cordis.
As a reminder, we indicated that any gains from divestitures, which are reflected in the other income and expense line, would largely be reinvested in the business as well as used to mitigate the negative impact of currency and the lower level of income in 2015 from reduced OLYSIO sales. And therefore, our pretax operating margin would be expected to be lower in 2015 versus 2014. And our 2015 results reflect just that. We funded important investments with the higher level of other income that will benefit us going forward.
The adjusted fourth quarter effective tax rate for 2015 was 17.7%. This was lower than the rate in the previous 9 months due to the passing of legislation which renewed the R&D tax credit and look-through provisions. The R&D tax credit and look-through provisions were always included in our annual guidance. The adjusted full year effective tax rate for 2015 was 20.7%, slightly below guidance due to the mix of income from higher to lower tax jurisdictions.
Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. Adjusted income before tax for the entire enterprise improved from 30.7% of sales in '14 to 31.4% of sales in 2015.
Looking at the adjusted pretax income by segment. Medical Devices expanded 360 basis points, due primarily to the gain associated with the Cordis divestiture, while Pharmaceutical margins contracted 50 basis points due to the lower OLYSIO sales and increased investments in research and development, partially offset by the gain earlier in the year of divestiture of NUCYNTA.
Consumer margins contracted 110 basis points due to lower divestitures gains in 2015 versus 2014 as well as important investments for future growth as we returned our iconic consumer brands to the market.
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. Before I discuss sales and earnings, I'll first give you some guidance on items we know may be difficult to forecast.
I would first like to address our cash position and remind you about our capital allocation approach. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.5 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $38.5 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $20 billion of debt. This is a higher level of cash than we typically hold. And as Alex said earlier, we are actively looking for the right opportunities to deploy that capital to create greater value for our shareholders. But we are patient. We are seeking companies with a mutual desire to partner and will only act when we see the right value-creating deal at the right price with the right partners.
We have a transparent and disciplined capital allocation strategy that starts with dividends to our shareholders, followed by value-creating M&A and then we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as share repurchase programs. And due to our strong balance sheet, we have the financial strength and flexibility to execute on all 3 of these capital allocation priorities simultaneously.
During Q4 2015, we used approximately $1 billion to repurchase shares of our stock in connection with our $10 billion share repurchase program that we announced in October. Although we are continuing to evaluate external value-creating opportunities in line with this strategy, for purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, we suggest you consider modeling 2016 net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million.
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses, providing from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as divestitures, asset sales and write-offs.
We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Although we expect to have a significantly lower level of other income in 2016 versus 2015, our pretax operating margin in 2016 is expected to expand by more than 200 basis points.
As we've discussed several times during the year, we continue to evaluate our portfolio, and we expected that any gains from divestitures would be lower than the level we saw in 2015. However, we also discussed that we would nonetheless improve on earnings as we see the benefits of good expense management and meaningful investments we made in 2015.
And now a word on taxes. We're very pleased that the R&D tax credit was made permanent and approved by Congress this last year. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016 excluding special items of approximately 19.5% to 20.5%.
Turning to sales and earnings guidance. Our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrance for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrance for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO.
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business and will also provide an estimate of our sales and earnings and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.
For the full year of 2016, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. Additionally, while we have comparison to how we described our sales and results in 2015, our 2015 operating sales growth, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales, was approximately 6.5%. After adjusting for extra shipping days in 2015, that underlying growth rate was approximately 5.5% 2015. Our sales guidance for '16 on the same basis is expected to continue at a similar growth rate of around 5.5%.
While the euro has been fairly stable over the last few months, many of the other currencies have been volatile. Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro at $1.09, our guidance for sales growth would decrease by approximately 1.5%. We are watching the other currencies closely as it is uncertain as to how they will settle out for the year. Of course, we will update the assessment as we progress throughout the year.
Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 1% to 2% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $70.8 billion to $71.5 billion.
Now turning to earnings. A continuing factor impacting earnings guidance for 2016 is the impact of currency movements on transactions, which, although hedged, is still somewhat negative. We expect transaction currency impacts to negatively impact our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in the range of $6.53 to $6.68 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting operational or constant currency growth rates of 5% to 8%.
Again, we're not predicting the impact of currency movements. But to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, with the euro at $1.09, our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 per share. Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS would range from $6.43 to $6.58 per share. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range, which, at approximately 5%, is higher than current consensus estimate.
So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, I'd like to make a few points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 2.5% and 3.5%, we're pleased to note, when excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales, our operational sales growth is expected to be around 5.5% for the full year 2016. With regards to expected EPS growth on an operational basis, our adjusted EPS growth guidance is strong in the range of 5% to 8%.
Also for 2016, pretax operating margins are expected to expand by more than 200 basis points based on the guidance I just provided. The margin expansion is driven by a combination of investments we made in 2015, coupled with the benefit of disciplined expense management across the enterprise.
Moving into 2016. We are confident in the strength of our business. As we execute our growth plans and near-term priorities that Alex laid out for you this morning, we're well positioned with the strong balance sheet to deliver solid results while continuing to invest in innovation, which will ensure our future growth and success. Our goal remains to grow our sales organically at a rate faster than the markets in which we compete, grow our earnings faster than sales and create value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships that generate additional growth. All of this, coupled with our strong dividend yield, provides a very compelling long-term shareholder return.
Finally, before I turn it over to Louise for Q&A, just a reminder to please save the date for our Consumer and Medical Device Business Review on Wednesday, May 18.
Thank you. Now back to Louise."

So if I look at MD&D and where you ended up with pretax margins in 2015, they were at 35.6% and which -- every observer would say those are very high margins. And for the overall company, you're guiding to 200 basis points plus of pretax margin improvement, which would make 2016 the biggest year of margin expansion in the last 15. So talk about the decision to be as aggressive as you're being in 2016 on operating cost. And for the MD&D business in particular, why is the consolidation that you're pursuing in what's called the cost transformation imperative at this point in time? And why are you being as aggressive as you're being?"

So in 2016, we have a lower level of those investments consistent with a lower level of the other income that we just guided to. Also, it's important to point out that those investments we made in 2015, we're seeing the benefits of those already in 2016, so we think they are wise investments. And finally, we have talked a lot about our various programs of reducing our cost structure. And Alex today mentioned the program that we're embarking -- that we embarked on several years ago that will reduce costs by $1 billion by 2018. Well, we're well on our way in implementing that program after several years of investment. In 2016, we'll see a year where the actual benefits associated with that program outweigh any incremental investments. And maybe Alex may comment on the MD&D restructuring and why that's appropriate for us to do today."

At the same time, we've been making changes internally with the way that our organizations are innovating as well as in the way that they're going to market. And so we see this as the next logical step in that overall process. Our Medical Device business is one that we remain very committed to. We believe that it's got an exciting future, a lot of new innovation coming, new ways of dealing with our customers. And so we think this is the right time to make sure that we're set up for growth, not only in 2016, but actually for the next 5 and 10 years."

And while we didn't necessarily close on a larger deal, I would not assume that we were not engaged and involved.

Now for all the reasons that we've discussed around increasing demands based on demographics, certainly here in the U.S., and a rising middle class and demographics outside the United States and the pressure that, that's likely going to put on payers and governments and others in between, we realize that there is an opportunity for us to participate, not only in bringing great innovations that's going to help patients, but also doing it in a value-added way. And clearly, the consumer, the patient, is weighing in much heavier in these decisions as they take on higher copays as they can get more information that's available online. And frankly, they just have higher expectations about their ability to participate in that health care decision-making process. So what we see is a range of customers, but we see some customers who are still very innovation focused. And to be clear, we remain very innovation focused. We think, at the end of the day, what we do best is bring new products, new solutions to our customers that are going to ultimately have better outcomes for patients. And so that's an area where we are very focused on and we'll continue to be focused on. We are though starting to also see hospital systems. And I think one important point here is it's certainly taking place in the United States, but it's also definitely taking place in places like Europe and even some of the developing and emerging markets that frankly don't have the history and the legacy of some of the infrastructure that you see in the more developed markets. In there, it -- what we see is an evolution more towards the business-to-business relationship where yes, customers want to see innovation, but they also want to see how are you going to interact, how can you assist in working with our supply chain to make it more efficient, how can we work together as part of a broader partnership that ultimately is focusing not just on a product sell, but actually on an outcome, on an episodic care for the patient and it creates a much broader partnership. We are seeing those organizations becoming more and more interested, and that's why we're adapting to make sure that we're part of that. So I think, overall, it's important that we continue to innovate, we continue to operate with a lot of excellence in the current environment. At the same time, it's important that we set the stage for this evolution that's taking place out there to make sure that we can not only be successful, that we're -- but we'll actually be a leader as that market evolves as well."

I think what we would say overall is we continue to see, let's say, a slightly increasing positive trends. So we saw hospital admissions, I believe, up around 2%, we saw surgical procedures up a little over 1% in the U.S., that's the most recent data that we have. If we go outside a U.S., we think rates in Europe have been pretty steady. And even in the markets in which we compete most significantly, in the developing markets, we haven't seen a major impact from secular shifts, perhaps in China some, but not dramatic. And then putting that into context, what that represents overall on our business, we don't see it as a major indicator. As I look towards 2016, look, there's a few things that cause us to be optimistic about our Medical Device business. It really starts with innovation. And we've got about 30 products that we'll be launching by the end of 2016. Over half of those have either been launched or are well on their way as we speak. And what we're seeing is when we're bringing new technologies to the market like our new contact lenses, like our new insulin pump, like our new energy instrumentation, like the ATTUNE Knee, we're seeing very good uptake. And in fact, in those categories, we're seeing share gains. And certainly, in areas like electrophysiology, endocutters, the same thing. And so we believe that the market does still reward significant innovation when we're introducing it. So that's one aspect. The second aspect, frankly, is one, just improved execution. And I think if you look across all of our device businesses, if you think about diabetes care, the major price reset that we had there a couple of years ago -- and as all of you know, when you're -- when you take that kind of a reduction, resizing your business, going back in each and every line and setting it for the new marketplace caused us an tremendous amount of change. If you look at our Vision Care business last year, we went in and we really increased the cadence out of our innovation pipeline, launching 5 new products. We did a price reset there to make us more competitive with the ECPs. We made a lot of other internal adjustments to improve our selling and marketing. We are definitely seeing the impact of that now, not only on the sales results of up to 8%, but as -- maybe even more importantly, if you look at the leading indicators as far as new share that's being generated and new patient starts in the offices, those things are positive. Louise mentioned earlier the improvement that we're seeing across the Orthopaedics business. And look, this is one where we know that when you bring large organizations together, when you standardize quality systems, manufacturing systems, we think that we've made a lot of progress there. And frankly, when you compound that with the innovation rollout that we've seen in Orthopaedics of the ATTUNE Knee, the CORAIL Hip, the TFNA nail, we're starting to see that come back as well as some of the, frankly, the new approaches that we're taking that Gary will be talking more about in May where our Ethicon and our DePuy Synthes teams were actually co-selling, co-contracting in a number of very innovative ways, compounded with the fact that -- look, we think some of the performance issues related to China in our Orthopaedics are more of a onetime event. That's getting normalized. So as we burn our way through those and head into 2016 overall, we think that innovation, we think changes in our commercial model, we think improved execution, all those things are -- make us more optimistic about the growth prospects as we head into 2016."

And we think there's a few things to keep in consideration about this. And first and foremost is that as Dominic stated earlier, biosimilars are very different from generics. And particularly, in this category, I think keeping the patient in the center of all these -- we've got a tremendous amount of experience in the biologics category going back to PROCRIT, REMICADE, a number of our days. And we think the differences between molecules can have -- manifest themselves in significant ways with patients. So making sure -- and I think things that we'll be watching for the at AC or what kind of data that the biosimilars actually have, what kind of indications, what will be the guidance around substitutability. All those, frankly, sitting here today, are unknowns. We'll need more clarification. But we think each of those means that the expected uptake, even when a biosimilar does launch, will lead to a significantly different curve than what you see with generics. We think, secondly, it's very important -- if you actually think about it from a patient perspective. And we know, for example, there's about 2.5 million patients with REMICADE, and about 70% of those are either continuing therapy and have a pretty high satisfaction rate. So if you look at the available population who's likely to be switched, we think it's in the 30% range. And last but certainly not least, there's the whole issue of the business model and the way that we actually work with customers in this setting. And this is an area where we've got a lot of experience in contracting. We've got some great relationships with providers in this area right now. We also have a very broad portfolio. If you think about what REMICADE does, but you look more broadly at the performance recently of a product like STELARA, a multibillion dollar compound, growing at 20-plus percent rate; if you look at SIMPONI, same thing, SIMPONI ARIA, in particular, the great dosing convenience that it provides, that's another multibillion addition that we add to that portfolio, then you augment that with the submissions that we have in 2016 planned for, guselkumab, sirukumab and IL-23 and then IL-6, we think that, that positions us very well with our portfolio and from a contracting point of view with large providers and payers in -- certainly in the U.S. but also abroad. What we're seeing outside the United States is that most of the markets where they're introduced is a relatively minor impact. We're seeing that we're holding on to about 90% plus or minus. It varies by market. You have to look at each one individually. And it's difficult to project exactly what that impact will be going forward. But I think when we think of it broadly across all those different areas, what's the clinical data show, what ultimately is the labeling, the regulatory aspects, what about our contracting, the business aspects, and we think all those are very important, will result in a different impact from biosimilars. And ultimately, we'll continue to defend our intellectual property as well through what we believe is the right patent in September of 2018."

Do you have a sense for what The Street was assuming for nonoperating income? When I go back historically, that's been in the $500 million to $600 million range. Clearly, it was $2 billion last year, but just curious to know what consensus models had assumed for that. Secondly, did your guidance assume that the medical device tax will be suspended as I think we've seen with other device companies? Just curious to know if that savings is reinvested in the business or if that is part of the guidance. And then for you, Alex, just curious to know your thoughts on pricing. I mean, we heard Bernie and Hillary last night go after drug pricing again. And I think that's also something we're going to hear from the Republican candidates. What are your expectations in terms of pricing in 2016 and 2017? Do you expect that there will be a change in terms of list prices going forward?"

Jami, let me try to take the first 2 and then have Alex -- maybe he'll comment on the drug pricing. You were referring to our nonoperating, now let's call it the other income and expense line for 2016, what was assumed in analyst models versus what we have provided in guidance. When we looked at the analyst consensus models, overall, it looks like that number averaged in the high $900 million, so nearly $1 billion. And our guidance, of course, is somewhere at $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. So our guidance is slightly higher than the analyst models. But just as a reminder, we always take the opportunity to -- these are portfolio choices to use any of those gains to offset some other expenses we'd like to invest in. And then with respect to the Medical Device Tax, the -- we have assumed that it would be a benefit in 2016. But I must say, the benefit for us is very, very minor. Remember, when the Medical Device Tax is incurred, it's incurred upon the first manufacturer of a product and therefore, it can be, for example, orthopedic companies hung up in inventory for quite some time. So the overall impact of not having a Medical Device Tax in 2016 is not significant for Johnson & Johnson. It may be significant for certain other companies that maybe are pure orthopedic players, but not overall significant for us. And secondly, I would say that whatever benefit we see there, we've already assumed would be reinvested in innovation because, of course, during the time that the Medical Device Tax was a drag on earnings, obviously, decisions had to be made on where to invest. Now we're happy that with that easement of the Device Tax for a couple of years, we'll be able to actually invest more in innovation in the medical device space."

Look, we realize and understand the pricing in pharmaceuticals, let alone all of health care, it's certainly a very important issue. And we believe that it's important to consider it just in that way. As we think about pharmaceuticals, for example, they currently make up about 12% of health care spending in the United States, slightly higher in Europe. If you think about medical devices, they represent about 6%. And if you go beyond those areas, of course, there's a lot of other cost built into that system, ranging from hospital, patient care, insurance companies, many other people and particularly, in an environment today, where frankly, we're seeing such transformational outcomes and moving more and more towards cures, disease prevention, interception than we ever have because of some of the great science that's being produced. So we understand and would certainly expect there to be a continued spotlight in this area. Obviously, we're working with a lot of stakeholders to try and make sure that we look at it in a very holistic way. And it's very, I think, difficult, at this point in time, to try to project what's going to happen in 2016 or 2017.

Look, I just pick up what Dominic had just said about our Consumer business is that I'm really proud of the work that we've done on the Consent Decree and the great strides that they have taken around quality. In fact, I think in working closely and partnering with the FDA, we likely have a benchmark organization now, and we're really proud having done that. At the same time, I think as they begin to shift from only remediation to remediation and relaunch, across a number of these areas, while certainly keeping a very high eye on quality, as we increase our volumes, as we are able to deepen our relationships with a lot of the major trade partners, that's where we see a great growth opportunity as well and obviously, that's going to have an impact on our margins as we go forward. I also think that the other thing that, that team is doing is as we're transitioning more and more to online marketing versus just traditional marketing, the way we're partnering with some of the large customers, I think there's a lot of opportunities not only to drive share and volume, but actually to improve efficiencies on our back end as well. As I step back and look more broadly, look, we think the 3 areas that we're in, consumer, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, are all great platform and great businesses. Of course, we would look, first, for areas that -- what is the next ZYTIGA? What's the next Vision Care platform? What's the next NEUTROGENA? That would certainly be our focus. Another would be, are there chances to grow in perhaps some of the faster-growing developing markets with the right kind of opportunity? Those are things that we would be interested in. And then what are ways to complement our existing businesses? I think the way that you point it out, as the markets evolve, we are looking, not only at M&A, but also broader partnerships that we've done, for example, with companies like Google, and verily, where we see a big opportunity to really help transform the robotics surgery space in a pretty significant way longer term. And then, I guess, so the final option there would be for us to actually acquire something outside the current 3. And again, if it's something where we thought there was a lot of unmet patient or consumer need, if we feel that it's consistent with the capabilities that we can bring to bear to actually have it be a successful business, if the financials work, then we would take that step."

Our plans are for improved growth in China in 2016. But I just want to put China in perspective. It's less than 5% of our sales. It's an important market for us longer term with 1.3 billion people and lots of health care needs, et cetera. But any short-term changes in their economy is unlikely to have any significant impact on our results. And then on the 200 basis point improvement, Bob, it's actually across all 3 lines of the P&L, COGS, selling, marketing as well as R&D. So in the case of COGS where we have a long-term program that we've been executing on to reduce footprint, we're accelerating some of those programs that will benefit us in the COGS line. On the selling, marketing and administrative line, I talked earlier about the fact that we had a program in place for a couple of years, shooting for $1 billion of cost savings by 2018, we're well on our way. We'll see cost reductions in that line. In R&D, that depends on the individual licensing deals that we have and the timing of when we would spend those milestone payments or enter into new licensing agreements. But as it looks today, the advancement in the portfolio in 2015 from the milestone payments, et cetera, are not expected to be at the same level in '16 that they were in '15. So it's across all 3 lines in the P&L. And I can't give you an exact number on the amount of investment we made in '15, extra investment made in '15. But just to say that we had $2.8 billion of other income in 2015, well above the years passed, and we still improved overall income before tax by not quite that amount, right? So most of it was reinvested in the business."

And obviously, as we think about it, for example, in our Pharmaceutical group, we think that the model that we pull together, while we try to find the next INVOKANA, the next DARZALEX, very early compounds, where frankly we've got solid scientific insights, we bring it inside. And because of our clinical development, our regulatory capabilities, we can launch, and then very strong sales marketing and reimbursement practices around that. Frankly, that's what helped us create the number of billion-dollar blockbusters that we've been able to launch since 2009, I think 16 new products and 7 of which are like right at $1 billion or shortly will be. And so we think that's a good model. In Medical Devices, we've done tuck-ins as well as large. And look, I think in both cases, whether it's Pharma or Medical Devices, the smaller tuck-ins are frankly more straightforward to get done. We haven't shied -- we won't shy away from large where we think it makes for a significant opportunity, and it's something that we'll continue to look at in Consumer. As far as the question that it's underperforming, now I think it depends on why it's underperforming. If it's a market -- if it's an exogenous market shift or something else, then obviously, that would not necessarily have us shy away from that particular area. On the other hand, if it's an internal, more executional issue, absolutely, we'd want to make sure that we've got the knitting where we need it before we add on to that particular opportunity. So that's the way we tend to look at it. But again, it's part of a broader strategic question really on how we're managing the portfolio across the enterprise."

I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2016. 
Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the first quarter for the corporation and for our 3 business segments. Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. 
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. 
Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or license from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, up 0.6% versus first quarter 2015. 
On an operational basis, sales were up 3.9% and currency had a negative impact of 3.3%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 0.6%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 6.6%. 
On an operational basis, Asia-Pacific and Africa grew 3%. Europe declined 0.8% and the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined by 0.6%. 
Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures, the most significant one being Cordis. 
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted operational growth in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 6.9% worldwide, 9.8% in the U.S. and 3.8% outside the U.S. 
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 60 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.54 versus $1.53 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $205 million and the charge of $192 million for after-tax special items. 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a next charge of $98 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 6.1% and 7.7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. 
Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 10.3%. 
Turning now to business segment highlights. Please note percentages quoted represents operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translation impact. I'll begin with the consumer segment. 
Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.2 billion decreased 0.2%, with U.S. sales down 0.1%, while outside the U.S., sales were down 0.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures underlying operational sales growth was 1.9% worldwide, 4.1% in the U.S. and 0.5% outside the U.S. 
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 200 basis points and 320 basis points, respectively, with the the most significant impact to Women's Health, Oral Care and Baby Care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by OTC worldwide and Oral Care. OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak flu season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesics share growth and an inventory build as well as seasonal and new product launch inventory for upper respiratory products. 
In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 12% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 46%, up from nearly 43% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of analgesics and anti-smoking aids, partially offset by lower sales of upper respiratory products due to the fourth quarter and distributor inventory build, as noted last quarter. 
New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 8.5% with U.S. sales up 12.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 2.6%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.3%, 16.2% and 7.1%, respectively. 
As we discussed last year, U.S. results in the first quarter of 2015 included a positive adjustment for gross to net, including managed Medicaid rebates. In the first quarter this year, U.S. results including an adjustment for a similar amount and therefore overall growth was not impacted. However, on a product basis, STELARA growth in 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 16 points, XERALTA by 4 points and REMICADE by 3 points. 
Significant contributors to growth for Immunology products, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA, Oncology products, IMBRUVICA and recently launched, DARZALEX, as well as cardiovascular metabolic products XARELTO and INVOKANA. The results for Immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth as well as gross to net to the sales that I mentioned. 
Combined REMICADE export sales and international  sales grew approximately 11%. Sales to distribution partners were up approximately 5%. Sales to our international direct markets were up approximately 17% due primarily to strong double-digit growth in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., primarily driven by timing of shipments and market growth. 
Strong patient timing uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove the results for IMBRUVICA both in the U.S. and outside U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 65 countries. 
DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake. DARZALEX contributed over 2% to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. 
XARELTO sales were up 29% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 16.5%, up over 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was nearly 14% and in cardiology, nearly 23.5%, up on a sequential basis by 0.5 points and 0.3 points, respectively. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up nearly 18% on a worldwide basis and nearly 12% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, including insulin and metformin, was 6.1%, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologist with 11.5% and 5.5% in the primary care. 
On a sequential basis, sales declined due to the extra shipping days in the fourth quarter, incremental rebates and savings program redemptions as well as increased competition in formulary positions. INVOKANA access remains strong at 80% preferred combined commercial and Part D. 
I'll now reviewed the medical devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.1 billion increased 0.5%. U.S. sales increased 2.2%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 1%. Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3% worldwide with the U.S. up 3.3% and the growth of 2.8% outside the U.S. 
Growth was driven by Orthopaedics, Advanced Surgery  and Electrophysiology. 
Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by worldwide knees and hips, and U.S. trauma and spine. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across a major category, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The success of the TFNA mailing system in trauma, the [indiscernible] platform in knees, our primary platforms in hips and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC, a new spine product introductions made important contributions to results. 
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by results in China due to softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Trauma in spine, other were the categories most impacted. 
In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. 
Strong results were achieved for Advanced Surgery products with endocutters growth of 10%, biosurgical's growth of 8% and energy growth of 8%. 
Electrophysiology grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increase penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2016. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?"

We carried last year's momentum into 2016, and we're off to a strong start this year. We're very pleased with the results generated in the first quarter, and we continue to make very good progress on our near-term priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers, which we discussed during our January call. We remain confident in the strength of our business. 
As we previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and a few extra shipping days in 2015 was 5.5%. 
On this same basis, we gained momentum in the first quarter with strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7% and in line with analysts' estimates. 
In our Pharmaceutical business, our strong performance from 2015 continued into the first quarter with underlying operational growth at over 12%. First quarter underlying operational sales growth for consumer increased approximately 4% when also adjusting for the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela that Louise mentioned earlier. And in Medical Devices, we're off to a good start in the first quarter with underlying operational growth of approximately 3%. Growth in our consumer-facing medical businesses was negatively impacted by challenges in the diabetes market. 
For the hospital-focused medical businesses, we're seeing signs of continued improvement with underlying operational growth in those businesses are approximately 4%, driven by strength in our Orthopaedics, Advanced Surgery and electrophysiology businesses. 
We also saw an improvement in our overall adjusted pretax operating margin. For 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase on an adjusted basis, and we remain comfortable with that forecast as we accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. 
As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit, less selling, marketing administrative and R&D expenses. 
Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key developments on the first quarter as well as some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. 
During the quarter, we had several key developments across the business. In our Pharmaceutical business, we received an additional approval for IMBRUVICA for first line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and also entered in a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with TESARO for exclusive rights in the investigational compound by niraparib in prostate cancer. 
Niraparib is an orally administered poly polymerase or PARP inhibitor. 
We also continued our efforts to combat major global health challenges from collaborations with government organizations and others in the industry with the call for innovative ideas to reduce HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa as well as providing funding for nonprofit organizations supporting underserved communities in the United States. 
In March 2016, we entered into agreement to sell our control substance raw material and API business. In 2015, these businesses totaled approximately $250 million in net trade sales. 
This divestiture remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals but is expected to be completed towards the middle of 2016. 
In Medical Devices, Ethicon completed the acquisition of NeuWave Medical, a probably held medical device company that manufactures in markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems. We look forward to providing an in-depth review of the ongoing efforts of our consumer and medical device businesses at our upcoming business review meeting on May 18, which will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 3.9% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestiture and hep C sales, it was a strong 6.9%. If you'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization and special items. 
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: Intangible asset amortization of $200 million and litigation charges and our Medical Devices restructuring charge. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68 per share, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by first call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 7.7% versus the prior year.  Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.72, up 10% over the prior year. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items in the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased with an basis points mostly due to transactional currency, partially offset by a favorable mix in the business. Selling, marketing, administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 110 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to continued good cost management. 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.5% higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines. 
Our pretax operating margin when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense was 32.9%, 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of the prior year. Interest expense net of interest income was lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments. Other income and expense was a net gain of $39 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $348 million in the same period last year. 
Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $127 million compared to a net gain of $91 million in the prior year period. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 21.5% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year and the current mix of our business. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. 
On our 2015 year-end call, we commented on our segment results for adjusted income before tax versus the prior year. Now that all of our competitors have reported their results for 2015, I would like to take the opportunity to point out that our 2015 adjusted income before tax was 31.4% compared to 26.2% weighted average for our competitive set. This was driven by higher margins in both pharmaceutical and medical devices and somewhat lower margins in our consumer business as compared to our competitive set. 
In the first quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 80 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by improvement in both our pharmaceutical and medical device businesses. Our consumer business had a lower-margin this year as compared to last year due principally to the devaluation in Venezuela. We are confident that our consumer business will show when improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $23 billion of debt. 
As you know, in February, we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates with a debt issuance of $7.5 billion. Through the end of the first quarter, we completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete 75% of the program by the end of this year. 
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of a between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. 
Regarding other income and expense as a reminder, as the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments prior development corporation, divestiture, asset sales and write-offs. We'll be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and this is also unchanged versus our January guidance. 
And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2016 includes the R&D tax credit that Congress made permanent in 2015. We are, therefore, comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items of approximately 19% to 20%, lower by 50 basis points in our previous guidance due to updating our outlook for a higher mix of our earnings from lower tax jurisdictions in 2016  than we anticipated in our previous guidance. 
And now turning to sales and earnings. While share and guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrants for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. and our assumption with regard to REMICADE biosimilar remains unchanged even with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra due to our intellectual property, which we intend to defend. 
We also do not anticipate generic competition this year from ZYTIGA, Respo and INVEGA SUSTENNA, but as expected there are generic entrants for INVEGA and [indiscernible]. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a very good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
Consistent with our previous guidance, we'll be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestiture and hepatitis C sales would be approximately 5.5%, a level of growth comparable last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier. 
The devaluation in Venezuela that we previously discussed is anticipated to be a headwind of approximately 30 basis points for the full year, which we anticipate will be offset by the strength of the business. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.13, the negative impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 1%. This is an improvement of 50 basis points since we last provided guidance. We're watching the euro and other currencies closely as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle after the year. 
Plus under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for a total expect level of reported sales of approximately $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion, higher than our previous guidance. 
Now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to bit negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.56 to $6.71 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 6% to 8%. This is higher than our previous guidance. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS will be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, a better outlook than the approximate $0.10 negative impact we discussed in our January guidance. Therefore, we will be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.53 to $6.68 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due to an update to our tax rate and current currency estimates. As it's still early in the year, we will be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our strong start for the year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely we're expecting operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and underlying operational sales growth of 5.5% consistent with '15 -- 2015 growth on a comparable basis. 
Our operating margins are on tract to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operational adjusted EPS growth and guidance remains strong in the range of 6% to 8% and our businesses are continuing to invest, while also delivering on our growth expectations. 
In particular, we're pleased to see our medical device businesses showing continued signs of improvement and our restructuring activities in that business are on track. And we look forward to discussing with you in more detail these activities on our May 18 Investor Day.

We're in the middle of doing one right now, and we'll obviously evaluate whether we can continue to increase that particular share buyback as time goes on. With respect to not allocating capital to any particular deals, I could tell you that we're very active. But as you know, we're also very disciplined.

There's been previous to this canvas study, there's been 12 previous studies with INVOKANA where we saw no such indications of increased in lower amputations, particularly the toe, so this seems to be focused only on the patients in the canvas study. It's important to note that, yes, the European regulatory body is taking a look at it, but already the independent monitoring committee that reviews the clinical trial after reviewing all the data concluded that the trial should continue.

In other words, the 5.5% in 2016 doesn't adjust for the extra selling days in 2015. Is that -- is our math directionally right, Dominic? And I had one follow up."

Thanks for the question. Just on the Vision Care business and our ACUVUE brand. As you know, the ACUVUE business has a long heritage of strong category growth as well as good innovation, which creates a fantastic products for contact lens wearers. And as you know, we are the world in contact lenses with the ACUVUE brand. And we just launched 4 new products in 2015, which have been received very well by the eye care professional and a contact lens wearer. Back in 2014, we did not have that kind of innovation coming to market first of all. And secondly, we saw some unevenness in the pricing in the market with their very different pricing and different channels. So we decided to implement the unilateral pricing policy in order to even out the pricing and of the end of the day, what happened there was we did see a lower overall price for our products, which are made the products more affordable. So today, the majority of the patients who get ACUVUE contact lens are paying less than they did for that brand 2 years ago. Now with innovation, with the market stabilizing, we adopted a new program that encourages patients to see their eye care professional and provides rebates and incentives for the purchase of contact lenses in conjunction with their eye exam as prescribed by a very eye care professional. And we think this just the next evolution as a market leader to focus on eye health and not just price of the contact lens. So just continued evolution of how we approach the market and slight disruption in the market we think that overall the long term benefit to the overall category into our business is worth it."

I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2016. 
Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the first quarter for the corporation and for our 3 business segments, then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 1 hour. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. 
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, up 0.6% versus first quarter 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.9%, and currency had a negative impact of 3.3%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 0.6%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 6.6%. 
On an operational basis, Asia Pacific and Africa grew 3%. Europe declined 0.8% and the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined by 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures, the most significant one being Cordis. 
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted operational growth in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 6.9% worldwide, 9.8% in the U.S. and 3.8% outside the U.S. In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 60 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.54 versus $1.53 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $205 million and the charge of $192 million for after-tax special items. 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a next charge of $98 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 6.1% and 7.7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. 
Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 10.3%. 
Turning now to business segment highlights. Please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translation impact. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. 
Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.2 billion decreased 0.2%, with U.S. sales down 0.1%, while outside the U.S. sales were down 0.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 1.9% worldwide, 4.1% in the U.S. and 0.5% outside the U.S. 
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 200 basis points and 320 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to Women's Health, Oral Care and Baby Care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by OTC worldwide and Oral Care. OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak flu season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic share growth and an inventory build as well as seasonal and new product launch inventory for upper respiratory products. 
In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 12% a year ago; while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 46%, up from nearly 43% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of analgesics and anti-smoking aids, partially offset by lower sales of upper respiratory products due to the fourth quarter distributor inventory build, as noted last quarter. 
New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 8.5%, with U.S. sales up 12.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 2.6%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.3%, 16.2% and 7.1%, respectively. 
As we discussed last year, U.S. results in the first quarter of 2015 included a positive adjustment for gross to net, including managed Medicaid rebates. In the first quarter this year, U.S. results included an adjustment for a similar amount and therefore, overall growth was not impacted. However, on a product basis, STELARA growth in 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 16 points, XARELTO by 4 points and REMICADE by 3 points. 
Significant contributors to growth were immunology products, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA; oncology products, IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX; as well as cardiovascular metabolic products, XARELTO and INVOKANA. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth as well as a gross to net adjustment to sales that I mentioned. 
Combined REMICADE export sales and international sales grew approximately 11%. Sales to distribution partners were up approximately 5%. Sales to our international direct markets were up approximately 17%, due primarily to strong double-digit growth in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., primarily driven by timing of shipments and market growth. 
Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove the results for IMBRUVICA, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 65 countries. 
DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake. DARZALEX contributed over 2% to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. 
XARELTO sales were up 29%, and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 16.5%, up over 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was nearly 14% and in cardiology, nearly 23.5%, up on a sequential basis by 0.5 points and 0.3 points, respectively. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed, with 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up nearly 18% on a worldwide basis and nearly 12% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was 6.1%, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was 11.5% and 5.5% in the primary care. 
On a sequential basis, sales declined due to the extra shipping days in the fourth quarter, incremental rebates and savings program redemptions as well as increased competition in formulary positions. INVOKANA access remains strong at 80% preferred for combined commercial and Part D. 
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.1 billion increased 0.5%. U.S. sales increased 2.2%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 1%. Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3% worldwide, with the U.S. up 3.3% and the growth of 2.8% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by Orthopaedics, advanced surgery and electrophysiology. 
Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by worldwide knees and hips, and U.S. trauma and spine. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The success of the TFNA mailing system in trauma, the Attune platform in knees, our primary stem platform in hips and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to results. 
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by results in China due to a softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine, other were the categories most impacted. In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. 
Strong results were achieved for advanced surgery products with endocutters growth of 10%, biosurgicals growth of 8% and energy growth of 8%. 
Electrophysiology grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2016. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?"

We carried last year's momentum into 2016, and we're off to a strong start this year. We are very pleased with the results generated in the first quarter, and we continue to make very good progress on our near-term priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers, which we discussed during our January call. We remain confident in the strength of our business. 
As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and a few extra shipping days in 2015, was 5.5%. On this same basis, we gained momentum in the first quarter, with strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7% and in line with analysts' estimates. 
In our Pharmaceutical business, our strong performance from 2015 continued into the first quarter, with underlying operational growth at over 12%. 
First quarter underlying operational sales growth for Consumer increased approximately 4% when also adjusting for the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela that Louise mentioned earlier. 
And in Medical Devices, we're off to a good start in the first quarter, with underlying operational growth of approximately 3%. Growth in our consumer-facing medical businesses was negatively impacted by challenges in the diabetes market. 
For the hospital-focused medical device businesses, we're seeing signs of continued improvement, with underlying operational growth in those businesses of approximately 4%, driven by strength in our Orthopaedics, advanced surgery and electrophysiology businesses. 
We also saw an improvement in our overall adjusted pretax operating margin. For 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase on an adjusted basis, and we remain comfortable with that forecast as we will accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative and R&D expenses. 
Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key developments on the first quarter as well as some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. 
During the quarter, we had several key developments across the business. In our Pharmaceutical business, we received an additional approval for IMBRUVICA for first line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and also entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with TESARO for exclusive rights to the investigational compound niraparib in prostate cancer. Niraparib is an orally administered poly polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor. 
We also continued our efforts to combat major global health challenges through collaborations with government organizations and others in the industry with a call for innovative ideas to reduce HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa as well as providing funding for nonprofit organizations supporting underserved communities in the United States. 
In March 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlled substance raw material and API business. In 2015, these businesses totaled approximately $250 million in net trade sales. This divestiture remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals but is expected to be completed towards the middle of 2016. 
In Medical Devices, Ethicon completed the acquisition of NeuWave Medical, a privately held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems. We look forward to providing an in-depth review of the ongoing efforts of our Consumer and Medical Device businesses at our upcoming business review meeting on May 18, which will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 3.9%. And excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales, it was a strong 6.9%. If you'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization and special items. 
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: intangible asset amortization of $200 million and litigation charges and our Medical Devices restructuring charge. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68 per share, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates, as published by first call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 7.7% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.72, up 10% over the prior year. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items in the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 10 basis points, mostly due to transactional currency, partially offset by a favorable mix in the business. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 110 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to continued good cost management. 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.5% higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines. 
Our pretax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32.9%, 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of the prior year. Interest expense net of interest income was lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments. Other income and expense was a net gain of $39 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $348 million in the same period last year. 
Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $127 million compared to a net gain of $91 million in the prior year period. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 21.5% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year and the current mix of our business. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. On our 2015 year-end call, we commented on our segment results for adjusted income before tax versus the prior year. Now that all of our competitors have reported their results for 2015, I would like to take the opportunity to point out that our 2015 adjusted income before tax was 31.4% compared to 26.2% weighted average for our competitive set. This was driven by higher margins in both Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and somewhat lower margins in our Consumer business as compared to our competitive set. 
In the first quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 80 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by improvement in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. Our Consumer business had a lower margin this year as compared to last year, due principally to the devaluation in Venezuela. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $23 billion of debt. As you know, in February, we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates with a debt issuance of $7.5 billion. Through the end of the first quarter, we completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete 75% of the program by the end of this year. 
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. 
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We'll be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. And this is also unchanged versus our January guidance. 
And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2016 includes the R&D tax credit that Congress made permanent in 2015. We are, therefore, comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 19% to 20%, lower by 50 basis points in our previous guidance due to updating our outlook for a higher mix of our earnings from lower tax jurisdictions in 2016 than we anticipated in our previous guidance. 
And now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrant for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. And our assumption with regard to REMICADE biosimilar remains unchanged, even with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra due to our intellectual property, which we intend to defend. 
We also do not anticipate generic competition this year from ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a very good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
Consistent with our previous guidance, we'd be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestiture and hepatitis C sales, would be approximately 5.5%, a level of growth comparable to last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier. 
The devaluation in Venezuela that we previously discussed is anticipated to be a headwind of approximately 30 basis points for the full year, which we anticipate will be offset by the strength of the business. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.13, the negative impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 1%. This is an improvement of 50 basis points since we last provided guidance. We're watching the euro and other currencies closely as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year. 
Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion, higher than our previous guidance. 
Now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.56 to $6.71 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 6% to 8%. This is higher than our previous guidance. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, a better outlook than the approximately $0.10 negative impact we discussed in our January guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.53 to $6.68 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due to an update to our tax rate and current currency estimates. As it's still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our strong start for the year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely we're expecting operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and underlying operational sales growth of 5.5%, consistent with '15 -- 2015 growth on a comparable basis. 
Our operating margins improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operational adjusted EPS growth in our guidance remains strong in the range of 6% to 8%, and our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations. 
In particular, we're pleased to see our Medical Device businesses showing continued signs of improvement, and our restructuring activities in that business are on track. And we look forward to discussing with you in more detail these activities on our May 18 Investor Day. 
Now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call. Louise?"

And I'm just wondering, Dominic, as you're having these discussions, it appears that some of the targets you may be having discussions with have unrealistic valuation expectations. So maybe talk about where valuation expectations have come. Are they getting at least in the ballpark of what J&J thinks is appropriate valuation? And then with Allergan and Pfizer no longer getting together, you have 2 more companies that are going to be actively looking at deals.

With respect to Allergan and Pfizer maybe being in the market now and creating more competition, that's probably true. I can't speak for what they're going to do. But we're accustomed to looking at various acquisition candidates where more than one party may be interested in a particular asset. That does not to sway us from being disciplined and have a clear focus on ultimately what matters, which is the deployment of that capital to create shareholder value.

So we'll continue to look there. And again, like every other M&A evaluation, we'll make sure that it's at the right valuation at the right time. With respect to INVOKANA, a couple of things to mention there. There has been -- previous to this CANVAS study, there has been 12 previous studies with INVOKANA, where we saw no such indication of increased in lower limb amputations, particularly the toe, so this seems to be focused only on the patients in the CANVAS study. It's important to note that, yes, the European regulatory body is taking a look at it. But already, the independent monitoring committee that reviews the clinical trial after reviewing all the data concluded that the trial should continue. So that's what I can tell you about that.

And typically, innovative products that have a significant impact on unmet medical need. In this case, it would be those patients that are not otherwise responding to, for example, TNF therapy. Our view is that pricing will still continue to be -- either the products will still continue to be valued and therefore, not have a lot of pressure on pricing because there is some still significant unmet medical need, and that's a new mechanism of action that should have an impact on patients. I think that that's irrespective of whether or not there's a biosimilar in the market with respect to REMICADE because, overall, pricing for immunology products, particularly in the TNF category, already have pretty significant gross to net discounts in the marketplace.

Well, just a couple things on the Vision Care business and our ACUVUE brand. As you know, the ACUVUE business is -- has a long heritage of strong category growth as well as good innovation, which creates fantastic products for contact lens wearers. And as you know, we are the world leader in contact lenses with the ACUVUE brand. And we just launched 4 new products in 2015, which are being received very well by the eye care professional and the contact lens wearer. Back in 2014, we did not have that kind of innovation coming to market first of all. And secondly, we saw some unevenness in the pricing in the market with very, very different pricing in different channels. So we decided to implement the Unilateral Pricing Policy in order to even out the pricing. And at the end of the day, what happened there was we did see a lower overall price for our products, which made the products more affordable. So today, the majority of the patients who get ACUVUE contact lenses are paying less than they did for that brand 2 years ago. Now with innovation, with the market stabilizing, we've adopted a new program that encourages patients to see their eye care professional and provides rebates and incentives for the purchase of contact lenses in conjunction with their eye exam, as prescribed by the eye care professional. And we think that's just the next evolution as a market leader to focus on eye health and not just price of the contact lens. So just a continued evolution of how we approach the market. And there may be -- when there is slight disruption in the market, we think that, overall, the long term benefit to the overall category into our business is worth it."

Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso,",1723,"Good morning, and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2016. 
Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via a webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the first quarter for the corporation and for our 3 business segments, then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 1 hour. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. 
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, up 0.6% versus first quarter 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 3.9%, and currency had a negative impact of 3.3%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 0.6%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 6.6%. 
On an operational basis, Asia Pacific and Africa grew 3%. Europe declined 0.8% and the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined by 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures, the most significant one being Cordis. 
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted operational growth in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 6.9% worldwide, 9.8% in the U.S. and 3.8% outside the U.S. In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 60 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.54 versus $1.53 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $205 million and the charge of $192 million for after-tax special items. 2015 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge of $98 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 6.1% and 7.7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. 
Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 10.3%. 
Turning now to business segment highlights. Please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translation impact. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. 
Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.2 billion decreased 0.2%, with U.S. sales down 0.1%, while outside the U.S. sales were down 0.3%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 1.9% worldwide, 4.1% in the U.S. and 0.5% outside the U.S. 
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 200 basis points and 320 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to Women's Health, Oral Care and Baby Care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by OTC worldwide and Oral Care. OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak flu season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic share growth and an inventory build as well as seasonal and new product launch inventory for upper respiratory products. 
In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 12% a year ago; while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 46%, up from nearly 43% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of analgesics and anti-smoking aids, partially offset by lower sales of upper respiratory products due to the fourth quarter distributor inventory build, as noted last quarter. 
New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 8.5%, with U.S. sales up 12.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 2.6%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.3%, 16.2% and 7.1%, respectively. 
As we discussed last year, U.S. results in the first quarter of 2015 included a positive adjustment for gross-to-net, including managed Medicaid rebates. In the first quarter this year, U.S. results included an adjustment for a similar amount and therefore, overall growth was not impacted. However, on a product basis, STELARA growth in 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 16 points, XARELTO by 4 points and REMICADE by 3 points. 
Significant contributors to growth were immunology products, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA; oncology products, IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX; as well as cardiovascular metabolic products, XARELTO and INVOKANA. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth as well as a gross-to-net adjustment to sales that I mentioned. 
Combined REMICADE export sales and international sales grew approximately 11%. Sales to distribution partners were up approximately 5%. Sales to our international direct markets were up approximately 17%, due primarily to strong double-digit growth in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., primarily driven by timing of shipments and market growth. 
Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove the results for IMBRUVICA, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 65 countries. 
DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake. DARZALEX contributed over 2% to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. 
XARELTO sales were up 29%, and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 16.5%, up over 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was nearly 14% and in cardiology, nearly 23.5%, up on a sequential basis by 0.5 point and 0.3 points, respectively. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed, with 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up nearly 18% on a worldwide basis and nearly 12% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was 6.1%, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was 11.5% and 5.5% in the primary care. 
On a sequential basis, sales declined due to the extra shipping days in the fourth quarter, incremental rebates and savings program redemptions as well as increased competition in formulary positions. INVOKANA access remains strong at 80% preferred for combined commercial and Part D. 
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.1 billion increased 0.5%. U.S. sales increased 2.2%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 1%. Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3% worldwide, with the U.S. up 3.3% and the growth of 2.8% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by Orthopaedics, advanced surgery and electrophysiology. 
Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by worldwide knees and hips, and U.S. trauma and spine. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. The success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the Attune platform in knees, our primary stem platform in hips and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to results. 
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted by results in China due to a softer demand and a reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine, other were the categories most impacted. In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. 
Strong results were achieved for advanced surgery products with endocutters growth of 10%, biosurgicals growth of 8% and energy growth of 8%. 
Electrophysiology grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2016. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?"

We carried last year's momentum into 2016, and we're off to a strong start this year. We are very pleased with the results generated in the first quarter, and we continue to make very good progress on our near-term priorities as well as our long-term growth drivers, which we discussed during our January call. We remain confident in the strength of our business. 
As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and a few extra shipping days in 2015, was 5.5%. On this same basis, we gained momentum in the first quarter, with strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7% and in line with analysts' estimates. 
In our Pharmaceutical business, our strong performance from 2015 continued into the first quarter, with underlying operational growth at over 12%. 
First quarter underlying operational sales growth for Consumer increased approximately 4% when also adjusting for the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela that Louise mentioned earlier. 
And in Medical Devices, we're off to a good start in the first quarter, with underlying operational growth of approximately 3%. Growth in our consumer-facing medical device businesses was negatively impacted by challenges in the diabetes market. 
For the hospital-focused medical device businesses, we're seeing signs of continued improvement, with underlying operational growth in those businesses of approximately 4%, driven by strength in our Orthopaedics, advanced surgery and electrophysiology businesses. 
We also saw an improvement in our overall adjusted pretax operating margin. For 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase on an adjusted basis, and we remain comfortable with that forecast as we will accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative and R&D expenses. 
Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key developments on the first quarter as well as some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. 
During the quarter, we had several key developments across the business. In our Pharmaceutical business, we received an additional approval for IMBRUVICA for first line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and also entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with TESARO for exclusive rights to the investigational compound niraparib in prostate cancer. Niraparib is an orally administered poly polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor. 
We also continued our efforts to combat major global health challenges through collaborations with government organizations and others in the industry with a call for innovative ideas to reduce HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa as well as providing funding for nonprofit organizations supporting underserved communities in the United States. 
In March 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our controlled substance raw material and API business. In 2015, these businesses totaled approximately $250 million in net trade sales. This divestiture remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals but is expected to be completed towards the middle of 2016. 
In Medical Devices, Ethicon completed the acquisition of NeuWave Medical, a privately held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems. We look forward to providing an in-depth review of the ongoing efforts of our Consumer and Medical Device businesses at our upcoming business review meeting on May 18, which will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 3.9%. And excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hep C sales, it was a strong 6.9%. If you'll direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization and special items. 
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: intangible asset amortization of $200 million and litigation charges and our Medical Devices restructuring charge. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68 per share, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates, as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 7.7% versus the prior year. Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was $1.72, up 10% over the prior year. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items in the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 10 basis points, mostly due to transactional currency, partially offset by a favorable mix in the business. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 110 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to continued good cost management. 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.5% higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines. 
Our pretax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32.9%, 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of the prior year. Interest expense net of interest income was lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments. Other income and expense was a net gain of $39 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $348 million in the same period last year. 
Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $127 million compared to a net gain of $91 million in the prior year period. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 21.5% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year and the current mix of our business. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. On our 2015 year-end call, we commented on our segment results for adjusted income before tax versus the prior year. Now that all of our competitors have reported their results for 2015, I would like to take the opportunity to point out that our 2015 adjusted income before tax was 31.4% compared to 26.2% weighted average for our competitive set. This was driven by higher margins in both Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and somewhat lower margins in our Consumer business as compared to our competitive set. 
In the first quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 80 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by improvement in both our Pharmaceutical and Medical Device businesses. Our Consumer business had a lower margin this year as compared to last year, due principally to devaluation in Venezuela. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $23 billion of debt. As you know, in February, we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates with a debt issuance of $7.5 billion. Through the end of the first quarter, we completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete 75% of the program by the end of this year. 
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. 
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We'll be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. And this is also unchanged versus our January guidance. 
And now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2016 includes the R&D tax credit that Congress made permanent in 2015. We are, therefore, comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 19% to 20%, lower by 50 basis points than our previous guidance due to updating our outlook for a higher mix of our earnings from lower tax jurisdictions in 2016 than we anticipated in our previous guidance. 
And now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrant for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. And our assumption with regard to REMICADE biosimilar remains unchanged, even with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra due to our intellectual property, which we intend to defend. 
We also do not anticipate generic competition this year from ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a very good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
Consistent with our previous guidance, we'd be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, would be approximately 5.5%, a level of growth comparable to last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier. 
The devaluation in Venezuela that we previously discussed is anticipated to be a headwind of approximately 30 basis points for the full year, which we anticipate will be offset by the strength of the business. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.13, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1%. This is an improvement of 50 basis points since we last provided guidance. We're watching the euro and other currencies closely as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year. 
Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion, higher than our previous guidance. 
Now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.56 to $6.71 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 6% to 8%. This is higher than our previous guidance. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, a better outlook than the approximate $0.10 negative impact we discussed in our January guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.53 to $6.68 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due to an update to our tax rate and current currency estimates. As it's still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our strong start for the year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely we're expecting operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and underlying operational sales growth of 5.5%, consistent with '15 -- 2015 growth on a comparable basis. 
Our operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operational adjusted EPS growth in our guidance remains strong in the range of 6% to 8%, and our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations. 
In particular, we're pleased to see our Medical Device businesses showing continued signs of improvement, and our restructuring activities in that business are on track. And we look forward to discussing with you in more detail these activities on our May 18 Investor Day.

I think in the past, you've talked about emerging markets, but just wondering if there's anything more -- time that you can share today on that side of things. And then the second question relates back to the INVOKANA discussion that was going on before. There was an announcement last week that the EMA is looking into the -- an increase in amputations that have been seen in the CANVAS study. I'm curious if you have any comments on that at this point.

So we'll continue to look there. And again, like every other M&A evaluation, we'll make sure that it's at the right valuation at the right time. With respect to INVOKANA, a couple of things to mention there. There has been -- previous to this CANVAS study, there has been 12 previous studies with INVOKANA, where we saw no such indication of increased in lower limb amputations, particularly the toe, so this seems to be focused only on the patients in the CANVAS study. It's important to note that, yes, the European regulatory body is taking a look at it. But already, the independent monitoring committee that reviews the clinical trial after reviewing all the data concluded that the trial should continue. So that's what I can tell you about that. And obviously, we'll look to advise physicians appropriately of the results once we have more understanding of them."

And typically, innovative products that have a significant impact on unmet medical need. In this case, it would be those patients that are not otherwise responding to, for example, TNF therapy. Our view is that pricing will still continue to be -- the products will still continue to be valued and, therefore, not have a lot of pressure on pricing because there is some still significant unmet medical need, and that's a new mechanism of action that should have an impact on patients. I think that that's irrespective of whether or not there's a biosimilar in the market with respect to REMICADE because, overall, pricing for immunology products, particularly in the TNF category, already have pretty significant gross-to-net discounts in the marketplace. I think we've talked before about that ours are already in the 25% range. So I don't think there's that much room for there to be significantly lower pricing in that market."

Well, just a couple things on the Vision Care business and our ACUVUE brand. As you know, the ACUVUE business is -- has a long heritage of strong category growth as well as good innovation, which creates fantastic products for contact lens wearers. And as you know, we are the world leader in contact lenses with the ACUVUE brand. And we just launched 4 new products in 2015, which are being received very well by the eye care professional and the contact lens wearer. Back in 2014, we did not have that kind of innovation coming to market first of all. And secondly, we saw some unevenness in the pricing in the market with very, very different pricing in different channels. So we decided to implement the Unilateral Pricing Policy in order to even out the pricing. And at the end of the day, what happened there was we did see a lower overall price for our products, which made the products more affordable. So today, the majority of the patients who get ACUVUE contact lenses are paying less than they did for that brand 2 years ago. Now with innovation, with the market stabilizing, we've adopted a new program that encourages patients to see their eye care professional and provides rebates and incentives for the purchase of contact lenses in conjunction with their eye exam, as prescribed by the eye care professional. And we think that's just the next evolution as a market leader to focus on eye health and not just price of the contact lens. So just a continued evolution of how we approach the market. And there may be -- when there is some slight disruption in the market, we think that, overall, the long term benefit to the overall category into our business is worth it."

Joining the on the call today is Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the second quarter for the corporation and for our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2016 results to date and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Next, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and update guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. 
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to evaluating business performance period-over-period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Also to assist you with your models, this slide provide you with a summary of important developments for the current calendar quarter. 
Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion, up 3.9% versus second quarter 2015. 
On an operational basis, sales were up 5.3% and currency have a negative impact of 1.4%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 3.1%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.7%. 
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 15.4% with approximately 1/3 of the growth due to an inventory build that will reverse in the third quarter. Asia Pacific, Africa grew 2.1%, while Europe declined 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures. The most significant one being Cordis. Excluding the next impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 7.9% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 6.9% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 30 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4 billion and earnings per share were $1.43 versus $1.61 a year ago. As a reference in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $238 million and charges for after-tax special items of $631 million. 
2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $230 million and charges for after-tax special items of $66 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.74, representing increases of 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share also grew 1.8%. 
Now turning to the highlights for the first 6 months of 2016. Consolidated sales to customers were $36 billion, an increase of 2.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, sales grew 4.6% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 2.3%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 7.4% worldwide, 9.3% in the U.S. and 5.4% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S., operational growth by 50 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings for the first 6 months of 2016. Net earnings were $8.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $3.02. Adjusted net earnings were $9.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $3.47, up 5.3% and 6.1%, respectively, versus the same period last year. 
On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 7.3%. 
Turning now to business segment highlights for the second quarter of 2016. Please note, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translation impact. 
I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 1.5%, with U.S. sales up 2.1%, while outside the U.S. sales were up 1%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, 6.8% in the U.S. and 2% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 120 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to Women's Health, Baby Care and Oral Care. 
Growth for the segment was driven primarily by Skin Care, OTC and Oral Care. 
In Skin Care, market share increases in a growing market as well as timing of inventory drove double-digit growth for both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. 
OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak allergy season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic and adjusted held share growth. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 47%, up from nearly 44% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of anti-smoking aids, children's analgesics and adjusted health products. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.7 billion increased 9.7% with U.S. sales up 13.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.9%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. 
Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.8%, 13.9% and 11.2%, respectively. 
As you know, there were discounts and rebates in the pharmaceutical industry that are reflected in net sales. These amounts are estimated until the related claims data is received and then they are actualized. We have adjusted our estimates to reflect the most current claims trends. 
U.S. pharmaceutical results this quarter included a positive adjustment to sales reserves across many channels, which was approximately $140 million higher than the adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 and positively impacted second quarter 2016 worldwide growth by approximately 1.5 points and U.S. growth by approximately 2.5 points. 
On a product basis, REMICADE U.S. growth in the second quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 8 points, STELARA by 11 points, SIMPONI by 13 points, ZYTIGA by 8 points and PROCRIT by 31 points. 
Significant contributors to growth were immunology products: REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA; oncology products, IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX; as well as cardiovascular metabolic products, XARELTO and INVOKANA. 
Within Neuroscience, strong growth for INVEGA SUSTENNA TRINZA was partially offset by lower sales of INVEGA due to the impact of generic competition. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, share growth for STELARA and SIMPONI ARIA as well as the growth to net adjustment to U.S. sales that I mentioned. 
The decline in REMICADE export sales to our distribution partners is due to the impact of biosimilars. 
Strong patient uptake with new indications approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. 
In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 70 countries. 
DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake with strong underlying demand. DARZALEX contributed approximately 2 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. DARZALEX received European Commission conditional approval this quarter and was launched in certain European countries. 
XARELTO sales were up 25.8% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to nearly 17%, up 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was over 14% and in cardiology, over 23%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up 21% on a worldwide basis and 15.2% in the U.S. 
In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was 6.3%, up from 6% in the second quarter of 2015. 
TRx with endocrinologist was approximately 11.5% and over 5.5% in primary care. 
INVOKANA access remains strong at nearly 70% preferred for commercial and over 90% for Medicare Part D. 
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 1.8%. U.S. sales increased 1%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%. As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide with U.S., up 1.9% and growth of 5.8% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. 
Growth was driven by advanced surgery, electrophysiology, orthopedics and Vision Care. Strong results were achieved for advanced surgery products with endocutters growth of 13%, energy growth of 9% and biosurgical's growth of 8%. 
The acquisition of NeuWave Medical also contributed to growth this quarter. 
Electrophysiology grew 18% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. 
Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by U.S. trauma and worldwide hips and knees. Market growth in the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. 
The success of the TFNA mailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platform in hips and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to the results. 
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted results in China due to continued reduction in inventory, trauma and spine other were the categories most impacted. 
In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. 
Vision Care sales were driven by strong growth across the major regions, partially offset in the U.S. by a customer reward program. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2016. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?"
139677,367223456,1007800,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us on the conference call or webcast today. As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016, an",2197,"Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us on the conference call or webcast today. 
As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016, and we're pleased with our shareholders are seeing above-average returns on their investment in Johnson & Johnson. 
Delivering a fair return to shareholders is the final line of our credo, which clearly defines our first responsibilities, the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and fathers and all others who use our products. 
When we meet those responsibilities and when we continuously work to improve outcomes for patients around the world, we succeed all of our stakeholders. 
Now over the last 130 years, the people at Johnson & Johnson have been helping people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives. With that remarkable heritage, I'm excited and optimistic about the opportunities for the future of Johnson & Johnson and committed to continuing our long-term success. With our broad base of strong businesses, focused strategies and comprehensive approach to innovation, we're well prepared to address the challenges of today's health care market and well positioned to lead in the movement towards healthier societies. 
As I've discussed before, we believe our broad base in human health care is vital to achieving that vision. Our broad-based is a strategic choice based on performance, and it has helped us to deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance through various economic cycles, meeting our financial commitments in the midst of global events like the U.K.'s vote to exit from the EU or the economic issues in Venezuela this year. 
Our broad base enables us to create and access growth opportunities wherever they may arise at the right time and in the right markets. 
Our deep health care expertise also makes Johnson & Johnson companies strategic partner of choice for many companies whether that means with innovative start-ups, information technology giants or large hospital systems looking to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. 
We also work with local governments and public health organizations where we're collaborating more than ever to address the world's most pressing health challenges. Our broad base allows us to create product platforms and systems across categories and establish new sources of innovation to converge in combination products. 
And finally, our broad base is helping us to realize advantages of scale to achieve enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our segments. 
All of these advantages of our broad base in human health care contribute to the long-term value we are able to create for our shareholders. 
And we continue to have a clear set of objectives for creating that long-term value. We expect global health care to grow at 3% to 5% over the next 5 years, and we have an objective to grow our sales organically at a faster rate than the market. 
We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. When we combine these objectives with our plans that continue creating value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships as well as our strong dividend yields, we believe the result to be a basis for compelling, long-term total shareholder returns. 
And that is our focus. We invest for the long-term success of our business. In fact, we've increased our spending on R&D every year for the last 5 years. We invest above industry average levels to build our robust pipelines and continue to nurture the investments we've already made. 
We also invest in innovative sales and marketing initiatives and consistently benchmark to ensure the return on our investments is as competitive and as efficient as possible. 
I'm proud that we are able to make these important investments in our business, while also generating enterprise adjusted net income margins that have increased in our above-industry benchmarks. 
After we've made the appropriate investments in our business, we look to capitalize on the right opportunities to create greater long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation framework starts with paying dividends to our shareholders, which is why we have increased our dividend every year for the last 54 years. 
Next, we seek value-creating strategic acquisitions and partnership opportunities. And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as repurchase programs. 
In fact, over the last 3, 10 and 20-year periods, Johnson & Johnson total shareholder return has exceeded our competitive composite and as you can see in this chart, we're up to a very strong start in 2016 with total shareholder return of approximately 20% through the first half of the year. 
And while we manage our business for the long term, we also have a number of near-term priorities, which I've shared with you before. As an enterprise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. Through the first 6 months, we generated sales of $36 billion, resulting in an operational growth of 4.6% when you exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C sales and operations in Venezuela, underlying growth was 7.9%. 
To the first half of this year, we have delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.47.  On an operational basis, adjusted EPS was $3.51, representing growth of 7.3%. 
In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver very strong results. On the same underlying basis, growth was 12.7% through the first half of 2016, and we are continuing to build momentum in our Consumer and Medical Device businesses, with first half underlying growth of 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively. 
We also continue making progress with our quality system, including resolving a warning letter in our ASP business in completion of the Cindy's corporate integrity agreement. 
In pharmaceuticals, we're continuing to build on our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In the last several months, we have made significant advancements in our pipeline, including: Conditional EU approval for DARZALEX for monotherapy of adults with relapse and refractory multiple myeloma and presented positive Phase III data on castor and polyps studies, which are evaluating combination therapies for DARZALEX. 
We also received the EU approval for frontline IMBRUVICA treatment in CLL as well as FDA expansion of the IMBRUVICA label to include new Phase III data on survival and in combination therapies. 
Phase III data on STELARA demonstrated maintain clinical remission after 1 year treatment in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. 
Clinical trial in real world data was presented on INVOKANA, including Phase II data on type 1 diabetes and chronic weight management. 
We received EU approval for TREVICTA, a once every 3 months injection for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia as well as line extension approval both INVOKAMET and SIMPONI. 
Positive Phase III data was presented on sirukumab for patients with moderately to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. 
And just recently, FDA granted a fourth Breakthrough Therapy designation for IMBRUVICA in graft-versus-host GDHD, which makes 6 total breakthrough designations for our Pharmaceutical business so far. 
In addition to these pipeline milestones as Louise pointed out, we also delivered strong growth with our in market products, including IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, XARELTO, STELARA and SIMPONI. 
In consumer, our priority is expanding market leadership in key segments within OTC, Oral Care, baby and beauty. 
As part of our focus on the beauty space, we had just completed the strategic acquisition of Vogue International. The award-winning beauty products in this portfolio, including the OGX brand, enhance our existing position in the market in a highly complementary to our heritage of breakthrough innovations in this space. 
Vogue International has grown double digits over the last 5 years with a compound annual growth rate of about 25% and the acquisition will take us from #8 to #4 in the U.S. haircare market. 
And as we discussed in May at our Analyst Day, we're continuing to see operating margin improvement in our consumer business and plan to continue that trend for the next several years. 
And in Medical Devices, we're focused on accelerating growth through innovation and transforming our go-to-market models. In this segment, we're gaining momentum in accelerating growth through our unique and broad-based approach to innovation. Our performance this quarter was roughly in line with market growth. And we're pleased with the progress here, but far from satisfied. Our goal to be clear is to grow above market overall. 
And while we're making strategic decisions in our portfolio to achieve that growth like the recent acquisition of BioMedical Enterprises, which still the key portfolio gap in ankle, foot surgery, we're also realigning our commercial models in line with our near-term priority. Our innovation model in Hospital Medical Devices includes innovating our product offerings, but it also looks at innovation in terms of our commercial offerings and contracting. 
As we outlined during our business review day, today, about 25% of our U.S. orthopedic and surgery business is in multi-product line agreements. These agreements perform almost 2x better than single product contract agreements. We see this percentage growing to 40% in the near future, which we believe will help us accelerate our business going forward. 
And finally, we're also serving customers in a more end-to-end manner with risk sharing contracts and outcome-based patients solutions. 
We're also on track to deliver approximately $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings from our medical device restructuring, the majority of which we expect will be realized by the end of 2018. 
And also, we continue to make progress in launching new competitive entries in our Consumer Medical Device businesses like the ACUVUE VITA, a 30-day daily wear contact lens that provides superior comfort over leading monthly brands. 
With all these progress through our Medical Devices segment, we are confident that we are poised to deliver above-market growth. 
Altogether, these near-term priorities will help drive success for each of our business segments, while also enabling us to achieve the growth we expect for our company in the long term. With the progress we made on our near-term priorities, our businesses are strong, positioning us for above-market growth. With the combined strength of our in market portfolio, deep late-stage pipeline and robust early-stage pipeline, we feel confident our Pharmaceutical business can successfully navigate through the launches of new competitive biosimilar or generic entrance and evolving market dynamics. And our objective is to continue delivering above-industry growth. 
Our consumer business is positioned to grow above market, while also achieving benchmark profitability and investing for the future. 
In Hospital Medical Devices, we are poised to grow above the market, driven by our innovative pipelines, expanding global presence and novel commercial models. 
Our consumer Medical Devices businesses are holding leading positions and seeking opportunities to expand a large growing markets with significant unmet needs. 
With the strength of each of our business segments, we feel optimistic about the future opportunities in health care, and we are confident our long-term strategies have positioned us for continued growth. Our holistic approach to innovation, going beyond products and solutions, will allow us to address the evolving health care landscape, driving better outcomes and delivering long-term value. We have the right internal capabilities and are developing strategic partnerships in health tech to reshape the way health care is delivered, managed and experienced. 
And finally, our broad-based across human health care uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader in partner of choice in the health care market. 
But perhaps most importantly of all, our continued strong performance means we are able to create better products, more valuable services and improved outcomes for patients, consumers and their families. 
I'd like to thank you. I look forward to further dialogue during the Q&A session. But first, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Louise Mehrotra, who was most of you from our announcement last month, has decided to retire after more than 35 years with Johnson & Johnson and more than 10 years as Vice President of Investor Relations. 
I know many of you on the call today have gotten to know Louise pretty well over the last several years, a real testament to the strong relationship she's built in the investment community on behalf of Johnson & Johnson. And you may know that she's an incredibly committed credo-based leader and had a remarkable career and impact in our company. I think I can speak for all of us at Johnson & Johnson in saying that we will miss her trusted, experience, respected advice and her ever presence determination to do the best interest of our credo stakeholders. 
Louise, we're so proud of the best-in-class Investor Relations function you've developed for us over the last decade. And we sincerely thank you for your many years of service and dedication to Johnson & Johnson. 
Now we know we'll be in good hands with Joe Wolk, previously Vice President group finance for our pharmaceutical groups, will become Vice President Investor Relations effective August 1 and will transition with Louise over the next 5 months. 
We are confident that Joe will continue Louise's legacy of transparent and credible communication with you, our investors. 
So now, I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso, who will talk more about our results and expectations for the second half of 2016. Dominic?"

Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for our valued support and friendship during my time as Chief Financial Officer. 
Over the last 10 years, Louise and the entire IR team has transformed our Investor Relations function, significantly developing our reputation with the investment community, which has been recognized with several awards and recognitions, including those from institutional investor and IR Magazine. And through surveys of money managers conducted by Barron's Magazine, Johnson & Johnson has been ranked at/or near the top of the most respected companies list for 10 of the last 12 years. In fact, I'm also pleased to report the Johnson & Johnson was recognized this year by Barron's Magazine as the #1 most respected company for 2016. 
As Alex noted, Louise's outstanding leadership and dedication to advancing our reputation will continue with her successor, Joe Wolk, who we're happy to have joining us on our call next quarter. We all wish Louise well, and we are certainly going to miss her. 
With that, I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're very pleased with our second quarter results as we continue to see improved performance across the enterprise. And as Alex said, we remain confident in the strength of our business. 
As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and the few shipping days in 2015, was about 5.5% On this same basis, we continue to deliver strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7.9% for the second quarter and our sales results are above analyst estimates. 
Our second quarter earnings were also above analyst estimates, driven by strong sales performance and operating margin improvement. 
As you may remember for 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase in pretax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We were pleased to see progress towards this improvement during the second quarter, which I will discuss later. And we remain comfortable with that forecast as we continue to accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. 
Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. 
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 5.3% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hepatitis C sales and also the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year, it was strong at more than 8%. 
If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization, expense and special items. 
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items approximately $900 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: Intangible asset amortization expense of about $200 million; litigation charges from ongoing legal matters of about $500 million; and additional charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore, $1.74, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by our first call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 1.8% versus the prior year and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items in the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold decreased by 120 basis points, mostly due to favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by transactional currency. 
Selling marketing and administrative expenses were 28% of sales or 230 basis points lower as compared to the second quarter 2015 due to good cost management. 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2% and higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advanced our promising product pipelines. 
Our pretax operating margin when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense was 32.5% or 320 basis points higher than the second quarter of the prior year. 
As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling marketing administrative and R&D expenses. 
As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progressed throughout the year and through 6 months, we have achieved 180 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability. 
Interest expense net of interest income was slightly lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments. Other income and expense was a net expense of approximately $600 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of approximately $900 million in the same period last year. 
Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $100 million compared to a net gain of approximately $1 billion in the prior year period.  The significant decrease is due to the divestiture of NUCYNTA in the prior year period. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 23% in the same period last year. This year's effective tax rate reflect the R&D credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, the current mix of our business and the impact of new accounting standards related to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which I will discuss further in a moment. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. 
In the second quarter of 2016 , our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise declined by 250 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. 
During the second quarter 2015, as I mentioned earlier, we recorded a gain from the divestiture of NUCYNTA, and this gain, which as you know from our discussions last year, was invested in various parts of the business but those investments occurred later in the year. 
If the NUCYNTA divestiture gain is excluded, year-on-year adjusted income before tax margin which show an improvement of approximately 300 basis points. We're very pleased to see a significant improvement in our consumer business adjusted income tax margin this quarter. As you may recall, from our business review day in May, we said that we are focused on improving our margins in the consumer business to benchmark levels. We are confident that our consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin of full year 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Overall, we expect income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in the pretax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $16 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $42 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $26 billion of debt. As you know, in May, we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates, with the European debt issuance equivalent to $4.5 billion. 
Through the end of the second quarter, we have completed nearly 50% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we continue to expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. 
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $400 million and $500 million. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance. 
Regarding other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we recorded royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation investments prior development corporation divestitures, asset sales and write offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as of net gain, ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the timing of underlying activity. This impact will be offset by the strength of our business, primarily due to our outlook for higher level of sales as noted in the increased sales guidance in our press release today. 
And now just a word on taxes. During the second quarter, the company elected for early adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based compensation. With this update, increased tax benefits are recognized in earnings on the employee exercises options or received shares. Previously, these tax benefits were recorded in equity. 
The first quarter -- first quarter impact was approximately $165 million or $0.05 per share and is reflected in the year-to-date results and not in the second quarter when we adopted the standard. 
The second quarter impact is offset by additional tax cost reflected in this quarter. For adoption guidance, the first quarter does not need to be reissued. However, all future comparisons for the first quarter should reflect the recasted numbers. We have included a supplementary schedule on our website that includes the updated first quarter impact for the P&L. 
You will note that the first quarter recast number reflects a tax rate of 15.8%. The company issued shares related to employee stock compensation such as restricted stock, awards or performance share units in the first quarter. Therefore historically, a significant portion of the annual tax benefit is recognized in the first quarter. The tax benefit for stock options is recognized throughout the year as employees exercise their options, but timing is less predictable for stock options. 
We are comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016 excluding special items will approximately 18.5% to 19%, lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the accounting for share-based compensation tax benefit that I just described. 
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. 
As a reminder,  our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrance for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S. and our assumption remains unchanged with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra. 
We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic and transport INVEGA and TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As Alex mentioned, we have now closed the acquisition of Vogue International so our guidance now reflects 6 months of additional sales. This is a fast-growing business and will contribute to the profitability of our consumer business beginning the first full year as well as be accretive to our adjusted EPS beginning in the first full year. 
Also during the second quarter, we closed on our divestiture for the controlled substance raw material and API business and therefore, those sales were no longer be recorded. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflected our results for operation. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this does provide a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact at current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
As noted on our press release, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for 2016 primarily reflecting the strong results from the first half as well as 6 additional months of sales from the Vogue acquisition, partially offset by the divestiture of our controlled substance raw material and API business. We would, therefore, be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion and higher than our previous guidance. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how do we describe our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C sales would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we've mentioned earlier. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 1% on sales. This is consistent with our previous guidance as other major currencies strengthened since our last update. We are watching the euro and other currencies closely as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle after the year. Of course,  we're closely following the situation with the UK's vote to exit from the EU. We expect this will take them to fully determine what the impact will be, if any. 
To put it into perspective though, the U.K. represents about 3% of our total sales. So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion and higher than our previous guidance. 
And now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by about 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of between $6.66 to $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational constant currency growth rate of 7.4% to 9%. This is a narrower range as well as higher than our previous guidance, and includes the first quarter impact from the tax accounting change we discussed earlier. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, and this is consistent with our guidance in April. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.63, $6.73 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due both to the continued strength of the business and a lower tax rate. 
And at this point in the year, we will be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the first 6 months of this year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6% or higher than we saw in 2015 on a comparable basis. 
Our adjusted pretax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
Our adjusted operational EPS growth in our guidance improved and remains strong in the range of $6.66 to $6.76 a share, that's a growth rate of between 7% and 9%. 
Our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations. 
And now, I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call. Louise?"

Well with respect to the early adoption, I mentioned earlier that the first quarter impact was $0.05, and that's the most significant impact we expect for the year because that's where the majority of stock-based compensation is issued to employees. The second quarter impact was lower than that, but was almost entirely offset by other tax items, and the rest of the year will depend on when employees exercise stock options, so very difficult to predict. So for now, we've included in our effective tax rate for the year only the first quarter impact, which after we adopted in the second quarter, we're letting the first quarter impact flow through for the remainder of the year. Second quarter have already been offset by other items and remaining quarterly impacts we think will either likely be offset by other items or very difficult to predict because it's timing of when employees exercise options."

Those 2 generally offset and the midpoint of the guidance is up about $0.07 and when I do the midpoint versus the 2 ends and the $0.07 is primarily due to the overall increases in sales guidance that we provided today.

I think we see that in the core trends and of course, was we establish that, we continue to see consumer us a great growth opportunity for the organization going forward. And as Jorge and as you saw when we did the medical device and consumer Investor Relations review now about a little over a month ago, I think they've got a really ambitious but also realistic plan for that, built on our existing brands, and we're really pleased to see performance, for example, LISTERINE up 7%; OTC is up 6%; analgesics within OTC were up over 13% and in beauty, we saw about 9% lift with really strong performance for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. And when you take that and augment it, I think with thoughtful additions such as we saw over this last quarter whether it was NeoStrata, whether it was HIPOGLÓS or with Vogue, we think that those are great additions our existing portfolio and we'll  likely be part of a continuous stream of additions to that part of that portfolio. As we said for sometime whenever we're looking at inorganic growth opportunities, we look at tuck-ins, we look at midsize deals, we look at large deals, of course, the tuck in in strategy, particularly in pharma -- actually in all of our segments medical device and consumer are those that where we feel that we can create the most value, but we do think of there's other opportunities to create value as well.

We see it in the way that expectation are changing among decision-makers, including not only surgeons, but also people in procurement and other C suite executives, administrators and hospital systems.

We know that they're unlikely to be switched when they're getting a positive reference from the therapy, and we also know that when we contract across the Johnson & Johnson portfolio that it provides is a very important position with larger health care networks.

Well, Josh you are right there are many factors that contribute. I mean, GP is one, so we continue to see good manufacturing efficiencies and cost improvements across the supply chain, that's a major initiative we've had ongoing for quite some time, so we saw some of that benefit this quarter. We expect that we'll see it going forward as well. In the selling market administrative line, that's where you see the benefit of the program you're referring to, where we anticipate about $1 billion of savings for 2018. That program is on track, we're seeing the savings. We also making some investments as the investments tail off, the savings will be more significant and more impactful in that line item going forward. So we're beginning to see the savings now. They're somewhat partially offset by some investments we need to make to continue the program. But in the future, those investments tail off and the savings ramp up, and they have more of an impact. And then also, as you mentioned, the medical device restructuring is a whole another area that's unrelated to the 2 that I just mentioned earlier, and we expect to see continued improvements there, although that's a business where we want also to accelerate the pace of innovation with those savings. So some of those will be reinvested in the business. So it's across those 3 areas, and we're committed to the operating margin improvement that I've mentioned earlier of greater than 200 basis points and halfway through the year, we feel very good about our ability to achieve that."

Well, consistent with what we said last time when you asked a very similar question. We, as you know, we're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions and although we're  actively involved in considering them, valuations come into play and the willingness of the other party to do an acquisition have certain valuations come into play. So that's regardless of how much money we have available to spend, right? So we don't really look at that as the main driver of how we're going to the acquisitions. We look at what value we're going to create for shareholders by doing the acquisition of the right value, so we can improve returns for our shareholders. There are some expectations that are still not, in our opinion, normalized for appropriate valuations in the market, so that's a factor, and that will take time, and we're patient with that and we'll take -- we'll see how the market evolves overtime or as we learn more about the acquisition candidates and their progress in various areas. And then finally, whether or not the cash is trapped overseas or not is not at all an impediment to our ability to do any acquisitions. We'll either obviously try to find a way to do it in the tax efficient basis as we've done with other acquisitions and utilize that cash as much is possible only if it's tax efficient but then obviously, we can continue to borrow and we have ability to borrow to do the acquisitions that we think are value creative for our shareholders. So we won't let that hold us back should the acquisition beat value creating, we exercise our ability to borrow and do that acquisition."

So U.S. how does it occur and what's going on with list price versus net price, and those sort of things. So just to put it in perspective, this is not unusual in our industry, as you know,, everyone in the pharmaceutical industry is estimating what the rebates might be and then, of course, we'll actualize them was actual data is submitted. Recently, that actual data has been more timely and in that more timely data from the payers, we're able to see trends -- so we're able to not only actualize prior period amounts but also able to estimate better what the ultimate gross to net variation will be going forward. With respect to list price net of rebates, as you probably know, we said this before, I think we price our products responsibly and our overall list price increases have been relatively below, substantially below the average industry. But in the end, the net price that's achieved is far from the gross price increase that happened. So rebates continue to be an increasing part of the business and the overall realization of gross price to net price that is expanding I would say overtime. And therefore, as I said, now, we're much more current with our ability to predict these estimates, and that's what's going on. And as I mentioned, we don't expect to see significant adjustments in [indiscernible]."

I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2016. 
Joining the on the call today is Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the second quarter for the corporation and for our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2016 results to date and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Next, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and update guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. 
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to evaluating business performance period-over-period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Also, to assist you with your models, this slide provide you with a summary of important developments for the current during the quarter. 
Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion, up 3.9% versus second quarter 2015. 
On an operational basis, sales were up 5.3% and currency have a negative impact of 1.4%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 3.1% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.7%. 
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 15.4% with approximately 1/3 of the growth due to an inventory build that will reverse in the third quarter. Asia Pacific, Africa grew 2.1%, while Europe declined 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures. The most significant one being Cordis. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 7.9% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 6.9% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 30 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4 billion and earnings per share were $1.43 versus $1.61 a year ago. As a reference in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $238 million and charges for after-tax special items of $631 million. 
2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $230 million and charges for after-tax special items of $66 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.74, representing increases of 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share also grew 1.8%. 
Now turning to the highlights for the first 6 months of 2016. Consolidated sales to customers were $36 billion, an increase of 2.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, sales grew 4.6% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 2.3%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 7.4% worldwide, 9.3% in the U.S. and 5.4% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S., operational growth by 50 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings for the first 6 months of 2016. Net earnings were $8.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $3.02. Adjusted net earnings were $9.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $3.47, up 5.3% and 6.1%, respectively, versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 7.3%. 
Turning now to business segment highlights for the second quarter of 2016. Please note, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translation impact. 
I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 1.5%, with U.S. sales up 2.1% while outside the U.S. sales were up 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, 6.8% in the U.S. and 2% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 120 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to Women's Health, Baby Care and Oral Care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by Skin Care, OTC and Oral Care. 
In Skin Care, market share increases in a growing market as well as timing of inventory builds to have double-digit growth for both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. 
OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak allergy season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic and adjusted held share growth. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 47%, up from nearly 44% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of anti-smoking aids, children's analgesics and adjusted health products. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.7 billion increased 9.7% with U.S. sales up 13.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.9%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. 
Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide, U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.8%, 13.9% and 11.2%, respectively. 
As you know, there were discounts and rebates in the pharmaceutical industry that are reflected in net sales. These amounts are estimated until the related claims data is received and then they are actualized. We have adjusted our estimates to reflect the most current claims trends. 
U.S. pharmaceutical results this quarter included a positive adjustment to sales reserves across many channels, which was approximately $140 million higher than the adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 and positively impacted second quarter 2016 worldwide growth by approximately 1.5 points and U.S. growth by approximately 2.5 points. 
On a product basis, REMICADE U.S. growth in the second quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 8 points, STELARA by 11 points, SIMPONI by 13 points, ZYTIGA by 8 points and PROCRIT by 31 points. 
Significant contributors to growth were immunology products, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA; oncology products, IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX; as well as cardiovascular metabolic products, XARELTO and INVOKANA. 
Within Neuroscience, strong growth for INVEGA SUSTENNA TRINZA was partially offset by lower sales of INVEGA due to the impact of generic competition. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, share growth for STELARA and SIMPONI ARIA as well as the growth to net adjustments to U.S. sales that I mentioned. 
The decline in REMICADE export sales to our distribution partners was due to the impact of biosimilars. 
Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 70 countries. 
DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake with strong underlying demand. DARZALEX contributed approximately 2 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. DARZALEX received European Commission conditional approval this quarter and was launched in certain European countries. 
XARELTO sales were up 25.8% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to nearly 17%, up 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was over 14% and in cardiology, over 23%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up 21% on a worldwide basis and 15.2% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was 6.3%, up from 6% in the second quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologist was approximately 11.5% and over 5.5% in primary care. INVOKANA access remains strong at nearly 70% preferred for commercial and over 90% for Medicare Part D. 
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 1.8%. U.S. sales increased 1%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%. As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide with U.S. up 1.9% and growth of 5.8% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. Growth was driven by advanced surgery, electrophysiology, orthopedics and Vision Care. 
Strong results were achieved for advanced surgery products with endocutters growth of 13%, energy growth of 9% and biosurgicals growth of 8%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical also contributed to growth this quarter. 
Electrophysiology grew 18% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. 
Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by U.S. trauma and worldwide hips and knees. Market growth in the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. 
The success of the TFNA mailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platforms in hips and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to the results.
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were negatively impacted results in China due to continued reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine, other were the categories most impacted. 
In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. 
Vision Care sales were driven by strong growth across the major regions, partially offset in the U.S. by a customer reward program. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2016. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?"

As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016, and we're pleased that our shareholders are seeing above-average returns on their investment in Johnson & Johnson. 
Delivering a fair return to shareholders is the final line of our credo, which clearly defines our first responsibilities, the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and fathers and all others who use our products. When we meet those responsibilities and when we continuously work to improve outcomes for patients around the world, we succeed with all of our stakeholders. 
Now over the last 130 years, the people of Johnson & Johnson have been helping people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives. With that remarkable heritage, I'm excited and optimistic about the opportunities for the future of Johnson & Johnson and committed to continuing our long-term success. With our broad base of strong businesses, focused strategies and comprehensive approach to innovation, we're well prepared to address the challenges of today's health care market and well positioned to lead in the movement towards healthier societies. 
As I've discussed before, we believe our broad base in human health care is vital to achieving that vision. Our broad base is a strategic choice based on performance, and it has helped us to deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance through various economic cycles, meeting our financial commitments in the midst of global events like the U.K.'s vote to exit from the EU or the economic issues in Venezuela this year. Our broad base enables us to create and access growth opportunities wherever they may arise at the right time and in the right markets. 
Our deep health care expertise also makes Johnson & Johnson companies strategic partner of choice for many companies whether that means with innovative start-ups, information technology giants or large hospital systems looking to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. 
We also work with local governments and public health organizations where we're collaborating more than ever to address the world's most pressing health challenges. Our broad base allows us to create product platforms and systems across categories and establish new sources of innovation to converge in combination products. And finally, our broad base is helping us to realize advantages of scale to achieve enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our segments. 
All of these advantages of our broad base in human health care contribute to the long-term value we are able to create for our shareholders, and we continue to have a clear set of objectives for creating that long-term value. We expect global health care to grow at 3% to 5% over the next 5 years, and we have an objective to grow our sales organically at a faster rate than the market. 
We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. When we combine these objectives with our plans that continue creating value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships as well as our strong dividend yield, we believe the result to be a basis for compelling, long-term total shareholder returns. And that is our focus. We invest for the long-term success of our business. In fact, we have increased our spending on R&D every year for the last 5 years. We invest above-industry average levels to build our robust pipelines and continue to nurture the investments we've already made. 
We also invest in innovative sales and marketing initiatives and consistently benchmark to ensure the return on our investments is as competitive and as efficient as possible. 
I'm proud that we are able to make these important investments in our business, while also generating enterprise adjusted net income margins that have increased in our above-industry benchmarks. 
After we've made the appropriate investments in our business, we look to capitalize on the right opportunities to create greater long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation framework starts with paying dividends to our shareholders, which is why we have increased our dividend every year for the last 54 years. Next, we seek value-creating strategic acquisitions and partnership opportunities. And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as repurchase programs. 
In fact, over the last 3, 10 and 20-year periods, Johnson & Johnson total shareholder return has exceeded our competitive composite. And as you can see in this chart, we're up to a very strong start in 2016 with total shareholder return of approximately 20% through the first half of the year. 
And while we manage our business for the long term, we also have a number of near-term priorities, which I've shared with you before. As an enterprise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. Through the first 6 months, we generated sales of $36 billion, resulting in an operational growth of 4.6% when you exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C sales. And operations in Venezuela, underlying growth was 7.9%. 
To the first half of this year, we have delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.47. On an operational basis, adjusted EPS was $3.51, representing growth of 7.3%. 
In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver very strong results. On the same underlying basis, growth was 12.7% through the first half of 2016, and we are continuing to build momentum in our Consumer and Medical Device businesses with first half underlying growth of 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively. 
We also continue making progress with our quality system, including resolving a warning letter in our ASP business in completion of the Cintas' corporate integrity agreement. 
In pharmaceuticals, we're continuing to build on our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In the last several months, we have made significant advancements in our pipeline, including conditional EU approval for DARZALEX for monotherapy of adults with relapse and refractory multiple myeloma and presented positive Phase III data on the CASTOR and POLLUX studies, which are evaluating combination therapies for DARZALEX. 
We also received the EU approval for frontline IMBRUVICA treatment in CLL as well as FDA expansion of the IMBRUVICA label to include new Phase III data on survival and in combination therapies. 
Phase III data on STELARA demonstrated maintain clinical remission after 1 year of treatment in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. 
Clinical trial in real-world data was presented on INVOKANA, including Phase II data on type 1 diabetes and chronic weight management. 
We received EU approval for TREVICTA, a once every 3 months injection for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia as well as line extension approval for both INVOKAMET and SIMPONI. 
Positive Phase III data was presented on sirukumab for patients with moderately to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. 
And just recently, FDA granted the fourth Breakthrough Therapy designation for IMBRUVICA in graft versus host disease, GDHD, which makes 6 total breakthrough designations for our Pharmaceutical business so far. 
In addition to these pipeline milestones, as Louise pointed out, we also delivered strong growth with our in-market products, including IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, XARELTO, STELARA and SIMPONI. 
In consumer, our priority is expanding market leadership in key segments within OTC, Oral Care, Baby and beauty. 
As part of our focus on the beauty space, we had just completed the strategic acquisition of Vogue International. The award-winning beauty products in this portfolio, including the OGX brand, enhance our existing position in the market in a highly complementary to our heritage of breakthrough innovations in this space. 
Vogue International has grown double digits over the last 5 years with a compound annual growth rate of about 25%, and the acquisition will take us from #8 to #4 in the U.S. hair care market. 
And as we discussed in May at our Analyst Day, we're continuing to see operating margin improvement in our consumer business and plan to continue that trend for the next several years. 
And in Medical Devices, we're focused on accelerating growth through innovation and transforming our go-to-market models. In this segment, we're gaining momentum in accelerating growth through our unique and broad-based approach to innovation. Our performance this quarter was roughly in line with market growth. And we're pleased with the progress here, but far from satisfied. Our goal to be clear is to grow above market overall. 
And while we're making strategic decisions in our portfolio to achieve that growth like the recent acquisition of BioMedical Enterprises, Inc., which filled the key portfolio gap in elective foot and ankle surgery, we're also realigning our commercial models in line with our near-term priority. Our innovation model in Hospital Medical Devices includes innovating our product offerings, but it also looks at innovation in terms of our commercial offerings and contracting. 
As we outlined during our business review day, today, about 25% of our U.S. orthopedic and surgery business is in multiproduct line agreements. These agreements perform almost 2x better than single-product contract agreements. We see this percentage growing to 40% in the near future, which we believe will help us accelerate our business going forward. 
And finally, we're also serving customers in a more end-to-end manner with risk-sharing contracts and outcome-based patient solutions. 
We're also on track to deliver approximately $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings from our medical device restructuring, the majority of which we expect will be realized by the end of 2018. 
And also, we continue to make progress in launching new competitive entries in our Consumer Medical Device businesses like the ACUVUE VITA, a 30-day daily wear contact lens that provides superior comfort over leading monthly brands. 
With all these progress through our Medical Devices segment, we are confident that we are poised to deliver above-market growth. Altogether, these near-term priorities will help drive success for each of our business segments, while also enabling us to achieve the growth we expect for our company in the long term. With the progress we made on our near-term priorities, our businesses are strong, positioning us for above-market growth. With the combined strength of our in-market portfolio, deep late-stage pipeline and robust early-stage pipeline, we feel confident our Pharmaceutical business can successfully navigate through the launches of new competitive biosimilar or generic entrance and evolving market dynamics. And our objective is to continue delivering above-industry growth. Our consumer business is positioned to grow above market, while also achieving benchmark profitability and investing for the future. 
And in Hospital Medical Devices, we are poised to grow above the market, driven by our innovative pipelines, expanding global presence and novel commercial models. 
Our Consumer Medical Device businesses are holding leading positions and seeking opportunities to expand in large growing markets with significant unmet needs. With the strength of each of our business segments, we feel optimistic about the future opportunities in health care, and we are confident our long-term strategies have positioned us for continued growth. Our holistic approach to innovation, going beyond products and solutions, will allow us to address the evolving health care landscape, driving better outcomes and delivering long-term value. We have the right internal capabilities and are developing strategic partnerships in health tech to reshape the way health care is delivered, managed and experienced. 
And finally, our broad base across human health care uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader in partner of choice in the health care market. 
But perhaps most importantly of all, our continued strong performance means we are able to create better products, more valuable services and improved outcomes for patients, consumers and their families. 
So I'd like to thank you. I look forward to further dialogue during the Q&A session. But first, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Louise Mehrotra, who, as most of you know from our announcement last month, has decided to retire after more than 35 years with Johnson & Johnson and more than 10 years as Vice President of Investor Relations. 
I know many of you on the call today have gotten to know Louise pretty well over the last several years, a real testament to the strong relationship she's built in the investment community on behalf of Johnson & Johnson. And you may know that she's an incredibly committed credo-based leader and had a remarkable career and impact on our company. I think I can speak for all of us at Johnson & Johnson in saying that we will miss her trusted, experienced, respected advice and her ever-present determination to do as in the best interest of all of our credo stakeholders. 
Louise, we're so proud of the best-in-class Investor Relations function you've developed for us over the last decade, and we sincerely thank you for your many years of service and dedication to Johnson & Johnson. 
Now we know we'll all be in good hands with Joe Wolk, previously Vice President in Group Finance for our Pharmaceuticals Group, will become Vice President Investor Relations effective August 1 and transition with Louise over the next 5 months. We are confident that Joe will continue Louise's legacy of transparent and credible communication with you, our investors. 
So now, I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso, who will talk more about our results and expectations for the second half of 2016. Dominic?"
139677,367223456,1007971,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for her valued support and friendship during my time as Chie",2644,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for her valued support and friendship during my time as Chief Financial Officer. 
Over the last 10 years, Louise and the entire IR team has transformed our Investor Relations function, significantly developing our reputation with the investment community, which has been recognized with several awards and recognitions, including those from institutional investor and IR Magazine. And through surveys of money managers conducted by Barron's Magazine, Johnson & Johnson has been ranked at/or near the top of the most respected companies list for 10 of the last 12 years. In fact, I'm also pleased to report that Johnson & Johnson was recognized this year by Barron's Magazine as the #1 most respected company for 2016.
As Alex noted, Louise's outstanding leadership and dedication to advancing our reputation will continue with her successor, Joe Wolk, who we're happy to have joining us on our call next quarter. We all wish Louise well, and we are certainly going to miss her. 
With that, I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're very pleased with our second quarter results as we continue to see improved performance across the enterprise. And as Alex said, we remain confident in the strength of our business. 
As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days in 2015, was about 5.5% On this same basis, we continue to deliver strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7.9% for the second quarter, and our sales results are above analyst estimates. Our second quarter earnings were also above analyst estimates, driven by strong sales performance and operating margin improvement. 
As you may remember for 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase in pretax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We were pleased to see progress towards this improvement during the second quarter, which I will discuss later. And we remain comfortable with that forecast as we continue to accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. 
Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. 
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 5.3%. And excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hepatitis C sales and also the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year, it was strong at more than 8%. 
If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization, expense and special items. 
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items on approximately $900 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: Intangible asset amortization expense of about $200 million, litigation charges from ongoing legal matters of about $500 million and additional charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore, $1.74, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by our first call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 1.8% versus the prior year, and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold decreased by 120 basis points, mostly due to favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by transactional currency. 
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 28% of sales or 230 basis points lower as compared to the second quarter 2015 due to good cost management. 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2% and higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advanced our promising product pipelines. 
Our pretax operating margin when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense was 32.5% or 320 basis points higher than the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative and R&D expenses. 
As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progressed throughout the year. And through 6 months, we have achieved 180 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability. 
Interest expense, net of interest income was slightly lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments. Other income and expense was a net expense of approximately $600 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of approximately $900 million in the same period last year. 
Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $100 million compared to a net gain of approximately $1 billion in the prior year period. The significant decrease is due to the divestiture of NUCYNTA in the prior year period. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 23% in the same period last year. This year's effective tax rate reflect the R&D credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, the current mix of our business and the impact of new accounting standards related to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which I will discuss further in a moment. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise declined by 250 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. 
During the second quarter of 2015, as I mentioned earlier, we recorded a gain from the divestiture of NUCYNTA. And this gain, which, as you know from our discussions last year, was invested in various parts of the business, but those investments occurred later in the year. 
If the NUCYNTA divestiture gain is excluded, year-on-year adjusted income before tax margin which show an improvement of approximately 300 basis points. We're very pleased to see a significant improvement in our Consumer business adjusted income tax margin this quarter. As you may recall from our business review day in May, we said that we are focused on improving our margins in the Consumer business to benchmark levels. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin of full year 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Overall, we expect income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in the pretax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $16 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $42 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $26 billion of debt. As you know, in May, we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates, with the European debt issuance equivalent to $4.5 billion. 
Through the end of the second quarter, we have completed nearly 50% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we continue to expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. 
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $400 million and $500 million. There's a slight decrease from our prior guidance. 
Regarding other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation investments, prior development corporation divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2016, reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as of net gain, ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the timing of underlying activity. This impact will be offset by the strength of our business, primarily due to our outlook for higher level of sales as noted in the increased sales guidance in our press release today. 
And now just a word on taxes. During the second quarter, the company elected for early adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based compensation. With this update, increased tax benefits are recognized in earnings on the employee exercises options or received shares. Previously, these tax benefits were recorded in equity. 
The first quarter impact was approximately $165 million or $0.05 per share and is reflected in the year-to-date results and not in the second quarter when we adopted the standard. The second quarter impact is offset by additional tax costs reflected in this quarter. 
For adoption guidance, the first quarter does not need to be reissued. However, all future comparisons for the first quarter should reflect the recasted numbers. We have included a supplementary schedule on our website that includes the updated first quarter impact for the P&L. 
You will note that the first quarter recast number reflects a tax rate of 15.8%. The company issued shares related to employee stock compensation such as restricted stock, awards or performance share units in the first quarter. Therefore, historically, a significant portion of the annual tax benefit is recognized in the first quarter. The tax benefit for stock options is recognized throughout the year as employees exercise their options, but timing is less predictable for stock options. 
We are comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, were approximately 18.5% to 19%, lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the accounting for share-based compensation tax benefits that I just described. 
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrance for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S., and our assumption remains unchanged with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra. 
We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrance for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As Alex mentioned, we have now closed the acquisition of Vogue International. So our guidance now reflects 6 months of additional sales. This is a fast-growing business and will contribute to the profitability of our Consumer business beginning the first full year as well as be accretive to our adjusted EPS beginning in the first full year. 
Also, during the second quarter, we closed on our divestiture for the controlled substance raw material and API business and therefore, those sales were no longer be recorded. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this does provide a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
As noted on our press release, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for 2016, primarily reflecting the strong results from the first half as well as 6 additional months of sales from the Vogue acquisition, partially offset by the divestiture of our controlled substance raw material and API business. We would, therefore, be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion and higher than our previous guidance. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we describe our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C sales, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we've mentioned earlier. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 1% on sales. This is consistent with our previous guidance as other major currencies strengthened since our last update. We are watching the euro and other currencies closely as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle after the year. Of course, we're closely following the situation with the U.K.'s vote to exit from the EU. We expect this will take them to fully determine what the impact will be, if any. 
To put it into perspective though, the U.K. represents about 3% of our total sales. So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion and higher than our previous guidance. 
And now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by about 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of between $6.66 to $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational constant currency growth rate of 7.4% to 9%. This is a narrower range as well as higher than our previous guidance and includes the first quarter impact from the tax accounting change we discussed earlier. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, and this is consistent with our guidance in April. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.63 to $6.73 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due both to the continued strength of the business and a lower tax rate. And at this point in the year, we will be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the first 6 months of this year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6% or higher than we saw in 2015 on a comparable basis. 
Our adjusted pretax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
Our adjusted operational EPS growth in our guidance improved and remains strong in the range of $6.66 to $6.76 a share, that's a growth rate of between 7% and 9%. Our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations.

Well, with respect to the early adoption, I mentioned earlier that the first quarter impact was $0.05, and that's the most significant impact we expect for the year because that's where the majority of stock-based compensation is issued to employees. The second quarter impact was lower than that, but was almost entirely offset by other tax items. And the rest of the year will depend on when employees exercise stock options, so very difficult to predict. So for now, we've included in our effective tax rate for the year only the first quarter impact, which after we adopted in the second quarter, we're letting the first quarter impact flow through for the remainder of the year. Second quarter impacts already been offset by other items, and remaining quarterly impacts, we think, will either likely be offset by other items or very difficult to predict because it's timing of when employees exercise options."

So the $0.10 raise at the lower end on operational EPS and the $0.05 on the high end, is $0.05 due to the accounting change and the rest due to the underlying strength in the business? And then it appears there's a lot of moving parts on the sales guidance as well. That 5.5% in 2015 that you raised to 6% for 2016, by my math, it implies that you're expecting similar growth in the second half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2016.

Well, with respect to EPS guidance, you mentioned 2 of the items, which obviously was tax as well as the stronger sales performance. But I just wanted to remind you that we also lowered our other income and expense guidance for the year. So one way to think about it is that other income and expense guidance is slower. The tax rate is also lower. Those 2 generally offset. And the midpoint of the guidance is up about $0.07, when I do the midpoint versus the 2 ends. And the $0.07 is primarily due to the overall increase in sales guidance that we provided today. Your observations with respect to the back half of the year, you're right. That if we exclude the extra shipping days in 2015 from the analysis, the back half of 2016 would be similar to what we saw for the first half."

But look, we were really happy that we were able to add Vogue to J&J Consumer portfolio. As we've been talking about over the last several years, we felt that what was most important to the Consumer group was to actually ensure that we were able to get through the early stages of the remediation in a really high-quality and effective way. And I think the team has done a great job at making it a little bit more broadly across an entire Consumer group. I think we see that in the core trends. And of course, once we establish that, we continue to see Consumer as a great growth opportunity for the organization going forward. And as Jorge and -- as you saw when we did the Medical Device and Consumer Investor Relations review now about a little over a month ago, I think they've got a really ambitious but also realistic plan for that, built on our existing brands. And we were really pleased to see performance. For example, LISTERINE, up 7%; OTC's up 6%; analgesics within OTCs were up over 13%. And then in beauty, you saw about a 9% lift with really strong performance from NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. And when you take that and augment it, I think with thoughtful additions such as we saw over this last quarter, whether it was NeoStrata, whether it was HIPOGLÓS or with Vogue, we think that those are great additions to our existing portfolio. And we'll likely be part of a continuous stream of additions to that part of the portfolio. And as we said for some time, whenever we're looking at inorganic growth opportunities, we look at tuck-ins, we look at midsized deals, we'll look at large deals. Of course, the tuck-in strategy, particularly in pharma -- or actually, in all of our segments, Medical Device and Consumer, are those that -- where we feel that we can create the most value. But we do think that there's other opportunities to create value as well, and again, in mid- and larger deals. But we're going to be very disciplined. We're going to be very decisive about how we do it. And ultimately, try to better serve patients and consumers."

And by the way, we're pleased with the progress that we've seen in our Medical Device group over the last quarter as well. I mean, if we look at the restructuring, I think, overall, that team's on track. They're doing actions that strengthen their go-to-market model, to accelerate their pace of innovation. They're prioritizing some additional platforms and geographies, and all while streamlining some operations but really keeping very high-quality standards. We think they're on track with the plan that they articulated earlier in the year.

Thank you very much for the question. Over the past 3 or 4 years, I think we've been pretty consistent in our thinking and in our projections about likely increasing consolidation among providers and hospitals, particular here in the United States and just broader health care systems. And as systems feel continuing pricing pressure, we think that will manifest itself by them having consolidation. I think we've seen those trends. And I think they're clearly starting an effort to try and be as effective and as efficient as possible. So we do believe that, that will be a longer secular trend that's going to continue. That's why we believe having a diverse and enough critical mass in our medical device portfolio is so important going forward. We see it in the way that expectations are changing among decision-makers, including not only surgeons, but also people in procurement and other C suite executives, administrators and hospital systems. And we think as a result of that, we'll be very well positioned, particularly when you think about our surgical franchise, our Orthopaedics franchise. We've also been consistent in saying that we're extremely pleased with the performance of our cardiovascular unit, particularly our EP group, Biosense Webster. I mean, once again, this quarter, they've delivered over 18.5% growth with great innovation and great execution. But we also realized that, that's an area where we'll continue to look for the right kind of additions, organically and inorganically, to ensure that we're properly positioned going forward."

Look, as we look at the landscape going forward, we fully predict that generics and biosimilars are going to be part of the competitive landscape. And look, we think that, that is essential for the health care system. We think, in the long run, it's actually a benefit for very innovative-focused companies because that's the only way you can relieve pressure over the long term. Of course, that's predicated upon the market and companies respecting intellectual property. It's very important to produce the right scientific information so that we're guaranteeing patient safety and understanding the important clinical differences between some of these compounds as they may or may not manifest themselves. And so we projected them. As we look at our strategic plan, we think they will be there. But we also feel that, that's why it's so important to keep innovating with new product launches going forward. And it's also critical to establish a strong critical mass in terms of products, but also expertise in clinical data and information in certain platforms. And so for us, in the Immunology platform, we're very proud of the extensive track record that REMICADE, the TNF-alpha compound has had and what it continues to do. We'll continue to defend our intellectual property around it. But at the same time, if you look at compounds like STELARA and SIMPONI, not only have they both generated an excess of 30% growth this quarter, but we've also produced additional data that we think is going to be very important to patients and physicians in how they adopt these products. And these are already multibillion dollar platforms for Janssen and Johnson & Johnson. And then when you compound that with sirukumab and guselkumab, again an IL-6 and IL-23 approach where we know there's a lot of patient variability, we think that's important. Also, as we look at REMICADE itself, we know that there's about 2.4 million patients who've been treated with the compound. We know that about 70% of them in fact are getting good relief and good effects. We know that they're unlikely to be switched when they're getting a positive response from their therapy. And we also know that when we contract across the Janssen and Johnson & Johnson portfolio, that it provides us a very important position with larger health care systems and networks. So that's the way we think about it, and that's the way we plan for it going forward."

In the selling, market and administrative line, that's where you see the benefits of the program you were referring to, where we anticipate about $1 billion of savings for 2018. That program's on track. We're seeing the savings. We're also making some investments. As the investments tail off, the savings will be more significant and more impactful in that line item going forward. So we're beginning to see the savings now. They're somewhat partially offset by some investments we need to make to continue the program. But in the future, those investments tail off and the savings ramp up, and there -- have more of an impact. And then also, as you mentioned, the Medical Device restructuring is a whole another area that's unrelated to the 2 that I just mentioned earlier and that we expect to see continued improvements there, although that's a business where we want also to accelerate the pace of innovation with those savings. So some of those will be reinvested in the business. So it's across those 3 areas, and we're committed to the operating margin improvement that I've mentioned earlier of greater than 200 basis points.

We -- as you know, we're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. And although we're actively involved in considering them, valuations come into play. And willingness of the other party to do an acquisition have certain valuations come into play. So that's regardless of how much money we have available to spend, right? So we don't really look at that as the main driver of how we're going to do acquisitions. We look at what value we're going to create for shareholders by doing the acquisition at the right value so we can improve returns for our shareholders. There are some expectations that are still not, in our opinion, normalized for appropriate valuations in the market, so that's a factor. And that will take time, and we're patient with that. And then we'll take -- we'll see how the market evolves over time or as we learn more about the acquisition candidates and their progress in various areas. And then finally, whether or not the cash is trapped overseas or not, is not at all an impediment to our ability to do any acquisitions. We'll either obviously try to find a way to do it in the tax efficient basis as we've done with other acquisitions and utilize that cash as much is possible, only if it's tax efficient. But then, obviously, we can continue to borrow, and we have ability to borrow to do the acquisitions that we think are value-creating for our shareholders. So we wouldn't let that hold us back, should the acquisition beat value-creating. We'd exercise what -- we'd exercise our ability to borrow to do that acquisition."

So U.S., how does it occur and what's going on with list price versus net price and those sorts of things. So just to put it in perspective, this is not unusual in our industry, as you know. Everyone in the pharmaceutical industry is estimating what the rebates might be. And then, of course, we'll actualize them was actual data is submitted. Recently, that actual data has been more timely. And in that more timely data from the payers, we're able to see trends -- so we're able to not only actualize prior period amounts, but we're also able to estimate better what the ultimate gross to net variation will be going forward. With respect to list price net of rebates, as you probably know, we said this before, we think we price our products responsibly and our overall list price increases have been relatively below -- substantially below the average industry. But in the end, the net price that's achieved is far from the gross price increase that happened. So rebates continue to be an increasing part of the business, and the overall realization of gross price to net price -- that delta is expanding, I would, say over time. And therefore, as I said, now, we're much more current with our ability to predict these estimates, and that's what's going on.

And also it's -- I guess, it's been about a year now since you now have a partner on that product with Pharmacyclics being acquired by AbbVie. Just the dynamics in that partnership and how you see that related to what you're seeing previously with Pharmacyclics."

I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2016. Joining me the on the call today is Alex Gorsky",2027,"Good morning, and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2016. 
Joining me the on the call today is Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the second quarter for the corporation and for our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2016 results to date and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Next, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and update guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. 
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to evaluating business performance period-over-period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Also, to assist you with your models, this slide provide you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. 
Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion, up 3.9% versus second quarter 2015. 
On an operational basis, sales were up 5.3% and currency had a negative impact of 1.4%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 3.1% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.7%. 
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 15.4% with approximately 1/3 of the growth due to an inventory build that will reverse in the third quarter. Asia Pacific, Africa grew 2.1%, while Europe declined 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures, the most significant one being Cordis. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 7.9% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 6.9% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 30 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4 billion and earnings per share were $1.43 versus $1.61 a year ago. As a reference in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $238 million and charges for after-tax special items of $631 million. 
2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $230 million and charges for after-tax special items of $66 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.74, representing increases of 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share also grew 1.8%. 
Now turning to the highlights for the first 6 months of 2016. Consolidated sales to customers were $36 billion, an increase of 2.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, sales grew 4.6% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 2.3%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 7.4% worldwide, 9.3% in the U.S. and 5.4% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S., operational growth by 50 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings for the first 6 months of 2016. Net earnings were $8.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $3.02. Adjusted net earnings were $9.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $3.47, up 5.3% and 6.1%, respectively, versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 7.3%. 
Turning now to business segment highlights for the second quarter of 2016. Please note, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translation impact. 
I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 1.5%, with U.S. sales up 2.1% while outside the U.S. sales were up 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, 6.8% in the U.S. and 2% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 120 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to Women's Health, Baby Care and Oral Care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by Skin Care, OTC and Oral Care. 
In Skin Care, market share increases in a growing market as well as timing of inventory builds drove double-digit growth for both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. 
OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak allergy season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic and digestive health share growth. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 47%, up from nearly 44% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of anti-smoking aids, children's analgesics and digestive health products. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.7 billion increased 9.7%, with U.S. sales up 13.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.9%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. 
Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide, U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.8%, 13.9% and 11.2%, respectively. 
As you know, there were discounts and rebates in the pharmaceutical industry that are reflected in net sales. These amounts are estimated until the related claims data is received and then they are actualized. We have adjusted our estimates to reflect the most current claims trends. 
U.S. Pharmaceutical results this quarter included a positive adjustment to sales reserves across many channels, which was approximately $140 million higher than the adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 and positively impacted second quarter 2016 worldwide growth by approximately 1.5 points and U.S. growth by approximately 2.5 points. 
On a product basis, REMICADE U.S. growth in the second quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 8 points, STELARA by 11 points, SIMPONI by 13 points, ZYTIGA by 8 points and PROCRIT by 31 points. 
Significant contributors to growth were immunology products, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA; oncology products, IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX; as well as cardiovascular and metabolic products, XARELTO and INVOKANA. 
Within Neuroscience, strong growth for INVEGA SUSTENNA/TRINZA was partially offset by lower sales of INVEGA due to the impact of generic competition. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, share growth for STELARA and SIMPONI ARIA as well as the gross-to-net adjustments to U.S. sales that I mentioned. 
The decline in REMICADE export sales to our distribution partners was due to the impact of biosimilars. 
Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 70 countries. 
DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake with strong underlying demand. DARZALEX contributed approximately 2 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. DARZALEX received European Commission conditional approval this quarter and was launched in certain European countries. 
XARELTO sales were up 25.8% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to nearly 17%, up 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was over 14% and in cardiology, over 23%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up 21% on a worldwide basis and 15.2% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was 6.3%, up from 6% in the second quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was approximately 11.5% and over 5.5% in primary care. INVOKANA access remains strong at nearly 70% preferred for commercial and over 90% for Medicare Part D. 
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 1.8%. U.S. sales increased 1% while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%. As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, with U.S. up 1.9% and growth of 5.8% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. Growth was driven by advanced surgery, electrophysiology, orthopedics and Vision Care. 
Strong results were achieved for advanced surgery products with endocutters growth of 13%, energy growth of 9% and biosurgicals growth of 8%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical also contributed to growth this quarter. 
Electrophysiology grew 18% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. 
Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by U.S. trauma and worldwide hips and knees. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. 
The success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platforms in hips and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to the results.
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were -- negatively impacted results in China due to continued reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine/other were the categories most impacted. 
In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. 
Vision Care sales were driven by strong growth across the major regions, partially offset in the U.S. by a customer reward program. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2016. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?"
139677,367223456,1008028,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us on the conference call or webcast today. As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016, an",2214,"Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us on the conference call or webcast today. 
As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016, and we're pleased that our shareholders are seeing above-average returns on their investment in Johnson & Johnson. 
Delivering a fair return to shareholders is the final line of our credo, which clearly defines our first responsibilities, the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and fathers and all others who use our products. When we meet those responsibilities and when we continuously work to improve outcomes for patients around the world, we succeed with all of our stakeholders. 
Now over the last 130 years, the people of Johnson & Johnson have been helping people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives. With that remarkable heritage, I'm excited and optimistic about the opportunities for the future of Johnson & Johnson and committed to continuing our long-term success. With our broad base of strong businesses, focused strategies and comprehensive approach to innovation, we're well prepared to address the challenges of today's health care market and well positioned to lead in the movement towards healthier societies. 
As I've discussed before, we believe our broad base in human health care is vital to achieving that vision. Our broad base is a strategic choice based on performance, and it has helped us to deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance through various economic cycles, meeting our financial commitments in the midst of global events like the U.K.'s vote to exit from the EU or the economic issues in Venezuela this year. Our broad base enables us to create and access growth opportunities wherever they may arise at the right time and in the right markets. 
Our deep health care expertise also makes Johnson & Johnson companies strategic partners of choice for many companies, whether that means with innovative start-ups, information technology giants or large hospital systems looking to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. 
We also work with local governments and public health organizations where we're collaborating more than ever to address the world's most pressing health challenges. Our broad base allows us to create product platforms and systems that cross categories and establish new sources of innovation to converge in combination products. And finally, our broad base is helping us to realize advantages of scale to achieve enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our segments. 
All of these advantages of our broad base in human health care contribute to the long-term value we are able to create for our shareholders, and we continue to have a clear set of objectives for creating that long-term value. We expect global health care to grow at 3% to 5% over the next 5 years, and we have an objective to grow our sales organically at a faster rate than the market. 
We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. When we combine these objectives with our plans that continue creating value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships as well as our strong dividend yield, we believe the result to be a basis for compelling, long-term total shareholder returns. And that is our focus. We invest for the long-term success of our business. In fact, we have increased our spending on R&D every year for the last 5 years. We invest above industry average levels to build our robust pipelines and continue to nurture the investments we've already made. 
We also invest in innovative sales and marketing initiatives and consistently benchmark to ensure the return on our investments is as competitive and as efficient as possible. 
I'm proud that we are able to make these important investments in our business, while also generating enterprise adjusted net income margins that have increased in our above-industry benchmarks. 
After we've made the appropriate investments in our business, we look to capitalize on the right opportunities to create greater long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation framework starts with paying dividends to our shareholders, which is why we have increased our dividend every year for the last 54 years. Next, we seek value-creating strategic acquisitions and partnership opportunities. And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as repurchase programs. 
In fact, over the last 3-, 10- and 20-year periods, Johnson & Johnson total shareholder return has exceeded our competitive composite. And as you can see in this chart, we're off to a very strong start in 2016 with total shareholder return of approximately 20% through the first half of the year. 
And while we manage our business for the long term, we also have a number of near-term priorities, which I've shared with you before. As an enterprise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. Through the first 6 months, we generated sales of $36 billion, resulting in an operational growth of 4.6%. When you exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C sales and operations in Venezuela, underlying growth was 7.9%. 
Through the first half of this year, we have delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.47. On an operational basis, adjusted EPS was $3.51, representing growth of 7.3%. 
In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver very strong results. On the same underlying basis, growth was 12.7% through the first half of 2016, and we are continuing to build momentum in our Consumer and Medical Device businesses with first half underlying growth of 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively. 
We also continue making progress with our quality system, including resolving a warning letter in our ASP business and completion of the Synthes corporate integrity agreement. 
In Pharmaceuticals, we're continuing to build on our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In the last several months, we have made significant advancements in our pipeline, including conditional EU approval for DARZALEX for monotherapy of adults with relapse and refractory multiple myeloma and presented positive Phase III data on the CASTOR and POLLUX studies, which are evaluating combination therapies for DARZALEX. 
We also received the EU approval for frontline IMBRUVICA treatment in CLL as well as FDA expansion of the IMBRUVICA label to include new Phase III data on survival and in combination therapies. 
Phase III data on STELARA demonstrated maintained clinical remission after 1 year of treatment in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. 
Clinical trial and real-world data was presented on INVOKANA, including Phase II data on type 1 diabetes and chronic weight management. 
We received EU approval for TREVICTA, a once every 3 months injection for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, as well as line extension approval for both INVOKAMET and SIMPONI. 
Positive Phase III data was presented on sirukumab for patients with moderately to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. 
And just recently, FDA granted the fourth Breakthrough Therapy designation for IMBRUVICA in graft versus host disease, GDHD, which makes 6 total breakthrough designations for our Pharmaceutical business so far. 
In addition to these pipeline milestones, as Louise pointed out, we also delivered strong growth with our in-market products, including IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, XARELTO, STELARA and SIMPONI. 
In Consumer, our priority is expanding market leadership in key segments within OTC, Oral Care, Baby and beauty. 
As part of our focus on the beauty space, we had just completed the strategic acquisition of Vogue International. The award-winning beauty products in this portfolio, including the OGX brand, enhance our existing position in the market and are highly complementary to our heritage of breakthrough innovations in this space. 
Vogue International has grown at double digits over the last 5 years with a compound annual growth rate of about 25%, and the acquisition will take us from #8 to #4 in the U.S. hair care market. 
And as we discussed in May at our Analyst Day, we're continuing to see operating margin improvement in our consumer business and plan to continue that trend for the next several years. 
And in Medical Devices, we're focused on accelerating growth through innovation and transforming our go-to-market models. In this segment, we're gaining momentum and accelerating growth through our unique and broad-based approach to innovation. Our performance this quarter was roughly in line with market growth. And we're pleased with the progress here, but far from satisfied. Our goal, to be clear, is to grow above market overall. 
And while we're making strategic decisions in our portfolio to achieve that growth like the recent acquisition of BioMedical Enterprises, Inc., which filled a key portfolio gap in elective foot and ankle surgery, we're also realigning our commercial models in line with our near-term priority. Our innovation model in Hospital Medical Devices includes innovating our product offerings, but it also looks at innovation in terms of our commercial offerings and contracting. 
As we outlined during our business review day, today, about 25% of our U.S. orthopedic and surgery business is in multiproduct line agreements. These agreements perform almost 2x better than single-product contract agreements. We see this percentage growing to 40% in the near future, which we believe will help us accelerate our business going forward. 
And finally, we're also serving customers in a more end-to-end manner with risk-sharing contracts and outcome-based patient solutions. 
We're also on track to deliver approximately $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings from our Medical Device restructuring, the majority of which we expect will be realized by the end of 2018. 
And also, we continue to make progress in launching new competitive entries in our Consumer Medical Device businesses like the ACUVUE VITA, a 30-day daily-wear contact lens that provides superior comfort over leading monthly brands. 
With all this progress in our Medical Devices segment, we are confident that we are poised to deliver above-market growth. Altogether, these near-term priorities will help drive success for each of our business segments, while also enabling us to achieve the growth we expect for our company in the long term. With the progress we made on our near-term priorities, our businesses are strong, positioning us for above-market growth. With the combined strength of our in-market portfolio, deep late-stage pipeline and robust early-stage pipeline, we feel confident our Pharmaceutical business can successfully navigate through the launches of new competitive, biosimilar or generic entrants and evolving market dynamics. And our objective is to continue delivering above-industry growth. Our Consumer business is positioned to grow above market, while also achieving benchmark profitability and investing for the future. 
And in Hospital Medical Devices, we are poised to grow above the market, driven by our innovative pipelines, expanding global presence and novel commercial models. 
Our Consumer Medical Device businesses are holding leading positions and seeking opportunities to expand in large growing markets with significant unmet needs. With the strength of each of our business segments, we feel optimistic about the future opportunities in health care, and we are confident our long-term strategies have positioned us for continued growth. Our holistic approach to innovation, going beyond products and solutions, will allow us to address the evolving health care landscape, driving better outcomes and delivering long-term value. We have the right internal capabilities and are developing strategic partnerships in health tech to reshape the way health care is delivered, managed and experienced. 
And finally, our broad base across human health care uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader and partner of choice in the health care market. 
But perhaps most importantly of all, our continued strong performance means we are able to create better products, more valuable services and improved outcomes for patients, consumers and their families. 
So I'd like to thank you. I look forward to further dialogue during the Q&A session. But first, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Louise Mehrotra, who, as most of you know from our announcement last month, has decided to retire after more than 35 years with Johnson & Johnson and more than 10 years as Vice President of Investor Relations. 
I know many of you on the call today have gotten to know Louise pretty well over the last several years, a real testament to the strong relationships she's built in the investment community on behalf of Johnson & Johnson. And you may know that she's an incredibly committed credo-based leader and had a remarkable career and impact on our company. I think I can speak for all of us at Johnson & Johnson in saying that we will miss her trusted, experienced, respected advice and her ever-present determination to do what's in the best interest of all of our credo stakeholders. 
Louise, we're so proud of the best-in-class Investor Relations function you've developed for us over the last decade, and we sincerely thank you for your many years of service and dedication to Johnson & Johnson. 
Now we know we'll all be in good hands with Joe Wolk, previously Vice President of Group Finance for our Pharmaceuticals Group, will become Vice President Investor Relations effective August 1 and transition with Louise over the next 5 months. We are confident that Joe will continue Louise's legacy of transparent and credible communication with you, our investors. 
So now, I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso, who will talk more about our results and expectations for the second half of 2016. Dominic?"
139677,367223456,1008028,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for her valued support and friendship during my time as Chie",2639,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for her valued support and friendship during my time as Chief Financial Officer. 
Over the last 10 years, Louise and the entire IR team has transformed our Investor Relations function, significantly developing our reputation with the investment community, which has been recognized with several awards and recognitions, including those from Institutional Investor and IR Magazine. And through surveys of money managers conducted by Barron's Magazine, Johnson & Johnson has been ranked at/or near the top of the most respected companies list for 10 of the last 12 years. In fact, I'm also pleased to report that Johnson & Johnson was recognized this year by Barron's Magazine as the #1 most respected company for 2016.
As Alex noted, Louise's outstanding leadership and dedication to advancing our reputation will continue with her successor, Joe Wolk, who we're happy to have joining us on our call next quarter. We all wish Louise well, and we are certainly going to miss her. 
With that, I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're very pleased with our second quarter results as we continue to see improved performance across the enterprise. And as Alex said, we remain confident in the strength of our business. 
As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days in 2015, was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continue to deliver strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7.9% for the second quarter, and our sales results are above analyst estimates. Our second quarter earnings were also above analyst estimates, driven by strong sales performance and operating margin improvement. 
As you may remember, for 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase in pretax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We were pleased to see progress towards this improvement during the second quarter, which I will discuss later. And we remain comfortable with that forecast as we continue to accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. 
Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. 
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 5.3%. And excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hepatitis C sales and also the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year, it was strong at more than 8%. 
If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization, expense and special items. 
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items on approximately $900 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: intangible asset amortization expense of about $200 million, litigation charges from ongoing legal matters of about $500 million and additional charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore, $1.74, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 1.8% versus the prior year, and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same, as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold decreased by 120 basis points, mostly due to favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by transactional currency. 
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 28% of sales or 230 basis points lower as compared to the second quarter 2015 due to good cost management. 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2% and higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines. 
Our pretax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32.5% or 320 basis points higher than the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative and R&D expenses. 
As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progress throughout the year. And through 6 months, we have achieved a 180 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability. 
Interest expense, net of interest income, was slightly lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments. Other income and expense was a net expense of approximately $600 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of approximately $900 million in the same period last year. 
Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $100 million compared to a net gain of approximately $1 billion in the prior year period. The significant decrease is due to the divestiture of NUCYNTA in the prior year period. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 23% in the same period last year. This year's effective tax rate reflects the R&D credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, the current mix of our business and the impact of new accounting standards related to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which I will discuss further in a moment. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2016, our adjusted income-before-tax margin for the enterprise declined by 250 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. 
During the second quarter of 2015, as I mentioned earlier, we recorded a gain from the divestiture of NUCYNTA. And this gain, which, as you know from our discussions last year, was invested in various parts of the business, but those investments occurred later in the year. 
If the NUCYNTA divestiture gain is excluded, year-on-year adjusted income-before-tax margin would show an improvement of approximately 300 basis points. We're very pleased to see a significant improvement in our Consumer business adjusted income tax margin this quarter. As you may recall from our business review day in May, we said that we are focused on improving our margins in the Consumer business to benchmark levels. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income-before-tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Overall, we expect income-before-tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in the pretax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $16 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $42 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $26 billion of debt. As you know, in May, we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates, with the European debt issuance equivalent to $4.5 billion. 
Through the end of the second quarter, we have completed nearly 50% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we continue to expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. 
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $400 million and $500 million. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance. 
Regarding other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation investments, prior development corporation divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the timing of underlying activity. This impact will be offset by the strength of our business, primarily due to our outlook for a higher level of sales as noted in the increased sales guidance in our press release today. 
And now just a word on taxes. During the second quarter, the company elected for early adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based compensation. With this update, increased tax benefits are recognized in earnings on the employee exercises options or received shares. Previously, these tax benefits were recorded in equity. 
The first quarter impact was approximately $165 million or $0.05 per share and is reflected in the year-to-date results and not in the second quarter, when we adopted the standard. The second quarter impact is offset by additional tax costs reflected in this quarter. 
Per adoption guidance, the first quarter does not need to be reissued. However, all future comparisons for the first quarter should reflect the recasted numbers. We have included a supplementary schedule on our website that includes the updated first quarter impact for the P&L. 
You will note that the first quarter recast number reflects a tax rate of 15.8%. The company issued shares related to employee stock compensation such as restricted stock awards or performance share units in the first quarter. Therefore, historically, a significant portion of the annual tax benefit is recognized in the first quarter. The tax benefit for stock options is recognized throughout the year as employees exercise their options, but timing is less predictable for stock options. 
We are comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 18.5% to 19%, lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the accounting for share-based compensation tax benefits that I just described. 
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrants for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S., and our assumption remains unchanged with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra. 
We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As Alex mentioned, we have now closed the acquisition of Vogue International. So our guidance now reflects 6 months of additional sales. This is a fast-growing business and will contribute to the profitability of our Consumer business beginning the first full year, as well as be accretive to our adjusted EPS beginning in the first full year. 
Also, during the second quarter, we closed on our divestiture for the controlled substance raw material and API business and therefore, those sales were no longer be recorded. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this does provide a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
As noted in our press release, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for 2016, primarily reflecting the strong results from the first half as well as 6 additional months of sales from the Vogue acquisition, partially offset by the divestiture of our controlled substance raw material and API business. We would, therefore, be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion and higher than our previous guidance. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we describe our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C sales, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we've mentioned earlier. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 1% on sales. This is consistent with our previous guidance as other major currencies strengthened since our last update. We are watching the euro and other currencies closely as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year. Of course, we're closely following the situation with the U.K.'s vote to exit from the EU. We expect this will take time to fully determine what the impact will be, if any. 
To put it into perspective though, the U.K. represents about 3% of our total sales. So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion and higher than our previous guidance. 
And now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by about 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of between $6.66 to $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational constant currency growth rate of 7.4% to 9%. This is a narrower range as well as higher than our previous guidance and includes the first quarter impact from the tax accounting change we discussed earlier. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, and this is consistent with our guidance in April. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.63 to $6.73 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due both to the continued strength of the business and a lower tax rate. And at this point in the year, we will be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the first 6 months of this year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6% or higher than we saw in 2015 on a comparable basis. 
Our adjusted pretax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
Our adjusted operational EPS growth in our guidance improved and remains strong in the range of $6.66 to $6.76 a share, that's a growth rate of between 7% and 9%. Our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations. 
And now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call. Louise?"

Well, with respect to the early adoption, I mentioned earlier that the first quarter impact was $0.05, and that's the most significant impact we expect for the year because that's where the majority of stock-based compensation is issued to employees. The second quarter impact was lower than that, but was almost entirely offset by other tax items. And the rest of the year will depend on when employees exercise stock options, so very difficult to predict. So for now, we've included in our effective tax rate for the year only the first quarter impact, which after we adopt it in the second quarter, we're letting the first quarter impact flow through for the remainder of the year.
Second quarter impacts already been offset by other items, and remaining quarterly impacts, we think, will either likely be offset by other items or very difficult to predict because it's timing of when employees exercise options."

I think hospital admissions are up around 3%. We think the procedures are probably up around 3.5%. We continue to see some decrease, overall, in office physician visits, down a couple of percent. We think that that's due to a more moderated utilization at the front-end due to increased co-pays and a number of other dynamics. But overall, if we look at the core growth rate in the medical hospital device area, we're encouraged by some of the recent trends that we're seeing."

But look, we were really happy that we were able to add Vogue to the J&J Consumer portfolio. As we've been talking about over the last several years, we felt that what was most important to the Consumer group was to actually ensure that we were able to get through the early stages of the remediation in a really high-quality and effective way. And I think the team has done a great job at making it [ph] a little bit more broadly across that entire Consumer group. I think we see that in the core trends. And of course, once we establish that, we continue to see Consumer as a great growth opportunity for the organization going forward. And as Jorge and as you saw when we did the Medical Device and Consumer Investor Relations review, now about a little over a month ago, I think they've got a really ambitious but also realistic plan for that, built on our existing brands. And we were really pleased to see performance. For example, LISTERINE, up 7%; OTC's up 6%; analgesics within OTCs were up over 13%. And then in beauty, you saw about a 9% lift with really strong performance from NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. And when you take that and augment it, I think, with thoughtful additions such as we saw over this last quarter, whether it was NeoStrata, whether it was HIPOGLÓS or with Vogue, we think that those are great additions to our existing portfolio, and will likely be part of a continuous stream of additions to that part of the portfolio. And as we said for some time, whenever we're looking at inorganic growth opportunities, we look at tuck-ins, we look at midsized deals, we'll look at large deals. Of course, the tuck-in strategy, particularly in pharma -- or actually, in all of our segments, Medical Device and Consumer, are those that -- where we feel that we can create the most value. But we do think that there's other opportunities to create value as well, and again, in mid- and larger deals. But we're going to be very disciplined. We're going to be very decisive about how we do it. And ultimately, try to better serve patients and consumers."

I mean, if we look at the restructuring, I think, overall, that team's on track. They're doing actions that strengthen their go-to-market model, to accelerate their pace of innovation. They're prioritizing some additional platforms and geographies, and all while streamlining some operations but really keeping very high-quality standards. We think they're on track with the plan that they articulated earlier in the year.

Thank you very much for the question. Over the past 3 or 4 years, I think we've been pretty consistent in our thinking and in our projections about likely increasing consolidation among providers and hospitals, particularly here in the United States and just broader health care systems. And as systems feel continuing pricing pressure, we think that will manifest itself by them having consolidation. I think we've seen those trends. And I think they're clearly starting an effort to try and be as effective and as efficient as possible. So we do believe that, that will be a longer secular trend that's going to continue. That's why we believe having a diverse and enough critical mass in our Medical Device portfolio is so important going forward. We see it in the way that expectations are changing among decision-makers, including not only surgeons, but also people in procurement and other C suite executives, administrators and hospital systems. And we think as a result of that, we'll be very well positioned, particularly when you think about our surgical franchise, our Orthopaedics franchise. We've also been consistent in saying that we're extremely pleased with the performance of our cardiovascular unit, particularly our EP group, Biosense Webster. I mean, once again, this quarter, they've delivered over 18.5% growth with great innovation and great execution. But we also realize that that's an area where we'll continue to look for the right kind of additions, organically and inorganically, to ensure that we're properly positioned going forward."

Look, as we look at the landscape going forward, we fully predict that generics and biosimilars are going to be part of the competitive landscape. And look, we think that, that is essential for the health care system. We think, in the long run, it's actually a benefit for very innovative-focused companies because that's the only way you can relieve pressure over the long term. Of course, that's predicated upon the market and companies respecting intellectual property. It's very important to produce the right scientific information so that we're guaranteeing patient safety and understanding the important clinical differences between some of these compounds as they may or may not manifest themselves. And so we projected them. As we look at our strategic plan, we think they will be there. But we also feel that that's why it's so important to keep innovating with new product launches going forward. And it's also critical to establish a strong critical mass in terms of products, but also expertise in clinical data and information in certain platforms. And so for us, in the Immunology platform, we're very proud of the extensive track record that REMICADE, the TNF-alpha compound has had and what it continues to do. We'll continue to defend our intellectual property around it. But at the same time, if you look at compounds like STELARA and SIMPONI, not only have they both generated in excess of 30% growth this quarter, but we've also produced additional data that we think is going to be very important to patients and physicians in how they adopt these products. And these are already multibillion-dollar platforms for Janssen and Johnson & Johnson. And then when you compound that with sirukumab and guselkumab, again an IL-6 and IL-23 approach where we know there's a lot of patient variability, we think that's important. Also, as we look at REMICADE itself, we know that there's about 2.4 million patients who've been treated with the compound. We know that about 70% of them in fact are getting good relief and good effects. We know that they're unlikely to be switched when they're getting a positive response from their therapy. And we also know that when we contract across the Janssen and Johnson & Johnson portfolio, that it provides us a very important position with larger health care systems and networks. So that's the way we think about it, and that's the way we plan for it going forward."

So we continue to see good manufacturing efficiencies and cost improvements across the supply chain. That's a major initiative we've had ongoing for quite some time.

In the selling, market and administrative line, that's where you see the benefits of the program you were referring to, where we anticipate about $1 billion of savings for 2018. That program's on track. We're seeing the savings. We're also making some investments. As the investments tail off, the savings will be more significant and more impactful in that line item going forward. So we're beginning to see the savings now. They're somewhat partially offset by some investments we need to make to continue the program. But in the future, those investments tail off and the savings ramp up, and there -- have more of an impact. And then also, as you mentioned, the Medical Device restructuring is a whole another area that's unrelated to the 2 that I just mentioned earlier and that we expect to see continued improvements there, although that's a business where we want to also accelerate the pace of innovation with those savings. So some of those will be reinvested in the business. So it's across those 3 areas, and we're committed to the operating margin improvement that I've mentioned earlier of greater than 200 basis points. And halfway through the year, we feel very good about our ability to achieve that."

Well, consistent with what we said last time when you asked a very similar question, we -- as you know, we're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. And although we're actively involved in considering them, valuations come into play. And willingness of the other party to do an acquisition at certain valuations come into play. So that's regardless of how much money we have available to spend, right? So we don't really look at that as the main driver of how we're going to do acquisitions. We look at what value we're going to create for shareholders by doing the acquisition at the right value so we can improve returns for our shareholders. There are some expectations that are still not, in our opinion, normalized for appropriate valuations in the market, so that's a factor. And that will take time, and we're patient with that. And then we'll take -- we'll see how the market evolves over time or as we learn more about the acquisition candidates and their progress in various areas. And then finally, whether or not the cash is trapped overseas or not is not at all an impediment to our ability to do any acquisitions. We'll either obviously try to find a way to do it in a tax-efficient basis as we've done with other acquisitions and utilize that cash as much as possible, only if it's tax efficient. But then, obviously, we can continue to borrow, and we have the ability to borrow to do the acquisitions that we think are value-creating for our shareholders. So we wouldn't let that hold us back. Should the acquisition be value-creating, we'd exercise what -- we'd exercise our ability to borrow to do that acquisition."

And frankly, if you look at our pharmaceutical performance and whether it's the partnerships that we have on a compound like IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, others, I think the strategy has worked really well and it's something that we'll continue to pursue. I think we have a lot of examples of that in Medical Devices and also Consumer. And there's nothing that we would like more than to take a several hundred million-dollar platform like Vogue and create the next multibillion-dollar platform as we see in things like NEUTROGENA and others. So all that being said, if and when we see larger opportunities present an opportunity to really create longer-term shareholder value, those are things we'd certainly be interested in, but we'll be particularly thoughtful about those."

So U.S., how does it occur and what's going on with list price versus net price and those sorts of things. So just to put it in perspective, this is not unusual in our industry, as you know. Everyone in the pharmaceutical industry is estimating what the rebates might be. And then, of course, we'll actualize them once actual data is submitted. Recently, that actual data has been more timely. And in that more timely data from the payers, we're able to see trends, so we're able to not only actualize prior-period amounts, but we're also able to estimate better what the ultimate gross-to-net variation will be going forward. With respect to list price net of rebates, as you probably know, we said this before, we think we price our products responsibly and our overall list price increases have been relatively below -- substantially below the average industry. But in the end, the net price that's achieved is far from the gross price increase that happened. So rebates continue to be an increasing part of the business, and the overall realization of gross price to net price, that delta is expanding, I would, say over time. And therefore, as I said, now, we're much more current with our ability to predict these estimates, and that's what's going on.

I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2016. Joining me the on the call today is Alex Gorsky",2027,"Good morning, and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the second quarter of 2016. 
Joining me the on the call today is Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing the second quarter for the corporation and for our 3 business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2016 results to date and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Next, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and update guidance for 2016. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. 
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the company and on our website. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to evaluating business performance period-over-period. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Also, to assist you with your models, this slide provide you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. 
Now I would like to review our results for the second quarter of 2016. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion, up 3.9% versus second quarter 2015. 
On an operational basis, sales were up 5.3% and currency had a negative impact of 1.4%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 3.1% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.7%. 
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 15.4% with approximately 1/3 of the growth due to an inventory build that will reverse in the third quarter. Asia Pacific, Africa grew 2.1%, while Europe declined 0.6%. Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures, the most significant one being Cordis. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 7.9% worldwide, 8.8% in the U.S. and 6.9% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S. operational growth by 30 basis points and 70 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4 billion and earnings per share were $1.43 versus $1.61 a year ago. As a reference in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $238 million and charges for after-tax special items of $631 million. 
2015 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $230 million and charges for after-tax special items of $66 million. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.74, representing increases of 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share also grew 1.8%. 
Now turning to the highlights for the first 6 months of 2016. Consolidated sales to customers were $36 billion, an increase of 2.3% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, sales grew 4.6% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 2.3%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, underlying operational growth was approximately 7.4% worldwide, 9.3% in the U.S. and 5.4% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted worldwide and outside the U.S., operational growth by 50 basis points and 90 basis points, respectively. 
Turning now to earnings for the first 6 months of 2016. Net earnings were $8.5 billion and diluted earnings per share were $3.02. Adjusted net earnings were $9.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $3.47, up 5.3% and 6.1%, respectively, versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 7.3%. 
Turning now to business segment highlights for the second quarter of 2016. Please note, percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the second quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and therefore, exclude the currency translation impact. 
I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.4 billion increased 1.5%, with U.S. sales up 2.1% while outside the U.S. sales were up 1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, 6.8% in the U.S. and 2% outside the U.S. 
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 120 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to Women's Health, Baby Care and Oral Care. Growth for the segment was driven primarily by Skin Care, OTC and Oral Care. 
In Skin Care, market share increases in a growing market as well as timing of inventory builds drove double-digit growth for both NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. 
OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak allergy season. U.S. OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic and digestive health share growth. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 11% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 47%, up from nearly 44% a year ago. Major contributors to the growth outside the U.S. were the strong performance of anti-smoking aids, children's analgesics and digestive health products. New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.7 billion increased 9.7%, with U.S. sales up 13.2% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.9%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. 
Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter. Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide, U.S. and outside the U.S. was 12.8%, 13.9% and 11.2%, respectively. 
As you know, there were discounts and rebates in the pharmaceutical industry that are reflected in net sales. These amounts are estimated until the related claims data is received and then they are actualized. We have adjusted our estimates to reflect the most current claims trends. 
U.S. Pharmaceutical results this quarter included a positive adjustment to sales reserves across many channels, which was approximately $140 million higher than the adjustment in the second quarter of 2015 and positively impacted second quarter 2016 worldwide growth by approximately 1.5 points and U.S. growth by approximately 2.5 points. 
On a product basis, REMICADE U.S. growth in the second quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 8 points, STELARA by 11 points, SIMPONI by 13 points, ZYTIGA by 8 points and PROCRIT by 31 points. 
Significant contributors to growth were immunology products, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA; oncology products, IMBRUVICA and recently launched DARZALEX; as well as cardiovascular and metabolic products, XARELTO and INVOKANA. 
Within Neuroscience, strong growth for INVEGA SUSTENNA/TRINZA was partially offset by lower sales of INVEGA due to the impact of generic competition. The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, share growth for STELARA and SIMPONI ARIA as well as the gross-to-net adjustments to U.S. sales that I mentioned. 
The decline in REMICADE export sales to our distribution partners was due to the impact of biosimilars. 
Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. In the U.S., IMBRUVICA remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL. IMBRUVICA is now launched in more than 70 countries. 
DARZALEX was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake with strong underlying demand. DARZALEX contributed approximately 2 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. DARZALEX received European Commission conditional approval this quarter and was launched in certain European countries. 
XARELTO sales were up 25.8% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to nearly 17%, up 1.5 points from a year ago. TRx in primary care was over 14% and in cardiology, over 23%. XARELTO is broadly reimbursed with approximately 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were up 21% on a worldwide basis and 15.2% in the U.S. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was 6.3%, up from 6% in the second quarter of 2015. TRx with endocrinologists was approximately 11.5% and over 5.5% in primary care. INVOKANA access remains strong at nearly 70% preferred for commercial and over 90% for Medicare Part D. 
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.4 billion increased 1.8%. U.S. sales increased 1% while sales outside the U.S. increased 2.6%. As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3.9% worldwide, with U.S. up 1.9% and growth of 5.8% outside the U.S. In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. Growth was driven by advanced surgery, electrophysiology, orthopedics and Vision Care. 
Strong results were achieved for advanced surgery products with endocutters growth of 13%, energy growth of 9% and biosurgicals growth of 8%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical also contributed to growth this quarter. 
Electrophysiology grew 18% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters. 
Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by U.S. trauma and worldwide hips and knees. Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the U.S. Orthopaedics business. Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products. 
The success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platforms in hips and ORTHOVISC/MONOVISC and new spine product introductions made important contributions to the results.
Orthopaedics sales outside the U.S. were -- negatively impacted results in China due to continued reduction in inventory. Trauma and spine/other were the categories most impacted. 
In addition, timing of tender business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter. 
Vision Care sales were driven by strong growth across the major regions, partially offset in the U.S. by a customer reward program. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's second quarter of 2016. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?"
139677,367223456,1008198,"Johnson & Johnson, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us on the conference call or webcast today. As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016, an",2214,"Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone, and thank all of you for joining us on the conference call or webcast today. 
As you just heard from Louise, our second quarter results have continued the momentum that began with our great start to 2016, and we're pleased that our shareholders are seeing above-average returns on their investment in Johnson & Johnson. 
Delivering a fair return to shareholders is the final line of our credo, which clearly defines our first responsibilities, the doctors, nurses and patients, the mothers and fathers and all others who use our products. When we meet those responsibilities and when we continuously work to improve outcomes for patients around the world, we succeed with all of our stakeholders. 
Now over the last 130 years, the people of Johnson & Johnson have been helping people everywhere live longer, healthier and happier lives. With that remarkable heritage, I'm excited and optimistic about the opportunities for the future of Johnson & Johnson and committed to continuing our long-term success. With our broad base of strong businesses, focused strategies and comprehensive approach to innovation, we're well prepared to address the challenges of today's health care market and well positioned to lead in the movement towards healthier societies. 
As I've discussed before, we believe our broad base in human health care is vital to achieving that vision. Our broad base is a strategic choice based on performance, and it has helped us to deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance through various economic cycles, meeting our financial commitments in the midst of global events like the U.K.'s vote to exit from the EU or the economic issues in Venezuela this year. Our broad base enables us to create and access growth opportunities wherever they may arise at the right time and in the right markets. 
Our deep health care expertise also makes Johnson & Johnson companies strategic partners of choice for many companies, whether that means with innovative start-ups, information technology giants or large hospital systems looking to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care. 
We also work with local governments and public health organizations where we're collaborating more than ever to address the world's most pressing health challenges. Our broad base allows us to create product platforms and systems that cross categories and establish new sources of innovation to converge in combination products. And finally, our broad base is helping us to realize advantages of scale to achieve enterprise efficiencies and capabilities across all of our segments. 
All of these advantages of our broad base in human health care contribute to the long-term value we are able to create for our shareholders, and we continue to have a clear set of objectives for creating that long-term value. We expect global health care to grow at 3% to 5% over the next 5 years, and we have an objective to grow our sales organically at a faster rate than the market. 
We also intend to grow our earnings faster than sales. When we combine these objectives with our plans that continue creating value through strategic acquisitions and partnerships as well as our strong dividend yield, we believe the result to be a basis for compelling, long-term total shareholder returns. And that is our focus. We invest for the long-term success of our business. In fact, we have increased our spending on R&D every year for the last 5 years. We invest above industry average levels to build our robust pipelines and continue to nurture the investments we've already made. 
We also invest in innovative sales and marketing initiatives and consistently benchmark to ensure the return on our investments is as competitive and as efficient as possible. 
I'm proud that we are able to make these important investments in our business, while also generating enterprise adjusted net income margins that have increased in our above-industry benchmarks. 
After we've made the appropriate investments in our business, we look to capitalize on the right opportunities to create greater long-term value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation framework starts with paying dividends to our shareholders, which is why we have increased our dividend every year for the last 54 years. Next, we seek value-creating strategic acquisitions and partnership opportunities. And finally, we consider other prudent ways to return value to shareholders such as repurchase programs. 
In fact, over the last 3-, 10- and 20-year periods, Johnson & Johnson total shareholder return has exceeded our competitive composite. And as you can see in this chart, we're off to a very strong start in 2016 with total shareholder return of approximately 20% through the first half of the year. 
And while we manage our business for the long term, we also have a number of near-term priorities, which I've shared with you before. As an enterprise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments. Through the first 6 months, we generated sales of $36 billion, resulting in an operational growth of 4.6%. When you exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, hepatitis C sales and operations in Venezuela, underlying growth was 7.9%. 
Through the first half of this year, we have delivered adjusted net earnings of $9.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.47. On an operational basis, adjusted EPS was $3.51, representing growth of 7.3%. 
In our Pharmaceutical business, we continue to deliver very strong results. On the same underlying basis, growth was 12.7% through the first half of 2016, and we are continuing to build momentum in our Consumer and Medical Device businesses with first half underlying growth of 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively. 
We also continue making progress with our quality system, including resolving a warning letter in our ASP business and completion of the Synthes corporate integrity agreement. 
In Pharmaceuticals, we're continuing to build on our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In the last several months, we have made significant advancements in our pipeline, including conditional EU approval for DARZALEX for monotherapy of adults with relapse and refractory multiple myeloma and presented positive Phase III data on the CASTOR and POLLUX studies, which are evaluating combination therapies for DARZALEX. 
We also received the EU approval for frontline IMBRUVICA treatment in CLL as well as FDA expansion of the IMBRUVICA label to include new Phase III data on survival and in combination therapies. 
Phase III data on STELARA demonstrated maintained clinical remission after 1 year of treatment in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. 
Clinical trial and real-world data was presented on INVOKANA, including Phase II data on type 1 diabetes and chronic weight management. 
We received EU approval for TREVICTA, a once every 3 months injection for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, as well as line extension approval for both INVOKAMET and SIMPONI. 
Positive Phase III data was presented on sirukumab for patients with moderately to severe active rheumatoid arthritis. 
And just recently, FDA granted the fourth Breakthrough Therapy designation for IMBRUVICA in graft versus host disease, GDHD, which makes 6 total breakthrough designations for our Pharmaceutical business so far. 
In addition to these pipeline milestones, as Louise pointed out, we also delivered strong growth with our in-market products, including IMBRUVICA, DARZALEX, XARELTO, STELARA and SIMPONI. 
In Consumer, our priority is expanding market leadership in key segments within OTC, Oral Care, Baby and beauty. 
As part of our focus on the beauty space, we had just completed the strategic acquisition of Vogue International. The award-winning beauty products in this portfolio, including the OGX brand, enhance our existing position in the market and are highly complementary to our heritage of breakthrough innovations in this space. 
Vogue International has grown at double digits over the last 5 years with a compound annual growth rate of about 25%, and the acquisition will take us from #8 to #4 in the U.S. hair care market. 
And as we discussed in May at our Analyst Day, we're continuing to see operating margin improvement in our consumer business and plan to continue that trend for the next several years. 
And in Medical Devices, we're focused on accelerating growth through innovation and transforming our go-to-market models. In this segment, we're gaining momentum and accelerating growth through our unique and broad-based approach to innovation. Our performance this quarter was roughly in line with market growth. And we're pleased with the progress here, but far from satisfied. Our goal, to be clear, is to grow above market overall. 
And while we're making strategic decisions in our portfolio to achieve that growth like the recent acquisition of BioMedical Enterprises, Inc., which filled a key portfolio gap in elective foot and ankle surgery, we're also realigning our commercial models in line with our near-term priority. Our innovation model in Hospital Medical Devices includes innovating our product offerings, but it also looks at innovation in terms of our commercial offerings and contracting. 
As we outlined during our business review day, today, about 25% of our U.S. orthopedic and surgery business is in multiproduct line agreements. These agreements perform almost 2x better than single-product contract agreements. We see this percentage growing to 40% in the near future, which we believe will help us accelerate our business going forward. 
And finally, we're also serving customers in a more end-to-end manner with risk-sharing contracts and outcome-based patient solutions. 
We're also on track to deliver approximately $800 million to $1 billion in annual savings from our Medical Device restructuring, the majority of which we expect will be realized by the end of 2018. 
And also, we continue to make progress in launching new competitive entries in our Consumer Medical Device businesses like the ACUVUE VITA, a 30-day daily-wear contact lens that provides superior comfort over leading monthly brands. 
With all this progress in our Medical Devices segment, we are confident that we are poised to deliver above-market growth. Altogether, these near-term priorities will help drive success for each of our business segments, while also enabling us to achieve the growth we expect for our company in the long term. With the progress we made on our near-term priorities, our businesses are strong, positioning us for above-market growth. With the combined strength of our in-market portfolio, deep late-stage pipeline and robust early-stage pipeline, we feel confident our Pharmaceutical business can successfully navigate through the launches of new competitive, biosimilar or generic entrants and evolving market dynamics. And our objective is to continue delivering above-industry growth. Our Consumer business is positioned to grow above market, while also achieving benchmark profitability and investing for the future. 
And in Hospital Medical Devices, we are poised to grow above the market, driven by our innovative pipelines, expanding global presence and novel commercial models. 
Our Consumer Medical Device businesses are holding leading positions and seeking opportunities to expand in large growing markets with significant unmet needs. With the strength of each of our business segments, we feel optimistic about the future opportunities in health care, and we are confident our long-term strategies have positioned us for continued growth. Our holistic approach to innovation, going beyond products and solutions, will allow us to address the evolving health care landscape, driving better outcomes and delivering long-term value. We have the right internal capabilities and are developing strategic partnerships in health tech to reshape the way health care is delivered, managed and experienced. 
And finally, our broad base across human health care uniquely positions Johnson & Johnson as a leader and partner of choice in the health care market. 
But perhaps most importantly of all, our continued strong performance means we are able to create better products, more valuable services and improved outcomes for patients, consumers and their families. 
So I'd like to thank you. I look forward to further dialogue during the Q&A session. But first, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Louise Mehrotra, who, as most of you know from our announcement last month, has decided to retire after more than 35 years with Johnson & Johnson and more than 10 years as Vice President of Investor Relations. 
I know many of you on the call today have gotten to know Louise pretty well over the last several years, a real testament to the strong relationships she's built in the investment community on behalf of Johnson & Johnson. And you may know that she's an incredibly committed credo-based leader and had a remarkable career and impact on our company. I think I can speak for all of us at Johnson & Johnson in saying that we will miss her trusted, experienced, respected advice and her ever-present determination to do what's in the best interest of all of our credo stakeholders. 
Louise, we're so proud of the best-in-class Investor Relations function you've developed for us over the last decade, and we sincerely thank you for your many years of service and dedication to Johnson & Johnson. 
Now we know we'll all be in good hands with Joe Wolk, previously Vice President of Group Finance for our Pharmaceuticals Group, will become Vice President Investor Relations effective August 1 and transition with Louise over the next 5 months. We are confident that Joe will continue Louise's legacy of transparent and credible communication with you, our investors. 
So now, I'll turn it over to Dominic Caruso, who will talk more about our results and expectations for the second half of 2016. Dominic?"

Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for her valued support and friendship during my time as Chie",2639,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I'd like to echo Alex's sentiments and personally thank Louise for her significant contributions to Johnson & Johnson and for her valued support and friendship during my time as Chief Financial Officer. 
Over the last 10 years, Louise and the entire IR team has transformed our Investor Relations function, significantly developing our reputation with the investment community, which has been recognized with several awards and recognitions, including those from Institutional Investor and IR Magazine. And through surveys of money managers conducted by Barron's Magazine, Johnson & Johnson has been ranked at/or near the top of the most respected companies list for 10 of the last 12 years. In fact, I'm also pleased to report that Johnson & Johnson was recognized this year by Barron's Magazine as the #1 most respected company for 2016.
As Alex noted, Louise's outstanding leadership and dedication to advancing our reputation will continue with her successor, Joe Wolk, who we're happy to have joining us on our call next quarter. We all wish Louise well, and we are certainly going to miss her. 
With that, I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're very pleased with our second quarter results as we continue to see improved performance across the enterprise. And as Alex said, we remain confident in the strength of our business. 
As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days in 2015, was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continue to deliver strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7.9% for the second quarter, and our sales results are above analyst estimates. Our second quarter earnings were also above analyst estimates, driven by strong sales performance and operating margin improvement. 
As you may remember, for 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase in pretax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We were pleased to see progress towards this improvement during the second quarter, which I will discuss later. And we remain comfortable with that forecast as we continue to accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our Medical Device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year. 
Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016. 
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the second quarter of 2016. As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 5.3%. And excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, hepatitis C sales and also the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year, it was strong at more than 8%. 
If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization, expense and special items. 
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 second quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items on approximately $900 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the following: intangible asset amortization expense of about $200 million, litigation charges from ongoing legal matters of about $500 million and additional charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore, $1.74, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 1.8% versus the prior year, and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same, as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold decreased by 120 basis points, mostly due to favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by transactional currency. 
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 28% of sales or 230 basis points lower as compared to the second quarter 2015 due to good cost management. 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2% and higher than the prior year due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines. 
Our pretax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32.5% or 320 basis points higher than the second quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative and R&D expenses. 
As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progress throughout the year. And through 6 months, we have achieved a 180 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability. 
Interest expense, net of interest income, was slightly lower than last year due to slightly better rates on our investments. Other income and expense was a net expense of approximately $600 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of approximately $900 million in the same period last year. 
Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $100 million compared to a net gain of approximately $1 billion in the prior year period. The significant decrease is due to the divestiture of NUCYNTA in the prior year period. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 23% in the same period last year. This year's effective tax rate reflects the R&D credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, the current mix of our business and the impact of new accounting standards related to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which I will discuss further in a moment. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the second quarter of 2016, our adjusted income-before-tax margin for the enterprise declined by 250 basis points versus the second quarter of 2015. 
During the second quarter of 2015, as I mentioned earlier, we recorded a gain from the divestiture of NUCYNTA. And this gain, which, as you know from our discussions last year, was invested in various parts of the business, but those investments occurred later in the year. 
If the NUCYNTA divestiture gain is excluded, year-on-year adjusted income-before-tax margin would show an improvement of approximately 300 basis points. We're very pleased to see a significant improvement in our Consumer business adjusted income tax margin this quarter. As you may recall from our business review day in May, we said that we are focused on improving our margins in the Consumer business to benchmark levels. We are confident that our Consumer business will show an improved adjusted income-before-tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Overall, we expect income-before-tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in the pretax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $16 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $42 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $26 billion of debt. As you know, in May, we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates, with the European debt issuance equivalent to $4.5 billion. 
Through the end of the second quarter, we have completed nearly 50% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we continue to expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. 
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $400 million and $500 million. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance. 
Regarding other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation investments, prior development corporation divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain ranging from approximately $900 million to $1 billion, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the timing of underlying activity. This impact will be offset by the strength of our business, primarily due to our outlook for a higher level of sales as noted in the increased sales guidance in our press release today. 
And now just a word on taxes. During the second quarter, the company elected for early adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based compensation. With this update, increased tax benefits are recognized in earnings on the employee exercises options or received shares. Previously, these tax benefits were recorded in equity. 
The first quarter impact was approximately $165 million or $0.05 per share and is reflected in the year-to-date results and not in the second quarter, when we adopted the standard. The second quarter impact is offset by additional tax costs reflected in this quarter. 
Per adoption guidance, the first quarter does not need to be reissued. However, all future comparisons for the first quarter should reflect the recasted numbers. We have included a supplementary schedule on our website that includes the updated first quarter impact for the P&L. 
You will note that the first quarter recast number reflects a tax rate of 15.8%. The company issued shares related to employee stock compensation such as restricted stock awards or performance share units in the first quarter. Therefore, historically, a significant portion of the annual tax benefit is recognized in the first quarter. The tax benefit for stock options is recognized throughout the year as employees exercise their options, but timing is less predictable for stock options. 
We are comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 18.5% to 19%, lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to the accounting for share-based compensation tax benefits that I just described. 
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrants for PROCRIT or REMICADE in the U.S., and our assumption remains unchanged with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra. 
We also do not anticipate generic competition this year for ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. But as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As Alex mentioned, we have now closed the acquisition of Vogue International. So our guidance now reflects 6 months of additional sales. This is a fast-growing business and will contribute to the profitability of our Consumer business beginning the first full year, as well as be accretive to our adjusted EPS beginning in the first full year. 
Also, during the second quarter, we closed on our divestiture for the controlled substance raw material and API business and therefore, those sales were no longer be recorded. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this does provide a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
As noted in our press release, we are increasing our operational sales guidance for 2016, primarily reflecting the strong results from the first half as well as 6 additional months of sales from the Vogue acquisition, partially offset by the divestiture of our controlled substance raw material and API business. We would, therefore, be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion and higher than our previous guidance. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we describe our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C sales, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015, which we've mentioned earlier. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 1% on sales. This is consistent with our previous guidance as other major currencies strengthened since our last update. We are watching the euro and other currencies closely as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year. Of course, we're closely following the situation with the U.K.'s vote to exit from the EU. We expect this will take time to fully determine what the impact will be, if any. 
To put it into perspective though, the U.K. represents about 3% of our total sales. So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion and higher than our previous guidance. 
And now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by about 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range of between $6.66 to $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational constant currency growth rate of 7.4% to 9%. This is a narrower range as well as higher than our previous guidance and includes the first quarter impact from the tax accounting change we discussed earlier. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, and this is consistent with our guidance in April. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.63 to $6.73 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance due both to the continued strength of the business and a lower tax rate. And at this point in the year, we will be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the first 6 months of this year, and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year, namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6% or higher than we saw in 2015 on a comparable basis. 
Our adjusted pretax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
Our adjusted operational EPS growth in our guidance improved and remains strong in the range of $6.66 to $6.76 a share, that's a growth rate of between 7% and 9%. Our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations. 
And now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call. Louise?"

Well, with respect to the early adoption, I mentioned earlier that the first quarter impact was $0.05, and that's the most significant impact we expect for the year because that's where the majority of stock-based compensation is issued to employees. The second quarter impact was lower than that, but was almost entirely offset by other tax items. And the rest of the year will depend on when employees exercise stock options, so very difficult to predict. So for now, we've included in our effective tax rate for the year only the first quarter impact, which after we adopt it in the second quarter, we're letting the first quarter impact flow through for the remainder of the year.
Second quarter impacts already been offset by other items, and remaining quarterly impacts, we think, will either likely be offset by other items or very difficult to predict because it's timing of when employees exercise options."

And I think the team has done a great job at making it [ph] a little bit more broadly across that entire Consumer group. I think we see that in the core trends. And of course, once we establish that, we continue to see Consumer as a great growth opportunity for the organization going forward. And as Jorge and as you saw when we did the Medical Device and Consumer Investor Relations review, now about a little over a month ago, I think they've got a really ambitious but also realistic plan for that, built on our existing brands. And we were really pleased to see performance. For example, LISTERINE, up 7%; OTC's up 6%; analgesics within OTCs were up over 13%. And then in beauty, you saw about a 9% lift with really strong performance from NEUTROGENA and AVEENO. And when you take that and augment it, I think, with thoughtful additions such as we saw over this last quarter, whether it was NeoStrata, whether it was HIPOGLÓS or with Vogue, we think that those are great additions to our existing portfolio, and will likely be part of a continuous stream of additions to that part of the portfolio. And as we said for some time, whenever we're looking at inorganic growth opportunities, we look at tuck-ins, we look at midsized deals, we'll look at large deals. Of course, the tuck-in strategy, particularly in pharma -- or actually, in all of our segments, Medical Device and Consumer, are those that -- where we feel that we can create the most value. But we do think that there's other opportunities to create value as well, and again, in mid- and larger deals. But we're going to be very disciplined. We're going to be very decisive about how we do it. And ultimately, try to better serve patients and consumers."

And by the way, we're pleased with the progress that we've seen in our Medical Device group over the last quarter as well. I mean, if we look at the restructuring, I think, overall, that team's on track. They're doing actions that strengthen their go-to-market model, to accelerate their pace of innovation. They're prioritizing some additional platforms and geographies, and all while streamlining some operations but really keeping very high-quality standards. We think they're on track with the plan that they articulated earlier in the year. And we're confident that as they move through this, they will be not only a stronger, but a more innovative and a more efficient business."

Thank you very much for the question. Over the past 3 or 4 years, I think we've been pretty consistent in our thinking and in our projections about likely increasing consolidation among providers and hospitals, particularly here in the United States and just broader health care systems. And as systems feel continuing pricing pressure, we think that will manifest itself by them having consolidation. I think we've seen those trends. And I think they're clearly starting an effort to try and be as effective and as efficient as possible. So we do believe that, that will be a longer secular trend that's going to continue. That's why we believe having a diverse and enough critical mass in our Medical Device portfolio is so important going forward. We see it in the way that expectations are changing among decision-makers, including not only surgeons, but also people in procurement and other C suite executives, administrators and hospital systems. And we think as a result of that, we'll be very well positioned, particularly when you think about our surgical franchise, our Orthopaedics franchise. We've also been consistent in saying that we're extremely pleased with the performance of our cardiovascular unit, particularly our EP group, Biosense Webster. I mean, once again, this quarter, they've delivered over 18.5% growth with great innovation and great execution. But we also realize that that's an area where we'll continue to look for the right kind of additions, organically and inorganically, to ensure that we're properly positioned going forward."

Look, as we look at the landscape going forward, we fully predict that generics and biosimilars are going to be part of the competitive landscape. And look, we think that, that is essential for the health care system. We think, in the long run, it's actually a benefit for very innovative-focused companies because that's the only way you can relieve pressure over the long term. Of course, that's predicated upon the market and companies respecting intellectual property. It's very important to produce the right scientific information so that we're guaranteeing patient safety and understanding the important clinical differences between some of these compounds as they may or may not manifest themselves. And so we projected them. As we look at our strategic plan, we think they will be there. But we also feel that that's why it's so important to keep innovating with new product launches going forward. And it's also critical to establish a strong critical mass in terms of products, but also expertise in clinical data and information in certain platforms. And so for us, in the Immunology platform, we're very proud of the extensive track record that REMICADE, the TNF-alpha compound has had and what it continues to do. We'll continue to defend our intellectual property around it. But at the same time, if you look at compounds like STELARA and SIMPONI, not only have they both generated in excess of 30% growth this quarter, but we've also produced additional data that we think is going to be very important to patients and physicians in how they adopt these products. And these are already multibillion-dollar platforms for Janssen and Johnson & Johnson. And then when you compound that with sirukumab and guselkumab, again an IL-6 and IL-23 approach where we know there's a lot of patient variability, we think that's important. Also, as we look at REMICADE itself, we know that there's about 2.4 million patients who've been treated with the compound. We know that about 70% of them in fact are getting good relief and good effects. We know that they're unlikely to be switched when they're getting a positive response from their therapy. And we also know that when we contract across the Janssen and Johnson & Johnson portfolio, that it provides us a very important position with larger health care systems and networks. So that's the way we think about it, and that's the way we plan for it going forward."

In the selling, market and administrative line, that's where you see the benefits of the program you were referring to, where we anticipate about $1 billion of savings for 2018. That program's on track. We're seeing the savings. We're also making some investments. As the investments tail off, the savings will be more significant and more impactful in that line item going forward. So we're beginning to see the savings now. They're somewhat partially offset by some investments we need to make to continue the program. But in the future, those investments tail off and the savings ramp up, and there -- have more of an impact. And then also, as you mentioned, the Medical Device restructuring is a whole another area that's unrelated to the 2 that I just mentioned earlier and that we expect to see continued improvements there, although that's a business where we want to also accelerate the pace of innovation with those savings. So some of those will be reinvested in the business. So it's across those 3 areas, and we're committed to the operating margin improvement that I've mentioned earlier of greater than 200 basis points. And halfway through the year, we feel very good about our ability to achieve that."

Well, consistent with what we said last time when you asked a very similar question, we -- as you know, we're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions. And although we're actively involved in considering them, valuations come into play. And willingness of the other party to do an acquisition at certain valuations come into play. So that's regardless of how much money we have available to spend, right? So we don't really look at that as the main driver of how we're going to do acquisitions. We look at what value we're going to create for shareholders by doing the acquisition at the right value so we can improve returns for our shareholders. There are some expectations that are still not, in our opinion, normalized for appropriate valuations in the market, so that's a factor. And that will take time, and we're patient with that. And then we'll take -- we'll see how the market evolves over time or as we learn more about the acquisition candidates and their progress in various areas. And then finally, whether or not the cash is trapped overseas or not is not at all an impediment to our ability to do any acquisitions. We'll either obviously try to find a way to do it in a tax-efficient basis as we've done with other acquisitions and utilize that cash as much as possible, only if it's tax efficient. But then, obviously, we can continue to borrow, and we have the ability to borrow to do the acquisitions that we think are value-creating for our shareholders. So we wouldn't let that hold us back.

I felt like the messaging from Jorge and others was, yes, this business can be sort of an upper single-digit grower with obviously expanding margins.

Let me take the first question on gross to net, and then Alex will cover the SGLT2 commentary. So U.S., how does it occur and what's going on with list price versus net price and those sorts of things. So just to put it in perspective, this is not unusual in our industry, as you know. Everyone in the pharmaceutical industry is estimating what the rebates might be. And then, of course, we'll actualize them once actual data is submitted. Recently, that actual data has been more timely. And in that more timely data from the payers, we're able to see trends, so we're able to not only actualize prior-period amounts, but we're also able to estimate better what the ultimate gross-to-net variation will be going forward. With respect to list price net of rebates, as you probably know, we said this before, we think we price our products responsibly and our overall list price increases have been relatively below -- substantially below the average industry. But in the end, the net price that's achieved is far from the gross price increase that happened. So rebates continue to be an increasing part of the business, and the overall realization of gross price to net price, that delta is expanding, I would, say over time. And therefore, as I said, now, we're much more current with our ability to predict these estimates, and that's what's going on.

Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Chief Financial Officer; Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; and Dr. Bill Hait, Global Head of Pharmaceutical Research and Development. 
A few logistics before we discuss the results. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. 
I will begin today's presentation by briefly reviewing the third quarter sales and earnings results for the corporation and sales results for each of our 3 business segments. Next, Joaquin and Bill will provide an update on our Pharmaceutical business, specifically highlighting how our focus on innovation to address unmet medical needs translates to current and future strong performance. Dominic will then provide some additional commentary on the results, review the income statement and discuss guidance for 2016. Lastly, we will open the call to your questions. We expect today's call to last approximately 90 minutes. 
Included with the press release issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made here today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. 
During the course of today's presentation, we will discuss a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide is an acknowledgment of those relationships. 
I would now like to review our results. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016, up 4.2% versus the third quarter of 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.3% and currency had a negative impact of 0.1%. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6.7% while regions outside the U.S. were up 1.5%, comprised of 1.7% operational growth, partially offset by negative impact of currency exchange rates of 0.2%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined 1.3%. You may recall that we highlighted growth in the second quarter of 2016 being favorably impacted by an inventory build, which did reverse in the third quarter. Europe grew by 3.2% while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 1.4%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 7.3% in the U.S. and 4.2% outside the U.S. Additionally, operations in Venezuela reduced reported sales growth. Worldwide, this impact was a reduction of 30 basis points; and outside the U.S., 70 basis points. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.53 versus $1.20 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $236 million and a charge of $175 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 12.2% and 12.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew 12.8%. 
Beginning with Consumer, let's now turn to segment highlights for the quarter. Please note that the percentages quoted for all segments represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.3 billion, increasing 0.1% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. sales were up 1.1% while sales outside the U.S. declined 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales fell 0.4% worldwide, with a decline of 1.5% in the U.S. and growth of 0.3% outside the U.S.  
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 110 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively, with the most pronounced impact occurring in Women's Health. Growth was driven by worldwide Skin Care and OTC sales outside the U.S. Baby Care experienced declines over the third quarter of 2015. 
Performance in the Consumer segment was negatively impacted by slower market growth and reductions of customer inventory levels. Overall, the impact of inventory reduction was approximately 3 points on Worldwide Consumer sales growth for the quarter, with the most pronounced effect on OTC and Skin Care results. Dominic will discuss these factors in further detail later in the call. 
OTC sales grew 1.8% worldwide. Results were driven by strong consumption in smoking cessation products across Europe and new product launches in Europe and Asia. U.S. sales growth due to share gains was partially offset by trade inventory levels impacting growth in the U.S. by approximately 10 points, where, as highlighted, for the third quarter of 2015, the business experienced launch build in pain, allergy and digestive health. Also, a weak allergy season in the U.S. during 2016 negatively impacted inventory levels in the third quarter of 2016. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from 13% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 49%, up from 44% a year ago. 
Skin Care grew 12.2% worldwide and 18.9% in the U.S. These results include the sales from the recent Vogue, NeoStrata acquisitions, which are captured in the U.S. O-U.S. results were driven by stocking of  Dabao products in China and share gains in Latin America. Inventory levels negatively impacted worldwide sales growth by 3 points. Successful marketing campaigns and new products continue to drive the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. Divestitures impacted sales growth in Wound Care/Other and Women's Health categories. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.4 billion increased 9.0%, with U.S. sales up 11.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.0%, driven by strong performance of new products as well as growth from our core products. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying worldwide sales growth was 10.7% as sales in the U.S. were up 13.0%; and outside the U.S., up 7.0%. Contributors to growth included Immunology products, REMICADE, SIMPONI and STELARA; Oncology products, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX; as well as INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/TRINZA and XARELTO. 
In Immunology, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA achieved strong growth in the U.S. due to market growth and increasing share for STELARA. The results reported for REMICADE export sales was driven entirely by a change in inventory levels accounting for approximately 90 points of growth. Specifically, there was an inventory build of approximately $55 million in the current period and $110 million impact from lower level inventories that we noted in the third quarter of 2015 results. 
Biosimilar competition continues to negatively impact performance of export sales. 
In Neuroscience, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/ TRINZA achieved strong results, with worldwide sales growth of 21% due primarily to increased market share. As expected, during the quarter, we saw the impact from generic entries for INVEGA tablets in the U.S. 
In Oncology, strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. Sales increased 92% worldwide, and IMBRUVICA remains the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second-line CLL and MCL. 
Outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Canada, in the G5 and has recently launched in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. 
ZYTIGA sales grew 5.3% worldwide. In the U.S., market growth was essentially flat while market share was up almost 2 points sequentially. Sales outside the U.S. were tied to share gains in Japan and adoption in China since the launch in January of this year. 
DARZALEX continues to gain strong acceptance as a treatment for multiple myeloma and contributed approximately 2 points of Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales growth. 
Turning to Cardiovascular and metabolics. XARELTO continued strong share performance, with TRx market share up 1.7 points versus Q3 of 2015 to 17.5%. Warfarin represents approximately 55% of the total market, down from 62% in the third quarter of 2015. XARELTO continues to be broadly reimbursed, with over 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product copay. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales declined 3%, with the U.S. down 8.7% due to an increase in price discounts. Some of the increase in discounts is attributable to higher copay program cost in the quarter. While the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was up approximately 5%, TRx share was essentially flat to the third quarter of 2015. TRx share with endocrinologists was approximately 11% and approximately 6% with primary care. 
I'll now review the results of the Medical Device segment. Worldwide Medical Device segment sales of $6.2 billion increased 0.7% with U.S. sales increasing 1.4% and sales outside the U.S. decreasing 0.2%. 
As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 3.1% worldwide, with the U.S. up 2.3% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Additionally, the devaluation of Venezuela impacted growth worldwide by 10 basis points and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points. 
Growth was driven by electrophysiology, Advanced Surgery, Vision Care and Orthopaedics, slightly offset by general surgery and Diabetes Care. Electrophysiology within Cardiovascular grew 16% worldwide, driven by continued share gains in the U.S. and Europe as the atrial fibrillation procedure market increases. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by joint reconstruction and U.S. trauma. Pricing pressure continued across all major categories but was partially offset by positive mix in trauma and spine, continued success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees and the  CORAIL primary stem in hips contributed to the sales results. 
Within Advanced Surgery, endocutters grew 14%, energy was up 10% and biosurgicals up 7%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, closed in the second quarter of this year, also contributed modestly to growth. 
Vision Care sales were higher by 5.5% worldwide as new products launched late last year continued on an upward trajectory across all regions. Worldwide general surgery declined by approximately 2% due to discontinuing certain products in Women's Health and hernia, partially offset by both market growth and share gains in sutures. Competitive pressures and price erosion continue to impact Diabetes Care. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2016. To assist with your models, this slide provides you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, to inform you about the state of the Pharmaceutical business and the progress made since our May 2015 Business Review Day. Joaquin?"
139677,381738381,1056201,"Johnson & Johnson, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson.",1845,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson. Our market-leading innovative medicines are the foundation of our strong performance, with the vast majority of their growth coming from volume gains. We continue to pursue significant growth opportunities in terms of both penetration within existing indications and planned line extensions. 
Additionally, we have launched DARZALEX, the first of our 10 potential billion-dollars-plus NMEs. As a result, we remain confident that we'll continue to deliver strong growth through 2019 despite biosimilar competition and market dynamics. Our success is a result of our strong track record of execution. Our industry-leading pipeline has delivered 12 NMEs since 2011 and 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations since 2013. And for the fourth year, we are proud to have been named the #1 company in R&D and commercial productive innovation. 
Our focused execution has delivered 11 in-market, billion-dollars-plus brands. 10 of these brands are growing, and 6 of them are growing double digit. Cumulatively, sales from our medicines launched since 2011 are the second highest of any pharmaceutical company. Our R&D and commercial capabilities are a proven strong foundation for future growth. 
First, we will continue to focus on driving volume growth across our current market-leading brands through clinical differentiation. Second, we will accelerate the growth of these in-market brands through approximately 40 potential line extensions. Critically, 10 of these line extensions have more than $0.5 billion potential. Third, as we shared last year, we have a [indiscernible] pipeline investing in 10 potential billion-dollar-plus NMEs planned to be filed through 2019. Of these, we anticipate 5 to deliver significant growth opportunities in the near term. 
Since 2015, our expectations around these near-term opportunities have crystallized. Our latest information provides higher certainty that these products will succeed delivering higher value than originally anticipated. DARZALEX, launched last year, is significantly outperforming expectations. According to your own models, it is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar brand. Sirukumab has just been filed in the U.S. and Europe. Guselkumab has just had very positive data versus Humira presented at the EADV, and we anticipate filing for psoriasis before year-end. 
Apalutamide has a broad clinical development program in both pre-metastatic and metastatic prostate cancer. We also are investigating it in combination with ZYTIGA and with our newly licensed PARP inhibitor, niraparib. Finally, esketamine is already in Phase III and recently received a second Breakthrough Therapy designation. Bill will provide additional clinical details on these near-term opportunities shortly. 
Finally, it is important to note that these 3 strategies will prepare us to deliver robust growth beyond 2019, paving the way for more than 25 potential next-generation NMEs in the 2020 to 2024 time frame. 
The strength of our in-market portfolio, complemented by our near-term line extensions and NME launches, will be more than offset upcoming headwinds, including those anticipated for REMICADE. 
We are fully prepared to execute a focused biosimilar readiness plan. Yesterday, the launch of a U.S. biosimilar to REMICADE was announced for later this year. However, the appeals process is still ongoing, and we believe any commercial launch of a biosimilar remains at risk. 
Biosimilars are very different from generics. For example, in Canada, Australia and Brazil, where there is already biosimilar competition to REMICADE, we have maintained more than 90% volume share. Our U.S. commercial team is ready for a potential biosimilar launch. 
I'm confident in our strategy for 3 reasons. First, with no biosimilar approved for interchangeability, REMICADE's significant long-term safety data, a strong advocacy from patients and clear physician preference means that the 70% of patients who are stable on REMICADE are highly unlikely to switch. Second, our patient assistance programs provide a leading market differentiator. Third, we are confident that we can continue to provide a cost-effective option in all channels. The current market is extremely competitive, and REMICADE ASP is already significantly lower than the list price 
Additionally, in developing innovative contracts, we can utilize the full breadth of our portfolio. 
Our Immunology franchise remains poised to grow through 2019. We have a strong market position and a deep near-term pipeline. Let me give you some examples. Already in rheumatoid arthritis, SIMPONI ARIA is the fastest-growing IV product in the U.S. and has higher new-to-brand share than REMICADE. Outside of the U.S., we continue to gain share with SIMPONI, too. Additionally, we plan to file 2 line extensions for SIMPONI ARIA in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Together with the recent submissions of sirukumab for the approval in the U.S. and Europe, we will further strengthen our leading position in Rheumatology. 
Turning to psoriasis. STELARA continues to be the #1 biologic in new-to-brand share in the U.S. and maintains clear share leadership in key markets internationally. One of our 10 potential billion-dollars-plus brands, Guselkumab, is expected to provide a significant boost to our leadership in psoriasis, and Bill will share more on this important upcoming filing. 
Finally, moving to Gastroenterology. The most exciting news is the recent launch of STELARA for Crohn's disease in the U.S. and its anticipated launch in Europe. There is tremendous unmet need in this debilitating disease. For example, 70% to 80% of Crohn's patients on anti-TNFs are not in remission at 1 year, and the patient population is expected to grow 50% over the next decade. This is the first in a series of line extensions, including UC, which will drive more than 35% of STELARA performance by 2019. 
Moving now to Cardiovascular and metabolics. INVOKANA continues to be a standout performer. Globally, it is the leading  SGLT2 inhibitor and the third largest known insulin diabetes medicine. Put into perspective, in the U.S., there have been more prescriptions filled for INVOKANA and INVOKAMET than all other  SGLT2 inhibitors combined. A total of more than 1.3 million patients are treated in the U.S. alone. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, INVOKANA's performance dipped this quarter due to temporary increased costs to administer copay patient access programs. However, I want to emphasize that this was a transitory event. Our return to growth will be driven by INVOKANA's strong access position across U.S. commercial plans and Medicare Part D and the recent approval of INVOKAMET XR. We are expecting our cardiovascular outcomes data to read out in mid-2017. 
XARELTO is another market leader in our Cardiovascular and metabolics portfolio, delivering double-digit growth every year since its launch in 2011. To date, XARELTO has already treated more than 3.8 million patients in the U.S. and is supported by an extremely robust published real-world dataset, including evidence from more than 91,000 patients demonstrating consistency with our clinical trials. As a result, it is broadly reimbursed, with more than 95% Medicare and commercial patients on formulary at the lowest branded copay. 
These considerable achievements are just a start. Approximately, 54% of potential patients are still utilizing Warfarin, presenting significant growth opportunities in current indications.  Additionally, there are 8 new indications seeking clinical studies underway as part of EXPLORER, the largest clinical development program within the anticoagulant space. If successful, the potential patient pull could increase more than fivefold. 
Turning to Neuroscience. INVEGA TRINZA is a growth catalyst for the entire long-acting therapy franchise. Notably, INVEGA TRINZA is the fastest-growing LAT in the U.S. It has also contributed to growing INVEGA SUSTENNA scripts 26% in the 13 months since launch. 
Significant opportunities for growth remain as only 11% of patients are treated with LATs in the U.S. 
Celebrating 10 years of innovation this year, our HIV portfolio has achieved approximately 20% growth annually and cumulative sales of more than $15 billion. Today, 25% of patients in developed markets are treated with a J&J HIV medicine. Our class-leading portfolio has benefited more than 1 million patients, and this legacy will continue with upcoming line extensions. When Prezista first launched, it was part of a 6-tablet regimen. The first upcoming line extension, darunavir single-tablet regimen, will reduce this number to 1, improving adherence and safety. Also, we expect 2 rilpivirine fixed-dose combinations, one with Gilead's TAF and another one with ViiV's dolutegravir, that will drive additional growth for 2019. 
Finally, let's move to our fastest-growing therapeutic area, Oncology. IMBRUVICA has led the recent growth of our oncology franchise, accelerating from a record-breaking global launch to clear market share leadership in total patients in the first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Today, IMBRUVICA is reimbursed in 41 countries with world-class market access. Since launch, an additional 6 indications have been approved, and we anticipate an additional 7 new registrations ahead, 4 of which have $500 million-plus potential.  Together with a number of promising combination therapies in development, these new indications will usher in a very exciting future for IMBRUVICA. 
IMBRUVICA's leadership in Oncology is mirrored by our recently launched asset, DARZALEX. Only 3 months after its launch, DARZALEX became the #1 prescribed therapy in fourth-line and later multiple myeloma. From a launch-aligned sales perspective, DARZALEX has continued to far outpace its competitors. This first-in-class medicine has since been improved in the EU and Canada and is driving positive share trends in earlier therapy lines in the U.S. We are confident DARZALEX can become the standard of care in multiple myeloma and help even more than the 10,000 patients who have benefited already worldwide. 
Growth will continue to accelerate with the anticipated approval in second-line patient populations and the impressive data from the recently published CASTOR and POLLUX studies. An additional 5 Phase III trials are currently underway as well as development of a subcutaneous formulation. As Bill will detail, we have also seen some positive data that DARZALEX may be effective outside of multiple myeloma. What should be clear today is that all of our current market-leading medicines have significant potential for continued volume growth. 
Additionally, we have a multitude of promising potential line extensions across every therapeutic area, approximately 40 in total, by 2019. Of these, 10 have more than $0.5 billion potential. The remaining 30 potential line extensions are not insignificant.  Cumulatively, the line extensions for XARELTO and INVOKANA have the potential to drive $3 billion to $5 billion in incremental sales for the Cardiovascular franchise. We believe these new indications will be a key driver of our growth through 2019 even in the context of biosimilars and market dynamics. 
In my 6 years leading our Pharmaceutical sector, I have never been more excited and more positive about our future as I am today. We have significant growth potential throughout our portfolio with market-leading brands; 40 anticipated line extensions, 10 of which have more than $0.5 billion potential; and 10 NMEs with more than $1 billion potential to be filed by 2019. Combined, these factors will ensure that we continue to outpace the industry growth through 2019. 
It is now my privilege to turn the call over to Dr. William Hait, who heads up our R&D organization. Bill will provide additional detail about our pipeline that is set to deliver this groundbreaking treatments. Bill?"
139677,381738381,1056201,"Johnson & Johnson, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Hait, and I'm the Global Head of Research and Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen, we believe that by continuing to execu",2101,"Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Hait, and I'm the Global Head of Research and Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. 
As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen, we believe that by continuing to execute our current strategy, we will consistently deliver valuable products to patients with serious unmet medical needs and that this will sustain our leadership in the pharmaceutical industry. Our strength is built on a blend of deep internal scientific expertise with industry-leading collaborations through the work of Johnson & Johnson innovation. We continue to find efficiencies that produce savings that we invest in our pipeline, and our strategic focus creates an enviable track record. We are delivering against our anticipated 2015 to 2019 NME and LE results that will produce a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. For these reasons and the results I will describe today, Janssen has become one of the most productive and most respected pharmaceutical companies. 
Before I share with you the details of our pipeline progress, let me explain how and why we have been able to sustain industry-leading results. Our 5 end-to-end therapeutic areas span basic drug discovery through launch and life cycle management. This structure produces a focused, seamless R&D organization, promotes efficient phase transitions and ensures dedication to major unmet medical needs where there is compelling, translatable science. These 5 therapeutic areas concentrate on 11 high-priority disease areas through our disease area strongholds, nimble and efficient biotech-like teams embedded in the broader context of the therapeutic areas. Each disease area stronghold undergoes rigorous triennial review by our external scientific advisory board, receives a priority score and proportional funding of discovery and early development. 
Our therapeutic areas are supported by substantial research capabilities through our centers of excellence, including biotechnology; medicinal chemistry; diagnostics; clinical operations; and, most recently, oligonucleotide and nucleic acid chemistry, expertise garnered through the acquisition of Alios. Assets that transition into late development are prioritized into 3 categories to ensure that our investment of resources align with our most promising targets. Currently, our top 2 categories, which represent 40% of our assets and 80% of our overall late-development value, receives 60% of our investment. It is through this approach that we remain at the top of the industry in successful phase transitions and speed to market. 
Janssen has achieved considerable success, and we are poised to continuously deliver near- and long-term growth. Our balanced investment across all aspects of our pipeline allows us to enjoy a constant flow of important new data. We launched 12 new products since 2011. We received the most FDA approvals from 2011 to 2016 as well as 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations. 
For 4 consecutive years, we have been named the innovation leader by IDEA Pharma and became the partner of choice through the work of J&J innovation. And for the third consecutive year, Fortune Magazine ranked Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson #1 in the pharmaceutical category on its annual World's Most Admired Companies list. Our unwavering commitment to global public health is demonstrated by SIRTURO, the first new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis in over 40 years; as well as our work on new, convenient HIV combinations; the first prime-boost Ebola vaccine using Crucell's adenoviral vector and Bavarian Nordic's MVA vector; as well as new chewable forms of mebendazole for children with worm infestations. 
As Joaquin mentioned and as we highlighted at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review Day, between 2015 and 2019, we plan on filing approximately 10 new drugs, each with a potential for greater than $1 billion in peak year sales and 40 line extensions. This slide highlights 10 of these, anticipated to be filed in the 2015 to 2019 time period, with peak year sales potential greater than $0.5 billion 
In addition, our early pipeline is rich in important assets that have the potential to file between 2020 and 2024. We are on track to deliver our anticipated NME and LE results through a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. Since May 2015, we garnered 3 new product approvals and filings, with the fourth, Guselkumab, anticipated this year, and we achieved 16 significant line extensions. 
Now let me use our time together to describe in greater detail some of the progress we have made since our May 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. Oncology is the newest of our 5 therapeutic areas and achieved industry-leading growth based on our development of several first-in-class drugs, including ZYTIGA, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. Our hem malignancies disease area is anchored by IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. 
IMBRUVICA, the first BTK inhibitor for the treatment of certain B-cell malignancies, received 4 FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations. IMBRUVICA was recently approved for frontline use, based on the unprecedented results in previously untreated CLL patients reported in the RESONATE-2 study published in the December 15 issue of the New England Journal. As shown on this slide, treatment with ibrutinib decreased progression or death from CLL by 84% compared to chlorambucil and demonstrated a similar improvement in overall survival. 
DARZALEX, the first monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma, received 2 FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations and was approved almost 4 months ahead of its PDUFA date in double-refractory myeloma. As shown on this slide, combination therapy with DARZALEX delivered impressive results in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. The CASTOR and POLLUX studies demonstrated that the addition of DARZALEX to Zalcaid and [indiscernible] or revlimine in [indiscernible], respectively, produced a greater than 60% decrease in risk of progression or death as compared to [indiscernible] or [indiscernible] alone, both of these studies were published in the New England Journal. 
This month, the FDA granted priority review for daratumumab in combination with [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] or [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] for relapsed multiple myeloma with the PDUFA date in February 2017. 
Our prostate cancer disease area is anchored by Zytiga, the first set 17 inhibitor for the treatment of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, was approved for both pre- and post chemotherapy indications. 
Furthermore, we are developing ARN 509 now known as Apalutamide, a more potent next-generation androgen receptor antagonist that shows a high degree of safety and efficacy in castrate-resistant prostate cancer. 
As seen in these figures, Apalutamide decreased PSA by a median of 85% in patients with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer after 12 weeks of treatment. The maximum PSA response shown on the right-hand figure was achieved in 94% of patients. 
Earlier this year, we licensed niraparib from Tesoro to obtain a highly potent and selected part inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer patients with DNA repair defects for use in combination with Zytiga or apalutamide. Niraparib is in Phase II trials and is currently to be filed by 2019. This portfolio of assets gives us confidence that we will continue to bring great results of patients with prostate cancer for many years to come. 
While we did not explicitly address immuno-oncology during our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review, we continue to make significant progress in this area. Over the last 5 years, we invested in 4 critical areas, including vaccines, T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell redirection and myeloid mechanisms of actions. We currently have 15 immuno-oncology assets in development, including 8 that are in the clinic. 
Recently, we uncovered an important additional mechanism of action of DARZALEX to be immune mediated through the depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid in lymphoid populations, including a previously unrecognized super suppressor CD38 positive T rate calculation as well as activation of CD8 and CD4 positive effector T-cells. These results provide the impetus for exploring DARZALEX in indications beyond heme malignancies in solid tumors. 
Our immunology therapeutic area continues to deliver extraordinary products for patients with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. STELARA was the first IL-12 IL-23 monoclonal antibody introduced for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. It was recently approved and moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in the U.S, received the positive opinion from the committee for additional products for human use of the European Medicines Agency and offers new options for adult patients with IBD. 
[indiscernible] is a first in class selective anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody that demonstrated significant efficacy versus placebo in superiority compared with the anti-[indiscernible] necrosis factor, Adalimumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
The VOYAGE study, whose results are shown in this slide, randomly assigned 750 patients to receive Guselkumab, Adalimumab or placebo, followed by Guselkumab in the 2 to 2 to 1 ratio. Patients treated with Guselkumab achieved a significantly greater chance of obtaining approximately 90 score compared to that of patients treated with Adalimumab or placebo at Week 16 and the advantage over Adalimumab were sustained through Week 48. 
The high degree of efficacy of Guselkumab, the less intensive dosing regimen and the potential for a STELARA-like safety profile makes Guselkumab highly competitive with newly launched anti-IL 17 antibodies. We plan to file for psoriasis this year and advance Guselkumab into Phase III for patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Neuroscience is a historically strong area patient area for JANSSEN since Dr. Paul Janssen and colleague developed [indiscernible], the first medication for schizophrenia. We have built on Dr. Paul's legacy with the development of next generation antipsychotics and pioneered the development of long-acting injectables that help improve compliance for this difficult-to-treat patient population. 
Most recently with the approval of INVEGA TRINZA in every 3 months injectable formulation. Today, we focus our neuroscience investments in drugs that treat serious mood disorders, including depression, suicide and Alzheimer's disease. Esketamine, an intranasally delivered ketamine, produced groundbreaking results in major depressive disorder with onset of action measured in hours to days rather than weeks to months. 
There's an alarming increase in suicides both in the U.S. and globally, more than 41,000 each year in the U.S. alone. It's a tragic issue that's emerging as a major health priority. 
As shown in this light, esketamine ameliorated suicidal ideation within 4 hours and sustain this effect for over 3 weeks leading to a second FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation. 
Infectious Diseases is one of our most exciting and important areas and investment for future growth where we focus on respiratory infections and hepatitis. We are pursuing an aggressive strategy for the cure of hepatitis C. We recently reported a 100% FBR 12 in patients with genotype 1 with both an 8 and 6 weeks duration of treatment using a 3DAA combination of OLYSIO AL 335 and [indiscernible]. 
Based on this exceptional data, we are moving to 3DAA regimen into late development studies. 
Our Cardiovascular and Metabolism therapeutic area developed both INVOKANA and XARELTO in partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe. New line extensions are designed to continue to bring value with these 2 first in class drugs. With XARELTO, we are pursuing studies in congestive heart failure, embolic stroke of undetermined source, DTE prevention in medically ill patients, infect [indiscernible] peripheral artery disease, ZTE prevention in cancer patients and an acute coronary syndrome. 
We anticipate [indiscernible] from 2 INVOKANA cardiovascular outcome studies by mid 2017, which we believe will further strengthen the importance of the STL 2 inhibitor class for the treatment of patients with diabetes. 
We are also studying the role of INVOKANA in diabetic kidney disease and plan to address obesity and prediabetes. 
In summary, at the JANSSEN pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are executing a clearly defined innovation strategy that drive value to patients around the world. We are on track to meeting our anticipated results described in 2015. We are producing the cadence of transformational innovations that are leading to exceptional results. We are a leader in productivity, approval and FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designations, and we are one of the fastest-growing top 10 pharmaceutical companies. 
We have had the most U.S. FDA approvals in the last 5 years, 2011 to 2016, and 8 Breakthrough Therapy Designation. We anticipate filing approximately 10 NMEs between 2015 and 2019, each with greater than $1 billion peak year sales potential. 
We have approximately 40 planned line extension filings anticipated between 2015 and 2019, several with greater than $500 million in peak year sales potential, supported by a steady flow of clinical data that drive better patient results. 
Finally, we take pride in delivering years of live saved and better quality of life for our first credo responsibility to the doctors, nurses and patients who use our products. 
Now before I turn it over to Dominic, for your reference, let me leave you with a current overview of our pipeline across our 5 therapeutic areas. Dominic will now continue with an update of the company's financial results."

As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we make the progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceu",2490,"Thank you, Bill and Joaquin,  and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we make the progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. 
With great leaders like Joaquin and Bill, our strong end market performance driven by excellent commercial capabilities and our robust R&D pipeline, you can see what we remain confident that our Pharmaceuticals business will continue to be a major driver of growth moving forward. 
I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We are pleased with our overall results. As you know, we have a strong start to the year and as a result, last quarter, we increased our sales and earnings guidance. I'm happy to say, we're tracking with those higher expectations while continuing to invest in our business. 
As you've heard, our Pharmaceutical business delivered strong results this quarter, with underlying operational growth of 10.7%. 
Let me now provide some comments on our other businesses. In our consumer business, we continue to gain share this quarter. However, as reported by Nielsen, the industry saw slowdown in many markets, with category growth rates in 2016, about half of the category growth rate we saw in Q3 of 2015. 
As Joe noted, our sales growth for the quarter was also impacted by lower trade inventory levels. These lower levels are the result of inventory builds in Q3 2015 as we discussed at that time due to relaunches of certain products as well as inventory reduction programs being implemented at some of our larger retailers this past quarter. 
When excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year and this overall impact for trade inventory reductions, overall consumer growth was nearly 4%. Based on increasing share trends of our brands, we expect trade levels to align with consumption going forward. 
In Medical Devices, consistent with the recent analyst reports about the market, we believe the industry experienced lower hospital admission and procedure rates during the mid-summer months. 
Late in the quarter, several reports showed higher levels of activity and in fact, the data that we recently saw published for September looked encouraging. 
Additionally, we're very pleased to see our priority platforms continue to deliver robust growth of nearly 9%, with some at double digits as Joe mentioned earlier. 
Overall, Hospital Medical Devices operational growth, excluding acquisition and divestitures, was approximately 4% this quarter. 
In the Consumer Medical Device businesses, we saw continued price erosion in our Diabetes business. However, in our Vision Care business, we saw good operational growth of 5.5%. 
So in summary, as we previously discussed, in 2015, our underlying operational growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions divestiture us as well as hepatitis C sales and the extra shipping days that we saw in 2015 was about 5.5%. 
On this same basis, we continue to accelerate our growth, and we delivered strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 5.9% for the third quarter 2016. 
Our sales were above analyst estimates as were earnings due to significantly higher pretax operating margins. As you may remember, our guidance from January included a more than 200 basis points increase in our 2016 pretax operating margin on an adjusted basis. We have attained that level year-to-date while continuing to invest in our business, and we remain comfortable with a forecast for the full year as continue to execute on the restructuring activities in our medical device businesses while also investing in growth. 
As you know, in September, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics. We expect this transaction to close in Q1 of 2017. So for 2016, the transaction is expected to have no impact to our adjusted earnings, it's not expected to our guidance. For 2017, again assuming a Q1 close, the transaction is expected to be positive to sales growth and immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. 
We're excited about Abbott Medical Optics' strong and differentiated surgical ophthalmic portfolio, particularly in cataract surgery. That, coupled with our world leading ACUVUE contact lens business will help us become a broad-based leader in Vision Care. 
Now I take the next few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results for the quarter and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the remainder of 2016. 
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter 2016. Our operational sales growth this quarter was 4.3% and when we exclude the impact of acquisition and divestiture, the impact of hep C sales and the overall impact of Venezuela had, it was strong at more than 6%. 
If you direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. 
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expenses special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the intangible amortization expense of about $250 million and the anticipated special charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring plan. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68, which exceeded the mean of the analysts' estimates as published by first call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 12.8% versus the prior year. 
Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was the same as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a few moments and talk about other items of the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 30 basis points, mostly due to unfavorable transaction currency impacts partly offset by favorable mix and a manufacturing efficiencies. 
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 290 basis points lower as compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to overall good cost management. 
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2%, lower by 40 basis points due primarily to lower milestone payments, partly offset by increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipeline. 
Our pretax operating margin when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32% or 310 basis points higher than the third quarter of the prior year. 
As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative expenses and less R&D expense. 
As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progressed throughout the year and through 9 months, we have achieved a 220 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability consistent with the expectations we communicated to you throughout the year. 
Interest expense net of interest income was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $50 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of approximately $400 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $200 million compared to a net gain of approximately $400 million in the prior year period, which included a higher level of gains from divestitures. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7% compared to 20% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year. And it affects the mix of our businesses in the impact from a new accounting standards relating to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which we discussed in our call in July. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise improved by 220 basis points versus the third quarter of 2015. You will notice significant improvements in margins for the Medical Devices and pharmaceutical businesses. 
Last year, our consumer business benefited from gain in the sale of SPLENDA, and you're seeing that are affected in the lower margin this quarter, although still have very healthy rates. 
As you can see at the next slide on a year-to-date basis, we are pleased to see solid improvement in our consumer margin, and we remain confident it will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Overall, we expect adjusted income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in pretax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I'd like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. I'd like to start with some of the items that we know you'll find difficult to forecast. 
Let's start with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $13 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27 billion of debt. 
Through the end of the third quarter, we completed nearly 60% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year. 
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $450 million. There's a slight tightening of the range. 
Regarding other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corp, divestitures, asset sales and rails. We will be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as a gain, ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the underlying activity. This impact will be offset by a lower tax rate. 
And now for taxes, we're very comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items of approximately 18% to 18.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to higher level of income and lower tax jurisdictions. 
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. Our sales range for 2016 continues to remain the same whether or not a biosimilar REMICADE launches this year in the U.S.. 
Additionally, we do not anticipate biosimilar or generic competition this year for PROCRIT, ZYTIGA, [indiscernible] and INVEGA SUSTENNA but as expected, there are generic entrance for INVEGA and orthro cycle. 
As been done for several years, our guidance will be first based on a constant currency basis reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We also provide an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
We continue to be comfortable with the sales guidance we provided last quarter, reflecting on operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This was a result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of between approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we describe our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisition and divestitures and hepatitis C will be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year even after adjusting for the shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation will be approximately 1% on sales growth. This is consistent with our previous guidance as major currencies have not significantly fluctuated since our last update. 
So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the the range of positive 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales are approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion consistent with our previous guidance. 
And now, turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range between $6.71 and $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting on operational or constant currency growth rate of 8% to 9%. And this is a narrowing of the range. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 or to remain where they were as of last week, the negative impact to EPS would be approximately $0.03, consistent with our previous guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS range ranging from $6.68 to $6.73 per share, which again is a narrowing of our previous guidance with a midpoint that is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance range. 
Finally, just remind of some dynamics you will see in our fourth quarter results this year in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015. 
In 2015, we had additional shipping days based on when our year-end closed, and that contributed approximately 4 points of sales growth in the fourth quarter last year. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter last year, we closed on the Cordis divestiture. And based on our latest guidance for 2016, we will have significantly lower level of other income from divestitures as compared to the prior year. 
In closing, we are very pleased for our performance so far this year, and we remain confident and optimistic about our future full year growth for 2016. 
Specifically, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6%, a higher level that we experienced last year on a comparable basis. 
Our adjusted pretax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year. We narrowed our guidance and increased the midpoint for adjusted operational EPS growth, which remains strong in the range of $6.71 to $6.76 per share with the growth rate of 8% to 9%, and we are very well positioned to seize the opportunities in our strong pipelines to continue fueling our future growth.

I took that to mean that you feel that you can grow sales in 2017, is it similar rate to 2016 minus the impact from biosimilar REMICADE. So my questions are that is that the right interpretation? What gives you the confidence that this level of growth will continue? And second, the biosimilar for [indiscernible] captured about 7% in the market in year 1.

So I think that is a good way to characterize it. We'll provide more color on that when we talk about the 2017 guidance in our discussion in January. We do think that the rate of penetration for biosimilar will be modest and there are several reasons for that. As we talked about before 70% patients are treated well with REMICADE. There is no interchangeability available, that's another factor, and we're already highly competitive environment with respect to biologics, anti-TNF therapy, as you know. Before any comment on [indiscernible], Joaquin, anything else you would like to add on overall penetration of biosimilars?"

We are confident that we have a strong plan based on what Dominic described before, there's been 2.6 million patients treated with REMICADE worldwide. There's no interchangeability and there's a clear patient and physician preference, so it's highly unlikely that you're going to be seeing patients that are stable in REMICADE switch. So that is 70% of the patients. At the same time, we have a strong patient assistance program, which will prove to be a market differentiator, and we are ready to compete in every channel trying to bring patients the most affordable option in every situation. So we feel well prepared to face the biosimilar. And as Dominic said, we are convinced that we will continue to grow our business in the face of biosimilar competition."

We not only feel that we're going to be able to grow in the phase of biosimilar, the pharmaceutical business overall, but we also are confident that we're going to be able to growth our immunology franchise in the phase of biosimilars. Let me give you some examples of why going into the 3 segments: Rheumatology, psoriasis and gastroenterology. In Rheumatology, SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA are doing very well. As a matter of fact, SIMPONI ARIA, it's already leading in new brand -- new to brand share in rheumatology in the U.S. and SIMPONI, it's gaining share in all international markets. We plan to file 2 line extensions of SIMPONI ARIA in ankylosing spondylitis and in psoriatic arthritis by 2017. And also we just filed sirukumab with EMEA, and we plan to file it here in the U.S. before the end of the year. So that gives us a strong confidence that where we want to be continue to grow in rheumatology. Then moving into psoriasis, STELARA continues to be the leading in new to brand share in the U.S. and it's leading in most markets internationally. Together with that, we plan to file Guselkumab, that we have presented very impressive data at the last EADV, we plan to file Guselkumab before the end of the year, so that's another reason why we feel real confident that we'll continue to grow in psoriasis. In Gastroenterology, which by the way, is for us is the largest and fastest-growing segment, we just had the approval of STELARA in current disease and we are now -- we're launched it in the U.S. and we anticipate of relaunching it in Europe pretty soon. So that is another reason why, which we believe that we're going to be able to continue to grow in immunology. So overall, we have line extensions, we have continuous penetration and also we have the filing of sirukumab and Guselkumab in the second half of the year."

And my comment was, well to the extent we have 5 major therapeutic areas today, if we decided that another major therapeutic area was of importance to us and wanted to get into that therapeutic area, and we thought we could add a lot to, but based on our overall scientific knowledge more broadly that I would see that perhaps being done not by necessary licensing strategy, but more of an acquisition type strategy.

And then finally, we plan to utilize market differentiators such as patient assistance programs that are going to enable affordability. So with these 3 components, we feel confident that we are going to be able to have a very strong plan to face the biosimilar. The second element of that overall is what I just described before, what are the elements that lead us to believe that we'll continue to grow immunology, too, and I described the different line extensions and NMEs that we have in the 3 areas: Rheumatology, gastroenterology and psoriasis.

So what we saw, David, this is through published sources, many of which are from the firms such as yours and many of the sales side that published. We saw actually utilization rates as depicted in hospital admissions and hospital surgical procedures with the first quarter of this year being the highest, by far, and then a slowdown in the second quarter, a slowdown even below the level at which most estimates we're depicting, we're forecasting. And then in the third quarter was even slower then the second quarter overall, but is a very marked difference in September. So once September hit, the data showed quite a rebound from the summer months and the rate of growth in September was actually faster than we saw in the first quarter, which is the highest growth quarter year-over-year in terms of penetration. Now whether that remains at that level or whether it's a rebound effect in the summer, we'll have to see. But I think this is all well chronicled in the multiple reports that many of you I'm sure have seen. So overall, I'd say we're now in a stable environment in hospital procedures. Going into '17, I express confidence in our Medical Device business growing faster and quite frankly, we have a plan for that business to return to growth at above market for the medical device sector and it's continuing to improve. What gives me confidence there is that the areas that we focus the most on, the growth platforms and priority platforms just this quarter, they grew at 9% and within those, 3 of those in particular, electrophysiology, energy and endocutters, each grew at double-digit growth. So we obviously have a very robust growth coming in the priority platforms, which we expect to continue and drive us to above-market growth in 2017."

So whether or not we do a major transaction will not be dependent on waiting for international tax reform. Obviously, we have plenty of borrowing capacity and obviously, any transaction that's done outside the U.S. will be an effective use of that OUS cash. And as you know, we've had the benefit of being able to structure transactions and effectively use of OUS cash in a tax efficient manner. And we did that with the [indiscernible]  Transaction, we've done recently with the 2 transaction that we recently announced. With respect to international tax reform and what we're hearing, I can tell you that I visit in Washington often and speak with members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee and the tax staffs are busily working and working very collaboratively with U.S. multinationals on an appropriate tax reform package. We think there's more bipartisan support now than there has been in the past. We think that often, we hear, as you mentioned, the benefit of investing in U.S. infrastructure as a result of those repatriated earnings coming back into the U.S., so that would be a positive. And we think that overall, the climate for international tax reform post the election quite frankly, is more positive than it's been in the last year or so. And then with respect to Proposition 61, there are several opponents to that proposition, and we will prefer to have pricing that is more related to outcomes, evidence-based medicine is something that we are advocates of and therefore, outcome-based pricing is a logical consequence of that. But Joaquin, any other thoughts on Proposition 61?"

As far as Proposition 61 as an example of that rhetoric, as Dominic said, different groups that opposed that measure that includes even better in groups and seniors and unions. The reason being it's unclear what the effects of Proposition 61 would be. It is clear that it will be difficult to operationalize and also would create some access barriers to patients.

And that is the same even regardless of size. I mean, obviously, size matters for a couple of reasons. One is that the asset may be well understood, the business may be well penetrated, the premium required for the asset may be excessive and therefore, to generate value for our shareholders will be a challenge. But it doesn't mean we wouldn't try to do that or we wouldn't look for areas where that may in fact be available for us. So that would be across any of the businesses. Within Consumer and Medical Devices, in particular, Consumer just like we have in pharma, we have specific areas of focus. We have 11 need states. The primary focus for us is growing internationally in emerging markets, so strong brands and emerging markets, a focus on over-the-counter medications and beauty space, particularly in Asia are of interest to us. We just did a recent transaction with Dr. Silabo in Japan where we have an interest in that Asian marketplace and utilizing that brand throughout broader, throughout Asia, beyond Japan where it's currently marketed just as an example of one. And the Medical Devices, as you know, we have a very strong presence in orthopedics and in general surgery. We keep looking for additional bolt-on acquisitions there, and we have a very strong electrophysiology business and cardiovascular, but there are other areas within cardiovascular that seem attractive, in structural heart in other areas, but the valuation will be something we'll always consider.

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. 
During the course of today's presentation, we will discuss a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide is an acknowledgment of those relationships. 
I would now like to review our results. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016, up 4.2% versus the third quarter of 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.3% and currency had a negative impact of 0.1%. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6.7% while regions outside the U.S. were up 1.5%, comprised of 1.7% operational growth, partially offset by negative impact of currency exchange rates of 0.2%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined 1.3%. You may recall that we highlighted growth in the second quarter of 2016 being favorably impacted by an inventory build, which did reverse in the third quarter. Europe grew by 3.2% while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 1.4%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 7.3% in the U.S. and 4.2% outside the U.S. Additionally, operations in Venezuela reduced reported sales growth. Worldwide, this impact was a reduction of 30 basis points; and outside the U.S., 70 basis points. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.53 versus $1.20 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $236 million and a charge of $175 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 12.2% and 12.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew 12.8%. 
Beginning with Consumer, let's now turn to segment highlights for the quarter. Please note that the percentages quoted for all segments represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.3 billion, increasing 0.1% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. sales were up 1.1% while sales outside the U.S. declined 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales fell 0.4% worldwide, with a decline of 1.5% in the U.S. and growth of 0.3% outside the U.S.  
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 110 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively, with the most pronounced impact occurring in Women's Health. Growth was driven by worldwide Skin Care and OTC sales outside the U.S. Baby Care experienced declines over the third quarter of 2015. 
Performance in the Consumer segment was negatively impacted by slower market growth and reductions of customer inventory levels. Overall, the impact of inventory reduction was approximately 3 points on Worldwide Consumer sales growth for the quarter, with the most pronounced effect on OTC and Skin Care results. Dominic will discuss these factors in further detail later in the call. 
OTC sales grew 1.8% worldwide. Results were driven by strong consumption in smoking cessation products across Europe and new product launches in Europe and Asia. U.S. sales growth due to share gains was partially offset by trade inventory levels impacting growth in the U.S. by approximately 10 points, where, as highlighted, for the third quarter of 2015, the business experienced launch build in pain, allergy and digestive health. Also, a weak allergy season in the U.S. during 2016 negatively impacted inventory levels in the third quarter of 2016. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from 13% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 49%, up from 44% a year ago. 
Skin Care grew 12.2% worldwide and 18.9% in the U.S. These results include the sales from the recent Vogue, NeoStrata acquisitions, which are captured in the U.S. O-U.S. results were driven by stocking of  Dabao products in China and share gains in Latin America. Inventory levels negatively impacted worldwide sales growth by 3 points. Successful marketing campaigns and new products continue to drive the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. Divestitures impacted sales growth in Wound Care/Other and Women's Health categories. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.4 billion increased 9.0%, with U.S. sales up 11.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.0%, driven by strong performance of new products as well as growth from our core products. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying worldwide sales growth was 10.7% as sales in the U.S. were up 13.0%; and outside the U.S., up 7.0%. Contributors to growth included Immunology products, REMICADE, SIMPONI and STELARA; Oncology products, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX; as well as INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/TRINZA and XARELTO. 
In Immunology, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA achieved strong growth in the U.S. due to market growth and increasing share for STELARA. The results reported for REMICADE export sales was driven entirely by a change in inventory levels accounting for approximately 90 points of growth. Specifically, there was an inventory build of approximately $55 million in the current period and $110 million impact from lower level inventories that we noted in the third quarter of 2015 results. 
Biosimilar competition continues to negatively impact performance of export sales. 
In Neuroscience, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/ TRINZA achieved strong results, with worldwide sales growth of 21% due primarily to increased market share. As expected, during the quarter, we saw the impact from generic entries for INVEGA tablets in the U.S. 
In Oncology, strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. Sales increased 92% worldwide, and IMBRUVICA remains the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second-line CLL and MCL. 
Outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Canada, in the G5 and has recently launched in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. 
ZYTIGA sales grew 5.3% worldwide. In the U.S., market growth was essentially flat while market share was up almost 2 points sequentially. Sales outside the U.S. were tied to share gains in Japan and adoption in China since the launch in January of this year. 
DARZALEX continues to gain strong acceptance as a treatment for multiple myeloma and contributed approximately 2 points of Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales growth. 
Turning to Cardiovascular and metabolics. XARELTO continued strong share performance, with TRx market share up 1.7 points versus Q3 of 2015 to 17.5%. Warfarin represents approximately 55% of the total market, down from 62% in the third quarter of 2015. XARELTO continues to be broadly reimbursed, with over 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product copay. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales declined 3%, with the U.S. down 8.7% due to an increase in price discounts. Some of the increase in discounts is attributable to higher copay program cost in the quarter. While the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was up approximately 5%, TRx share was essentially flat to the third quarter of 2015. TRx share with endocrinologists was approximately 11% and approximately 6% with primary care. 
I'll now review the results of the Medical Device segment. Worldwide Medical Device segment sales of $6.2 billion increased 0.7% with U.S. sales increasing 1.4% and sales outside the U.S. decreasing 0.2%. 
As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 3.1% worldwide, with the U.S. up 2.3% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Additionally, the devaluation of Venezuela impacted growth worldwide by 10 basis points and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points. 
Growth was driven by electrophysiology, Advanced Surgery, Vision Care and Orthopaedics, slightly offset by general surgery and Diabetes Care. Electrophysiology within Cardiovascular grew 16% worldwide, driven by continued share gains in the U.S. and Europe as the atrial fibrillation procedure market increases. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by joint reconstruction and U.S. trauma. Pricing pressure continued across all major categories but was partially offset by positive mix in trauma and spine, continued success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees and the  CORAIL primary stem in hips contributed to the sales results. 
Within Advanced Surgery, endocutters grew 14%, energy was up 10% and biosurgicals up 7%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, closed in the second quarter of this year, also contributed modestly to growth. 
Vision Care sales were higher by 5.5% worldwide as new products launched late last year continued on an upward trajectory across all regions. Worldwide general surgery declined by approximately 2% due to discontinuing certain products in Women's Health and hernia, partially offset by both market growth and share gains in sutures. Competitive pressures and price erosion continue to impact Diabetes Care. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2016. To assist with your models, this slide provides you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, to inform you about the state of the Pharmaceutical business and the progress made since our May 2015 Business Review Day. Joaquin?"
139677,381738381,1056317,"Johnson & Johnson, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson.",1845,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson. Our market-leading innovative medicines are the foundation of our strong performance, with the vast majority of their growth coming from volume gains. We continue to pursue significant growth opportunities in terms of both penetration within existing indications and planned line extensions. 
Additionally, we have launched DARZALEX, the first of our 10 potential billion-dollars-plus NMEs. As a result, we remain confident that we'll continue to deliver strong growth through 2019 despite biosimilar competition and market dynamics. Our success is a result of our strong track record of execution. Our industry-leading pipeline has delivered 12 NMEs since 2011 and 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations since 2013. And for the fourth year, we are proud to have been named the #1 company in R&D and commercial productive innovation. 
Our focused execution has delivered 11 in-market, billion-dollars-plus brands. 10 of these brands are growing, and 6 of them are growing double digit. Cumulatively, sales from our medicines launched since 2011 are the second highest of any pharmaceutical company. Our R&D and commercial capabilities are a proven strong foundation for future growth. 
First, we will continue to focus on driving volume growth across our current market-leading brands through clinical differentiation. Second, we will accelerate the growth of these in-market brands through approximately 40 potential line extensions. Critically, 10 of these line extensions have more than $0.5 billion potential. Third, as we shared last year, we have a [indiscernible] pipeline investing in 10 potential billion-dollar-plus NMEs planned to be filed through 2019. Of these, we anticipate 5 to deliver significant growth opportunities in the near term. 
Since 2015, our expectations around these near-term opportunities have crystallized. Our latest information provides higher certainty that these products will succeed delivering higher value than originally anticipated. DARZALEX, launched last year, is significantly outperforming expectations. According to your own models, it is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar brand. Sirukumab has just been filed in the U.S. and Europe. Guselkumab has just had very positive data versus Humira presented at the EADV, and we anticipate filing for psoriasis before year-end. 
Apalutamide has a broad clinical development program in both pre-metastatic and metastatic prostate cancer. We also are investigating it in combination with ZYTIGA and with our newly licensed PARP inhibitor, niraparib. Finally, esketamine is already in Phase III and recently received a second Breakthrough Therapy designation. Bill will provide additional clinical details on these near-term opportunities shortly. 
Finally, it is important to note that these 3 strategies will prepare us to deliver robust growth beyond 2019, paving the way for more than 25 potential next-generation NMEs in the 2020 to 2024 time frame. 
The strength of our in-market portfolio, complemented by our near-term line extensions and NME launches, will be more than offset upcoming headwinds, including those anticipated for REMICADE. 
We are fully prepared to execute a focused biosimilar readiness plan. Yesterday, the launch of a U.S. biosimilar to REMICADE was announced for later this year. However, the appeals process is still ongoing, and we believe any commercial launch of a biosimilar remains at risk. 
Biosimilars are very different from generics. For example, in Canada, Australia and Brazil, where there is already biosimilar competition to REMICADE, we have maintained more than 90% volume share. Our U.S. commercial team is ready for a potential biosimilar launch. 
I'm confident in our strategy for 3 reasons. First, with no biosimilar approved for interchangeability, REMICADE's significant long-term safety data, a strong advocacy from patients and clear physician preference means that the 70% of patients who are stable on REMICADE are highly unlikely to switch. Second, our patient assistance programs provide a leading market differentiator. Third, we are confident that we can continue to provide a cost-effective option in all channels. The current market is extremely competitive, and REMICADE ASP is already significantly lower than the list price 
Additionally, in developing innovative contracts, we can utilize the full breadth of our portfolio. 
Our Immunology franchise remains poised to grow through 2019. We have a strong market position and a deep near-term pipeline. Let me give you some examples. Already in rheumatoid arthritis, SIMPONI ARIA is the fastest-growing IV product in the U.S. and has higher new-to-brand share than REMICADE. Outside of the U.S., we continue to gain share with SIMPONI, too. Additionally, we plan to file 2 line extensions for SIMPONI ARIA in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Together with the recent submissions of sirukumab for the approval in the U.S. and Europe, we will further strengthen our leading position in Rheumatology. 
Turning to psoriasis. STELARA continues to be the #1 biologic in new-to-brand share in the U.S. and maintains clear share leadership in key markets internationally. One of our 10 potential billion-dollars-plus brands, Guselkumab, is expected to provide a significant boost to our leadership in psoriasis, and Bill will share more on this important upcoming filing. 
Finally, moving to Gastroenterology. The most exciting news is the recent launch of STELARA for Crohn's disease in the U.S. and its anticipated launch in Europe. There is tremendous unmet need in this debilitating disease. For example, 70% to 80% of Crohn's patients on anti-TNFs are not in remission at 1 year, and the patient population is expected to grow 50% over the next decade. This is the first in a series of line extensions, including UC, which will drive more than 35% of STELARA performance by 2019. 
Moving now to Cardiovascular and metabolics. INVOKANA continues to be a standout performer. Globally, it is the leading  SGLT2 inhibitor and the third largest known insulin diabetes medicine. Put into perspective, in the U.S., there have been more prescriptions filled for INVOKANA and INVOKAMET than all other  SGLT2 inhibitors combined. A total of more than 1.3 million patients are treated in the U.S. alone. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, INVOKANA's performance dipped this quarter due to temporary increased costs to administer copay patient access programs. However, I want to emphasize that this was a transitory event. Our return to growth will be driven by INVOKANA's strong access position across U.S. commercial plans and Medicare Part D and the recent approval of INVOKAMET XR. We are expecting our cardiovascular outcomes data to read out in mid-2017. 
XARELTO is another market leader in our Cardiovascular and metabolics portfolio, delivering double-digit growth every year since its launch in 2011. To date, XARELTO has already treated more than 3.8 million patients in the U.S. and is supported by an extremely robust published real-world dataset, including evidence from more than 91,000 patients demonstrating consistency with our clinical trials. As a result, it is broadly reimbursed, with more than 95% Medicare and commercial patients on formulary at the lowest branded copay. 
These considerable achievements are just a start. Approximately, 54% of potential patients are still utilizing Warfarin, presenting significant growth opportunities in current indications.  Additionally, there are 8 new indications seeking clinical studies underway as part of EXPLORER, the largest clinical development program within the anticoagulant space. If successful, the potential patient pull could increase more than fivefold. 
Turning to Neuroscience. INVEGA TRINZA is a growth catalyst for the entire long-acting therapy franchise. Notably, INVEGA TRINZA is the fastest-growing LAT in the U.S. It has also contributed to growing INVEGA SUSTENNA scripts 26% in the 13 months since launch. 
Significant opportunities for growth remain as only 11% of patients are treated with LATs in the U.S. 
Celebrating 10 years of innovation this year, our HIV portfolio has achieved approximately 20% growth annually and cumulative sales of more than $15 billion. Today, 25% of patients in developed markets are treated with a J&J HIV medicine. Our class-leading portfolio has benefited more than 1 million patients, and this legacy will continue with upcoming line extensions. When Prezista first launched, it was part of a 6-tablet regimen. The first upcoming line extension, darunavir single-tablet regimen, will reduce this number to 1, improving adherence and safety. Also, we expect 2 rilpivirine fixed-dose combinations, one with Gilead's TAF and another one with ViiV's dolutegravir, that will drive additional growth for 2019. 
Finally, let's move to our fastest-growing therapeutic area, Oncology. IMBRUVICA has led the recent growth of our oncology franchise, accelerating from a record-breaking global launch to clear market share leadership in total patients in the first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Today, IMBRUVICA is reimbursed in 41 countries with world-class market access. Since launch, an additional 6 indications have been approved, and we anticipate an additional 7 new registrations ahead, 4 of which have $500 million-plus potential.  Together with a number of promising combination therapies in development, these new indications will usher in a very exciting future for IMBRUVICA. 
IMBRUVICA's leadership in Oncology is mirrored by our recently launched asset, DARZALEX. Only 3 months after its launch, DARZALEX became the #1 prescribed therapy in fourth-line and later multiple myeloma. From a launch-aligned sales perspective, DARZALEX has continued to far outpace its competitors. This first-in-class medicine has since been improved in the EU and Canada and is driving positive share trends in earlier therapy lines in the U.S. We are confident DARZALEX can become the standard of care in multiple myeloma and help even more than the 10,000 patients who have benefited already worldwide. 
Growth will continue to accelerate with the anticipated approval in second-line patient populations and the impressive data from the recently published CASTOR and POLLUX studies. An additional 5 Phase III trials are currently underway as well as development of a subcutaneous formulation. As Bill will detail, we have also seen some positive data that DARZALEX may be effective outside of multiple myeloma. What should be clear today is that all of our current market-leading medicines have significant potential for continued volume growth. 
Additionally, we have a multitude of promising potential line extensions across every therapeutic area, approximately 40 in total, by 2019. Of these, 10 have more than $0.5 billion potential. The remaining 30 potential line extensions are not insignificant.  Cumulatively, the line extensions for XARELTO and INVOKANA have the potential to drive $3 billion to $5 billion in incremental sales for the Cardiovascular franchise. We believe these new indications will be a key driver of our growth through 2019 even in the context of biosimilars and market dynamics. 
In my 6 years leading our Pharmaceutical sector, I have never been more excited and more positive about our future as I am today. We have significant growth potential throughout our portfolio with market-leading brands; 40 anticipated line extensions, 10 of which have more than $0.5 billion potential; and 10 NMEs with more than $1 billion potential to be filed by 2019. Combined, these factors will ensure that we continue to outpace the industry growth through 2019. 
It is now my privilege to turn the call over to Dr. William Hait, who heads up our R&D organization. Bill will provide additional detail about our pipeline that is set to deliver this groundbreaking treatments. Bill?"
139677,381738381,1056317,"Johnson & Johnson, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Hait, and I'm the Global Head of Research and Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen, we believe that by continuing to execu",2081,"Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Hait, and I'm the Global Head of Research and Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. 
As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen, we believe that by continuing to execute our current strategy, we will consistently deliver valuable products to patients with serious unmet medical needs and that this will sustain our leadership in the pharmaceutical industry. Our strength is built on a blend of deep internal scientific expertise with industry-leading collaborations through the work of Johnson & Johnson innovation. We continue to find efficiencies that produce savings that we invest in our pipeline, and our strategic focus creates an enviable track record. We are delivering against our anticipated 2015 to 2019 NME and LE results that will produce a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. For these reasons and the results I will describe today, Janssen has become one of the most productive and most respected pharmaceutical companies. 
Before I share with you the details of our pipeline progress, let me explain how and why we have been able to sustain industry-leading results. Our 5 end-to-end therapeutic areas span basic drug discovery through launch and life cycle management. This structure produces a focused, seamless R&D organization, promotes efficient phase transitions and ensures dedication to major unmet medical needs where there is compelling, translatable science. These 5 therapeutic areas concentrate on 11 high-priority disease areas through our disease area strongholds, nimble and efficient biotech-like teams embedded in the broader context of the therapeutic areas. Each disease area stronghold undergoes rigorous triennial review by our external scientific advisory board, receives a priority score and proportional funding of discovery and early development. 
Our therapeutic areas are supported by substantial research capabilities through our centers of excellence, including biotechnology; medicinal chemistry; diagnostics; clinical operations; and, most recently, oligonucleotide and nucleic acid chemistry, expertise garnered through the acquisition of Alios. Assets that transition into late development are prioritized into 3 categories to ensure that our investment of resources align with our most promising targets. Currently, our top 2 categories, which represent 40% of our assets and 80% of our overall late-development value, receives 60% of our investment. It is through this approach that we remain at the top of the industry in successful phase transitions and speed to market. 
Janssen has achieved considerable success, and we are poised to continuously deliver near- and long-term growth. Our balanced investment across all aspects of our pipeline allows us to enjoy a constant flow of important new data. We launched 12 new products since 2011. We received the most FDA approvals from 2011 to 2016 as well as 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations. 
For 4 consecutive years, we have been named the innovation leader by IDEA Pharma and became the partner of choice through the work of J&J innovation. And for the third consecutive year, Fortune Magazine ranked Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson #1 in the pharmaceutical category on its annual World's Most Admired Companies list. Our unwavering commitment to global public health is demonstrated by SIRTURO, the first new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis in over 40 years; as well as our work on new, convenient HIV combinations; the first prime-boost Ebola vaccine using Crucell's adenoviral vector and Bavarian Nordic's MVA vector; as well as new chewable forms of mebendazole for children with worm infestations. 
As Joaquin mentioned and as we highlighted at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review Day, between 2015 and 2019, we plan on filing approximately 10 new drugs, each with a potential for greater than $1 billion in peak year sales and 40 line extensions. This slide highlights 10 of these, anticipated to be filed in the 2015 to 2019 time period, with peak year sales potential greater than $0.5 billion 
In addition, our early pipeline is rich in important assets that have the potential to file between 2020 and 2024. We are on track to deliver our anticipated NME and LE results through a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. Since May 2015, we garnered 3 new product approvals and filings, with the fourth, Guselkumab, anticipated this year, and we achieved 16 significant line extensions. 
Now let me use our time together to describe in greater detail some of the progress we have made since our May 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. Oncology is the newest of our 5 therapeutic areas and achieved industry-leading growth based on our development of several first-in-class drugs, including ZYTIGA, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. Our hem malignancies disease area is anchored by IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. 
IMBRUVICA, the first BTK inhibitor for the treatment of certain B-cell malignancies, received 4 FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations. IMBRUVICA was recently approved for frontline use, based on the unprecedented results in previously untreated CLL patients reported in the RESONATE-2 study published in the December 15 issue of the New England Journal. As shown on this slide, treatment with ibrutinib decreased progression or death from CLL by 84% compared to chlorambucil and demonstrated a similar improvement in overall survival. 
DARZALEX, the first monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma, received 2 FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations and was approved almost 4 months ahead of its PDUFA date in double-refractory myeloma. As shown on this slide, combination therapy with DARZALEX delivered impressive results in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. The CASTOR and POLLUX studies demonstrated that the addition of DARZALEX to Velcade  and dexamethasone or REVLIMID and dexamethasone, respectively, produced a greater than 60% decrease in risk of progression or death as compared to that of Vel/dex or REV/dex alone, both of these studies were published in the New England Journal. This month, the FDA granted priority review for daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or bortezomib and  dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma with a PDUFA date in February 2017. 
Our prostate cancer disease area is anchored by ZYTIGA, the first CYP17 inhibitor for the treatment of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and is approved for both pre- and post-chemotherapy indications. Furthermore, we are developing ARN-509, now known as apalutamide, a more potent next-generation androgen receptor antagonist that shows a high degree of safety and efficacy in castrate-resistant prostate cancer. As seen in these figures, apalutamide decreased PSA by a median of 85% in patients with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer after 12 weeks of treatment. The maximum PSA response, shown on the right-hand figure, was achieved in 94% of patients. 
Earlier this year, we licensed niraparib from TESARO to obtain a highly potent and selective PARP inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer patients with DNA repair defects for use in combination with ZYTIGA or apalutamide. Niraparib is in Phase II clinical trials and currently planned to be filed by 2019. This portfolio of assets gives us confidence that we will continue to bring great results to patients with prostate cancer for many years to come. 
While we did not explicitly address immuno-oncology during our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review, we continue to make significant progress in this area. Over the last 5 years, we invested in 4 critical areas, including vaccines, T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell redirection and myeloid mechanisms of actions. We currently have 15 immuno-oncology assets in development, including 8 that are in the clinic. 
Recently, we uncovered an important additional mechanism of action of DARZALEX to be immune-mediated through the depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid in lymphoid populations, including a previously unrecognized super-suppressor, CD38+ T-reg population; as well as activation of CD8 and CD4+ effector T-cells. These results provide the impetus for exploring DARZALEX in indications beyond hem malignancies in solid tumors. 
Our Immunology therapeutic area continues to deliver extraordinary products for patients with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. STELARA was the first IL-12, IL-23 monoclonal antibody introduced for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. It was recently approved in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in the U.S, received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency and offers new options for adult patients with IBD. 
Guselkumab is a first-in-class selective anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody that demonstrated significant efficacy versus placebo in superiority compared with the antitumor necrosis factor, adalimumab, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The VOYAGE study, whose results are shown in this slide, randomly assigned 750 patients to receive guselkumab, adalimumab or placebo followed by guselkumab in the 2:2:1 ratio. Patients treated with guselkumab achieved a significantly greater chance of obtaining a PASI 90 score compared to that of patients treated with adalimumab or placebo at week 16, and the advantage over adalimumab was sustained through week 48. The high degree of efficacy of guselkumab, the less intensive dosing regimen and the potential for a STELARA-like safety profile makes guselkumab highly competitive with newly launched anti-IL-17 antibodies. We plan to file for psoriasis this year and advance guselkumab into Phase III for patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Neuroscience is a historically strong area for Janssen since Dr. Paul Janssen and colleagues developed haloperidol, the first medication for schizophrenia. We have built on Dr. Paul's legacy with the development of next-generation antipsychotics and pioneered the development of long-acting injectables that help improve compliance for this difficult-to-treat patient population, most recently with the approval of INVEGA TRINZA, an every-3-month injectable formulation. 
Today, we focus our neuroscience investment in drugs that treat serious mood disorders, including depression, suicidality and Alzheimer's disease. Esketamine, an intranasally-delivered enantiomer of ketamine, produced groundbreaking results in major depressive disorder, with onset of action measured in hours to days rather than weeks to months. There's an alarming increase in suicides, both in the U.S. and globally, more than 41,000 each year in the U.S. alone. It's a tragic issue that's emerging as a major health priority. As shown in this slide, esketamine ameliorated suicidal ideation within 4 hours and sustained this effect for over 3 weeks, leading to its second FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation. 
Infectious Diseases is one of our most exciting and important areas in investment for future growth, where we focus on respiratory infections and hepatitis. We are pursuing an aggressive strategy for the cure of hepatitis C. We recently reported a 100% SVR12 in patients with genotype 1, with both an 8- and 6-week duration of treatment using a 3DAA combination of OLYSIO, AL-335 and  odalasvir.
Based on this exceptional data, we are moving the 3DAA regimen into late-development studies. 
Our Cardiovascular and Metabolism therapeutic area developed both INVOKANA and XARELTO in partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe and Bayer, respectively. New line extensions are designed to continue to bring value to these 2 first-in-class drugs. With XARELTO, we are pursuing studies in congestive heart failure, embolic stroke of undetermined source, VTE prevention in medically ill patients, infrainguinal peripheral artery disease, VTE prevention in cancer patients and an acute coronary syndrome. We anticipate readouts from 2 INVOKANA cardiovascular outcomes studies by mid-2017, which we believe will further strengthen the importance of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in the treatment of patients with diabetes. We are also studying the role of INVOKANA in diabetic kidney disease and plan to address obesity and prediabetes. 
In summary, at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are executing a clearly defined innovation strategy that drives value to patients around the world. We are on track to meeting our anticipated results described in 2015. We are producing the cadence of transformational innovations that are leading to exceptional results. We are a leader in productivity, approvals and FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations, and we are one of the fastest-growing top 10 pharmaceutical companies. 
We have had the most U.S. FDA approvals in the last 5 years, 2011 to 2016, and 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations. We anticipate filing approximately 10 NMEs between 2015 and 2019, each with greater than $1 billion peak year sales potential.  We have approximately 40 planned line extension filings anticipated between 2015 and 2019, several with greater than $500 million in peak year sales potential, supported by a steady flow of clinical data that drive better patient results. Finally, we take pride in delivering years of lives saved and better quality of life for our first credo responsibility to the doctors, nurses and patients who use our products. 
Now before I turn it over to Dominic, for your reference, let me leave you with a current overview of our pipeline across our 5 therapeutic areas. Dominic will now continue with an update of the company's financial results."

As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we make good progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmace",2502,"Thank you, Bill and Joaquin,  and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we make good progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. With great leaders like Joaquin and Bill, our strong in-market performance driven by excellent commercial capabilities and our robust R&D pipeline, you can see why we remain confident that our Pharmaceuticals business will continue to be a major driver of growth moving forward. 
I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're pleased with our overall results. As you know, we had a strong start to the year, and as a result, last quarter, we increased our sales and earnings guidance. I'm happy to say we're tracking with those higher expectations while continuing to invest in our business. As you've heard, our Pharmaceutical business delivered strong results this quarter, with underlying operational growth of 10.7%. 
Let me now provide some comments on our other businesses. In our Consumer business, we continued to gain share this quarter. However, as reported by Nielsen, the industry saw a slowdown in many markets, with category growth rates in 2016 about half of the category growth rate we saw in Q3 of 2015. As Joe noted, our sales growth for the quarter was also impacted by lower trade inventory levels. These lower levels are the result of inventory builds in Q3 2015, as we discussed at that time, due to relaunches of certain products as well as inventory reduction programs being implemented at some of the larger retailers this past quarter. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year and this overall impact from trade inventory reductions, overall consumer growth was nearly 4%. Based on increasing share trend of our brands, we expect trade levels to align with consumption going forward. 
In Medical Devices, consistent with some recent analyst reports about the market, we believe the industry experienced lower hospital admissions and procedure rates during the mid-summer months. 
Late in the quarter, several reports showed higher levels of activity, and in fact, the data that we recently saw published for September looked encouraging. Additionally, we are very pleased to see our priority platforms continue to deliver robust growth of nearly 9%, with some at double digits, as Joe mentioned earlier. 
Overall, Hospital Medical Devices' operational growth, excluding acquisition and divestitures, was approximately 4% this quarter. 
In the Consumer Medical Device businesses, we saw continued price erosion in our Diabetes business. However, in our Vision Care business, we saw good operational growth of 5.5%. 
So in summary, as we previously discussed, in 2015, our underlying operational growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestiture as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days that we saw in 2015, was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continued to accelerate our growth, and we delivered strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 5.9% for the third quarter of 2016. 
Our sales were above analyst estimates, as were earnings, due to significantly higher pretax operating margins. As you may remember, our guidance from January included a more than 200 basis point increase in our 2016 pretax operating margin, on an adjusted basis. We have attained that level year-to-date while continuing to invest on our business, and we remain comfortable with that forecast for the full year as we continue to execute on the restructuring activities in our Medical Device businesses while also investing in growth. 
As you know, in September, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics . We expect this transaction to close in Q1 of 2017. So for 2016, the transaction is expected to have no impact to our adjusted earnings and is not expected to impact our guidance. For 2017, again assuming a Q1 close, the transaction is expected to be positive to sales growth and immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. We are excited about Abbott Medical Optics' strong and differentiated surgical ophthalmic portfolio, particularly in cataract surgery. That, coupled with our world-leading ACUVUE contact lens business, will help us become a broad-based leader in Vision Care. 
Now I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the remainder of 2016. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2016. Our operational sales growth this quarter was 4.3%, and when we exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of hep C sales and the overall impact that Venezuela had, it was strong at more than 6%. 
If you direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the intangible amortization expense of about $250 million and the anticipated special charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring plan. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is, therefore, $1.68, which exceeded the mean of the analysts' estimates, as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 12.8% versus the prior year.  Adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis was the same as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a few moments and talk about other items of the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 30 basis points mostly due to unfavorable transaction currency impacts, partly offset by favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 290 basis points lower as compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to overall good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2%, lower by 40 basis points due primarily to lower milestone payments, partly offset by increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipeline. 
Our pretax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32% or 310 basis points higher than the third quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing and administrative expenses and less R&D expenses. As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progressed throughout the year, and through 9 months, we have achieved a 220 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability, consistent with the expectations we communicated to you throughout the year. 
Interest expense net of interest income was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $50 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of approximately $400 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $200 million compared to a net gain of approximately $400 million in the prior year period, which included a higher level of gains from divestitures. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7% compared to 20% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, and it reflects the current mix of our businesses and the impact from a new accounting standard relating to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which we discussed in our call in July. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise improved by 220 basis points versus the third quarter of 2015. You will notice significant improvements in margins for the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical businesses.
Last year, our Consumer business benefited from a gain in the sale of SPLENDA, and you're seeing that reflected in their lower margin this quarter, although still had very healthy rates.
As you can see on the next slide, on a year-to-date basis, we are pleased to see solid improvement in our consumer margin, and we remain confident it will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015.
Overall, we expect adjusted income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in pretax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I'd like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. I'd like to start with some of the items that we know you are -- you find difficult to forecast. 
Let's start with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $13 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27 billion of debt. 
Through the end of the third quarter, we completed nearly 60% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year.
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $450 million. There's a slight tightening of the range. 
Regarding other income and expense as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corp, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as a gain, ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the underlying activity. This impact will be offset by a lower tax rate.
And now for taxes, we're very comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 18% to 18.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to a higher level of income and lower tax jurisdictions. 
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. Our sales range for 2016 continues to remain the same whether or not a biosimilar REMICADE launches this year in the U.S.
Additionally, we do not anticipate biosimilar or generic competition this year for PROCRIT, ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, but as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be first based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We've also provided an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
We continue to be comfortable with the sales guidance we provided last quarter, reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This was a result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of between approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisition, divestitures and hepatitis C, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year even after adjusting for the shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1% on sales growth. This is consistent with our previous guidance as major currencies had not significantly fluctuated since our last update. 
So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of positive 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion, consistent with our previous guidance. 
And now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range between $6.71 and $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 8% to 9%. And this is a narrowing of the range. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 are to remain where they were as of last week, the negative impact to EPS would be approximately $0.03, consistent with our previous guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS range ranging from $6.68 to $6.73 per share, which again is a narrowing of our previous guidance with a midpoint that is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance range. 
Finally, just a reminder of some dynamics you will see in our fourth quarter results this year in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2015, we had additional shipping days based on when our year-end closed, and that contributed approximately 4 points of sales growth in the fourth quarter last year. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter last year, we closed on the Cordis divestiture. And based on our latest guidance for 2016, we will have significantly lower level of other income from divestitures as compared to the prior year. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our performance so far this year, and we remain confident and optimistic about our future full year growth for 2016. Specifically, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6%, a higher level that we experienced last year on a comparable basis. 
Our adjusted pretax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out on our guidance of more than a 200-basis point improvement over the prior year. We narrowed our guidance and increased the midpoint for adjusted operational EPS growth, which remains strong in the range of $6.71 to $6.76 per share, with the growth rate of 8% to 9%. And we are very well positioned to seize the opportunities in our strong pipelines to continue fueling our future growth. 
Now I'd like to turn things back to Joe for the Q&A portion of the call. Joe?"

So Dominic, I wanted to focus on the 2017, the puts and takes. Dominic, at our health care conference in September, you said the only real delta from 2016 to 2017 is the rate at which a biosimilar REMICADE could penetrate the market, assuming Pfizer launches at risk, and you don't think the penetration will be dramatic. I took that to mean that you feel that you can grow sales in 2017 at a similar rate to 2016 minus the impact from biosimilar REMICADE. So my questions are, is that the right interpretation? What gives you the confidence that this level of growth will continue? And second, the biosimilar for Neupogen captured about 7% in the market in year 1. Would you expect inflector penetration to be less than that? Any color that you can give on the expected penetration would be helpful. And I do have one follow-up on pharma."

So I think that is a good way to characterize it. We'll provide more color on that when we talk about the 2017 guidance in our discussion in January. We do think that the rate of penetration for a biosimilar will be modest, and there are several reasons for that. As we talked about before, 70% of the patients are treated well with REMICADE. There is no interchangeability available, that's another factor, and we're already in a highly competitive environment with respect to biologics, anti-TNF therapies, as you know. Before any comment on Neupogen, Joaquin, anything else you want to add to overall penetration of biosimilars?"

We are confident that we have a strong plan based on what Dominic described before. There's been 2.6 million patients treated with REMICADE worldwide. There's no interchangeability and there's a clear patient and physician preference, so it's highly unlikely that you're going to be seeing patients that are stable in the REMICADE switched. So that is 70% of the patients. At the same time, we have a strong patient assistance program, which will prove to be a market differentiator, and we are ready to compete in every channel, trying to bring patients the most affordable option in every situation. So we feel well prepared to face the biosimilar. And as Dominic said, we are convinced that we will continue to grow our business in the face of biosimilar competition."

I described part of the reasons for optimists during my conversation before, we not only feel that we are going to be able to grow in the face of biosimilar of the pharmaceutical business, overall, but we also are confident that we're going to be able to grow our immunology franchise in the phase of biosimilars. Let me give you some examples of why going into the 3 segments: Rheumatology, Psoriasis and Gastroenterology. In Rheumatology, SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA are doing very well. As a matter of fact, SIMPONI ARIA, it's already leading in new brand -- in new to brand share in Rheumatology in the U.S. And SIMPONI, it's gaining share in all international markets. We plan to file 2 line extensions of SIMPONI ARIA in ankylosing spondylitis and in psoriatic arthritis by 2017. And also we just filed sirukumab with EMEA, and we're planning to file it here in the U.S. before the end of the year. So that gives us a strong confidence that we're going to be continuing to grow in Rheumatology. Then moving into psoriasis, STELARA continues to be the leading in new to brand share in the U.S. and it's leading in most markets internationally. Together with that, we plan to file guselkumab, that we have presented very impressive data at the last EADV, we plan to file guselkumab before the end of the year. So that's another reason why we feel real confident that we will continue to grow in psoriasis. Finally, gastroenterology, which by the way is, for us, is the largest and fastest-growing segment, we just had the approval of STELARA in Crohn's disease and we are now launching it in the U.S. and we anticipate to be launching it in Europe pretty soon. So that is another reason why, which we believe that we're going to be able to continue to grow in immunology. So overall, we have line extensions, with our continuous penetration and also we have the filing of sirukumab and guselkumab in the second half of the year."

And my comment was, well, to the extent we have 5 major therapeutic areas today, if we decided that another major therapeutic area was of importance to us and we wanted to get into that therapeutic area and we felt we could add a lot to it, but based on our overall scientific knowledge more broadly, that I would see that perhaps being done not by necessary a licensing strategy, but more of an acquisition type strategy. So it would enhance the overall portfolio of Johnson & Johnson's Pharmaceutical business beyond the current therapeutic areas that we currently are in. And by doing that, that might require a more significant acquisition than we've been doing in the pharma business. So that's the context for that."

So what we saw, David, this is through published sources, many of which are from firms such as yours and many of the sell side that published. We saw -- actually, utilization rates, as depicted in hospital admissions and hospital surgical procedures, with the first quarter of this year being the highest, by far, and then a slowdown in the second quarter, a slowdown even below the level at which most estimates we're depicting, we're forecasting. And then in the third quarter was even slower than the second quarter, overall. But there's a very marked difference in September. So once September hit, the data showed quite a rebound from the summer months. And the rate of growth in September was actually faster than we saw in the first quarter, which was the highest growth quarter year-over-year in terms of penetration. Now whether that remains at that level or whether it's a rebound effect from the summer, we'll have to see. But I think this is all well chronicled in the multiple reports that many of you, I'm sure, have seen. So overall, I'd say we're now in a stable environment in hospital procedures. Going into '17, I express confidence in our Medical Device business growing faster, and quite frankly, we have a plan for that business to return to growth at above market for the medical device sector, and it's continuing to improve. What gives me confidence there is that the areas that we focus the most on, the growth  platforms and priority platforms just this quarter, they grew at 9%, and within those, 3 of those, in particular, electrophysiology, energy and endocutters, each grew at double-digit growth. So we obviously have a very robust growth coming in the priority platforms, which we expect to continue and drive us to above-market growth in 2017."

And we did that with the Synthes Transaction, we've done that recently with the 2 transaction that we recently announced. With respect to international tax reform and what we're hearing, I can tell you that I visit in Washington often and speak with members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, and the tax staffs are busily working and working very collaboratively with U.S. multinationals on an appropriate tax reform package. We think there's more bipartisan support now than there has been in the past. We think that often, we hear, as you mentioned, the benefit of investing in U.S. infrastructure as a result of those repatriated earnings coming back into the U.S., so that would be a positive. And we think that, overall, the climate for international tax reform, post the election quite frankly, is more positive than it's been in the last year or so. And then with respect to Proposition 61, there are several opponents to that proposition, and we would prefer to have pricing that is more related to outcomes, evidence-based medicine is something that we are advocates of and therefore, outcome-based pricing is a logical consequence of that.

But it doesn't mean we wouldn't try to do that or we wouldn't look for areas where that may, in fact, be available for us. So that would be across any of the businesses. Within Consumer and Medical Devices, in particular, Consumer, just like we have in Pharma, we have specific areas of focus. We have 11 need states. The primary focus for us is growing internationally in emerging markets, so strong brands and emerging markets, a focus on over-the-counter medications and beauty space, particularly in Asia, are of interest to us. We just did a recent transaction with Dr.Ci:Labo in Japan, where we have an interest in that Asian marketplace and utilizing that brand throughout broader, throughout Asia, beyond Japan where it's currently marketed just as an example of one. And in Medical Devices, as you know, we have a very strong presence in orthopedics and in general surgery. We keep looking for additional bolt-on acquisitions there. And we have a very strong electrophysiology business in cardiovascular, but there are other areas within cardiovascular that seem attractive, in structural heart, and other areas, but the valuation would be something that we'll always consider.

I'm Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the review of our business results for the third quarter of 2016.  Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Chief Finan",1967,"Good morning. I'm Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the review of our business results for the third quarter of 2016.  Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Chief Financial Officer; Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; and Dr. Bill Hait, Global Head of Pharmaceutical Research and Development. 
A few logistics before we discuss the results. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. 
I will begin today's presentation by briefly reviewing the third quarter sales and earnings results for the corporation and sales results for each of our 3 business segments. Next, Joaquin and Bill will provide an update on our Pharmaceutical business, specifically highlighting how our focus on innovation to address unmet medical needs translates to current and future strong performance. Dominic will then provide some additional commentary on the results, review the income statement and discuss guidance for 2016. Lastly, we will open the call to your questions. We expect today's call to last approximately 90 minutes. 
Included with the press release issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made here today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. 
During the course of today's presentation, we will discuss a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide is an acknowledgment of those relationships. 
I would now like to review our results. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016, up 4.2% versus the third quarter of 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.3% and currency had a negative impact of 0.1%. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6.7% while regions outside the U.S. were up 1.5%, comprised of 1.7% operational growth, partially offset by negative impact of currency exchange rates of 0.2%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined 1.3%. You may recall that we highlighted growth in the second quarter of 2016 being favorably impacted by an inventory build, which did reverse in the third quarter. Europe grew by 3.2% while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 1.4%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 7.3% in the U.S. and 4.2% outside the U.S. Additionally, operations in Venezuela reduced reported sales growth. Worldwide, this impact was a reduction of 30 basis points; and outside the U.S., 70 basis points. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.53 versus $1.20 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $236 million and a charge of $175 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 12.2% and 12.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew 12.8%. 
Beginning with Consumer, let's now turn to segment highlights for the quarter. Please note that the percentages quoted for all segments represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.3 billion, increasing 0.1% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. sales were up 1.1% while sales outside the U.S. declined 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales fell 0.4% worldwide, with a decline of 1.5% in the U.S. and growth of 0.3% outside the U.S.  
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 110 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively, with the most pronounced impact occurring in Women's Health. Growth was driven by worldwide Skin Care and OTC sales outside the U.S. Baby Care experienced declines over the third quarter of 2015. 
Performance in the Consumer segment was negatively impacted by slower market growth and reductions of customer inventory levels. Overall, the impact of inventory reduction was approximately 3 points on Worldwide Consumer sales growth for the quarter, with the most pronounced effect on OTC and Skin Care results. Dominic will discuss these factors in further detail later in the call. 
OTC sales grew 1.8% worldwide. Results were driven by strong consumption in smoking cessation products across Europe and new product launches in Europe and Asia. U.S. sales growth due to share gains was partially offset by trade inventory levels impacting growth in the U.S. by approximately 10 points, where, as highlighted, for the third quarter of 2015, the business experienced launch build in pain, allergy and digestive health. Also, a weak allergy season in the U.S. during 2016 negatively impacted inventory levels in the third quarter of 2016. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from 13% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 49%, up from 44% a year ago. 
Skin Care grew 12.2% worldwide and 18.9% in the U.S. These results include the sales from the recent Vogue, NeoStrata acquisitions, which are captured in the U.S. O-U.S. results were driven by stocking of Dabao products in China and share gains in Latin America. Inventory levels negatively impacted worldwide sales growth by 3 points. Successful marketing campaigns and new products continue to drive the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. Divestitures impacted sales growth in Wound Care/Other and Women's Health categories. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.4 billion increased 9.0%, with U.S. sales up 11.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.0%, driven by strong performance of new products as well as growth from our core products. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying worldwide sales growth was 10.7% as sales in the U.S. were up 13.0%; and outside the U.S., up 7.0%. Contributors to growth included Immunology products, REMICADE, SIMPONI and STELARA; Oncology products, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX; as well as INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/TRINZA and XARELTO. 
In Immunology, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA achieved strong growth in the U.S. due to market growth and increasing share for STELARA. The results reported for REMICADE export sales was driven entirely by a change in inventory levels accounting for approximately 90 points of growth. Specifically, there was an inventory build of approximately $55 million in the current period and $110 million impact from lower level inventories that we noted in the third quarter of 2015 results. 
Biosimilar competition continues to negatively impact performance of export sales. 
In Neuroscience, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/TRINZA achieved strong results, with worldwide sales growth of 21% due primarily to increased market share. As expected, during the quarter, we saw the impact from generic entries for INVEGA tablets in the U.S. 
In Oncology, strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. Sales increased 92% worldwide, and IMBRUVICA remains the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second-line CLL and MCL. 
Outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Canada, in the G5 and has recently launched in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. 
ZYTIGA sales grew 5.3% worldwide. In the U.S., market growth was essentially flat while market share was up almost 2 points sequentially. Sales outside the U.S. were tied to share gains in Japan and adoption in China since the launch in January of this year. 
DARZALEX continues to gain strong acceptance as a treatment for multiple myeloma and contributed approximately 2 points of Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales growth. 
Turning to Cardiovascular and metabolics. XARELTO continued strong share performance, with TRx market share up 1.7 points versus Q3 of 2015 to 17.5%. Warfarin represents approximately 55% of the total market, down from 62% in the third quarter of 2015. XARELTO continues to be broadly reimbursed, with over 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product copay. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales declined 3%, with the U.S. down 8.7% due to an increase in price discounts. Some of the increase in discounts is attributable to higher copay program cost in the quarter. While the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was up approximately 5%, TRx share was essentially flat to the third quarter of 2015. TRx share with endocrinologists was approximately 11% and approximately 6% with primary care. 
I'll now review the results of the Medical Device segment. Worldwide Medical Device segment sales of $6.2 billion increased 0.7% with U.S. sales increasing 1.4% and sales outside the U.S. decreasing 0.2%. 
As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 3.1% worldwide, with the U.S. up 2.3% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Additionally, the devaluation of Venezuela impacted growth worldwide by 10 basis points and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points. 
Growth was driven by electrophysiology, Advanced Surgery, Vision Care and Orthopaedics, slightly offset by general surgery and Diabetes Care. Electrophysiology within Cardiovascular grew 16% worldwide, driven by continued share gains in the U.S. and Europe as the atrial fibrillation procedure market increases. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by joint reconstruction and U.S. trauma. Pricing pressure continued across all major categories but was partially offset by positive mix in trauma and spine, continued success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees and the  CORAIL primary stem in hips contributed to the sales results. 
Within Advanced Surgery, endocutters grew 14%, energy was up 10% and biosurgicals up 7%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, closed in the second quarter of this year, also contributed modestly to growth. 
Vision Care sales were higher by 5.5% worldwide as new products launched late last year continued on an upward trajectory across all regions. Worldwide general surgery declined by approximately 2% due to discontinuing certain products in Women's Health and hernia, partially offset by both market growth and share gains in sutures. Competitive pressures and price erosion continue to impact Diabetes Care. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2016. To assist with your models, this slide provides you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, to inform you about the state of the Pharmaceutical business and the progress made since our May 2015 Business Review Day. Joaquin?"

I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson.",1844,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson. Our market-leading innovative medicines are the foundation of our strong performance, with the vast majority of their growth coming from volume gains. We continue to pursue significant growth opportunities in terms of both penetration within existing indications and planned line extensions. 
Additionally, we have launched DARZALEX, the first of our 10 potential billion-dollars-plus NMEs. As a result, we remain confident that we'll continue to deliver strong growth through 2019 despite biosimilar competition and market dynamics. Our success is a result of our strong track record of execution. Our industry-leading pipeline has delivered 12 NMEs since 2011 and 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations since 2013. And for the fourth year, we are proud to have been named the #1 company in R&D and commercial productive innovation. 
Our focused execution has delivered 11 in-market, billion-dollars-plus brands. 10 of these brands are growing, and 6 of them are growing double digit. Cumulatively, sales from our medicines launched since 2011 are the second highest of any pharmaceutical company. Our R&D and commercial capabilities are a proven strong foundation for future growth. 
First, we will continue to focus on driving volume growth across our current market-leading brands through clinical differentiation. Second, we will accelerate the growth of these in-market brands through approximately 40 potential line extensions. Critically, 10 of these line extensions have more than $0.5 billion potential. Third, as we shared last year, we have a [indiscernible] pipeline investing in 10 potential billion-dollar-plus NMEs planned to be filed through 2019. Of these, we anticipate 5 to deliver significant growth opportunities in the near term. 
Since 2015, our expectations around these near-term opportunities have crystallized. Our latest information provides higher certainty that these products will succeed delivering higher value than originally anticipated. DARZALEX, launched last year, is significantly outperforming expectations. According to your own models, it is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar brand. Sirukumab has just been filed in the U.S. and Europe. Guselkumab has just had very positive data versus Humira presented at the EADV, and we anticipate filing for psoriasis before year-end. 
Apalutamide has a broad clinical development program in both pre-metastatic and metastatic prostate cancer. We also are investigating it in combination with ZYTIGA and with our newly licensed PARP inhibitor, niraparib. Finally, esketamine is already in Phase III and recently received a second Breakthrough Therapy designation. Bill will provide additional clinical details on these near-term opportunities shortly. 
Finally, it is important to note that these 3 strategies will prepare us to deliver robust growth beyond 2019, paving the way for more than 25 potential next-generation NMEs in the 2020 to 2024 time frame. 
The strength of our in-market portfolio, complemented by our near-term line extensions and NME launches, will more than offset upcoming headwinds, including those anticipated for REMICADE. 
We are fully prepared to execute a focused biosimilar readiness plan. Yesterday, the launch of a U.S. biosimilar to REMICADE was announced for later this year. However, the appeals process is still ongoing, and we believe any commercial launch of a biosimilar remains at risk. 
Biosimilars are very different from generics. For example, in Canada, Australia and Brazil, where there is already biosimilar competition to REMICADE, we have maintained more than 90% volume share. Our U.S. commercial team is ready for a potential biosimilar launch. 
I'm confident in our strategy for 3 reasons. First, with no biosimilar approved for interchangeability, REMICADE's significant long-term safety data, a strong advocacy from patients and clear physician preference means that the 70% of patients who are stable on REMICADE are highly unlikely to switch. Second, our patient assistance programs provide a leading market differentiator. Third, we are confident that we can continue to provide a cost-effective option in all channels. The current market is extremely competitive, and REMICADE ASP is already significantly lower than the list price 
Additionally, in developing innovative contracts, we can utilize the full breadth of our portfolio. 
Our Immunology franchise remains poised to grow through 2019. We have a strong market position and a deep near-term pipeline. Let me give you some examples. Already in rheumatoid arthritis, SIMPONI ARIA is the fastest-growing IV product in the U.S. and has higher new-to-brand share than REMICADE. Outside of the U.S., we continue to gain share with SIMPONI, too. Additionally, we plan to file 2 line extensions for SIMPONI ARIA in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Together with the recent submissions of sirukumab for the approval in the U.S. and Europe, we will further strengthen our leading position in Rheumatology. 
Turning to psoriasis. STELARA continues to be the #1 biologic in new-to-brand share in the U.S. and maintains clear share leadership in key markets internationally. One of our 10 potential billion-dollars-plus brands, Guselkumab, is expected to provide a significant boost to our leadership in psoriasis, and Bill will share more on this important upcoming filing. 
Finally, moving to Gastroenterology. The most exciting news is the recent launch of STELARA for Crohn's disease in the U.S. and its anticipated launch in Europe. There is tremendous unmet need in this debilitating disease. For example, 70% to 80% of Crohn's patients on anti-TNFs are not in remission at 1 year, and the patient population is expected to grow 50% over the next decade. This is the first in a series of line extensions, including UC, which will drive more than 35% of STELARA performance by 2019. 
Moving now to Cardiovascular and metabolics. INVOKANA continues to be a standout performer. Globally, it is the leading  SGLT2 inhibitor and the third largest known insulin diabetes medicine. Put into perspective, in the U.S., there have been more prescriptions filled for INVOKANA and INVOKAMET than all other SGLT2 inhibitors combined. A total of more than 1.3 million patients are treated in the U.S. alone. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, INVOKANA's performance dipped this quarter due to temporary increased costs to administer copay patient access programs. However, I want to emphasize that this was a transitory event. Our return to growth will be driven by INVOKANA's strong access position across U.S. commercial plans and Medicare Part D and the recent approval of INVOKAMET XR. We are expecting our cardiovascular outcomes data to read out in mid-2017. 
XARELTO is another market leader in our Cardiovascular and metabolics portfolio, delivering double-digit growth every year since its launch in 2011. To date, XARELTO has already treated more than 3.8 million patients in the U.S. and is supported by an extremely robust published real-world dataset, including evidence from more than 91,000 patients demonstrating consistency with our clinical trials. As a result, it is broadly reimbursed, with more than 95% Medicare and commercial patients on formulary at the lowest branded copay. 
These considerable achievements are just a start. Approximately, 54% of potential patients are still utilizing Warfarin, presenting significant growth opportunities in current indications.  Additionally, there are 8 new indications seeking clinical studies underway as part of EXPLORER, the largest clinical development program within the anticoagulant space. If successful, the potential patient pull could increase more than fivefold. 
Turning to Neuroscience. INVEGA TRINZA is a growth catalyst for the entire long-acting therapy franchise. Notably, INVEGA TRINZA is the fastest-growing LAT in the U.S. It has also contributed to growing INVEGA SUSTENNA scripts 26% in the 13 months since launch. 
Significant opportunities for growth remain as only 11% of patients are treated with LATs in the U.S. 
Celebrating 10 years of innovation this year, our HIV portfolio has achieved approximately 20% growth annually and cumulative sales of more than $15 billion. Today, 25% of patients in developed markets are treated with a J&J HIV medicine. Our class-leading portfolio has benefited more than 1 million patients, and this legacy will continue with upcoming line extensions. When Prezista first launched, it was part of a 6-tablet regimen. The first upcoming line extension, darunavir single-tablet regimen, will reduce this number to 1, improving adherence and safety. Also, we expect 2 rilpivirine fixed-dose combinations, one with Gilead's TAF and another one with ViiV's dolutegravir, that will drive additional growth for 2019. 
Finally, let's move to our fastest-growing therapeutic area, Oncology. IMBRUVICA has led the recent growth of our oncology franchise, accelerating from a record-breaking global launch to clear market share leadership in total patients in the first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Today, IMBRUVICA is reimbursed in 41 countries with world-class market access. Since launch, an additional 6 indications have been approved, and we anticipate an additional 7 new registrations ahead, 4 of which have $500 million-plus potential.  Together with a number of promising combination therapies in development, these new indications will usher in a very exciting future for IMBRUVICA. 
IMBRUVICA's leadership in Oncology is mirrored by our recently launched asset, DARZALEX. Only 3 months after its launch, DARZALEX became the #1 prescribed therapy in fourth-line and later multiple myeloma. From a launch-aligned sales perspective, DARZALEX has continued to far outpace its competitors. This first-in-class medicine has since been improved in the EU and Canada and is driving positive share trends in earlier therapy lines in the U.S. We are confident DARZALEX can become the standard of care in multiple myeloma and help even more than the 10,000 patients who have benefited already worldwide. 
Growth will continue to accelerate with the anticipated approval in second-line patient populations and the impressive data from the recently published CASTOR and POLLUX studies. An additional 5 Phase III trials are currently underway as well as development of a subcutaneous formulation. As Bill will detail, we have also seen some positive data that DARZALEX may be effective outside of multiple myeloma. What should be clear today is that all of our current market-leading medicines have significant potential for continued volume growth. 
Additionally, we have a multitude of promising potential line extensions across every therapeutic area, approximately 40 in total, by 2019. Of these, 10 have more than $0.5 billion potential. The remaining 30 potential line extensions are not insignificant.  Cumulatively, the line extensions for XARELTO and INVOKANA have the potential to drive $3 billion to $5 billion in incremental sales for the Cardiovascular franchise. We believe these new indications will be a key driver of our growth through 2019 even in the context of biosimilars and market dynamics. 
In my 6 years leading our Pharmaceutical sector, I have never been more excited and more positive about our future as I am today. We have significant growth potential throughout our portfolio with market-leading brands; 40 anticipated line extensions, 10 of which have more than $0.5 billion potential; and 10 NMEs with more than $1 billion potential to be filed by 2019. Combined, these factors will ensure that we continue to outpace the industry growth through 2019. 
It is now my privilege to turn the call over to Dr. William Hait, who heads up our R&D organization. Bill will provide additional detail about our pipeline that is set to deliver these groundbreaking treatments. Bill?"
139677,381738381,1056424,"Johnson & Johnson, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Hait, and I'm the Global Head of Research and Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen, we believe that by continuing to execu",2083,"Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone. My name is Bill Hait, and I'm the Global Head of Research and Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. 
As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen, we believe that by continuing to execute our current strategy, we will consistently deliver valuable products to patients with serious unmet medical needs and that this will sustain our leadership in the pharmaceutical industry. Our strength is built on a blend of deep internal scientific expertise with industry-leading collaborations through the work of Johnson & Johnson innovation. We continue to find efficiencies that produce savings that we invest in our pipeline, and our strategic focus creates an enviable track record. We are delivering against our anticipated 2015 to 2019 NME and LE results that will produce a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. For these reasons and the results I will describe today, Janssen has become one of the most productive and most respected pharmaceutical companies. 
Before I share with you the details of our pipeline progress, let me explain how and why we have been able to sustain industry-leading results. Our 5 end-to-end therapeutic areas span basic drug discovery through launch and life cycle management. This structure produces a focused, seamless R&D organization, promotes efficient phase transitions and ensures dedication to major unmet medical needs where there is compelling, translatable science. These 5 therapeutic areas concentrate on 11 high-priority disease areas through our disease area strongholds, nimble and efficient biotech-like teams embedded in the broader context of the therapeutic areas. Each disease area stronghold undergoes rigorous triennial review by our external scientific advisory board, receives a priority score and proportional funding of discovery and early development. 
Our therapeutic areas are supported by substantial research capabilities through our centers of excellence, including biotechnology; medicinal chemistry; diagnostics; clinical operations; and, most recently, oligonucleotide and nucleic acid chemistry, expertise garnered through the acquisition of Alios. Assets that transition into late development are prioritized into 3 categories to ensure that our investment of resources align with our most promising targets. Currently, our top 2 categories, which represent 40% of our assets and 80% of our overall late-development value, receives 60% of our investment. It is through this approach that we remain at the top of the industry in successful phase transitions and speed to market. 
Janssen has achieved considerable success, and we are poised to continuously deliver near- and long-term growth. Our balanced investment across all aspects of our pipeline allows us to enjoy a constant flow of important new data. We launched 12 new products since 2011. We received the most FDA approvals from 2011 to 2016 as well as 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations. 
For 4 consecutive years, we have been named the innovation leader by IDEA Pharma and became the partner of choice through the work of J&J innovation. And for the third consecutive year, Fortune Magazine ranked Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson #1 in the pharmaceutical category on its annual World's Most Admired Companies list. Our unwavering commitment to global public health is demonstrated by SIRTURO, the first new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis in over 40 years; as well as our work on new, convenient HIV combinations; the first prime-boost Ebola vaccine using Crucell's adenoviral vector and Bavarian Nordic's MVA vector; as well as new chewable forms of mebendazole for children with worm infestations. 
As Joaquin mentioned and as we highlighted at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review Day, between 2015 and 2019, we plan on filing approximately 10 new drugs, each with a potential for greater than $1 billion in peak year sales and 40 line extensions. This slide highlights 10 of these[ph], anticipated to be filed in the 2015 to 2019 time period, with peak year sales potential greater than $0.5 billion 
In addition, our early pipeline is rich in important assets that have the potential to file between 2020 and 2024. We are on track to deliver our anticipated NME and LE results through a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. Since May 2015, we garnered 3 new product approvals and filings, with the fourth, Guselkumab, anticipated this year, and we achieved 16 significant line extensions. 
Now let me use our time together to describe in greater detail some of the progress we have made since our May 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. Oncology is the newest of our 5 therapeutic areas and achieved industry-leading growth based on our development of several first-in-class drugs, including ZYTIGA, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. Our heme malignancies disease area is anchored by IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. 
IMBRUVICA, the first BTK inhibitor for the treatment of certain B-cell malignancies, received 4 FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations. IMBRUVICA was recently approved for frontline use, based on the unprecedented results in previously untreated CLL patients reported in the RESONATE-2 study published in the December 15 issue of the New England Journal. As shown on this slide, treatment with ibrutinib decreased progression or death from CLL by 84% compared to chlorambucil and demonstrated a similar improvement in overall survival. 
DARZALEX, the first monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma, received 2 FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations and was approved almost 4 months ahead of its PDUFA date in double-refractory myeloma. As shown on this slide, combination therapy with DARZALEX delivered impressive results in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. The CASTOR and POLLUX studies demonstrated that the addition of DARZALEX to Velcade and dexamethasone or REVLIMID and dexamethasone, respectively, produced a greater than 60% decrease in risk of progression or death as compared to that of Vel/dex or REV/dex alone, both of these studies were published in the New England Journal. This month, the FDA granted priority review for daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or bortezomib and  dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma with a PDUFA date in February 2017. 
Our prostate cancer disease area is anchored by ZYTIGA, the first CYP17 inhibitor for the treatment of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and is approved for both pre- and post-chemotherapy indications. Furthermore, we are developing ARN-509, now known as apalutamide, a more potent next-generation androgen receptor antagonist that shows a high degree of safety and efficacy in castrate-resistant prostate cancer. As seen in these figures, apalutamide decreased PSA by a median of 85% in patients with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer after 12 weeks of treatment. The maximum PSA response, shown on the right-hand figure, was achieved in 94% of patients. 
Earlier this year, we licensed niraparib from TESARO to obtain a highly potent and selective PARP inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer patients with DNA repair defects for use in combination with ZYTIGA or apalutamide. Niraparib is in Phase II clinical trials and currently planned to be filed by 2019. This portfolio of assets gives us confidence that we will continue to bring great results to patients with prostate cancer for many years to come. 
While we did not explicitly address immuno-oncology during our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review, we continue to make significant progress in this area. Over the last 5 years, we invested in 4 critical areas, including vaccines, T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell redirection and myeloid mechanisms of actions. We currently have 15 immuno-oncology assets in development, including 8 that are in the clinic. 
Recently, we uncovered an important additional mechanism of action of DARZALEX to be immune-mediated through the depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid in lymphoid populations, including a previously unrecognized super-suppressor, CD38+ T-reg population; as well as activation of CD8 and CD4+ effector T-cells. These results provide the impetus for exploring DARZALEX in indications beyond heme malignancies in solid tumors. 
Our Immunology therapeutic area continues to deliver extraordinary products for patients with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. STELARA was the first IL-12, IL-23 monoclonal antibody introduced for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. It was recently approved in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in the U.S, received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency and offers new options for adult patients with IBD. 
Guselkumab is a first-in-class selective anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody that demonstrated significant efficacy versus placebo in superiority compared with the antitumor necrosis factor, adalimumab, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The VOYAGE study, whose results are shown in this slide, randomly assigned 750 patients to receive guselkumab, adalimumab or a placebo followed by guselkumab in a 2:2:1 ratio. Patients treated with guselkumab achieved a significantly greater chance of obtaining a PASI 90 score compared to that of patients treated with adalimumab or a placebo at week 16, and the advantage over adalimumab was sustained through week 48. The high degree of efficacy of guselkumab, the less intensive dosing regimen and the potential for a STELARA-like safety profile makes guselkumab highly competitive with newly launched anti-IL-17 antibodies. We plan to file for psoriasis this year and advance guselkumab into Phase III for patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Neuroscience is a historically strong area for Janssen since Dr. Paul Janssen and colleagues developed haloperidol, the first medication for schizophrenia. We have built on Dr. Paul's legacy with the development of next-generation antipsychotics and pioneered the development of long-acting injectables that help improve compliance for this difficult-to-treat patient population, most recently with the approval of INVEGA TRINZA, an every-3-month injectable formulation. 
Today, we focus our neuroscience investment in drugs that treat serious mood disorders, including depression, suicidality and Alzheimer's disease. Esketamine, an intranasally-delivered enantiomer of ketamine, produced groundbreaking results in major depressive disorder, with onset of action measured in hours to days rather than weeks to months. There's an alarming increase in suicides, both in the U.S. and globally, more than 41,000 each year in the U.S. alone. It's a tragic issue that's emerging as a major health priority. As shown in this slide, esketamine ameliorated suicidal ideation within 4 hours and sustained this effect for over 3 weeks, leading to its second FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation. 
Infectious Diseases is one of our most exciting and important areas in investment for future growth, where we focus on respiratory infections and hepatitis. We are pursuing an aggressive strategy for the cure of hepatitis C. We recently reported a 100% SVR12 in patients with genotype 1, with both an 8- and 6-week duration of treatment using a 3DAA combination of OLYSIO, AL-335 and  odalasvir.
Based on this exceptional data, we are moving the 3DAA regimen into late-development studies. 
Our Cardiovascular and Metabolism therapeutic area developed both INVOKANA and XARELTO in partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe and Bayer, respectively. New line extensions are designed to continue to bring value to these 2 first-in-class drugs. With XARELTO, we are pursuing studies in congestive heart failure, embolic stroke of undetermined source, VTE prevention in medically ill patients, infrainguinal peripheral artery disease, VTE prevention in cancer patients and an acute coronary syndrome. We anticipate readouts from 2 INVOKANA cardiovascular outcomes studies by mid-2017, which we believe will further strengthen the importance of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in the treatment of patients with diabetes. We are also studying the role of INVOKANA in diabetic kidney disease and plan to address obesity and prediabetes. 
In summary, at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are executing a clearly defined innovation strategy that drives value to patients around the world. We are on track to meeting our anticipated results described in 2015. We are producing the cadence of transformational innovations that are leading to exceptional results. We are a leader in productivity, approvals and FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations, and we are one of the fastest-growing top 10 pharmaceutical companies. 
We have had the most U.S. FDA approvals in the last 5 years, 2011 to 2016, and 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations. We anticipate filing approximately 10 NMEs between 2015 and 2019, each with greater than $1 billion peak year sales potential.  We have approximately 40 planned line extension filings anticipated between 2015 and 2019, several with greater than $500 million in peak year sales potential, supported by a steady flow of clinical data that drive better patient results. Finally, we take pride in delivering years of lives saved and better quality of life for our first credo responsibility to the doctors, nurses and patients who use our products. 
Now before I turn it over to Dominic, for your reference, let me leave you with a current overview of our pipeline across our 5 therapeutic areas. Dominic will now continue with an update of the company's financial results."

As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we make good progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceu",2501,"Thank you, Bill and Joaquin, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we make good progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. With great leaders like Joaquin and Bill, our strong in-market performance driven by excellent commercial capabilities and our robust R&D pipeline, you can see why we remain confident that our Pharmaceuticals business will continue to be a major driver of growth moving forward. 
I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're pleased with our overall results. As you know, we had a strong start to the year, and as a result, last quarter, we increased our sales and earnings guidance. I'm happy to say we're tracking with those higher expectations while continuing to invest in our business. As you've heard, our Pharmaceutical business delivered strong results this quarter, with underlying operational growth of 10.7%. 
Let me now provide some comments on our other businesses. In our Consumer business, we continued to gain share this quarter. However, as reported by Nielsen, the industry saw a slowdown in many markets, with category growth rates in 2016 about half of the category growth rate we saw in Q3 of 2015. As Joe noted, our sales growth for the quarter was also impacted by lower trade inventory levels. These lower levels are the result of inventory builds in Q3 2015, as we discussed at that time, due to relaunches of certain products as well as inventory reduction programs being implemented at some of the larger retailers this past quarter. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year and this overall impact from trade inventory reductions, overall consumer growth was nearly 4%. Based on increasing share trend of our brands, we expect trade levels to align with consumption going forward. 
In Medical Devices, consistent with some recent analyst reports about the market, we believe the industry experienced lower hospital admissions and procedure rates during the mid-summer months. 
Late in the quarter, several reports showed higher levels of activity, and in fact, the data that we recently saw published for September looked encouraging. Additionally, we are very pleased to see our priority platforms continue to deliver robust growth of nearly 9%, with some at double digits, as Joe mentioned earlier. 
Overall, Hospital Medical Devices' operational growth, excluding acquisition and divestitures, was approximately 4% this quarter. 
In the Consumer Medical Device businesses, we saw continued price erosion in our Diabetes business. However, in our Vision Care business, we saw good operational growth of 5.5%. 
So in summary, as we previously discussed, in 2015, our underlying operational growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestiture as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days that we saw in 2015, was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continued to accelerate our growth, and we delivered strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 5.9% for the third quarter of 2016. 
Our sales were above analyst estimates, as were earnings, due to significantly higher pretax operating margins. As you may remember, our guidance from January included a more than 200 basis point increase in our 2016 pretax operating margin, on an adjusted basis. We have attained that level year-to-date while continuing to invest in our business, and we remain comfortable with that forecast for the full year as we continue to execute on the restructuring activities in our Medical Device businesses while also investing in growth. 
As you know, in September, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics . We expect this transaction to close in Q1 of 2017. So for 2016, the transaction is expected to have no impact to our adjusted earnings and is not expected to impact our guidance. For 2017, again assuming a Q1 close, the transaction is expected to be positive to sales growth and immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. We are excited about Abbott Medical Optics' strong and differentiated surgical ophthalmic portfolio, particularly in cataract surgery. That, coupled with our world-leading ACUVUE contact lens business, will help us become a broad-based leader in Vision Care. 
Now I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the remainder of 2016. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2016. Our operational sales growth this quarter was 4.3%, and when we exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of hep C sales and the overall impact that Venezuela had, it was strong at more than 6%. 
If you direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the intangible amortization expense of about $250 million and the anticipated special charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring plan. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is, therefore, $1.68, which exceeded the mean of the analysts' estimates, as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 12.8% versus the prior year.  Adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis was the same as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a few moments and talk about other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 30 basis points mostly due to unfavorable transaction currency impacts, partly offset by favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 290 basis points lower as compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to overall good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2%, lower by 40 basis points due primarily to lower milestone payments, partly offset by increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipeline. 
Our pretax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32% or 310 basis points higher than the third quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing and administrative expenses and less R&D expenses. As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progressed throughout the year, and through 9 months, we have achieved a 220 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability, consistent with the expectations we communicated to you throughout the year. 
Interest expense net of interest income was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $50 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of approximately $400 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $200 million compared to a net gain of approximately $400 million in the prior year period, which included a higher level of gains from divestitures. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7% compared to 20% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, and it reflects the current mix of our businesses and the impact from a new accounting standard relating to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which we discussed in our call in July. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise improved by 220 basis points versus the third quarter of 2015. You will notice significant improvements in margins for the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical businesses.
Last year, our Consumer business benefited from a gain in the sale of SPLENDA, and you're seeing that reflected in their lower margin this quarter, although still at very healthy rates.
As you can see on the next slide, on a year-to-date basis, we are pleased to see solid improvement in our consumer margin, and we remain confident it will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015.
Overall, we expect adjusted income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in pretax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I'd like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. I'd like to start with some of the items that we know you are -- you find difficult to forecast. 
Let's start with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $13 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27 billion of debt. 
Through the end of the third quarter, we completed nearly 60% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year.
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $450 million. There's a slight tightening of the range. 
Regarding other income and expense as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corp, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as a gain, ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the underlying activity. This impact will be offset by a lower tax rate.
And now for taxes, we're very comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 18% to 18.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to a higher level of income and lower tax jurisdictions. 
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. Our sales range for 2016 continues to remain the same whether or not a biosimilar REMICADE launches this year in the U.S.
Additionally, we do not anticipate biosimilar or generic competition this year for PROCRIT, ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, but as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be first based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We've also provided an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
We continue to be comfortable with the sales guidance we provided last quarter, reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This was a result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of between approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisition, divestitures and hepatitis C, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year even after adjusting for the shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1% on sales growth. This is consistent with our previous guidance as major currencies had not significantly fluctuated since our last update. 
So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of positive 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion, consistent with our previous guidance. 
And now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range between $6.71 and $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 8% to 9%. And this is a narrowing of the range. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, the negative impact to EPS would be approximately $0.03, consistent with our previous guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.68 to $6.73 per share, which again, is a narrowing of our previous guidance with a midpoint that is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance range. 
Finally, just a reminder of some dynamics you will see in our fourth quarter results this year in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2015, we had additional shipping days based on when our year-end closed, and that contributed approximately 4 points of sales growth in the fourth quarter last year. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter last year, we closed on the Cordis divestiture. And based on our latest guidance for 2016, we will have significantly lower level of other income from divestitures as compared to the prior year. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our performance so far this year, and we remain confident and optimistic about our future full year growth for 2016. Specifically, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6%, a higher level than we experienced last year on a comparable basis. 
Our adjusted pretax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out on our guidance of more than a 200-basis point improvement over the prior year. We narrowed our guidance and increased the midpoint for adjusted operational EPS growth, which remains strong in the range of $6.71 to $6.76 per share, with the growth rate of 8% to 9%. And we are very well positioned to seize the opportunities in our strong pipelines to continue fueling our future growth. 
Now I'd like to turn things back to Joe for the Q&A portion of the call. Joe?"

So Dominic, I wanted to focus on the 2017, the puts and takes. Dominic, at our health care conference in September, you said the only real delta from 2016 to 2017 is the rate at which a biosimilar REMICADE could penetrate the market, assuming Pfizer launches at risk, and you don't think the penetration will be dramatic. I took that to mean that you feel that you can grow sales in 2017 at a similar rate to 2016 minus the impact from biosimilar REMICADE. So my questions are, is that the right interpretation? What gives you the confidence that this level of growth will continue? And second, the biosimilar for Neupogen captured about 7% of the market in year 1. Would you expect inflector penetration to be less than that? Any color that you can give on the expected penetration would be helpful. And I did have one follow-up on pharma."

So I think that is a good way to characterize it. We'll provide more color on that when we talk about the 2017 guidance in our discussion in January. We do think that the rate of penetration for a biosimilar will be modest, and there are several reasons for that. As we talked about before, 70% of the patients are treated well with REMICADE. There is no interchangeability available, that's another factor, and we're already in a highly competitive environment with respect to biologics, anti-TNF therapies, as you know. Before any comments on Neupogen, Joaquin, anything else you want to add to overall penetration of biosimilars?"

We are confident that we have a strong plan based on what Dominic described before. There's been 2.6 million patients treated with REMICADE worldwide. There's no interchangeability and there's a clear patient and physician preference, so it's highly unlikely that you're going to be seeing patients that are stable in the REMICADE switched. So that is 70% of the patients. At the same time, we have a strong patient assistance program, which will prove to be a market differentiator, and we are ready to compete in every channel, trying to bring patients the most affordable option in every situation. So we feel well prepared to face the biosimilar. And as Dominic said, we are convinced that we will continue to grow our business in the face of biosimilar competition."

I described part of the reasons for optimists during my conversation before, we not only feel that we are going to be able to grow in the face of biosimilar of the pharmaceutical business, overall, but we also are confident that we're going to be able to grow our immunology franchise in the phase of biosimilars. Let me give you some examples of why going into the 3 segments: Rheumatology, Psoriasis and Gastroenterology. In Rheumatology, SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA are doing very well. As a matter of fact, SIMPONI ARIA, it's already leading in new brand -- in new to brand share in Rheumatology in the U.S. And SIMPONI, it's gaining share in all international markets. We plan to file 2 line extensions of SIMPONI ARIA in ankylosing spondylitis and in psoriatic arthritis by 2017. And also we just filed sirukumab with EMEA, and we're planning to file it here in the U.S. before the end of the year. So that gives us a strong confidence that we're going to be continuing to grow in Rheumatology. Then moving into psoriasis, STELARA continues to be the leading in new to brand share in the U.S. and it's leading in most markets internationally. Together with that, we plan to file guselkumab, that we have presented very impressive data at the last EADV, we plan to file guselkumab before the end of the year. So that's another reason why we feel real confident that we will continue to grow in psoriasis. Finally, gastroenterology, which by the way is, for us, is the largest and fastest-growing segment, we just had the approval of STELARA in Crohn's disease and we are now launching it in the U.S. and we anticipate to be launching it in Europe pretty soon. So that is another reason why, which we believe that we're going to be able to continue to grow in immunology.

Well, I remember that discussion pretty well. I just want to put it into context for everyone. So this was a discussion about the success of our Pharmaceutical business, which has largely been driven by collaboration, licensing, co-development, et cetera, and not at all by any major acquisition, right? And the question that I got posed to me was well, that's been very successful, why would you ever change that, or is there any reason no to consider a change in that strategy. And my comment was, well, to the extent we have 5 major therapeutic areas today, if we decided that another major therapeutic area was of importance to us and we wanted to get into that therapeutic area and we felt we could add a lot to it, but based on our overall scientific knowledge more broadly, that I would see that perhaps being done not by necessary a licensing strategy, but more of an acquisition type strategy. So it would enhance the overall portfolio of Johnson & Johnson's Pharmaceutical business beyond the current therapeutic areas that we currently are in. And by doing that, that might require a more significant acquisition than we've been doing in the pharma business. So that's the context for that."

So what we saw, David, this is through published sources, many of which are from firms such as yours and many of the sell side that publish. We saw -- actually, utilization rates, as depicted in hospital admissions and hospital surgical procedures, with the first quarter of this year being the highest, by far, and then a slowdown in the second quarter, a slowdown even below the level at which most estimates we're depicting, we're forecasting. And then the third quarter was even slower than the second quarter, overall. But there's a very marked difference in September. So once September hit, the data showed quite a rebound from the summer months. And the rate of growth in September was actually faster than what we saw in the first quarter, which was the highest growth quarter year-over-year in terms of penetration. Now whether that remains at that level or whether it's a rebound effect from the summer, we'll have to see. But I think this is all well chronicled in the multiple reports that many of you, I'm sure, have seen. So overall, I'd say we're now in a stable environment in hospital procedures. Going into '17, I express confidence in our Medical Device business growing faster, and quite frankly, we have a plan for that business to return to growth at above market for the medical device sector, and it's continuing to improve. What gives me confidence there is that the areas that we focus the most on, the growth  platforms and priority platforms just this quarter, they grew at 9%, and within those, 3 of those, in particular, electrophysiology, energy and endocutters, each grew at double-digit growth. So we obviously have very robust growth coming in the priority platforms, which we expect to continue and drive us to above-market growth in 2017."

With respect to international tax reform and what we're hearing, I can tell you that I visit in Washington often and speak with members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, and the tax staffs are busily working and working very collaboratively with U.S. multinationals on an appropriate tax reform package. We think there's more bipartisan support now than there has been in the past. We think that often, we hear, as you mentioned, the benefit of investing in U.S. infrastructure as a result of those repatriated earnings coming back into the U.S., so that would be a positive. And we think that, overall, the climate for international tax reform, post the election quite frankly, is more positive than it's been in the last year or so. And then with respect to Proposition 61, there are several opponents to that proposition, and we would prefer to have pricing that is more related to outcomes, evidence-based medicine is something that we are advocates of and therefore, outcome-based pricing is a logical consequence of that.

Within Consumer and Medical Devices, in particular, Consumer, just like we have in Pharma, we have specific areas of focus. We have 11 need states. The primary focus for us is growing internationally in emerging markets, so strong brands and emerging markets, a focus on over-the-counter medications and beauty space, particularly in Asia, are of interest to us. We just did a recent transaction with Dr.Ci:Labo in Japan, where we have an interest in that Asian marketplace and utilizing that brand throughout broader, throughout Asia, beyond Japan where it's currently marketed just as an example of one.

Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Chief Finan",1967,"Good morning. I'm Joe Wolk, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the review of our business results for the third quarter of 2016.  Joining me on the call today are Dominic Caruso, Chief Financial Officer; Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals; and Dr. Bill Hait, Global Head of Pharmaceutical Research and Development. 
A few logistics before we discuss the results. This review is being made available via webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. 
I will begin today's presentation by briefly reviewing the third quarter sales and earnings results for the corporation and sales results for each of our 3 business segments. Next, Joaquin and Bill will provide an update on our Pharmaceutical business, specifically highlighting how our focus on innovation to address unmet medical needs translates to current and future strong performance. Dominic will then provide some additional commentary on the results, review the income statement and discuss guidance for 2016. Lastly, we will open the call to your questions. We expect today's call to last approximately 90 minutes. 
Included with the press release issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website. 
I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and the company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made here today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. 
During the course of today's presentation, we will discuss a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide is an acknowledgment of those relationships. 
I would now like to review our results. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016, up 4.2% versus the third quarter of 2015. On an operational basis, sales were up 4.3% and currency had a negative impact of 0.1%. 
In the U.S., sales were up 6.7% while regions outside the U.S. were up 1.5%, comprised of 1.7% operational growth, partially offset by negative impact of currency exchange rates of 0.2%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., declined 1.3%. You may recall that we highlighted growth in the second quarter of 2016 being favorably impacted by an inventory build, which did reverse in the third quarter. Europe grew by 3.2% while the Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 1.4%. 
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational sales growth was 5.9% worldwide, 7.3% in the U.S. and 4.2% outside the U.S. Additionally, operations in Venezuela reduced reported sales growth. Worldwide, this impact was a reduction of 30 basis points; and outside the U.S., 70 basis points. 
Turning now to earnings. Net earnings were $4.3 billion, and earnings per share were $1.53 versus $1.20 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $236 million and a charge of $175 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks. 
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 12.2% and 12.8%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015. On an operational basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew 12.8%. 
Beginning with Consumer, let's now turn to segment highlights for the quarter. Please note that the percentages quoted for all segments represent operational sales change in comparison to the third quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated and, therefore, exclude the impact of currency translation. 
Worldwide Consumer segment sales totaled $3.3 billion, increasing 0.1% from the third quarter of 2015. U.S. sales were up 1.1% while sales outside the U.S. declined 0.6%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales fell 0.4% worldwide, with a decline of 1.5% in the U.S. and growth of 0.3% outside the U.S.  
In addition, operations in Venezuela negatively impacted growth worldwide and outside the U.S. by 110 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively, with the most pronounced impact occurring in Women's Health. Growth was driven by worldwide Skin Care and OTC sales outside the U.S. Baby Care experienced declines over the third quarter of 2015. 
Performance in the Consumer segment was negatively impacted by slower market growth and reductions of customer inventory levels. Overall, the impact of inventory reduction was approximately 3 points on Worldwide Consumer sales growth for the quarter, with the most pronounced effect on OTC and Skin Care results. Dominic will discuss these factors in further detail later in the call. 
OTC sales grew 1.8% worldwide. Results were driven by strong consumption in smoking cessation products across Europe and new product launches in Europe and Asia. U.S. sales growth due to share gains was partially offset by trade inventory levels impacting growth in the U.S. by approximately 10 points, where, as highlighted, for the third quarter of 2015, the business experienced launch build in pain, allergy and digestive health. Also, a weak allergy season in the U.S. during 2016 negatively impacted inventory levels in the third quarter of 2016. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from 13% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was approximately 49%, up from 44% a year ago. 
Skin Care grew 12.2% worldwide and 18.9% in the U.S. These results include the sales from the recent Vogue, NeoStrata acquisitions, which are captured in the U.S. O-U.S. results were driven by stocking of Dabao products in China and share gains in Latin America. Inventory levels negatively impacted worldwide sales growth by 3 points. Successful marketing campaigns and new products continue to drive the results for LISTERINE in Oral Care. Divestitures impacted sales growth in Wound Care/Other and Women's Health categories. 
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide sales of $8.4 billion increased 9.0%, with U.S. sales up 11.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 5.0%, driven by strong performance of new products as well as growth from our core products. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying worldwide sales growth was 10.7% as sales in the U.S. were up 13.0%; and outside the U.S., up 7.0%. Contributors to growth included Immunology products, REMICADE, SIMPONI and STELARA; Oncology products, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX; as well as INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/TRINZA and XARELTO. 
In Immunology, REMICADE, STELARA and SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA achieved strong growth in the U.S. due to market growth and increasing share for STELARA. The results reported for REMICADE export sales was driven entirely by a change in inventory levels accounting for approximately 90 points of growth. Specifically, there was an inventory build of approximately $55 million in the current period and $110 million impact from lower level inventories that we noted in the third quarter of 2015 results. 
Biosimilar competition continues to negatively impact performance of export sales. 
In Neuroscience, INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION/TRINZA achieved strong results, with worldwide sales growth of 21% due primarily to increased market share. As expected, during the quarter, we saw the impact from generic entries for INVEGA tablets in the U.S. 
In Oncology, strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove results for IMBRUVICA in the U.S. Sales increased 92% worldwide, and IMBRUVICA remains the leader in both new and total patient regimen share in second-line CLL and MCL. 
Outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Canada, in the G5 and has recently launched in Japan, Hong Kong and Korea. 
ZYTIGA sales grew 5.3% worldwide. In the U.S., market growth was essentially flat while market share was up almost 2 points sequentially. Sales outside the U.S. were tied to share gains in Japan and adoption in China since the launch in January of this year. 
DARZALEX continues to gain strong acceptance as a treatment for multiple myeloma and contributed approximately 2 points of Worldwide Pharmaceutical sales growth. 
Turning to Cardiovascular and metabolics. XARELTO continued strong share performance, with TRx market share up 1.7 points versus Q3 of 2015 to 17.5%. Warfarin represents approximately 55% of the total market, down from 62% in the third quarter of 2015. XARELTO continues to be broadly reimbursed, with over 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest branded product copay. 
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales declined 3%, with the U.S. down 8.7% due to an increase in price discounts. Some of the increase in discounts is attributable to higher copay program cost in the quarter. While the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was up approximately 5%, TRx share was essentially flat to the third quarter of 2015. TRx share with endocrinologists was approximately 11% and approximately 6% with primary care. 
I'll now review the results of the Medical Device segment. Worldwide Medical Device segment sales of $6.2 billion increased 0.7% with U.S. sales increasing 1.4% and sales outside the U.S. decreasing 0.2%. 
As a reminder, Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying growth was 3.1% worldwide, with the U.S. up 2.3% and growth of 3.9% outside the U.S. Additionally, the devaluation of Venezuela impacted growth worldwide by 10 basis points and outside the U.S. by 30 basis points. 
Growth was driven by electrophysiology, Advanced Surgery, Vision Care and Orthopaedics, slightly offset by general surgery and Diabetes Care. Electrophysiology within Cardiovascular grew 16% worldwide, driven by continued share gains in the U.S. and Europe as the atrial fibrillation procedure market increases. Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by joint reconstruction and U.S. trauma. Pricing pressure continued across all major categories but was partially offset by positive mix in trauma and spine, continued success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees and the  CORAIL primary stem in hips contributed to the sales results. 
Within Advanced Surgery, endocutters grew 14%, energy was up 10% and biosurgicals up 7%. The acquisition of NeuWave Medical, closed in the second quarter of this year, also contributed modestly to growth. 
Vision Care sales were higher by 5.5% worldwide as new products launched late last year continued on an upward trajectory across all regions. Worldwide general surgery declined by approximately 2% due to discontinuing certain products in Women's Health and hernia, partially offset by both market growth and share gains in sutures. Competitive pressures and price erosion continue to impact Diabetes Care. 
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2016. To assist with your models, this slide provides you with a summary of important developments that occurred during the quarter. 
It is now my pleasure to turn the discussion over to Joaquin Duato, Worldwide Chairman, Pharmaceuticals, to inform you about the state of the Pharmaceutical business and the progress made since our May 2015 Business Review Day. Joaquin?"

I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson.",1844,"Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share an update on our Pharmaceutical sector. Since May 2015, when we last met, our Pharmaceuticals business has continued to flourish and remains the primary growth engine of Johnson & Johnson. Our market-leading innovative medicines are the foundation of our strong performance, with the vast majority of their growth coming from volume gains. We continue to pursue significant growth opportunities in terms of both penetration within existing indications and planned line extensions. 
Additionally, we have launched DARZALEX, the first of our 10 potential billion-dollars-plus NMEs. As a result, we remain confident that we'll continue to deliver strong growth through 2019 despite biosimilar competition and market dynamics. Our success is a result of our strong track record of execution. Our industry-leading pipeline has delivered 12 NMEs since 2011 and 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations since 2013. And for the fourth year, we are proud to have been named the #1 company in R&D and commercial productive innovation. 
Our focused execution has delivered 11 in-market, billion-dollars-plus brands. 10 of these brands are growing, and 6 of them are growing double digit. Cumulatively, sales from our medicines launched since 2011 are the second highest of any pharmaceutical company. Our R&D and commercial capabilities are a proven strong foundation for future growth. 
First, we will continue to focus on driving volume growth across our current market-leading brands through clinical differentiation. Second, we will accelerate the growth of these in-market brands through approximately 40 potential line extensions. Critically, 10 of these line extensions have more than $0.5 billion potential. Third, as we shared last year, we have a [indiscernible] pipeline investing in 10 potential billion-dollar-plus NMEs planned to be filed through 2019. Of these, we anticipate 5 to deliver significant growth opportunities in the near term. 
Since 2015, our expectations around these near-term opportunities have crystallized. Our latest information provides higher certainty that these products will succeed delivering higher value than originally anticipated. DARZALEX, launched last year, is significantly outperforming expectations. According to your own models, it is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar brand. Sirukumab has just been filed in the U.S. and Europe. Guselkumab has just had very positive data versus Humira presented at the EADV, and we anticipate filing for psoriasis before year-end. 
Apalutamide has a broad clinical development program in both pre-metastatic and metastatic prostate cancer. We also are investigating it in combination with ZYTIGA and with our newly licensed PARP inhibitor, niraparib. Finally, esketamine is already in Phase III and recently received a second Breakthrough Therapy designation. Bill will provide additional clinical details on these near-term opportunities shortly. 
Finally, it is important to note that these 3 strategies will prepare us to deliver robust growth beyond 2019, paving the way for more than 25 potential next-generation NMEs in the 2020 to 2024 time frame. 
The strength of our in-market portfolio, complemented by our near-term line extensions and NME launches, will more than offset upcoming headwinds, including those anticipated for REMICADE. 
We are fully prepared to execute a focused biosimilar readiness plan. Yesterday, the launch of a U.S. biosimilar to REMICADE was announced for later this year. However, the appeals process is still ongoing, and we believe any commercial launch of a biosimilar remains at risk. 
Biosimilars are very different from generics. For example, in Canada, Australia and Brazil, where there is already biosimilar competition to REMICADE, we have maintained more than 90% volume share. Our U.S. commercial team is ready for a potential biosimilar launch. 
I'm confident in our strategy for 3 reasons. First, with no biosimilar approved for interchangeability, REMICADE's significant long-term safety data, a strong advocacy from patients and clear physician preference means that the 70% of patients who are stable on REMICADE are highly unlikely to switch. Second, our patient assistance programs provide a leading market differentiator. Third, we are confident that we can continue to provide a cost-effective option in all channels. The current market is extremely competitive, and REMICADE ASP is already significantly lower than the list price 
Additionally, in developing innovative contracts, we can utilize the full breadth of our portfolio. 
Our Immunology franchise remains poised to grow through 2019. We have a strong market position and a deep near-term pipeline. Let me give you some examples. Already in rheumatoid arthritis, SIMPONI ARIA is the fastest-growing IV product in the U.S. and has higher new-to-brand share than REMICADE. Outside of the U.S., we continue to gain share with SIMPONI, too. Additionally, we plan to file 2 line extensions for SIMPONI ARIA in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Together with the recent submissions of sirukumab for the approval in the U.S. and Europe, we will further strengthen our leading position in Rheumatology. 
Turning to psoriasis. STELARA continues to be the #1 biologic in new-to-brand share in the U.S. and maintains clear share leadership in key markets internationally. One of our 10 potential billion-dollars-plus brands, Guselkumab, is expected to provide a significant boost to our leadership in psoriasis, and Bill will share more on this important upcoming filing. 
Finally, moving to Gastroenterology. The most exciting news is the recent launch of STELARA for Crohn's disease in the U.S. and its anticipated launch in Europe. There is tremendous unmet need in this debilitating disease. For example, 70% to 80% of Crohn's patients on anti-TNFs are not in remission at 1 year, and the patient population is expected to grow 50% over the next decade. This is the first in a series of line extensions, including UC, which will drive more than 35% of STELARA performance by 2019. 
Moving now to Cardiovascular and metabolics. INVOKANA continues to be a standout performer. Globally, it is the leading  SGLT2 inhibitor and the third largest known insulin diabetes medicine. Put into perspective, in the U.S., there have been more prescriptions filled for INVOKANA and INVOKAMET than all other SGLT2 inhibitors combined. A total of more than 1.3 million patients are treated in the U.S. alone. 
As Joe mentioned earlier, INVOKANA's performance dipped this quarter due to temporary increased costs to administer copay patient access programs. However, I want to emphasize that this was a transitory event. Our return to growth will be driven by INVOKANA's strong access position across U.S. commercial plans and Medicare Part D and the recent approval of INVOKAMET XR. We are expecting our cardiovascular outcomes data to read out in mid-2017. 
XARELTO is another market leader in our Cardiovascular and metabolics portfolio, delivering double-digit growth every year since its launch in 2011. To date, XARELTO has already treated more than 3.8 million patients in the U.S. and is supported by an extremely robust published real-world dataset, including evidence from more than 91,000 patients demonstrating consistency with our clinical trials. As a result, it is broadly reimbursed, with more than 95% Medicare and commercial patients on formulary at the lowest branded copay. 
These considerable achievements are just a start. Approximately, 54% of potential patients are still utilizing Warfarin, presenting significant growth opportunities in current indications.  Additionally, there are 8 new indications seeking clinical studies underway as part of EXPLORER, the largest clinical development program within the anticoagulant space. If successful, the potential patient pull could increase more than fivefold. 
Turning to Neuroscience. INVEGA TRINZA is a growth catalyst for the entire long-acting therapy franchise. Notably, INVEGA TRINZA is the fastest-growing LAT in the U.S. It has also contributed to growing INVEGA SUSTENNA scripts 26% in the 13 months since launch. 
Significant opportunities for growth remain as only 11% of patients are treated with LATs in the U.S. 
Celebrating 10 years of innovation this year, our HIV portfolio has achieved approximately 20% growth annually and cumulative sales of more than $15 billion. Today, 25% of patients in developed markets are treated with a J&J HIV medicine. Our class-leading portfolio has benefited more than 1 million patients, and this legacy will continue with upcoming line extensions. When Prezista first launched, it was part of a 6-tablet regimen. The first upcoming line extension, darunavir single-tablet regimen, will reduce this number to 1, improving adherence and safety. Also, we expect 2 rilpivirine fixed-dose combinations, one with Gilead's TAF and another one with ViiV's dolutegravir, that will drive additional growth for 2019. 
Finally, let's move to our fastest-growing therapeutic area, Oncology. IMBRUVICA has led the recent growth of our oncology franchise, accelerating from a record-breaking global launch to clear market share leadership in total patients in the first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Today, IMBRUVICA is reimbursed in 41 countries with world-class market access. Since launch, an additional 6 indications have been approved, and we anticipate an additional 7 new registrations ahead, 4 of which have $500 million-plus potential.  Together with a number of promising combination therapies in development, these new indications will usher in a very exciting future for IMBRUVICA. 
IMBRUVICA's leadership in Oncology is mirrored by our recently launched asset, DARZALEX. Only 3 months after its launch, DARZALEX became the #1 prescribed therapy in fourth-line and later multiple myeloma. From a launch-aligned sales perspective, DARZALEX has continued to far outpace its competitors. This first-in-class medicine has since been improved in the EU and Canada and is driving positive share trends in earlier therapy lines in the U.S. We are confident DARZALEX can become the standard of care in multiple myeloma and help even more than the 10,000 patients who have benefited already worldwide. 
Growth will continue to accelerate with the anticipated approval in second-line patient populations and the impressive data from the recently published CASTOR and POLLUX studies. An additional 5 Phase III trials are currently underway as well as development of a subcutaneous formulation. As Bill will detail, we have also seen some positive data that DARZALEX may be effective outside of multiple myeloma. What should be clear today is that all of our current market-leading medicines have significant potential for continued volume growth. 
Additionally, we have a multitude of promising potential line extensions across every therapeutic area, approximately 40 in total, by 2019. Of these, 10 have more than $0.5 billion potential. The remaining 30 potential line extensions are not insignificant.  Cumulatively, the line extensions for XARELTO and INVOKANA have the potential to drive $3 billion to $5 billion in incremental sales for the Cardiovascular franchise. We believe these new indications will be a key driver of our growth through 2019 even in the context of biosimilars and market dynamics. 
In my 6 years leading our Pharmaceutical sector, I have never been more excited and more positive about our future as I am today. We have significant growth potential throughout our portfolio with market-leading brands; 40 anticipated line extensions, 10 of which have more than $0.5 billion potential; and 10 NMEs with more than $1 billion potential to be filed by 2019. Combined, these factors will ensure that we continue to outpace the industry growth through 2019. 
It is now my privilege to turn the call over to Dr. William Hait, who heads up our R&D organization. Bill will provide additional detail about our pipeline that is set to deliver these groundbreaking treatments. Bill?"
139677,381738381,1056642,"Johnson & Johnson, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Johnson & Johnson","Executives","Thank you, Joaquin. Good morning, everyone.

My name is Bill Hait, and I'm the Global Head of Research and Development for the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. 
As Joaquin indicated, at Janssen, we believe that by continuing to execute our current strategy, we will consistently deliver valuable products to patients with serious unmet medical needs and that this will sustain our leadership in the pharmaceutical industry. Our strength is built on a blend of deep internal scientific expertise with industry-leading collaborations through the work of Johnson & Johnson innovation. We continue to find efficiencies that produce savings that we invest in our pipeline, and our strategic focus creates an enviable track record. We are delivering against our anticipated 2015 to 2019 NME and LE results that will produce a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. For these reasons and the results I will describe today, Janssen has become one of the most productive and most respected pharmaceutical companies. 
Before I share with you the details of our pipeline progress, let me explain how and why we have been able to sustain industry-leading results. Our 5 end-to-end therapeutic areas span basic drug discovery through launch and life cycle management. This structure produces a focused, seamless R&D organization, promotes efficient phase transitions and ensures dedication to major unmet medical needs where there is compelling, translatable science. These 5 therapeutic areas concentrate on 11 high-priority disease areas through our disease area strongholds, nimble and efficient biotech-like teams embedded in the broader context of the therapeutic areas. Each disease area stronghold undergoes rigorous triennial review by our external scientific advisory board, receives a priority score and proportional funding of discovery and early development. 
Our therapeutic areas are supported by substantial research capabilities through our centers of excellence, including biotechnology; medicinal chemistry; diagnostics; clinical operations; and, most recently, oligonucleotide and nucleic acid chemistry, expertise garnered through the acquisition of Alios. Assets that transition into late development are prioritized into 3 categories to ensure that our investment of resources align with our most promising targets. Currently, our top 2 categories, which represent 40% of our assets and 80% of our overall late-development value, receives 60% of our investment. It is through this approach that we remain at the top of the industry in successful phase transitions and speed to market. 
Janssen has achieved considerable success, and we are poised to continuously deliver near- and long-term growth. Our balanced investment across all aspects of our pipeline allows us to enjoy a constant flow of important new data. We launched 12 new products since 2011. We received the most FDA approvals from 2011 to 2016 as well as 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations. 
For 4 consecutive years, we have been named the innovation leader by IDEA Pharma and became the partner of choice through the work of J&J innovation. And for the third consecutive year, Fortune Magazine ranked Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson #1 in the pharmaceutical category on its annual World's Most Admired Companies list. Our unwavering commitment to global public health is demonstrated by SIRTURO, the first new drug for the treatment of tuberculosis in over 40 years; as well as our work on new, convenient HIV combinations; the first prime-boost Ebola vaccine using Crucell's adenoviral vector and Bavarian Nordic's MVA vector; as well as new chewable forms of mebendazole for children with worm infestations. 
As Joaquin mentioned and as we highlighted at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review Day, between 2015 and 2019, we plan on filing approximately 10 new drugs, each with a potential for greater than $1 billion in peak year sales and 40 line extensions. This slide highlights 10 of these[ph], anticipated to be filed in the 2015 to 2019 time period, with peak year sales potential greater than $0.5 billion 
In addition, our early pipeline is rich in important assets that have the potential to file between 2020 and 2024. We are on track to deliver our anticipated NME and LE results through a cadence of significant clinical data, regulatory filings and approvals. Since May 2015, we garnered 3 new product approvals and filings, with the fourth, Guselkumab, anticipated this year, and we achieved 16 significant line extensions. 
Now let me use our time together to describe in greater detail some of the progress we have made since our May 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. Oncology is the newest of our 5 therapeutic areas and achieved industry-leading growth based on our development of several first-in-class drugs, including ZYTIGA, IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. Our heme malignancies disease area is anchored by IMBRUVICA and DARZALEX. 
IMBRUVICA, the first BTK inhibitor for the treatment of certain B-cell malignancies, received 4 FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations. IMBRUVICA was recently approved for frontline use, based on the unprecedented results in previously untreated CLL patients reported in the RESONATE-2 study published in the December 15 issue of the New England Journal. As shown on this slide, treatment with ibrutinib decreased progression or death from CLL by 84% compared to chlorambucil and demonstrated a similar improvement in overall survival. 
DARZALEX, the first monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma, received 2 FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations and was approved almost 4 months ahead of its PDUFA date in double-refractory myeloma. As shown on this slide, combination therapy with DARZALEX delivered impressive results in treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients. The CASTOR and POLLUX studies demonstrated that the addition of DARZALEX to Velcade and dexamethasone or REVLIMID and dexamethasone, respectively, produced a greater than 60% decrease in risk of progression or death as compared to that of Vel/dex or REV/dex alone, both of these studies were published in the New England Journal. This month, the FDA granted priority review for daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or bortezomib and  dexamethasone for relapsed multiple myeloma with a PDUFA date in February 2017. 
Our prostate cancer disease area is anchored by ZYTIGA, the first CYP17 inhibitor for the treatment of men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and is approved for both pre- and post-chemotherapy indications. Furthermore, we are developing ARN-509, now known as apalutamide, a more potent next-generation androgen receptor antagonist that shows a high degree of safety and efficacy in castrate-resistant prostate cancer. As seen in these figures, apalutamide decreased PSA by a median of 85% in patients with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer after 12 weeks of treatment. The maximum PSA response, shown on the right-hand figure, was achieved in 94% of patients. 
Earlier this year, we licensed niraparib from TESARO to obtain a highly potent and selective PARP inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer patients with DNA repair defects for use in combination with ZYTIGA or apalutamide. Niraparib is in Phase II clinical trials and currently planned to be filed by 2019. This portfolio of assets gives us confidence that we will continue to bring great results to patients with prostate cancer for many years to come. 
While we did not explicitly address immuno-oncology during our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review, we continue to make significant progress in this area. Over the last 5 years, we invested in 4 critical areas, including vaccines, T-cell checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell redirection and myeloid mechanisms of actions. We currently have 15 immuno-oncology assets in development, including 8 that are in the clinic. 
Recently, we uncovered an important additional mechanism of action of DARZALEX to be immune-mediated through the depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid in lymphoid populations, including a previously unrecognized super-suppressor, CD38+ T-reg population; as well as activation of CD8 and CD4+ effector T-cells. These results provide the impetus for exploring DARZALEX in indications beyond heme malignancies in solid tumors. 
Our Immunology therapeutic area continues to deliver extraordinary products for patients with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. STELARA was the first IL-12, IL-23 monoclonal antibody introduced for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis. It was recently approved in moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in the U.S, received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency and offers new options for adult patients with IBD. 
Guselkumab is a first-in-class selective anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody that demonstrated significant efficacy versus placebo in superiority compared with the antitumor necrosis factor, adalimumab, in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The VOYAGE study, whose results are shown in this slide, randomly assigned 750 patients to receive guselkumab, adalimumab or a placebo followed by guselkumab in a 2:2:1 ratio. Patients treated with guselkumab achieved a significantly greater chance of obtaining a PASI 90 score compared to that of patients treated with adalimumab or a placebo at week 16, and the advantage over adalimumab was sustained through week 48. The high degree of efficacy of guselkumab, the less intensive dosing regimen and the potential for a STELARA-like safety profile makes guselkumab highly competitive with newly launched anti-IL-17 antibodies. We plan to file for psoriasis this year and advance guselkumab into Phase III for patients with psoriatic arthritis. 
Neuroscience is a historically strong area for Janssen since Dr. Paul Janssen and colleagues developed haloperidol, the first medication for schizophrenia. We have built on Dr. Paul's legacy with the development of next-generation antipsychotics and pioneered the development of long-acting injectables that help improve compliance for this difficult-to-treat patient population, most recently with the approval of INVEGA TRINZA, an every-3-month injectable formulation. 
Today, we focus our neuroscience investment in drugs that treat serious mood disorders, including depression, suicidality and Alzheimer's disease. Esketamine, an intranasally-delivered enantiomer of ketamine, produced groundbreaking results in major depressive disorder, with onset of action measured in hours to days rather than weeks to months. There's an alarming increase in suicides, both in the U.S. and globally, more than 41,000 each year in the U.S. alone. It's a tragic issue that's emerging as a major health priority. As shown in this slide, esketamine ameliorated suicidal ideation within 4 hours and sustained this effect for over 3 weeks, leading to its second FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation. 
Infectious Diseases is one of our most exciting and important areas in investment for future growth, where we focus on respiratory infections and hepatitis. We are pursuing an aggressive strategy for the cure of hepatitis C. We recently reported a 100% SVR12 in patients with genotype 1, with both an 8- and 6-week duration of treatment using a 3DAA combination of OLYSIO, AL-335 and  odalasvir.
Based on this exceptional data, we are moving the 3DAA regimen into late-development studies. 
Our Cardiovascular and Metabolism therapeutic area developed both INVOKANA and XARELTO in partnership with Mitsubishi Tanabe and Bayer, respectively. New line extensions are designed to continue to bring value to these 2 first-in-class drugs. With XARELTO, we are pursuing studies in congestive heart failure, embolic stroke of undetermined source, VTE prevention in medically ill patients, infrainguinal peripheral artery disease, VTE prevention in cancer patients and an acute coronary syndrome. We anticipate readouts from 2 INVOKANA cardiovascular outcomes studies by mid-2017, which we believe will further strengthen the importance of the SGLT2 inhibitor class in the treatment of patients with diabetes. We are also studying the role of INVOKANA in diabetic kidney disease and plan to address obesity and prediabetes. 
In summary, at the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, we are executing a clearly defined innovation strategy that drives value to patients around the world. We are on track to meeting our anticipated results described in 2015. We are producing the cadence of transformational innovations that are leading to exceptional results. We are a leader in productivity, approvals and FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations, and we are one of the fastest-growing top 10 pharmaceutical companies. 
We have had the most U.S. FDA approvals in the last 5 years, 2011 to 2016, and 8 Breakthrough Therapy designations. We anticipate filing approximately 10 NMEs between 2015 and 2019, each with greater than $1 billion peak year sales potential.  We have approximately 40 planned line extension filings anticipated between 2015 and 2019, several with greater than $500 million in peak year sales potential, supported by a steady flow of clinical data that drive better patient results. Finally, we take pride in delivering years of lives saved and better quality of life for our first credo responsibility to the doctors, nurses and patients who use our products. 
Now before I turn it over to Dominic, for your reference, let me leave you with a current overview of our pipeline across our 5 therapeutic areas. Dominic will now continue with an update of the company's financial results."

As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we make good progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceu",2501,"Thank you, Bill and Joaquin, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, our Pharmaceutical business is well positioned for continued above-industry growth as we make good progress against the pipeline expectations we communicated at our 2015 Pharmaceutical Business Review. With great leaders like Joaquin and Bill, our strong in-market performance driven by excellent commercial capabilities and our robust R&D pipeline, you can see why we remain confident that our Pharmaceuticals business will continue to be a major driver of growth moving forward. 
I will now turn our discussion back to the quarter. We're pleased with our overall results. As you know, we had a strong start to the year, and as a result, last quarter, we increased our sales and earnings guidance. I'm happy to say we're tracking with those higher expectations while continuing to invest in our business. As you've heard, our Pharmaceutical business delivered strong results this quarter, with underlying operational growth of 10.7%. 
Let me now provide some comments on our other businesses. In our Consumer business, we continued to gain share this quarter. However, as reported by Nielsen, the industry saw a slowdown in many markets, with category growth rates in 2016 about half of the category growth rate we saw in Q3 of 2015. As Joe noted, our sales growth for the quarter was also impacted by lower trade inventory levels. These lower levels are the result of inventory builds in Q3 2015, as we discussed at that time, due to relaunches of certain products as well as inventory reduction programs being implemented at some of the larger retailers this past quarter. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the devaluation that occurred in Venezuela last year and this overall impact from trade inventory reductions, overall consumer growth was nearly 4%. Based on increasing share trend of our brands, we expect trade levels to align with consumption going forward. 
In Medical Devices, consistent with some recent analyst reports about the market, we believe the industry experienced lower hospital admissions and procedure rates during the mid-summer months. 
Late in the quarter, several reports showed higher levels of activity, and in fact, the data that we recently saw published for September looked encouraging. Additionally, we are very pleased to see our priority platforms continue to deliver robust growth of nearly 9%, with some at double digits, as Joe mentioned earlier. 
Overall, Hospital Medical Devices' operational growth, excluding acquisition and divestitures, was approximately 4% this quarter. 
In the Consumer Medical Device businesses, we saw continued price erosion in our Diabetes business. However, in our Vision Care business, we saw good operational growth of 5.5%. 
So in summary, as we previously discussed, in 2015, our underlying operational growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestiture as well as hepatitis C sales and the few extra shipping days that we saw in 2015, was about 5.5%. On this same basis, we continued to accelerate our growth, and we delivered strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 5.9% for the third quarter of 2016. 
Our sales were above analyst estimates, as were earnings, due to significantly higher pretax operating margins. As you may remember, our guidance from January included a more than 200 basis point increase in our 2016 pretax operating margin, on an adjusted basis. We have attained that level year-to-date while continuing to invest in our business, and we remain comfortable with that forecast for the full year as we continue to execute on the restructuring activities in our Medical Device businesses while also investing in growth. 
As you know, in September, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Abbott Medical Optics . We expect this transaction to close in Q1 of 2017. So for 2016, the transaction is expected to have no impact to our adjusted earnings and is not expected to impact our guidance. For 2017, again assuming a Q1 close, the transaction is expected to be positive to sales growth and immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. We are excited about Abbott Medical Optics' strong and differentiated surgical ophthalmic portfolio, particularly in cataract surgery. That, coupled with our world-leading ACUVUE contact lens business, will help us become a broad-based leader in Vision Care. 
Now I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some key points regarding our results for the quarter, and then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for the remainder of 2016. I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2016. Our operational sales growth this quarter was 4.3%, and when we exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of hep C sales and the overall impact that Venezuela had, it was strong at more than 6%. 
If you direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items. As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis, which consisted primarily of the intangible amortization expense of about $250 million and the anticipated special charges as we continue to execute on the Medical Devices restructuring plan. 
Our adjusted earnings per share is, therefore, $1.68, which exceeded the mean of the analysts' estimates, as published by First Call. This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 12.8% versus the prior year.  Adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis was the same as the impact of currency was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's take a few moments and talk about other items on the statement of earnings. Cost of goods sold increased by 30 basis points mostly due to unfavorable transaction currency impacts, partly offset by favorable mix and manufacturing efficiencies. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 290 basis points lower as compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to overall good cost management. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 12.2%, lower by 40 basis points due primarily to lower milestone payments, partly offset by increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipeline. 
Our pretax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32% or 310 basis points higher than the third quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing and administrative expenses and less R&D expenses. As we anticipated, we are seeing improvement as we progressed throughout the year, and through 9 months, we have achieved a 220 basis point improvement in this measure of profitability, consistent with the expectations we communicated to you throughout the year. 
Interest expense net of interest income was similar to last year. Other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $50 million in the quarter compared to a net expense of approximately $400 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in this line, other income and expense was a net gain of approximately $200 million compared to a net gain of approximately $400 million in the prior year period, which included a higher level of gains from divestitures. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.7% compared to 20% in the same period last year. This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit, which was passed by Congress late last year, and it reflects the current mix of our businesses and the impact from a new accounting standard relating to the tax benefit on share-based compensation, which we discussed in our call in July. 
Turning to the next slide. I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment. In the third quarter of 2016, our adjusted income before tax margin for the enterprise improved by 220 basis points versus the third quarter of 2015. You will notice significant improvements in margins for the Medical Devices and Pharmaceutical businesses.
Last year, our Consumer business benefited from a gain in the sale of SPLENDA, and you're seeing that reflected in their lower margin this quarter, although still at very healthy rates.
As you can see on the next slide, on a year-to-date basis, we are pleased to see solid improvement in our consumer margin, and we remain confident it will show an improved adjusted income before tax margin for full year 2016 as compared to 2015.
Overall, we expect adjusted income before tax margins for the enterprise to show an improvement over the prior year for all of 2016 as our increase in pretax operating profit margin, which I noted earlier, more than offsets the lower level of divestiture gains in 2016 as compared to 2015. 
Now I'd like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016. I'd like to start with some of the items that we know you are -- you find difficult to forecast. 
Let's start with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $13 billion of net cash, which consist of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $27 billion of debt. 
Through the end of the third quarter, we completed nearly 60% of our $10 billion share repurchase program, and we expect to complete approximately 75% of the program by the end of this year.
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $450 million. There's a slight tightening of the range. 
Regarding other income and expense as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corp, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We will be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items as a gain, ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, a lower range than our previous guidance related to the underlying activity. This impact will be offset by a lower tax rate.
And now for taxes, we're very comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 18% to 18.5%, which is lower than our previous guidance, primarily due to a higher level of income and lower tax jurisdictions. 
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight. Our sales range for 2016 continues to remain the same whether or not a biosimilar REMICADE launches this year in the U.S.
Additionally, we do not anticipate biosimilar or generic competition this year for PROCRIT, ZYTIGA, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, but as expected, there are generic entrants for INVEGA and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be first based on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business, and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business. 
We've also provided an estimate of our sales and adjusted EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. 
We continue to be comfortable with the sales guidance we provided last quarter, reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between 3% and 4% for the year. This was a result in sales for 2016 on a constant currency basis of between approximately $72.2 billion to $72.9 billion. 
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisition, divestitures and hepatitis C, would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than we saw last year even after adjusting for the shipping days in 2015, which we mentioned earlier. 
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.11, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1% on sales growth. This is consistent with our previous guidance as major currencies had not significantly fluctuated since our last update. 
So after impacts of currency, we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of positive 2% to 3% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion, consistent with our previous guidance. 
And now turning to earnings. As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015. We would be comfortable with adjusted operational EPS guidance in the range between $6.71 and $6.76 per share on a constant currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant currency growth rate of 8% to 9%. And this is a narrowing of the range. 
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, the negative impact to EPS would be approximately $0.03, consistent with our previous guidance. Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.68 to $6.73 per share, which again, is a narrowing of our previous guidance with a midpoint that is $0.03 higher than our previous guidance range. 
Finally, just a reminder of some dynamics you will see in our fourth quarter results this year in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2015, we had additional shipping days based on when our year-end closed, and that contributed approximately 4 points of sales growth in the fourth quarter last year. 
Additionally, in the fourth quarter last year, we closed on the Cordis divestiture. And based on our latest guidance for 2016, we will have significantly lower level of other income from divestitures as compared to the prior year. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our performance so far this year, and we remain confident and optimistic about our future full year growth for 2016. Specifically, we're expecting operational sales growth of 3% to 4% and underlying operational sales growth of 6%, a higher level than we experienced last year on a comparable basis. 
Our adjusted pretax operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out on our guidance of more than a 200-basis point improvement over the prior year. We narrowed our guidance and increased the midpoint for adjusted operational EPS growth, which remains strong in the range of $6.71 to $6.76 per share, with the growth rate of 8% to 9%. And we are very well positioned to seize the opportunities in our strong pipelines to continue fueling our future growth. 
Now I'd like to turn things back to Joe for the Q&A portion of the call. Joe?"

So Dominic, I wanted to focus on the 2017, the puts and takes. Dominic, at our health care conference in September, you said the only real delta from 2016 to 2017 is the rate at which a biosimilar REMICADE could penetrate the market, assuming Pfizer launches at risk, and you don't think the penetration will be dramatic. I took that to mean that you feel that you can grow sales in 2017 at a similar rate to 2016 minus the impact from biosimilar REMICADE. So my questions are, is that the right interpretation? What gives you the confidence that this level of growth will continue? And second, the biosimilar for Neupogen captured about 7% of the market in year 1. Would you expect inflector penetration to be less than that? Any color that you can give on the expected penetration would be helpful. And I did have one follow-up on pharma."

So I think that is a good way to characterize it. We'll provide more color on that when we talk about the 2017 guidance in our discussion in January. We do think that the rate of penetration for a biosimilar will be modest, and there are several reasons for that. As we talked about before, 70% of the patients are treated well with REMICADE. There is no interchangeability available, that's another factor, and we're already in a highly competitive environment with respect to biologics, anti-TNF therapies, as you know. Before any comments on Neupogen, Joaquin, anything else you want to add to overall penetration of biosimilars?"

We are confident that we have a strong plan based on what Dominic described before. There's been 2.6 million patients treated with REMICADE worldwide. There's no interchangeability and there's a clear patient and physician preference, so it's highly unlikely that you're going to be seeing patients that are stable in the REMICADE switched. So that is 70% of the patients. At the same time, we have a strong patient assistance program, which will prove to be a market differentiator, and we are ready to compete in every channel, trying to bring patients the most affordable option in every situation. So we feel well prepared to face the biosimilar. And as Dominic said, we are convinced that we will continue to grow our business in the face of biosimilar competition."

I described part of the reasons for optimists during my conversation before, we not only feel that we are going to be able to grow in the face of biosimilar of the pharmaceutical business, overall, but we also are confident that we're going to be able to grow our immunology franchise in the phase of biosimilars. Let me give you some examples of why going into the 3 segments: Rheumatology, Psoriasis and Gastroenterology. In Rheumatology, SIMPONI and SIMPONI ARIA are doing very well. As a matter of fact, SIMPONI ARIA, it's already leading in new brand -- in new to brand share in Rheumatology in the U.S. And SIMPONI, it's gaining share in all international markets. We plan to file 2 line extensions of SIMPONI ARIA in ankylosing spondylitis and in psoriatic arthritis by 2017. And also we just filed sirukumab with EMEA, and we're planning to file it here in the U.S. before the end of the year. So that gives us a strong confidence that we're going to be continuing to grow in Rheumatology. Then moving into psoriasis, STELARA continues to be the leading in new to brand share in the U.S. and it's leading in most markets internationally. Together with that, we plan to file guselkumab, that we have presented very impressive data at the last EADV, we plan to file guselkumab before the end of the year. So that's another reason why we feel real confident that we will continue to grow in psoriasis. Finally, gastroenterology, which by the way is, for us, is the largest and fastest-growing segment, we just had the approval of STELARA in Crohn's disease and we are now launching it in the U.S. and we anticipate to be launching it in Europe pretty soon. So that is another reason why, which we believe that we're going to be able to continue to grow in immunology. So overall, we have line extensions, with our continuous penetration and also we have the filing of sirukumab and guselkumab in the second half of the year."

Well, I remember that discussion pretty well. I just want to put it into context for everyone. So this was a discussion about the success of our Pharmaceutical business, which has largely been driven by collaboration, licensing, co-development, et cetera, and not at all by any major acquisition, right? And the question that I got posed to me was well, that's been very successful, why would you ever change that, or is there any reason no to consider a change in that strategy. And my comment was, well, to the extent we have 5 major therapeutic areas today, if we decided that another major therapeutic area was of importance to us and we wanted to get into that therapeutic area and we felt we could add a lot to it, but based on our overall scientific knowledge more broadly, that I would see that perhaps being done not by necessary a licensing strategy, but more of an acquisition type strategy. So it would enhance the overall portfolio of Johnson & Johnson's Pharmaceutical business beyond the current therapeutic areas that we currently are in. And by doing that, that might require a more significant acquisition than we've been doing in the pharma business. So that's the context for that."

So what we saw, David, this is through published sources, many of which are from firms such as yours and many of the sell side that publish. We saw -- actually, utilization rates, as depicted in hospital admissions and hospital surgical procedures, with the first quarter of this year being the highest, by far, and then a slowdown in the second quarter, a slowdown even below the level at which most estimates we're depicting, we're forecasting. And then the third quarter was even slower than the second quarter, overall. But there's a very marked difference in September. So once September hit, the data showed quite a rebound from the summer months. And the rate of growth in September was actually faster than what we saw in the first quarter, which was the highest growth quarter year-over-year in terms of penetration. Now whether that remains at that level or whether it's a rebound effect from the summer, we'll have to see. But I think this is all well chronicled in the multiple reports that many of you, I'm sure, have seen. So overall, I'd say we're now in a stable environment in hospital procedures. Going into '17, I express confidence in our Medical Device business growing faster, and quite frankly, we have a plan for that business to return to growth at above market for the medical device sector, and it's continuing to improve. What gives me confidence there is that the areas that we focus the most on, the growth  platforms and priority platforms just this quarter, they grew at 9%, and within those, 3 of those, in particular, electrophysiology, energy and endocutters, each grew at double-digit growth. So we obviously have very robust growth coming in the priority platforms, which we expect to continue and drive us to above-market growth in 2017."

With respect to international tax reform and what we're hearing, I can tell you that I visit in Washington often and speak with members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, and the tax staffs are busily working and working very collaboratively with U.S. multinationals on an appropriate tax reform package. We think there's more bipartisan support now than there has been in the past. We think that often, we hear, as you mentioned, the benefit of investing in U.S. infrastructure as a result of those repatriated earnings coming back into the U.S., so that would be a positive. And we think that, overall, the climate for international tax reform, post the election quite frankly, is more positive than it's been in the last year or so. And then with respect to Proposition 61, there are several opponents to that proposition, and we would prefer to have pricing that is more related to outcomes, evidence-based medicine is something that we are advocates of and therefore, outcome-based pricing is a logical consequence of that.

One is that the asset may be well understood, the business may be well penetrated, the premium required for the asset may be excessive and therefore, to generate value for our shareholders would be a challenge. But it doesn't mean we wouldn't try to do that or we wouldn't look for areas where that may, in fact, be available for us. So that would be across any of the businesses. Within Consumer and Medical Devices, in particular, Consumer, just like we have in Pharma, we have specific areas of focus. We have 11 need states. The primary focus for us is growing internationally in emerging markets, so strong brands and emerging markets, a focus on over-the-counter medications and beauty space, particularly in Asia, are of interest to us. We just did a recent transaction with Dr.Ci:Labo in Japan, where we have an interest in that Asian marketplace and utilizing that brand throughout broader, throughout Asia, beyond Japan where it's currently marketed just as an example of one. And in Medical Devices, as you know, we have a very strong presence in orthopedics and in general surgery. We keep looking for additional bolt-on acquisitions there. And we have a very strong electrophysiology business in cardiovascular, but there are other areas within cardiovascular that seem attractive, in structural heart, and other areas, but the valuation would be something that we'd always consider. So we'd also be very disciplined about doing a transaction where the valuation seem pretty high, which is what they are today."
