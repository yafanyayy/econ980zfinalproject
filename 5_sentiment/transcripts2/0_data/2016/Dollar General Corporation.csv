Today, we reported record results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year. 2015 was an exciting year for Dollar General as we reached over $20 billion in sales and celebrated th",1826,"Thank you, Mary Winn, and thanks to everyone for joining our call. 
Today, we reported record results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year. 2015 was an exciting year for Dollar General as we reached over $20 billion in sales and celebrated the milestone of opening our 12,000th store location.
Today's announced 14% increase in our quarterly cash dividend reaffirms our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. 
For the year, we had our most balanced financial growth since 2011, and delivered results that are in line with the long-term financial model that we announced today. The team is energized by the strong performance in 2015 and is focused on capturing the significant long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead. 
Let's recap some of the additional highlights of 2015. Full year net sales increased 7.7% to a record $20.4 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $226. Same-store sales for the year increase by 2.8%, marking our 26th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.2%. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and nonconsumables.
For the year, operating profit increased above 10% with diluted earnings per share up 13%. Earnings per share improved 11% in the quarter to $1.30 per share. For the 32nd consecutive quarter-over-quarter, we increased both customer traffic and average ticket.
During the year, we returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 17.6 million shares of common stock and the payment of dividends. We opened 730 new stores, increasing our sell-in square footage by 6% and exceeded our combined remodels and relocations targets with 881 stores. 
For 7 years now, our real estate projects have had strong performance. The class of stores in 2014 and 2015 continue to run ahead of our projections. And we are pleased with the performance in the new states we entered in early 2015.
Our distribution center in San Antonio, Texas was completed in January and started shipping the stores in February. We also broke ground on our 14th distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin to help us serve our growing store base in the Midwest. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network and the support our growing store base all while reducing our stem miles. 
In 2015, we accomplished the multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. Importantly, the team executed this initiative without disruption to our business.  The rollout of our targeted labor investments has been implemented across more than 3,100 stores. Since the roll out of this initiative in the second quarter, we have continued to see same-store sales growth for our stores gain traction. Phase 1 and 2 stores have been on the program long enough to see an impact. We are pleased that they are delivering on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores all are showing significant improvement. 
We also had continuing success in improving our shrink performance. Shrink improvement has been, and continues to be, one of our large largest long-term gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink on a store-by-store basis. This progress continues to be broad-based with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments for the year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink. 
We are constantly striving to fill the needs to meet the changing demands of our customers. We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-,12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending January 29, 2016. In the 2015 fourth quarter, we had very solid same-store sales growth of 2.2%, particularly considering the 2014 fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 4.9%. 
In consumables, growth was driven primarily by candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables.
Growth in the nonconsumable categories was broad based with notable strength across seasonal and home, offset by a modest decline in apparel. Even as apparel had a modest decline given the unseasonably warm weather, we had strong growth across holiday events, housewares, home decor, toys and stationary. Our offerings in nonconsumables are on trend and priced right for the key Christmas holiday season.  This represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in our nonconsumable categories. 
Everything we do at Dollar General is centered around our customers. The good news is that our customers are noticing the improvements we are making in our stores, especially as it relates to our on-shelf availability. As we exited 2015, we had our highest customer satisfaction scores in 2 years. As these results indicate, we made excellent progress on a number of fronts in 2015.
As we move into 2016, we have updated our customer segmentation to gain deeper insights into the most relevant groups as the consumer continues to change at a rapid pace. This customer segmentation helps guide our strategies to grow with each of our core customer segments. This was the first recut of our customer segmentation since 2012.
The new segmentation of our customer, one of the most exciting findings, is that we are growing with our most productive customers. These are exciting developments that confirm we are improving our core shopper productivity, while also attracting new key segments, and importantly, retain our trade down customers. These updated customer segmentation findings are integrated across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. We look forward to sharing more insights at our upcoming Investor Day.
The goal is to grow transactions and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance. Our operating priorities continue to include: Driving profitable sales growth; continuing growth opportunities; enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. 
Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In this process, we have assessed the expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. Health and beauty, perishables, party and stationary are areas where we are expanding in 2016. 
For 2016, the team is very focused on implementing these sales-driving initiatives across, not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also to our mature store base to a greater degree than we have in the last several years. 
Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with a refreshed approach. 
We will also leverage operational initiatives, such as improving our on-shelf availability.  We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and nonconsumable sales.
Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016 with a new store layout that we started utilizing in February for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. While it's still early, the results of this DG '16 [ph] layout are very encouraging as our sales performance is meeting our expectations.
In addition, we have been conducting a test and learn from a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 30 stores with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet or about 20% smaller than our traditional stores.
Sales productivity and returns based on the early results are very encouraging. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our urban customers, we believe this smaller format store will allow us to have higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household counts. With this smaller format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for Metro site and smaller lower household rural sites. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate opening 900 new stores, including about 80 of the smaller format stores and relocating or remodeling an additional 875 locations in fiscal 2016. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth with a proven high-return low-risk model. We are disciplined and focused on financial returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2016, and our pipeline is full. 
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. We recently adopted zero-based budgeting to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multiyear time frame, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. Our zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing cost from our business. Our 2016 budget was built through a zero-based budgeting perspective with a clear and defined process to address spending. All of these actions are filtered through 3 lenses. One, is it customer-facing? Second, does it align with our strategic priorities; and finally third, how does it impact our risk profile?
Over the last several years, our SG&A leverage points on comp sales have been running at approximately 3.5% and was trending at a rate that would have been higher in out-years if we had not taken action. Today, our zero-based budgeting initiatives, we have lowered the SG&A leverage point on comp sales to about 2.5% to 3%. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store management and development through great on-boarding and training and open communication. In 2015, we had our lowest level of store manager turnover in 3 years. To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the right skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.
For our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it is always challenging for our core consumer given the pressures on our income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.
Now let me turn the call over to John."

While Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year.

While Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our long-term financial growth model and our guidance convention going forward. 
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 31.8% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 12 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Lower transportation costs and improved freight of inventory shrink were the primary factors of the improved performance, while increased markdowns were a partial offset. This quarter represented our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in gross margin. 
For the quarter, total SG&A as a percentage of sales was even with last year's fourth quarter at 20.2%. The 2015 fourth quarter results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses, retail salaries and occupancy costs, offset by lower utility costs and administrative salaries as a percentage of sales. The 2014 quarter results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points as a percentage of sales related to the acquisition that was not completed. Our tax rate for the quarter was 36.1% compared to 34.8% in the 2014 quarter. This included a $16.5 million or $0.06 per share benefit from the reenactment of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is retroactive to January 1, 2015. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with the acquisition that was not completed. 
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow.  Cash and cash equivalents at year end were $422 million lower than the prior year as we did not buy back shares in the second half of 2014 due to the pending acquisition. Merchandise inventory was $3 billion at fiscal 2015 year end, up about 4.3% on a per-store basis year-over-year. Key factors impacting this increase include our on-shelf availability initiative, the load in for the new distributional center in San Antonio and the timing of receipts due to an early Easter, coupled with our sales performance.  Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Near term, we would expect on ongoing on-shelf availability initiative to impact our inventory level. Going forward, however, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time. In 2015, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of $63 million from the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $505 million in 2015, and included the majority of the cost for our new San Antonio distribution center. For the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock for $290 million. We also paid the quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding, totaling $63 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we've repurchased $3.6 billion or 62 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $920 million under the repurchase program. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividend and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
We are modifying our guidance convention going forward to more closely align with how we are managing the business for long-term shareholder value creation. This is a tremendous business. We have compelling new store economics with significant runway for growth, across channel, customer and product segments that we intend to capture. From our vantage point, the growth model we announced is more of an articulation of how we have been managing the business to deliver consistent, profitable growth and not a change in strategy. In addition, we have heard from our investors that they would like to know what we think our business is capable of over the long term.
We believe that this long-term focus is the best way to model our business. Key components of the model includes the following annual targets: Net sales increase of 7% to 10% with square footage growth of 6% to 8% and same-store sales improvement of 2% of 4%; operating profit growth of 7% to 11%; diluted earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%; cash from operations to be 7% to 8% of sales; capital expenditures to be 2% to 3% of sales; and annual shareholder returns of 11% to 17% defined as EPS growth plus dividend yield.
In 2016, we anticipate share repurchases of approximately $1 billion. This represents about 5% of our market capitalization as of today.  Since the inception of our share repurchases in December of 2011, we have reduced our outstanding share count by about 15%. Given that fiscal 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year for us, we expect the 53rd-week to contribute approximately 200 basis points to our net sales performance and $0.09 per diluted share to EPS. Including the impact of the 53rd-week in fiscal 2016, we expect our net sales and diluted EPS results to be at the high end of the growth ranges provided in our financial growth model as I just outlined.  We anticipate that same-store sales growth will be near the middle of the model's 2% to 4% growth rate. 
As we move into 2016, please keep in mind our most challenging sales overlaps are in the first and second quarters. We do pick up 2 additional sales dates between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Also for 2016, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million. 
At the beginning of today's call, Mary Winn outlined our intentions with respect to updating our 2016 guidance. This information is also in our earnings release issued today. We are confident that we are positioning Dollar General for profitable long-term growth to drive shareholder returns. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back to Todd."

We were delighted with the performance this year on gross margin delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And we continue to see benefits from the numerous levers. We continue to drive shrink rate lower over the quarter. We continue to see transportation efficiencies. We continue to grow our nonconsumables business, 8 quarters of consecutive improvement, which, as you know, carries the higher margin rate with it. And we continue to effectively manage all the additional levers of category management, private label penetration, foreign sourcing penetration and distribution efficiencies. And we continue to see opportunities for growth on the gross margin side and the SG&A side, with the introduction of zero-based budgeting, we've always had a very disciplined cost management process here with work elimination, but with zero-based budgeting implemented from a position of strength, that's one more tool at our disposal to manage that. So as we look at the 2 in tandem, we continue to see operating profit margin expansion growth over time. That's contemplated in our model. And as you look at the opportunity to drive total shareholder returns of 11% to 17%, each year and the potential -- and we're really focused on the long-term growth as well. So the ability to drive those types of returns in a consistent manner and deliver long-term value creation is really what we're focused on and what we've built into the model."

Now obviously, we had a little bit of a leather hiccup here in Q4, but we don't see our apparel business slowing down as we go into 2016. Matter of fact, we're pretty bullish on apparel. Cindy and her team have done a really nice job in giving us some very competitive offering there. But again, we'll continue to monitor all categories, and if we feel we need to contract at times and expand in others, we'll definitely do so."

But again, because of that 6,000 square foot box, we can keep that also from getting too far out of bounds because, again, trying to manage 6,000 square feet versus the 7,400 square foot workforce that we have is a little less complex. Then you couple that with the changing of them mix, and depending on the area that we put these stores, the consumable mix does increase a little bit, which does put a little pressure on gross margin rate. But again, when you look at overall return, because of the smaller box, it cost less to get into it, it cost less -- or it doesn't cost as much to operate it from a lot of different areas. And then couple that with some good sales and sales per square foot, which is higher than our normal box, then the whole equation works pretty nicely."

Today, we reported record results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year. 2015 was an exciting year for Dollar General as we reached over $20 billion in sales and celebrated the milestone of opening our 12,000th store location.
Today's announced 14% increase in our quarterly cash dividend reaffirms our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. 
For the year, we had our most balanced financial growth since 2011, and delivered results that are in line with the long-term financial mile that we announced today. The team is energized by the strong performance in 2015 and is focused on capturing the significant long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead. 
Let's recap some of the additional highlights of 2015. Full year net sales increased 7.7% to a record $20.4 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $226. Same-store sales for the year increase by 2.8%, marking our 26th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.2%. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables.
For the year, operating profit increased above 10% with diluted earnings per share up 13%. Earnings per share improved 11% in the quarter to $1.30 per share. For the 32nd consecutive quarter-over-quarter, we increased both customer traffic and average ticket.
During the year, we returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 17.6 million shares of common stock and the payment of dividends. We opened 730 new stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6% and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 881 stores. 
For 7 years now, our real estate projects have had strong performance. The class of stores in 2014 and 2015 continue to run ahead of our projections. And we are pleased with the performance in the new states we entered in early 2015.
Our distribution center in San Antonio, Texas, was completed in January and started shipping to stores in February. We also broke ground on our 14th distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, to help us serve our growing store base in the Midwest. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network and to support our growing store base, all while reducing our stem miles. 
In 2015, we accomplished the multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. Importantly, the team executed this initiative without disruption to our business. The rollout of our targeted labor investments has been implemented across more than 3,100 stores. Since the rollout of this initiative in the second quarter, we have continued to see same-store sales growth for our stores gain traction. Phase 1 and 2 stores have been on the program long enough to see an impact. We are pleased that they are delivering on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores, all are showing significant improvement. 
We also had continuing success in improving our shrink performance. Shrink improvement has been, and continues to be, one of our largest long-term gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink on a store-by-store basis. This progress continues to be broad-based with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments for the year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink. 
We are constantly striving to fill the needs to meet the changing demands of our customers. We continue to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-,12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending January 29, 2016. In the 2015 fourth quarter, we had very solid same-store sales growth of 2.2%, particularly considering the 2014 fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 4.9%. 
In consumables, growth was driven primarily by candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables.
Growth in the non-consumable categories was broad-based with notable strength across seasonal and home, offset by a modest decline in apparel. Even as apparel had a modest decline given the unseasonably warm weather, we had strong growth across holiday events, housewares, home decor, toys and stationery. Our offerings in non-consumables are on trend and priced right for the key Christmas holiday season. This represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in our non-consumable categories. 
Everything we do at Dollar General is centered around our customers. The good news is that our customers are noticing the improvements we are making in our stores, especially as it relates to our on-shelf availability. As we exited 2015, we had our highest customer satisfaction scores in 2 years. As these results indicate, we made excellent progress on a number of fronts in 2015.
As we move into 2016, we have updated our customer segmentation to gain deeper insights into the most relevant groups as the consumer continues to change at a rapid pace. This customer segmentation helps guide our strategies to grow with each of our core customer segments. This was the first recut of our customer segmentation since 2012.
The new segmentation of our customer, one of the most exciting findings is that we are growing with our most productive customers. These are exciting developments that confirm we are improving our core shopper productivity, while also attracting new key segments, and importantly, retain our trade-down customers. These updated customer segmentation findings are integrated across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. We look forward to sharing more insights at our upcoming Investor Day.
The goal is to grow transactions and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance. Our operating priorities continue to include: Driving profitable sales growth; continuing growth opportunities; enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. 
Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In this process, we have assessed the expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. Health and beauty, perishables, party and stationery are areas where we are expanding in 2016. 
For 2016, the team is very focused on implementing these sales-driving initiatives across, not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also to our mature store base to a greater degree than we have in the last several years. 
Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with a refreshed approach. 
We will also leverage operational initiatives, such as improving our on-shelf availability. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales.
Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016 with a new store layout that we started utilizing in February for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. While it's still early, the results of this DG '16 layout are very encouraging as our sales performance is meeting our expectations.
In addition, we have been conducting a test and learn for a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 30 stores with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet or about 20% smaller than our traditional stores.
Sales productivity and returns based on the early results are very encouraging. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our urban customers, we believe this smaller format store will allow us to have higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household counts. With this smaller format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller lower household rural sites. 
Looking ahead, we anticipate opening 900 new stores, including about 80 of the smaller format stores and relocating or remodeling an additional 875 locations in fiscal 2016. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth with a proven high-return, low-risk model. We are disciplined and focused on financial returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2016, and our pipeline is full. 
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. We recently adopted zero-based budgeting to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multiyear time frame, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. Our zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing cost from our business. Our 2016 budget was built through a zero-based budgeting perspective with a clear and defined process to address spending. All of these actions are filtered through 3 lenses; One, is it customer-facing?; second, does it align with our strategic priorities?; and finally third, how does it impact our risk profile?
Over the last several years, our SG&A leverage point on comp sales has been running at approximately 3.5% and was trending at a rate that would have been higher in out-years if we had not taken action. Today, our zero-based budgeting initiatives, we have lowered the SG&A leverage point on comp sales to about 2.5% to 3%. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. In 2015, we had our lowest level of store manager turnover in 3 years. To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the right skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.
For our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it is always challenging for our core consumer given the pressures on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.
Now, let me turn the call over to John."

While Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year.

While Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our long-term financial growth model and our guidance convention going forward. 
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 31.8% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 12 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Lower transportation costs and improved rate of inventory shrink were the primary factors of the improved performance, while increased markdowns were a partial offset. This quarter represented our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in gross margin. 
For the quarter, total SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was even with last year's fourth quarter at 20.2%. The 2015 fourth quarter results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses, retail salaries and occupancy costs, offset by lower utility costs and administrative salaries as a percentage of sales. The 2014 quarter results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points, as a percentage of sales, related to the acquisition that was not completed. Our tax rate for the quarter was 36.1% compared to 34.8% in the 2014 quarter. This included a $16.5 million or $0.06 per share benefit from the re-enactment of the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is retroactive to January 1, 2015. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with the acquisition that was not completed. 
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $422 million lower than the prior year as we did not buy back shares in the second half of 2014 due to the pending acquisition. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at fiscal 2015 year-end, up about 4.3% on a per-store basis year-over-year. Key factors impacting this increase include our on-shelf availability initiative, the load in for the new distribution center in San Antonio and the timing of receipts due to an early Easter, coupled with our sales performance. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Near term, we would expect our ongoing on-shelf availability initiative to impact our inventory level. Going forward, however, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time. In 2015, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of $63 million from the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $505 million in 2015, and included the majority of the cost for our new San Antonio distribution center. For the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock for $290 million. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding, totaling $63 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we've repurchased $3.6 billion or 62 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $920 million under the repurchase program. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. 
We are modifying our guidance convention going forward to more closely align with how we are managing the business for long-term shareholder value creation. This is a tremendous business. We have compelling new store economics with significant runway for growth, across channel, customer and product segments that we intend to capture. From our vantage point, the growth model we announced today is more of an articulation of how we have been managing the business to deliver consistent, profitable growth and not a change in strategy. In addition, we have heard from our investors that they would like to know what we think our business is capable of over the long term.
We believe that this long-term focus is the best way to model our business. Key components of the model includes the following annual targets: Net sales increase of 7% to 10% with square footage growth of 6% to 8% and same-store sales improvement of 2% of 4%; operating profit growth of 7% to 11%; diluted earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%; cash from operations to be 7% to 8% of sales; capital expenditures to be 2% to 3% of sales; and annual shareholder returns of 11% to 17% defined as EPS growth plus dividend yield.
In 2016, we anticipate share repurchases of approximately $1 billion. This represents about 5% of our market capitalization as of today. Since the inception of our share repurchases in December of 2011, we have reduced our outstanding share count by about 15%. Given that fiscal 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year for us, we expect the 53rd week to contribute approximately 200 basis points to our net sales performance and $0.09 per diluted share to EPS. Including the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, we expect our net sales and diluted EPS results to be at the high end of the growth ranges provided in our financial growth model as I just outlined. We anticipate that same-store sales growth will be near the middle of the model's 2% to 4% growth rate. 
As we move into 2016, please keep in mind our most challenging sales overlaps are in the first and second quarters. We do pick up 2 additional sales dates between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Also, for 2016, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million. 
At the beginning of today's call, Mary Winn outlined our intentions with respect to updating our 2016 guidance. This information is also in our earnings release issued today. We are confident that we are positioning Dollar General for profitable long-term growth to drive shareholder returns. 
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Todd."

We were able to deliver record financial performance, while positioning the company to capture accelerated square footage growth. We continue to have significant opportunities for high-return, low-risk organic growth. I look forward to sharing more details about our long-term strategies at our Investor Day scheduled for March 24, here in Nashville, where we plan to further discuss our growth drivers for the long term. 
Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and dividends.
I would like to thank the more than 113,000 Dollar General employees for all their hard work during the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015, all while fulfilling our mission of serving others. As a team, we are looking forward to 2016 as we build on our performance from 2015. 
With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

Some of the newer opportunities that have been unlocked in metro and in smaller rural areas with smaller household counts, because of our new smaller store, it gives us the confidence as we go forward that we can actually expand that -- that square footage growth if we think we need to as we go forward.

And as you alluded to, we really look to manage our gross margin and SG&A in tandem. And we continue to have numerous levers within gross margin. We were delighted with the performance this year on gross margin delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And we continue to see benefits from the numerous levers. We continue to drive shrink rates lower over the quarter. We continue to see transportation efficiencies. We continue to grow our non-consumables business, 8 quarters of consecutive improvement, which, as you know, carries the higher margin rate with it. And we continue to effectively manage all the additional levers of category management, private label penetration, foreign sourcing penetration and distribution efficiencies. And we continue to see opportunities for growth on the gross margin side and on the SG&A side, with the introduction of zero-based budgeting, we've always had a very disciplined cost management process here with work elimination, but with zero-based budgeting implemented from a position of strength, that's one more tool at our disposal to manage that. So as we look at the 2 in tandem, we continue to see operating profit margin expansion growth over time. That's contemplated in our model. And as you look at the opportunity to drive total shareholder returns of 11% to 17% each year and the potential, and we're really focused on the long-term growth as well. So the ability to drive those types of returns in a consistent manner and deliver long-term value creation is really what we're focused on and what we've built into the model."

The lags were a little tougher in the beginning of the year and get little easier towards the back. But make no bones about it, our initiatives that we've got this year are the strongest that I've seen here in the last 2 to 3 years. Not only the perishable that I just talked about, but as I've talked about in my prepared remarks, our health and beauty initiative as well as our party and stationery pieces really should help drive some of those initiatives as we go forward. You couple that with the work that our operators are doing on on-shelf availability and making product available when the consumer comes in the door at a very high rate, we think that guiding in where we did makes a lot of sense.

So she can afford to take a flyer, if you will, to go out and buy something at -- on a national brand basis that maybe a little larger size without ever having tried it. But if we can offer her a national brand offering, as an example, at a very small size that she can afford, say, at $1, it gives her that trial. And once she has that trial, what we've seen is it becomes then, it migrates into acceptance, and she moves from that $1 offering and actually trades up to the larger sizes.

Then you couple that with the changing of the mix, and depending on the area that we put these stores, the consumable mix does increase a little bit, which does put a little pressure on gross margin rate. But again, when you look at overall return, because of the smaller box, it costs less to get into it, costs less -- or it doesn't cost as much to operate it from a lot of different areas, and then, coupled that with some good sales and sales per square foot, which is higher than our normal box, then the whole equation works pretty nicely."

It's somewhere in that 6- to 8-plus feet. It depends on the store. It could go upwards of 16 feet in some areas. But what we're doing is we're not -- this isn't a one size fits all either. We're taking a look at shrink, we're taking a look at where the stores are located. And the other nice thing about this is it has a healthy balance of private brands.

          Today, we reported record results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year. 2015 was an exciting year for Dollar General as we reached over $20 billion in sales and celebrated the milestone of opening our 12,000th store location.
Today's announced 14% increase in our quarterly cash dividend reaffirms our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects. 
          For the year, we had our most balanced financial growth since 2011, and delivered results that are in line with the long-term financial model that we announced today. The team is energized by the strong performance in 2015 and is focused on capturing the significant long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead. 
          Let's recap some of the additional highlights of 2015. Full year net sales increased 7.7% to a record $20.4 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $226. Same-store sales for the year increase by 2.8%, marking our 26th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.2%. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables.
For the year, operating profit increased above [ph] 10% with diluted earnings per share up 13%. Earnings per share improved 11% in the quarter to $1.30 per share. For the 32nd consecutive quarter-over-quarter, we increased both customer traffic and average ticket.
During the year, we returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 17.6 million shares of common stock and the payment of dividends. We opened 730 new stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6% and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 881 stores. 
          For 7 years now, our real estate projects have had strong performance. The class of stores in 2014 and 2015 continue to run ahead of our projections. And we are pleased with the performance in the new states we entered in early 2015.
Our distribution center in San Antonio, Texas, was completed in January and started shipping to stores in February. We also broke ground on our 14th distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, to help us serve our growing store base in the Midwest. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network and to support our growing store base, all while reducing our stem miles. 
          In 2015, we accomplished the multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. Importantly, the team executed this initiative without disruption to our business. The rollout of our targeted labor investments has been implemented across more than 3,100 stores. Since the rollout of this initiative in the second quarter, we have continued to see same-store sales growth for our stores gained traction. Phase 1 and 2 stores have been on the program long enough to see an impact. We are pleased that they are delivering on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores, all are showing significant improvement. 
          We also had continuing success in improving our shrink performance. Shrink improvement has been, and continues to be, one of our largest long-term gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink on a store-by-store basis. This progress continues to be broad-based with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments for the year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink. 
          We are constantly striving to fill the needs to meet the changing demands of our customers. We continued to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-,12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending January 29, 2016. In the 2015 fourth quarter, we had very solid same-store sales growth of 2.2%, particularly considering the 2014 fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 4.9%. 
          In consumables, growth was driven primarily by candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables.
Growth in the non-consumable categories was broad-based with notable strength across seasonal and home, offset by a modest decline in apparel. Even as apparel had a modest decline given the unseasonably warm weather, we had strong growth across holiday events, housewares, home decor, toys and stationery. Our offerings in non-consumables are on trend and priced right for the key Christmas holiday season. This represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in our non-consumable categories. 
          Everything we do at Dollar General is centered around our customers. The good news is that our customers are noticing the improvements we are making in our stores, especially as it relates to our on-shelf availability. As we exited 2015, we had our highest customer satisfaction scores in 2 years. As these results indicate, we made excellent progress on a number of fronts in 2015.
As we move into 2016, we have updated our customer segmentation to gain deeper insights into the most relevant groups as the consumer continues to change at a rapid pace. This customer segmentation helps guide our strategies to grow with each of our core customer segments. This was the first recut of our customer segmentation since 2012.
The new segmentation of our customer, one of the most exciting findings is that we are growing with our most productive customers. These are exciting developments that confirm we are improving our core shopper productivity, while also attracting new key segments, and importantly, retaining our trade-down customers. These updated customer segmentation findings are integrated across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. We look forward to sharing more insights at our upcoming Investor Day.
The goal is to grow transactions and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance. Our operating priorities continue to include: Driving profitable sales growth; continuing growth opportunities; enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. 
          Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In this process, we have assessed the expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. Health and beauty, perishables, party and stationery are areas where we are expanding in 2016. 
          For 2016, the team is very focused on implementing these sales-driving initiatives across, not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also to our mature store base to a greater degree than we have in the last several years. 
          Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with a refreshed approach. 
          We will also leverage operational initiatives, such as improving our on-shelf availability. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales.
Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016 with a new store layout that we started utilizing in February for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. While it's still early, the results of this DG '16 layout are very encouraging as our sales performance is meeting our expectations.
In addition, we have been conducting a test and learn for a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 30 stores with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet or about 20% smaller than our traditional stores.
Sales productivity and returns based on the early results are very encouraging. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our urban customers, we believe this smaller format store will allow us to have higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household counts. With this smaller format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. 
          Looking ahead, we anticipate opening 900 new stores, including about 80 of the smaller format stores and relocating or remodeling an additional 875 locations in fiscal 2016. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth with a proven high-return, low-risk model. We are disciplined and focused on financial returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2016, and our pipeline is full. 
          Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. We recently adopted zero-based budgeting to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multiyear time frame, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. Our zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing costs from our business. Our 2016 budget was built through a zero-based budgeting perspective with a clear and defined process to address spending. All of these actions are filtered through 3 lenses. One, is it customer-facing? Second, does it align with our strategic priorities? And finally third, how does it impact our risk profile?
Over the last several years, our SG&A leverage point on comp sales has been running at approximately 3.5% and was trending at a rate that would have been higher in out-years if we had not taken action. Today, our zero-based budgeting initiatives, we have lowered the SG&A leverage point on comp sales to about 2.5% to 3%. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. In 2015, we had our lowest level of store manager turnover in 3 years. To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the right skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.
For our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it is always challenging for our core consumer given the pressures on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.
Now, let me turn the call over to John."

While Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year. I will also spend som",1026,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. While Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our long-term financial growth model and our guidance convention going forward. 
          Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 31.8% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 12 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Lower transportation costs and an improved rate of inventory shrink were the primary factors of the improved performance, while increased markdowns were a partial offset. This quarter represented our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in gross margin. 
          For the quarter, total SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was even with last year's fourth quarter at 20.2%. The 2015 fourth quarter results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses, retail salaries and occupancy costs, offset by lower utility costs and administrative salaries as a percentage of sales. The 2014 quarter results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points, as a percentage of sales, related to the acquisition that was not completed. Our tax rate for the quarter was 36.1% compared to 34.8% in the 2014 quarter. This included a $16.5 million or $0.06 per share benefit from the re-enactment of the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is retroactive to January 1, 2015. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with the acquisition that was not completed. 
          Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $422 million lower than the prior year as we did not buy back shares in the second half of 2014 due to the pending acquisition. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at fiscal 2015 year-end, up about 4.3% on a per-store basis year-over-year. Key factors impacting this increase include our on-shelf availability initiative, the load-in for the new distribution center in San Antonio and the timing of receipts due to an early Easter, coupled with our sales performance. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Near term, we would expect our ongoing on-shelf availability initiative to impact our inventory level. Going forward, however, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time. In 2015, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of $63 million from the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $505 million in 2015, and included the majority of the costs for our new San Antonio distribution center. For the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock for $290 million. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding, totaling $63 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased $3.6 billion or 62 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $920 million under the repurchase program. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
          We are modifying our guidance convention going forward to more closely align with how we are managing the business for long-term shareholder value creation. This is a tremendous business. We have compelling new store economics with significant runway for growth, across channel, customer and product segments that we intend to capture. From our vantage point, the growth model we announced today is more of an articulation of how we have been managing the business to deliver consistent, profitable growth and not a change in strategy. In addition, we have heard from our investors that they would like to know what we think our business is capable of over the long term.
We believe that this long-term focus is the best way to model our business. Key components of the model include the following annual targets: Net sales increase of 7% to 10% with square footage growth of 6% to 8% and same-store sales improvement of 2% of 4%; operating profit growth of 7% to 11%; diluted earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%; cash from operations to be 7% to 8% of sales; capital expenditures to be 2% to 3% of sales; and annual shareholder returns of 11% to 17% defined as EPS growth plus dividend yield.
In 2016, we anticipate share repurchases of approximately $1 billion. This represents about 5% of our market capitalization as of today. Since the inception of our share repurchases in December of 2011, we have reduced our outstanding share count by about 15%. Given that fiscal 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year for us, we expect the 53rd week to contribute approximately 200 basis points to our net sales performance and $0.09 per diluted share to EPS. Including the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, we expect our net sales and diluted EPS results to be at the high end of the growth ranges provided in our financial growth model as I just outlined. We anticipate that same-store sales growth will be near the middle of the model's 2% to 4% growth rate. 
          As we move into 2016, please keep in mind our most challenging sales overlaps are in the first and second quarters. We do pick up 2 additional sales dates between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Also, for 2016, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million. 
          At the beginning of today's call, Mary Winn outlined our intentions with respect to updating our 2016 guidance. This information is also in our earnings release issued today. We are confident that we are positioning Dollar General for profitable long-term growth to drive shareholder returns. 
          Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Todd."

And as you alluded to, we really look to manage our gross margin and SG&A in tandem. And we continue to have numerous levers within gross margin. We were delighted with the performance this year on gross margin delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And we continue to see benefits from the numerous levers. We continue to drive shrink rates lower over the quarter. We continued to see transportation efficiencies. We continue to grow our non-consumables business, 8 quarters of consecutive improvement, which, as you know, carries a higher margin rate with it. And we continue to effectively manage all the additional levers of category management, private label penetration, foreign sourcing penetration and distribution efficiencies. And we continue to see opportunities for growth on the gross margin side and on the SG&A side, with the introduction of zero-based budgeting, we've always had a very disciplined cost management process here with work elimination, but with zero-based budgeting implemented from a position of strength, that's one more tool at our disposal to manage that. So as we look at the 2 in tandem, we continue to see operating profit margin expansion growth over time. That's contemplated in our model. And as you look at the opportunity to drive total shareholder returns of 11% to 17% each year and the potential -- and we're really focused on the long-term growth as well. So the ability to drive those types of returns in a consistent manner and deliver long-term value creation is really what we're focused on and what we've built into the model."

We are monitoring, and we always have our wages, both from our hourly rates as well as our store managers. And while we remain very committed to ensure that we pay competitive rates out there, and we'll continue to do that, but I have to tell you, what we have seen as we exited 2015 and now entering 2016, our critical staffing at the hourly level is at the highest levels that we've seen in a couple of years. And that's very good because what that shows is that our pool of candidates coming in are very, very robust. So while we'll always monitor it and we will definitely pay competitive wages, which we have, and will continue to do so, we haven't seen the overwhelming pressure as of yet that some have been talking about. But at the end of the day, for our hourly folks, the great thing about it is that they can quickly move up from being an hourly associate to being a key carrier and even an assistant manager in very short order. And we like to say here and when we recruit people that we can actually take someone from a job to a career in less than a couple of years. And you don't really find that very often, especially in consumable retailing."

And again, as we went through this, and because we did it from a position of strength, we're really able to go through it with a filter that Todd mentioned of moving out those costs that didn't touch the customer, that weren't aligned with our strategic priorities, that didn't present risk and allowing us to put it in the most productive places. And the team has really rallied upon that. It's really changed the mindset in terms of how we look at the business and people apply this filter in everything we do. And we're delighted with having actions in place coming into this year, built into the budget that allows us to move that leverage point from 3.5% to 2.5% to 3%, while allowing for some targeted reinvestments in the business to keep that consistent growth going. We think that's a good place to be. We see our ability to continue that.

It's somewhere in that 6- to 8-plus feet. It depends on the store. It could go upwards of 16 feet in some areas. But what we're doing is we're not -- this isn't a one size fits all either. We're taking a look at shrink, we're taking a look at where the stores are located. And the other nice thing about this is it has a healthy balance of private brands. And as we all know, private brands, very good profitability, but also doesn't shrink near as much as your national brands. So I think when you couple all that together, I think this should be a real win for our consumers at Dollar General."

The great thing that we're seeing here is that the basket size is significantly larger than our normal basket size without using digital coupons. And the other thing that our marketeers, along with our IT department, have recently done has made sign-up at the store very, very, very easy. Matter of fact, we went from -- to over 3 to 4 minutes to sign-up to now we can sign-up in a minute or less. And that has really helped propel the sign-ups at store level. So we're very bullish on what that will bring us into 2016 and beyond. And you have to remember, some of this newfound money that our consumer has gotten over the last year to 1.5 years between going back to work and less gas -- and the gas prices being a little lower, she's reinvested some of that findings for her into smartphones. And we have seen that our smartphone usage from our core consumer has gone up a lot. Matter of fact, it has now -- has crested over 85%, where just a few short years ago, we were in the 40-some percent range on usage. So you couple all that, she is now ready to really go digital.

Today, we reported record results for the fourth quarter of 2015 and the full year. 2015 was an exciting year for Dollar General as we reached over $20 billion in sales and celebrated the milestone of opening our 12,000th store location.
Today's announced 14% increase in our quarterly cash dividend reaffirms our continued confidence in our long-term growth prospects.
For the year, we had our most balanced financial growth since 2011, and delivered results that are in line with the long-term financial model that we announced today. The team is energized by the strong performance in 2015 and is focused on capturing the significant long-term growth opportunities that lie ahead.
Let's recap some of the additional highlights of 2015. Full year net sales increased 7.7% to a record $20.4 billion, and sales per square foot increased to $226. Same-store sales for the year increase by 2.8%, marking our 26th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. Our same-store sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.2%. In the quarter, same-store sales growth was balanced across both consumables and non-consumables.
For the year, operating profit increased above [ph] 10% with diluted earnings per share up 13%. Earnings per share improved 11% in the quarter to $1.30 per share. For the 32nd consecutive quarter-over-quarter, we increased both customer traffic and average ticket.
During the year, we returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 17.6 million shares of common stock and the payment of dividends. We opened 730 new stores, increasing our selling square footage by 6% and exceeded our combined remodels and relocation targets with 881 stores.
For 7 years now, our real estate projects have had strong performance. The class of stores in 2014 and 2015 continue to run ahead of our projections. And we are pleased with the performance in the new states we entered in early 2015.
Our distribution center in San Antonio, Texas, was completed in January and started shipping to stores in February. We also broke ground on our 14th distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, to help us serve our growing store base in the Midwest. These investments are key to driving the efficiency and speed of our network and to support our growing store base, all while reducing our stem miles.
In 2015, we accomplished the multiyear rollout of our enterprise resource planning software for our supply chain. This technology platform represents a significant improvement with enhanced integration to allow for demand forecasting from the vendor to shelf. Importantly, the team executed this initiative without disruption to our business. The rollout of our targeted labor investments has been implemented across more than 3,100 stores. Since the rollout of this initiative in the second quarter, we have continued to see same-store sales growth for our stores gained traction. Phase 1 and 2 stores have been on the program long enough to see an impact. We are pleased that they are delivering on our return expectations. Specifically, in these stores, the key metrics of same-store sales, transactions, average basket and customer satisfaction scores, all are showing significant improvement.
We also had continuing success in improving our shrink performance. Shrink improvement has been, and continues to be, one of our largest long-term gross margin opportunities. We remain committed to reducing our shrink on a store-by-store basis. This progress continues to be broad-based with shrink declining across nearly 70% of our product departments for the year. Going forward, our teams continue to be focused on leveraging our defensive merchandising tools, technology and training to further reduce shrink.
We are constantly striving to fill the needs to meet the changing demands of our customers. We continued to increase our overall market share of consumables in both units and dollars across all markets over the 4-,12-, 24- and 52-week periods ending January 29, 2016. In the 2015 fourth quarter, we had very solid same-store sales growth of 2.2%, particularly considering the 2014 fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 4.9%.
In consumables, growth was driven primarily by candy and snacks, tobacco and perishables.
Growth in the non-consumable categories was broad-based with notable strength across seasonal and home, offset by a modest decline in apparel. Even as apparel had a modest decline given the unseasonably warm weather, we had strong growth across holiday events, housewares, home decor, toys and stationery. Our offerings in non-consumables are on trend and priced right for the key Christmas holiday season. This represented the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in our non-consumable categories.
Everything we do at Dollar General is centered around our customers. The good news is that our customers are noticing the improvements we are making in our stores, especially as it relates to our on-shelf availability. As we exited 2015, we had our highest customer satisfaction scores in 2 years. As these results indicate, we made excellent progress on a number of fronts in 2015.
As we move into 2016, we have updated our customer segmentation to gain deeper insights into the most relevant groups as the consumer continues to change at a rapid pace. This customer segmentation helps guide our strategies to grow with each of our core customer segments. This was the first recut of our customer segmentation since 2012.
The new segmentation of our customer, one of the most exciting findings is that we are growing with our most productive customers. These are exciting developments that confirm we are improving our core shopper productivity, while also attracting new key segments, and importantly, retaining our trade-down customers. These updated customer segmentation findings are integrated across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. We look forward to sharing more insights at our upcoming Investor Day.
The goal is to grow transactions and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance. Our operating priorities continue to include: Driving profitable sales growth; continuing growth opportunities; enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage.
Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips and capture share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In this process, we have assessed the expansion of categories that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. Health and beauty, perishables, party and stationery are areas where we are expanding in 2016.
For 2016, the team is very focused on implementing these sales-driving initiatives across, not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also to our mature store base to a greater degree than we have in the last several years.
Our ongoing affordability initiative will be front and center with a refreshed approach.
We will also leverage operational initiatives, such as improving our on-shelf availability. We have ongoing opportunities for gross margin expansion through improvements in shrink, global sourcing, private brands, distribution and transportation efficiencies and non-consumable sales.
Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Examples include our accelerated square footage growth in 2016 with a new store layout that we started utilizing in February for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. While it's still early, the results of this DG '16 layout are very encouraging as our sales performance is meeting our expectations.
In addition, we have been conducting a test and learn for a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 30 stores with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet or about 20% smaller than our traditional stores.
Sales productivity and returns based on the early results are very encouraging. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our urban customers, we believe this smaller format store will allow us to have higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household counts. With this smaller format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites.
Looking ahead, we anticipate opening 900 new stores, including about 80 of the smaller format stores and relocating or remodeling an additional 875 locations in fiscal 2016. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth with a proven high-return, low-risk model. We are disciplined and focused on financial returns. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2016, and our pipeline is full.
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. We recently adopted zero-based budgeting to proactively improve our efficiencies and reduce expenses over a multiyear time frame, all while giving us the flexibility to reinvest savings to drive growth. Our zero-based budgeting approach is a refreshed commitment to removing costs from our business. Our 2016 budget was built through a zero-based budgeting perspective with a clear and defined process to address spending. All of these actions are filtered through 3 lenses. One, is it customer-facing? Second, does it align with our strategic priorities? And finally third, how does it impact our risk profile?
Over the last several years, our SG&A leverage point on comp sales has been running at approximately 3.5% and was trending at a rate that would have been higher in out-years if we had not taken action. Today, our zero-based budgeting initiatives, we have lowered the SG&A leverage point on comp sales to about 2.5% to 3%. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. In 2015, we had our lowest level of store manager turnover in 3 years. To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the right skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover.
For our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it is always challenging for our core consumer given the pressures on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General.
Now, let me turn the call over to John."

While Todd has taken you through the highlights of 2015 and our strategic initiatives for 2016, let me now take you through some of the important financial details of the quarter and year. I will also spend some time discussing our long-term financial growth model and our guidance convention going forward.
Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 31.8% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 12 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Lower transportation costs and an improved rate of inventory shrink were the primary factors of the improved performance, while increased markdowns were a partial offset. This quarter represented our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in gross margin.
For the quarter, total SG&A, as a percentage of sales, was even with last year's fourth quarter at 20.2%. The 2015 fourth quarter results reflect increases in incentive compensation expenses, retail salaries and occupancy costs, offset by lower utility costs and administrative salaries as a percentage of sales. The 2014 quarter results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points, as a percentage of sales, related to the acquisition that was not completed. Our tax rate for the quarter was 36.1% compared to 34.8% in the 2014 quarter. This included a $16.5 million or $0.06 per share benefit from the re-enactment of the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is retroactive to January 1, 2015. The fourth quarter of 2014 also benefited from the deductibility of expenses incurred in prior quarters associated with the acquisition that was not completed.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Cash and cash equivalents at year-end were $422 million lower than the prior year as we did not buy back shares in the second half of 2014 due to the pending acquisition. Merchandise inventories were $3 billion at fiscal 2015 year-end, up about 4.3% on a per-store basis year-over-year. Key factors impacting this increase include our on-shelf availability initiative, the load-in for the new distribution center in San Antonio and the timing of receipts due to an early Easter, coupled with our sales performance. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Near term, we would expect our ongoing on-shelf availability initiative to impact our inventory level. Going forward, however, our goal remains to ensure inventory growth is in line with our total sales growth over time. In 2015, we generated cash from operations of $1.4 billion, an increase of $63 million from the prior year. Total capital expenditures were $505 million in 2015, and included the majority of the costs for our new San Antonio distribution center. For the quarter, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock for $290 million. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per common share outstanding, totaling $63 million. Since the inception of the share repurchase program in December 2011, we have repurchased $3.6 billion or 62 million shares of our common stock. We have a remaining share repurchase authorization of approximately $920 million under the repurchase program. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth. Our goal is to create lasting value for our shareholders through anticipated quarterly dividends and share repurchases, all while maintaining our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR.
We are modifying our guidance convention going forward to more closely align with how we are managing the business for long-term shareholder value creation. This is a tremendous business. We have compelling new store economics with significant runway for growth, across channel, customer and product segments that we intend to capture. From our vantage point, the growth model we announced today is more of an articulation of how we have been managing the business to deliver consistent, profitable growth and not a change in strategy. In addition, we have heard from our investors that they would like to know what we think our business is capable of over the long term.
We believe that this long-term focus is the best way to model our business. Key components of the model include the following annual targets: Net sales increase of 7% to 10% with square footage growth of 6% to 8% and same-store sales improvement of 2% of 4%; operating profit growth of 7% to 11%; diluted earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%; cash from operations to be 7% to 8% of sales; capital expenditures to be 2% to 3% of sales; and annual shareholder returns of 11% to 17% defined as EPS growth plus dividend yield.
In 2016, we anticipate share repurchases of approximately $1 billion. This represents about 5% of our market capitalization as of today. Since the inception of our share repurchases in December of 2011, we have reduced our outstanding share count by about 15%. Given that fiscal 2016 is a 53-week fiscal year for us, we expect the 53rd week to contribute approximately 200 basis points to our net sales performance and $0.09 per diluted share to EPS. Including the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, we expect our net sales and diluted EPS results to be at the high end of the growth ranges provided in our financial growth model as I just outlined. We anticipate that same-store sales growth will be near the middle of the model's 2% to 4% growth rate.
As we move into 2016, please keep in mind our most challenging sales overlaps are in the first and second quarters. We do pick up 2 additional sales dates between Thanksgiving and Christmas. Also, for 2016, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million.
At the beginning of today's call, Mary Winn outlined our intentions with respect to updating our 2016 guidance. This information is also in our earnings release issued today. We are confident that we are positioning Dollar General for profitable long-term growth to drive shareholder returns.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Todd."

And as you alluded to, we really look to manage our gross margin and SG&A in tandem. And we continue to have numerous levers within gross margin. We were delighted with the performance this year on gross margin delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. And we continue to see benefits from the numerous levers. We continue to drive shrink rates lower over the quarter. We continued to see transportation efficiencies. We continue to grow our non-consumables business, 8 quarters of consecutive improvement, which, as you know, carries a higher margin rate with it. And we continue to effectively manage all the additional levers of category management, private label penetration, foreign sourcing penetration and distribution efficiencies. And we continue to see opportunities for growth on the gross margin side and on the SG&A side, with the introduction of zero-based budgeting, we've always had a very disciplined cost management process here with work elimination, but with zero-based budgeting implemented from a position of strength, that's one more tool at our disposal to manage that. So as we look at the 2 in tandem, we continue to see operating profit margin expansion growth over time. That's contemplated in our model. And as you look at the opportunity to drive total shareholder returns of 11% to 17% each year and the potential -- and we're really focused on the long-term growth as well. So the ability to drive those types of returns in a consistent manner and deliver long-term value creation is really what we're focused on and what we've built into the model."

In our new remodels and relocations, we have got a new fresh approach there, expanded the section, but also moved it to the front of the store, so it's more prevalent and can be seen a lot more. And also signed it a little differently for the stores. And then what we'll do is some of the best of the best of that expansion, we'll start to put it into our same-store sales base as we move further into the year to ensure that we can take advantage on a same-store sales base as well. They key for our value offering that we have is it really -- what it does, it gives the consumer trial. You have to remember, our core consumer can ill afford to make a mistake. So she can't afford to take a flyer, if you will, to go out and buy something at -- on a national brand basis that may be a little larger size without ever having tried it. But if we can offer her a national brand offering, as an example, at a very small size that she can afford, say, at $1, it gives her that trial. And once she has that trial, what we've seen is it becomes then -- it migrates into acceptance, and she moves from that $1 offering and actually trades up to the larger sizes. So our national brand folks really like what they're seeing there, and of course, we do as well, and it's great for our consumer."

Now obviously, we had a little bit of a weather hiccup here in Q4, but we don't see our apparel business slowing down as we go into 2016. Matter of fact, we're pretty bullish on apparel.

Then you couple that with the changing of the mix, and depending on the area that we put these stores, the consumable mix does increase a little bit, which does put a little pressure on gross margin rate.

Now in saying that, as we look at our new stores where a lot of the health and beauty initiatives will be put into place, the new store design opened up some opportunity for us in that we didn't have to take out a lot of product to be able to put some of that health and beauty initiative in. It's somewhere in that 6- to 8-plus feet. It depends on the store. It could go upwards of 16 feet in some areas. But what we're doing is we're not -- this isn't a one size fits all either. We're taking a look at shrink, we're taking a look at where the stores are located. And the other nice thing about this is it has a healthy balance of private brands. And as we all know, private brands, very good profitability, but also doesn't shrink near as much as your national brands.

As we noted in our press release, we had a very good start to the year and are pleased with our results. For the first quarter, the team executed well as we we're keenly focused on ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of every aspect of our business. Let's recap some of the highlights for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the 2015 period.
First quarter sales increased 7% to $5.3 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 2.2% for the quarter, and in an environment where many retailers struggled, we delivered good performance. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and nonconsumables, with growth stronger across our consumable category. Growth in nonconsumables was due to seasonal and home products. For the 33rd consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket year-over-year. Gross margin expanded by 16 basis points to 30.6%. 
We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 26 basis points as our zero-based budget initiatives started to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 12% with operating profit margin expansion of 42 basis points. Net income in the first quarter increased 17% to $295 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased of 23% to $1.03, including a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate, which John will discuss later. 
During the quarter, we returned over $300 million of shareholders through the repurchase of 2.7 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. 
In the first quarter, we made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2016. As I will discuss in more detail a bit later in the call, the team has done a great job of developing compelling initiatives across merchandising, store operations and supply chain to help drive our business in 2016 and for the long term. Additionally, we continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-,12-, 24- and 52-week periods. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter."

Good morning, everyone. As Todd have taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30",717,"Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. As Todd have taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30.6% of sales, an increase of 16 basis points from last year's first quarter. The most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups and reduced transportation costs, partially attributable to lower fill rates. This was in part offset by a greater proportion of the sales of consumables, which have a lower gross profit rate to nonconsumables, increased inventory shrink and higher markdown. 
SG&A expenses decreased by 26 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.1 billion or 21.5% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A decrease was due to lower utilities costs, administrative payroll it, incentive compensation, travel expenses, workers' compensation costs and advertising costs as well as higher volume of customer cash back transactions resulting in increased convenience fees paid to the company. Partially offsetting these items where our retail labor investments and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in sales. 
Our zero-based budgeting initiative contributed to our robust results. This process leverages our cultural heritage of trip and further solidified our leadership as a low-cost operator. We implemented zero-based budgeting proactively and thoughtfully  as we develop our fiscal 2016 budget using 3 filters: The customer, our strategic priority and risk mitigation. The team is now actively working on a pipeline of additional future earnings opportunities across the company. 
Moving down the income statement, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% as compared to 37.7% in the first quarter last year. As we detailed in our press release, the effective income tax rate was lower the first quarter of this year due primarily to early adoption of commitment to existing guidance for employees share the accounting and the recognition of incremental benefits from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The income tax benefits of the employee share-based payment accounting change in the quarter was approximately $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Because of the majority of our stock-based awards typically vests in the first quarter, we do not expect this accounting amendment impact to reoccur to this a degree over the balance of the year. As you may recall, the WOTC was retroactively reenacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a significant portion of our 2015 annual benefit being recorded at that time. Due to Congress approving the WTC for 2019, we will be able to recognize greater amounts of each quarter's benefits to the respective quarter in which it serves. 
Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.07 billion, up 8% in total and 2% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with our sales growth. We generated cash from operations of $404 [ph] million in the quarter, an increase of 9% or $34 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $231 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding totaling $71 million. From December 2011 through the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $3.8 billion or 64.7 million shares of our common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remain share repurchase authorization is approximately $693 million.
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leveraged ratio of approximately 3x adjusted net to EBITDA. 
In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. We remain committed to focusing on profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd."

Our customers are starting point and center of all we do at Dollar General. We recently did the first recut of our consumer segmentation in 4 years to provide shopper insight that impacts decisions across the entire company. This research helps us know who our customers are, where they shop, how they shop, what they buy, how much of the spend, and most importantly, their attitudes and their behaviors. The exciting news is that we are improving our core customer productivity and retain our trade down customer, all while we expand our reach. New segments shopping with us include an older male middle income consumer and a millennial female shopper. 
The millennial shopper is a segment that I was particularly excited to see emerge as a core consumer for DG, as this segment is so important to the future of retail and Dollar General. Today, she represents about 12% of our shoppers in 24% of our sales. On average, she is shopping in our stores about 3 times a month. One of her money-saving strategies is to utilize technology like our Dollar General digital coupon app to make lists, find deals and save money. She wants healthy food items and likes to be on the cutting-edge and try new products. While national brands are important, should also trust our private brands. She utilizes the entire DG stores as a way to stretch her budget. These insights will help us serve her even better going forward as we strive to ensure she becomes an even larger consumer segment for us overtime.
I believe our deep and actionable understanding of our consumers is a core strength. As we implement and refine our initiatives, we have incorporated this knowledge of our consumers across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. The primary goal is to grow transactions and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance.
Our operating parties continue to be, first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, and enhancing our position as of a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips while capture a share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In the process, we have assessed the expansion of groups that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. In 2015, we are expanding in perishables, health and beauty care, party and stationery. These 2016 sales drive initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also into our maturity store base at a greater degree than we have the past several years. We are adding a total of 23,000 cooler doors across 9,000 existing stores. In the first quarter alone, more than 20% of the stores received a new cooler expansion, which allows for the extension of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores will see planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores getting all expansions. Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up over time. Currently, nearly 60% of our baskets contain a dollar item or less. 
Our private brand portfolio place a key role in driving profitable sales as of these items continue to both sales and enhance our gross margins. Private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers, and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our customers. We continue to have private brand opportunity as our penetration is below both mass merchants and grocery segments. Our plans include engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our customers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private brand line named Heartland Harvest to expand our Better For You offerings, which really resonates with our millennials. By September, we anticipate over 50 new SKUs under this Better For You brand. We will also be expanding our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. 
In about 160 Dollar General Plus locations, we are testing limited assortment of the best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience in this category and capitalize on our customers' desire for fresh options. Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. The program can provide customers exclusive savings available only as Dollar General coupons. The compelling offers, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollments. We are seeing higher average basket and greater trip frequency for those enrolled in the program. A recent limited market test across about 300 stores captured 30,000 new enrollees in just 2 weeks. Additionally, we have made system changes at that simplify enrollment. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopping analytics and targeting.
The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have improved their in-stock position by more than 100 basis points. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the returns. Notably, these stores continue to show significant improvements in customer satisfaction metrics and same-store sales growth, along with operating profit gains. Across the chain, our customers are taking note of the improvements in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years.
Our first quarter results indicate we are aggressively pursuing opportunities for continued gross margin expansion through global sourcing, cost management and the supply chain efficiencies. We believe we will be able to improve both product quality and value for our customers over time. 
Second, we are focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth and a proven high return, low-risk model. Our long-term growth model contemplates 6% to 8% [ph] footage growth annually. We anticipate accelerating our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increasing this to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new store -- new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place a greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience. While it's still early, the results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we're seeing stronger perishables sales, a double-digit lift in our new front-end and items. Overall, our sales performance on stores using the DG16 layout is meeting our expectations. 
In addition, we are utilizing a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated Metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 45 stores with selling square footage of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional stores. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns are very encouraging. This smaller footprint store has all of our strategic initiatives, but with added assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe the smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count. With this format, we have greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. In total, we anticipate about 80 of the smaller format stores for the 2016 fiscal year.
We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brand relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication and value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 875 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with around 900 locations slated for 2017. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017 as our 1,000-store pipeline is already 50% complete. We remained disciplined and focused on our new store program, continues to drive compelling returns with low cost to build and a low cost to operate. 
To support our new store growth and drive productivity, we are making investments in our distribution center network. Since 2012, we have opened 4 distribution centers. Construction is on track for our newest distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, with a goal to begin shipping in early 2017. Most recently, we purchased land in Jackson, Georgia, for our 15th distribution center. In conjunction with the real estate team, we're proactively planning where our next distribution centers will be located to support growth across merchandising initiatives and store base. 
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our first quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process contributed to our results as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth below our 2.5% to 3% leverage target. Our underlying principles are keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements as our store manager turnover decreased both sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015 and quarter-over-quarter. To build on these improvements going forward, we have focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover. 
Looking ahead, we are addressing the implementation of the Department of Labor's change to the overtime exemption regulations. We have been anticipating there would be changes since the proposed regulations were first announced and have been evaluating ways in which a change like this could be addressed once it was effective. Between now and the effective date of December 1st, we will continue to refine our analysis and determine the course of action that best serves the needs of our employees, customers and shareholders. 
As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the economic conditions, but acknowledge that it's always challenging for our core consumer, given the pressure on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are very pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter. The senior team is aligned and energized across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our multiyear strategic planning process is much further along than typical for this time of the year, and we are optimistic and confident in our opportunities going forward. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend.
Over the summer, we will celebrate a significant milestone with the opening of our 13,000 store location. With this type of new store growth, we continue to provide significant opportunities for our employees to develop their careers as we anticipate adding nearly 17,000 new jobs between 2016 and 2017. My appreciation and thanks goes out to the more than 115,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customer with convenience, value and service every day. 
With that, Mary Winn, we'd like to now open the call for questions."

But bear in mind that growth model is a long-term model, and what we're really focus is putting actions in place to drive that model for the long term, and we have a lot of great actions in place. We feel great about real estate. We're on track to open 900 units this year. And as Todd mentioned, over 50% full the pipeline to open 1,000 next year and the great thing is the economics is as compelling as ever. We continue to see our IRRs exceed our 20% target, continue to see payback less than 2 years. Sales are indexing above expectations. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, lot of exciting things with sales comps in terms of product assortment, store formats, operating initiatives that will be fully  -- many of them will be fully implemented as we get into the back half of the year and should gain momentum. And then on operating profit, as evidenced by the Q1 results, the team is very effectively managing all the levers to deliver that 42 basis points of expansion with growth in both gross margin and SG&A. And the newest lever, zero-based budgeting, we're really seeing that start to contribute very rapidly and really becoming ingrained in the fabric in which we operate here. And then lastly, we feel great about the amount of cash that this business continues to kick off, allowing us to reinvest in this low risk, high-return new unit growth and the structure to support it, while continuing to pay a competitive, and over time, growing dividend as well as consistent robust share repurchases. So the model is working great. We think that's evidenced by the Q1 results and feel great about the long-term impact of this and ready to continue improving it."

I could tell you that when we started this journey 8 years ago to really look at exactly how much opportunity we had, we always waited that depending also on where the consumer was going. And we still think that the consumer is looking for national brands in a lot cases, but also great value in our private brand offerings, which really goes toward that -- goes through that import fees.

And we like the trade-off right now. We are not happy with it, we are looking at ways to mitigate that exposure on shrink. But what we felt that what was even more compelling was to make sure that the customer, when they came in our store, had the product they needed on the shelf to purchase, and that was really day key driver. But rest assured that our operating team and our merchant marketing teams are working very, very hard, along with supply chain, to reduce that shrink number as we go forward.

And we also, every quarter, check it on the full book so we know exactly where we stand. And we today feel very confident in the where we sit on pricing, and if we see folks moving, you'll see us move because this is all about ensuring that we continue to drive units out of our stores, and of course, drive traffic into our stores. So anywhere that we may see or we need to be sharper around price, we'll take that action. and the great thing about Dollar General is, again, we've got the levers to enable us to do that. if so, when we look at this, we also look at it from the standpoint that now are vendors help us a lot as well. We're in the top 10 of all CPG companies out of there, and quite frankly, we're in the top 5 of the majority of them. And that gives us great partnership with our vendor community that enables us to insure we're in the right price any time we need to be."

But again, because of the nature of it, one being in these more metropolitan type areas, and then secondly, in these very rural areas, we got our arms around pretty close to how big that is. We're not really going to say exact how big it is, because what we're doing is making sure that we can refine of the model appropriately with, again, only 45 open, but we've got a good idea. The important thing here is we are concentrating a lot, though, in those rural areas, where there's only room for 1 store. And that's why you see us moving very quickly in a lot of cases with our growth of 900 stores this year and up to 1,000 next year. And a lot of those areas are in these towns or even crossroads that can only support 1 retailer. And I sure would rather it be Dollar General, and that's an that's how we are quite about this.

It really focuses our efforts and focuses in our resources towards the highest returning mission-critical activities. And there's a lot of power to do that and it really has a compounding effect. In addition, we have teams, we have 23 different cost packages, teams, senior-level folks on the team cross-functional engagement, interaction. And we have a pretty rigorous regulatory now, monthly meetings with the senior leadership team, where we go deep and wide through all the cost. And with that increase learning, with that sharing across the company, it really drives best practices that feeds on itself. And we're going after costs and process improvement, we're going after costs and efficiencies. We are going after costs and just good old-fashioned prioritization of spending, working very closely with procurement to go deeper and wider on those activities. So it really cuts across the entire P&L. It really is the power of the teams working together to uncover what we've always had.

We are able to move left and right, if you will. Now in saying that, at times, we do need reduce items inside of our store and reduce square footage on some of categories and increase others. So this time, this year, we really worked hard to increase our perishables, our health and beauty areas, our party and stationery areas. And in many cases, a lot of the reductions were coming out of a mix of both consumable and nonconsumable areas. I think I gave an example before, but right now, the -- a lot of the dry cereal business is in a secular decline. So what we do there is we reduce some square footage so we can increase a square footage of other trade grocer areas.

First quarter sales increased 7% to $5.3 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 2.2% for the quarter, and in an environment where many retailers struggled, we delivered good performance. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and non-consumables, with growth stronger across our consumable categories. Growth in non-consumables was due to seasonal and home products. For the 33rd consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket year-over-year. Gross margin expanded by 16 basis points to 30.6%. 
We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 26 basis points as our zero-based budget initiatives started to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 12% with operating profit margin expansion of 42 basis points. Net income in the first quarter increased 17% to $295 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.03, including a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate, which John will discuss later. 
During the quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.7 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. 
In the first quarter, we made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2016. As I will discuss in more detail a bit later in the call, the team has done a great job of developing compelling initiatives across merchandising, store operations and supply chain to help drive our business in 2016 and for the long term. Additionally, we continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter."
266974,332147202,992686,"Dollar General Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30",713,"Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30.6% of sales, an increase of 16 basis points from last year's first quarter. The most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups and reduced transportation costs, partially attributable to lower fill rates. This was in part offset by a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which have a lower gross profit rate to non-consumables, increased inventory shrink and higher markdown. 
SG&A expense decreased by 26 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.1 billion or 21.5% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A decrease was due to lower utilities costs, administrative payroll, incentive compensation, travel expenses, workers' compensation costs and advertising costs as well as higher volume of customer cash-back transactions resulting in increased convenience fees paid to the company. Partially offsetting these items were our retail labor investments and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in sales. 
Our zero-based budgeting initiatives contributed to our robust results. This process leverages our cultural heritage of thrift and further solidified our leadership as a low-cost operator. We implemented zero-based budgeting proactively and thoughtfully as we develop our fiscal 2016 budget using 3 filters: the customer, our strategic priority and risk mitigation. The team is now actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company. 
Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% as compared to 37.7% in the first quarter last year. As we detailed in our press release, the effective income tax rate was lower in the first quarter of this year due primarily to early adoption of amendment to existing guidance for employee share-based payment accounting and the recognition of incremental benefits from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The income tax benefit of the employee share-based payment accounting change in the quarter was approximately $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Because the majority of our stock-based awards typically vest in the first quarter, we do not expect this accounting amendment impact to recur to this degree over the balance of the year. As you may recall, the WOTC was retroactively reenacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a significant portion of our 2015 annual benefit being recorded at that time. Due to Congress approving the WOTC through 2019, we will be able to recognize greater amounts of each quarter's benefit in the respective quarter in which it is earned. 
Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.07 billion, up 8% in total and 2% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with our sales growth. We generated cash from operations of $404 million in the quarter, an increase of 9% or $34 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $231 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. From December 2011 through the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $3.8 billion or 64.7 million shares of our common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $693 million.
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leveraged ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. 
In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. We remain committed to focusing on profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd."
266974,332147202,992686,"Dollar General Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Now let's turn to an update on our initiatives for 2016. Our customers are the starting point and center of all we do at Dollar General.

Our customers are the starting point and center of all we do at Dollar General. We recently did the first recut of our consumer segmentation in 4 years to provide shopper insight that impact decisions across the entire company. This research helps us know who our customers are, where they shop, how they shop, what they buy, how much they spend, and most importantly, their attitudes and their behaviors. The exciting news is that we are improving our core customer productivity and retaining our trade-down customer, all while we expand our reach. New segments shopping with us include an older male middle income consumer and a millennial female shopper. 
The millennial shopper is a segment that I was particularly excited to see emerge as a core consumer for DG as this segment is so important to the future of retail and Dollar General. Today, she represents about 12% of our shoppers and 24% of our sales. On average, she is shopping our stores about 3 times a month. One of her money-saving strategies is to utilize technology like our Dollar General digital coupon app to make lists, find deals and save money. She wants healthy food items and likes to be on the cutting edge and try new products. While national brands are important, she also trusts our private brands. She utilizes the entire DG store as a way to stretch her budget. These insights will help us serve her even better going forward as we strive to ensure she becomes an even larger consumer segment for us over time.
I believe our deep and actionable understanding of our consumers is a core strength. As we implement and refine our initiatives, we have incorporated this knowledge of our consumers across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. The primary goal is to grow transactions and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance.
Our operating priorities continue to be, first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips while capturing share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In the process, we have assessed the expansion of groups that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. In 2016, we are expanding perishables, health and beauty care, party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also into our mature store base at a greater degree than we have in the past several years. We are adding a total of 23,000 cooler doors across 9,000 existing stores. In the first quarter alone, more than 20% of these stores received a new cooler expansion, which allows for the extension of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores will see planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores getting all expansions. Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up over time. Currently, nearly 60% of our baskets contain a dollar item or less. 
Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales as these items continue to both sales and enhance our gross margins. Private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our customers. We continue to have private brand opportunity as our penetration is below both mass merchant and grocery segments. Our plans include engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our customers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private brand line named Heartland Harvest to expand our better for you offerings, which really resonates with our millennials. By September, we anticipate over 15 new SKUs under this better for you brand. We will also be expanding our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. 
In about 160 Dollar General Plus locations, we are testing limited assortment of the best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience in this category and capitalize on our customers' desire for fresh options. Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. The program can provide consumers exclusive savings available only as Dollar General coupons. The compelling offers, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. We are seeing higher average basket and greater trip frequency for those enrolled in the program. A recent limited market test across about 300 stores captured 30,000 new enrollees in just 2 weeks. Additionally, we have made system changes that simplify enrollment. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting.
The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have improved their in-stock position by more than 100 basis points. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the returns. Notably, these stores continue to show significant improvement in customer satisfaction metrics and same-store sales growth, along with operating profit gains. Across the chain, our customers are taking note of the improvement in in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years.
Our first quarter results indicate we are aggressively pursuing opportunities for continued gross margin expansion through global sourcing, cost management and supply chain efficiencies. We believe we will be able to improve both product quality and value for our customers over time. 
Second, we are focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth and a proven high return, low-risk model. Our long-term growth model contemplates 6% to 8% square footage growth annually. We anticipate accelerating our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increasing this to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new store -- new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place a greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience. While it's still early, the results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we're seeing stronger perishables sales, a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, our sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is meeting our expectations. 
In addition, we are utilizing a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 45 stores with selling square footage of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional stores. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns are very encouraging. This smaller footprint store has all of our strategic initiatives, but with added assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count. With this format, we have greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. In total, we anticipate about 80 of the smaller format stores for the 2016 fiscal year.
We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brand relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 875 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with around 900 locations slated for 2017. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017 as our 1,000-store pipeline is already 50% complete. We remain disciplined and focused on our new store program, continues to drive compelling returns with low cost to build and a low cost to operate. 
To support our new store growth and drive productivity, we are making investments in our distribution center network. Since 2012, we have opened 4 distribution centers. Construction is on track for our newest distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, with a goal to begin shipping in early 2017. Most recently, we purchased land in Jackson, Georgia, for our 15th distribution center. In conjunction with the real estate team, we are proactively planning where our next distribution centers will be located to support growth across merchandising initiatives and store base. 
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our first quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process contributed to our results as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth below our 2.5% to 3% leverage target. Our underlying principles are keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great on-boarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements as our store manager turnover decreased both sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015 and quarter-over-quarter. To build on these improvements going forward, we have focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover. 
Looking ahead, we are addressing the implementation of the Department of Labor's change to the overtime exemption regulations. We have been anticipating there would be changes since the proposed regulations were first announced and have been evaluating ways in which a change like this could be addressed once it was effective. Between now and the effective date of December 1, we will continue to refine our analysis and determine the course of action that best serves the needs of our employees, customers and shareholders. 
As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it's always challenging for our core consumer, given the pressure on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are very pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter. The senior team is aligned and energized across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our multiyear strategic planning process is much further along than typical for this time of year, and we are optimistic and confident in our opportunities going forward. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend.
Over the summer, we will celebrate a significant milestone with the opening of our 13,000th store location. With this type of new store growth, we continue to provide significant opportunities for our employees to develop their careers as we anticipate adding nearly 17,000 new jobs between 2016 and 2017. My appreciation and thanks goes out to the more than 115,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customer with convenience, value and service every day. 
With that, Mary Winn, we'd like to now open the call for questions."

But bear in mind that growth model is a long-term model and what we're really focused on is putting the actions in place to drive that model for the long term, and we have a lot of great actions in place. We feel great about real estate. We're on track to open 900 units this year and over, as Todd mentioned, over 50% full the pipeline to open 1,000 next year. And the great thing here is the economics are as compelling as ever. We continue to see our IRRs exceed our 20% target, continue to see a payback less than 2 years. Sales are indexing above expectations. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, lot of exciting things with sales comps in terms of product assortment, store formats, operating initiatives that will be fully -- many of them will be fully implemented as we get into the back half of the year and should gain momentum. And then on operating profit, as evidenced by the Q1 results, the team is very effectively managing all the levers to deliver that 42 basis points of expansion with growth in both gross margin and SG&A. And the newest lever, zero-based budgeting, we're really seeing that start to contribute very rapidly and really become ingrained in the fabric in which we operate here. And then lastly, we feel great about the amount of cash that this business continues to kick off, allowing us to reinvest in this low-risk, high-return new unit growth and we have the structure to support it, while continuing to pay a competitive, and over time, growing dividend as well as consistent robust share repurchases. So the model is working great. We think that's evidenced by the Q1 results and feel great about the long-term impact of this and the ability to continue improving it."

And we like the trade-off right now. We're not happy with it, we're looking at ways to mitigate that exposure on shrink. But what we felt that was even more compelling was to make sure that the customer, when they came in our store, had the product they needed on the shelf to purchase, and that was really the key driver. But rest assured that our operating team and our merchant marketing teams are working very, very hard, along with supply chain, to reduce that shrink number as we go forward. We still have a lot of levers to pull, still putting a lot of defensive merchandising tools and other tools where our district manager and our store managers to be able to monitor shrink even closer to the actual event.

As we noted in our press release, we had a very good start to the year and are pleased with our results. For the first quarter, the team executed well as we were keenly focused on ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of every aspect of our business. Let's recap some of the highlights for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the 2015 period.
First quarter sales increased 7% to $5.3 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 2.2% for the quarter, and in an environment where many retailers struggled, we delivered good performance. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and non-consumables, with growth stronger across our consumable categories. Growth in non-consumables was due to seasonal and home products. For the 33rd consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket year-over-year. Gross margin expanded by 16 basis points to 30.6%. 
We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 26 basis points as our zero-based budget initiatives started to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 12% with operating profit margin expansion of 42 basis points. Net income in the first quarter increased 17% to $295 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.03, including a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate, which John will discuss later. 
During the quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.7 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. 
In the first quarter, we made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2016. As I will discuss in more detail a bit later in the call, the team has done a great job of developing compelling initiatives across merchandising, store operations and supply chain to help drive our business in 2016 and for the long term. Additionally, we continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter."
266974,332147202,992826,"Dollar General Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30",713,"Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30.6% of sales, an increase of 16 basis points from last year's first quarter. The most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups and reduced transportation costs, partially attributable to lower fuel rates. This was in part offset by a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which have a lower gross profit rate than non-consumables, increased inventory shrink and higher markdown. 
SG&A expense decreased by 26 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.1 billion or 21.5% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A decrease was due to lower utilities costs, administrative payroll, incentive compensation, travel expenses, workers' compensation costs and advertising costs as well as higher volume of customer cash-back transactions resulting in increased convenience fees paid to the company. Partially offsetting these items were our retail labor investments and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in sales. 
Our zero-based budgeting initiatives contributed to our robust results. This process leverages our cultural heritage of thrift and further solidifies our leadership as a low-cost operator. We implemented zero-based budgeting proactively and thoughtfully as we developed our fiscal 2016 budget using 3 filters: the customer, our strategic priorities and risk mitigation. The team is now actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company. 
Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% as compared to 37.7% in the first quarter last year. As we detailed in our press release, the effective income tax rate was lower in the first quarter of this year due primarily to early adoption of amendment to existing guidance for employee share-based payment accounting and the recognition of incremental benefits from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The income tax benefit of the employee share-based payment accounting change in the quarter was approximately $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Because the majority of our stock-based awards typically vest in the first quarter, we do not expect this accounting amendment impact to recur to this degree over the balance of the year. As you may recall, the WOTC was retroactively reenacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a significant portion of our 2015 annual benefit being recorded at that time. Due to Congress approving the WOTC through 2019, we will be able to recognize greater amounts of each quarter's benefit in the respective quarter in which it is earned. 
Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.07 billion, up 8% in total and 2% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with our sales growth. We generated cash from operations of $404 million in the quarter, an increase of 9% or $34 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $231 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. From December 2011 through the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $3.8 billion or 64.7 million shares of our common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $693 million.
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. 
In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. We remain committed to focusing on profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd."
266974,332147202,992826,"Dollar General Corporation, Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. Now let's turn to an update on our initiatives for 2016. Our customers are the starting point and center of all we do at Dollar General.

Our customers are the starting point and center of all we do at Dollar General. We recently did the first recut of our consumer segmentation in 4 years to provide shopper insight that impact decisions across the entire company. This research helps us know who our customers are, where they shop, how they shop, what they buy, how much they spend, and most importantly, their attitudes and their behaviors. The exciting news is that we are improving our core customer productivity and retaining our trade-down customer, all while we expand our reach. New segments shopping with us include an older male middle income consumer and a millennial female shopper. 
The millennial shopper is a segment that I was particularly excited to see emerge as a core consumer for DG as this segment is so important to the future of retail and Dollar General. Today, she represents about 12% of our shoppers and 24% of our sales. On average, she is shopping our stores about 3 times a month. One of her money-saving strategies is to utilize technology like our Dollar General digital coupon app to make lists, find deals and save money. She wants healthy food items and likes to be on the cutting edge and try new products. While national brands are important, she also trusts our private brands. She utilizes the entire DG store as a way to stretch her budget. These insights will help us serve her even better going forward as we strive to ensure she becomes an even larger consumer segment for us over time.
I believe our deep and actionable understanding of our consumers is a core strength. As we implement and refine our initiatives, we have incorporated this knowledge of our consumers across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. The primary goal is to grow transaction and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance.
Our operating priorities continue to be, first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips while capturing share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In the process, we have assessed the expansion of groups that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. In 2016, we are expanding perishables, health and beauty care, party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also into our mature store base at a greater degree than we have in the past several years. We are adding a total of 23,000 cooler doors across 9,000 existing stores. In the first quarter alone, more than 20% of these stores received a new cooler expansion, which allows for the extension of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores will see planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores getting all expansions. Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up over time. Currently, nearly 60% of our baskets contain a $1 item or less. 
Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales as these items continue to both sales and enhance our gross margins. Private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our customers. We continue to have private brand opportunity as our penetration is below both mass merchant and grocery segments. Our plans include engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our customers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private brand line named Heartland Harvest to expand our better for you offerings, which really resonates with our millennials. By September, we anticipate over 15 new SKUs under this better for you brand. We will also be expanding our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. 
In about 160 Dollar General Plus locations, we are testing limited assortment of the best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience in this category and capitalize on our customers' desire for fresh options. Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. The program can provide consumers exclusive savings available only as Dollar General coupons. The compelling offers, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. We are seeing higher average basket and greater trip frequency for those enrolled in the program. A recent limited market test across about 300 stores captured 30,000 new enrollees in just 2 weeks. Additionally, we have made system changes that simplify enrollment. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting.
The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have improved their in-stock position by more than 100 basis points. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the returns. Notably, these stores continue to show significant improvement in customer satisfaction metrics and same-store sales growth, along with operating profit gains. Across the chain, our customers are taking note of the improvement in in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years.
Our first quarter results indicate we are aggressively pursuing opportunities for continued gross margin expansion through global sourcing, cost management and supply chain efficiencies. We believe we will be able to improve both product quality and value for our customers over time. 
Second, we are focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth and a proven high return, low-risk model. Our long-term growth model contemplates 6% to 8% square footage growth annually. We anticipate accelerating our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increasing this to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new store -- new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place a greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience. While it's still early, the results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we're seeing stronger perishables sales, a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, our sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is meeting our expectations. 
In addition, we are utilizing a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 45 stores with selling square footage of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional stores. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns are very encouraging. This smaller footprint store has all of our strategic initiatives, but with added assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count. With this format, we have greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. In total, we anticipate about 80 of the smaller format stores for the 2016 fiscal year.
We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brand relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 875 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with around 900 locations slated for 2017. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017 as our 1,000-store pipeline is already 50% complete. We remain disciplined and focused on our new store program, continues to drive compelling returns with low cost to build and a low cost to operate. 
To support our new store growth and drive productivity, we are making investments in our distribution center network. Since 2012, we have opened 4 distribution centers. Construction is on track for our newest distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, with a goal to begin shipping in early 2017. Most recently, we purchased land in Jackson, Georgia, for our 15th distribution center. In conjunction with the real estate team, we are proactively planning where our next distribution centers will be located to support growth across merchandising initiatives and store base. 
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our first quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process contributed to our results as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth below our 2.5% to 3% leverage target. Our underlying principles are keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great on-boarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements as our store manager turnover decreased both sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015 and quarter-over-quarter. To build on these improvements going forward, we have focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover. 
Looking ahead, we are addressing the implementation of the Department of Labor's change to the overtime exemption regulations. We have been anticipating there would be changes since the proposed regulations were first announced and have been evaluating ways in which a change like this could be addressed once it was effective. Between now and the effective date of December 1, we will continue to refine our analysis and determine the course of action that best serves the needs of our employees, customers and shareholders. 
As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it's always challenging for our core consumer, given the pressure on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are very pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter. The senior team is aligned and energized across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our multiyear strategic planning process is much further along than typical for this time of year, and we are optimistic and confident in our opportunities going forward. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend.
Over the summer, we will celebrate a significant milestone with the opening of our 13,000th store location. With this type of new store growth, we continue to provide significant opportunities for our employees to develop their careers as we anticipate adding nearly 17,000 new jobs between 2016 and 2017. My appreciation and thanks goes out to the more than 115,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customer with convenience, value and service every day. 
With that, Mary Winn, we'd like to now open the call for questions."

But the one good thing that you know about Dollar General, particularly, and retail in general is that we have a lot of levers at our disposal, Stephen, to really take a look at how we can mitigate a lot of what may be an expense here to us. But again, we're looking at it and we're going to do that exact right thing for our employees, customers and our shareholders. Stay tuned, we'll give you more clarity as we get a little closer to December 1."

But bear in mind that growth model is a long-term model and what we're really focused on is putting the actions in place to drive that model for the long term, and we have a lot of great actions in place. We feel great about real estate. We're on track to open 900 units this year and over, as Todd mentioned, over 50% full the pipeline to open 1,000 next year. And the great thing here is the economics are as compelling as ever. We continue to see our IRRs exceed our 20% target, continue to see a payback less than 2 years. Sales are indexing above expectations. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, a lot of exciting things with sales comps in terms of product assortment, store formats, operating initiatives that will be fully -- many of them will be fully implemented as we get into the back half of the year and should gain momentum. And then on operating profit, as evidenced by the Q1 results, the team is very effectively managing all the levers to deliver that 42 basis points of expansion with growth in both gross margin and SG&A. And the newest lever, zero-based budgeting, we're really seeing that start to contribute very rapidly and really become ingrained in the fabric in which we operate here. And then lastly, we feel great about the amount of cash that this business continues to kick off, allowing us to reinvest in this low-risk, high-return new unit growth and the structure to support it, while continuing to pay a competitive, and over time, growing dividend as well as consistent robust share repurchases. So the model is working great. We think that's evidenced by the Q1 results and feel great about the long-term impact of this and the ability to continue improving it."

And we still think that the consumer is looking for national brands in a lot cases, but also great value in our private brand offerings, which really goes toward that -- goes toward that import piece.

And I see people of all levels of the organization now looking at everything they do through the lens of zero-based budgeting and the filters we've talked about, with the customer, our strategic priorities, risk management and looking at things in terms of return on investment.

And we like the trade-off right now. We're not happy with it, we're looking at ways to mitigate that exposure on shrink. But what we felt that was even more compelling was to make sure that the customer, when they came in our store, had the product they needed on the shelf to purchase, and that was really the key driver. But rest assured that our operating team and our merchant marketing teams are working very, very hard, along with supply chain, to reduce that shrink number as we go forward. We still have a lot of levers to pull, still putting a lot of defensive merchandising tools and other tools for our district managers and our store managers to be able to monitor shrink even closer to the actual event.

But the consumer right now, overall, I would tell you, back to work for the most part, probably feeling a little bit more confident, but -- and spending at little bit more on her nonconsumables, and we're still seeing our nonconsumable growth but still being cautious. So we look at that as an opportunity for us, especially for fill in. Because if she is cautious, that stock-up trip is not always in her eyesight, if you will, and at times, she maybe a little bit more reticent to stock up and a little bit free-er to fill in.

In addition, we have teams, we have 23 different cost packages, teams, with senior-level folks on the teams, cross-functional engagement, interaction. And we have a pretty rigorous routine now; monthly meetings with the senior leadership team, where we go deep and wide through all the costs. And with that increased learning, with that sharing across the company, it really drives best practices that feeds on itself. And we're going after costs. In process improvement, we're going after costs. In efficiencies, we're going after costs in just good old-fashioned prioritization of spending, working very closely with procurement to go deeper and wider on those activities. So it really cuts across the entire P&L. It really is the power of the teams working together to uncover. We've always had good cost management here and it's been a strength of ours, but with this zero-based budgeting, it really allows us to go that layer deeper to get those costs on the baseline that are hard to bring out and really drive an ownership type of mentality where it's not a use it, lose it budget that rolls ever but really everything has to pay for itself."

So this time, this year, we really worked hard to increase our perishables, our health and beauty areas, our party and stationery areas.

I think I gave an example before, but right now, the -- a lot of the dry cereal business is in a secular decline. So what we do there is we reduce some square footage so we can increase square footage of other dry grocery areas.

As we noted in our press release, we had a very good start to the year and are pleased with our results. For the first quarter, the team executed well as we were keenly focused on ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of every aspect of our business. Let's recap some of the highlights for the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the 2015 period.
First quarter sales increased 7% to $5.3 billion. We delivered same-store sales growth of 2.2% for the quarter, and in an environment where many retailers struggled, we delivered good performance. Same-store sales growth was positive for both consumables and non-consumables, with growth stronger across our consumable categories. Growth in non-consumables was due to seasonal and home products. For the 33rd consecutive quarter, we increased both our customer traffic and average ticket year-over-year. Gross margin expanded by 16 basis points to 30.6%. 
We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 26 basis points as our zero-based budget initiatives started to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 12% with operating profit margin expansion of 42 basis points. Net income in the first quarter increased 17% to $295 million. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $1.03, including a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate, which John will discuss later. 
During the quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.7 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. 
In the first quarter, we made notable progress against our key initiatives for 2016. As I will discuss in more detail a bit later in the call, the team has done a great job of developing compelling initiatives across merchandising, store operations and supply chain to help drive our business in 2016 and for the long term. Additionally, we continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter."

Good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30",713,"Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our first quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the financial results, starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the first quarter was $1.6 billion or 30.6% of sales, an increase of 16 basis points from last year's first quarter. The most significant drivers were higher initial inventory markups and reduced transportation costs, partially attributable to lower fuel rates. This was in part offset by a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which have a lower gross profit rate than non-consumables, increased inventory shrink and higher markdown. 
SG&A expense decreased by 26 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.1 billion or 21.5% of sales in the first quarter. The majority of the SG&A decrease was due to lower utilities costs, administrative payroll, incentive compensation, travel expenses, workers' compensation costs and advertising costs as well as higher volume of customer cash-back transactions resulting in increased convenience fees paid to the company. Partially offsetting these items were our retail labor investments and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in sales. 
Our zero-based budgeting initiatives contributed to our robust results. This process leverages our cultural heritage of thrift and further solidifies our leadership as a low-cost operator. We implemented zero-based budgeting proactively and thoughtfully as we developed our fiscal 2016 budget using 3 filters: the customer, our strategic priorities and risk mitigation. The team is now actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company. 
Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% as compared to 37.7% in the first quarter last year. As we detailed in our press release, the effective income tax rate was lower in the first quarter of this year due primarily to early adoption of amendment to existing guidance for employee share-based payment accounting and the recognition of incremental benefits from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. The income tax benefit of the employee share-based payment accounting change in the quarter was approximately $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share. Because the majority of our stock-based awards typically vest in the first quarter, we do not expect this accounting amendment impact to recur to this degree over the balance of the year. As you may recall, the WOTC was retroactively reenacted in the fourth quarter of 2015, which resulted in a significant portion of our 2015 annual benefit being recorded at that time. Due to Congress approving the WOTC through 2019, we will be able to recognize greater amounts of each quarter's benefit in the respective quarter in which it is earned. 
Now to our balance sheet and cash flow. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.07 billion, up 8% in total and 2% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth in line with our sales growth. We generated cash from operations of $404 million in the quarter, an increase of 9% or $34 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of our common stock for $231 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. From December 2011 through the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased $3.8 billion or 64.7 million shares of our common stock. As of the end of the first quarter, the remaining share repurchase authorization was approximately $693 million.
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDA. 
In closing, we feel really good about delivering a strong first quarter. We remain committed to focusing on profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd."

Our customers are the starting point and center of all we do at Dollar General. We recently did the first recut of our consumer segmentation in 4 years to provide shopper insight that impact decisions across the entire company. This research helps us know who our customers are, where they shop, how they shop, what they buy, how much they spend, and most importantly, their attitudes and their behaviors. The exciting news is that we are improving our core customer productivity and retaining our trade-down customer, all while we expand our reach. New segments shopping with us include an older male middle income consumer and a millennial female shopper. 
The millennial shopper is a segment that I was particularly excited to see emerge as a core consumer for DG as this segment is so important to the future of retail and Dollar General. Today, she represents about 12% of our shoppers and 24% of our sales. On average, she is shopping our stores about 3 times a month. One of her money-saving strategies is to utilize technology like our Dollar General digital coupon app to make lists, find deals and save money. She wants healthy food items and likes to be on the cutting edge and try new products. While national brands are important, she also trusts our private brands. She utilizes the entire DG store as a way to stretch her budget. These insights will help us serve her even better going forward as we strive to ensure she becomes an even larger consumer segment for us over time.
I believe our deep and actionable understanding of our consumers is a core strength. As we implement and refine our initiatives, we have incorporated this knowledge of our consumers across merchandising and pricing, marketing, site selection and store operations and design. The primary goal is to grow transaction and item units, which continue to be key to our market share performance.
Our operating priorities continue to be, first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is continuing to drive profitable sales growth. As we look to attract and grow new customers and trips while capturing share with existing customers, the insights gained from our customer segmentation work are incorporated into our disciplined approach to category management. In the process, we have assessed the expansion of groups that are most likely to drive traffic to our stores. In 2016, we are expanding perishables, health and beauty care, party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also into our mature store base at a greater degree than we have in the past several years. We are adding a total of 23,000 cooler doors across 9,000 existing stores. In the first quarter alone, more than 20% of these stores received a new cooler expansion, which allows for the extension of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores will see planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores getting all expansions. Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up over time. Currently, nearly 60% of our baskets contain a $1 item or less. 
Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales as these items continue to both sales and enhance our gross margins. Private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our customers. We continue to have private brand opportunity as our penetration is below both mass merchant and grocery segments. Our plans include engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our customers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private brand line named Heartland Harvest to expand our better for you offerings, which really resonates with our millennials. By September, we anticipate over 15 new SKUs under this better for you brand. We will also be expanding our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. 
In about 160 Dollar General Plus locations, we are testing limited assortment of the best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience in this category and capitalize on our customers' desire for fresh options. Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. The program can provide consumers exclusive savings available only as Dollar General coupons. The compelling offers, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. We are seeing higher average basket and greater trip frequency for those enrolled in the program. A recent limited market test across about 300 stores captured 30,000 new enrollees in just 2 weeks. Additionally, we have made system changes that simplify enrollment. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting.
The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have improved their in-stock position by more than 100 basis points. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the returns. Notably, these stores continue to show significant improvement in customer satisfaction metrics and same-store sales growth, along with operating profit gains. Across the chain, our customers are taking note of the improvement in in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years.
Our first quarter results indicate we are aggressively pursuing opportunities for continued gross margin expansion through global sourcing, cost management and supply chain efficiencies. We believe we will be able to improve both product quality and value for our customers over time. 
Second, we are focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth and a proven high return, low-risk model. Our long-term growth model contemplates 6% to 8% square footage growth annually. We anticipate accelerating our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increasing this to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new store -- new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place a greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience. While it's still early, the results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we're seeing stronger perishables sales, a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, our sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is meeting our expectations. 
In addition, we are utilizing a smaller format store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. Currently, we have opened approximately 45 stores with selling square footage of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional stores. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns are very encouraging. This smaller footprint store has all of our strategic initiatives, but with added assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection. Additionally, we believe this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count. With this format, we have greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. In total, we anticipate about 80 of the smaller format stores for the 2016 fiscal year.
We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brand relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 875 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with around 900 locations slated for 2017. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017 as our 1,000-store pipeline is already 50% complete. We remain disciplined and focused on our new store program, continues to drive compelling returns with low cost to build and a low cost to operate. 
To support our new store growth and drive productivity, we are making investments in our distribution center network. Since 2012, we have opened 4 distribution centers. Construction is on track for our newest distribution center in Janesville, Wisconsin, with a goal to begin shipping in early 2017. Most recently, we purchased land in Jackson, Georgia, for our 15th distribution center. In conjunction with the real estate team, we are proactively planning where our next distribution centers will be located to support growth across merchandising initiatives and store base. 
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our first quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process contributed to our results as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth below our 2.5% to 3% leverage target. Our underlying principles are keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great on-boarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements as our store manager turnover decreased both sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015 and quarter-over-quarter. To build on these improvements going forward, we have focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate turnover. 
Looking ahead, we are addressing the implementation of the Department of Labor's change to the overtime exemption regulations. We have been anticipating there would be changes since the proposed regulations were first announced and have been evaluating ways in which a change like this could be addressed once it was effective. Between now and the effective date of December 1, we will continue to refine our analysis and determine the course of action that best serves the needs of our employees, customers and shareholders. 
As for our customer, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about economic conditions, but acknowledge that it's always challenging for our core consumer, given the pressure on her income and spending. Regardless of the economic outlook for our consumers, we do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are very pleased to have delivered a strong first quarter. The senior team is aligned and energized across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our multiyear strategic planning process is much further along than typical for this time of year, and we are optimistic and confident in our opportunities going forward. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value are unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. Our business generates significant cash flow and we are in a position to invest in store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend.
Over the summer, we will celebrate a significant milestone with the opening of our 13,000th store location. With this type of new store growth, we continue to provide significant opportunities for our employees to develop their careers as we anticipate adding nearly 17,000 new jobs between 2016 and 2017. My appreciation and thanks goes out to the more than 115,000 Dollar General employees that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our customer with convenience, value and service every day. 
With that, Mary Winn, we'd like to now open the call for questions."

But bear in mind that growth model is a long-term model and what we're really focused on is putting the actions in place to drive that model for the long term, and we have a lot of great actions in place. We feel great about real estate. We're on track to open 900 units this year and over, as Todd mentioned, over 50% full the pipeline to open 1,000 next year. And the great thing here is the economics are as compelling as ever. We continue to see our IRRs exceed our 20% target, continue to see a payback less than 2 years. Sales are indexing above expectations. As we mentioned at our Investor Day, a lot of exciting things with sales comps in terms of product assortment, store formats, operating initiatives that will be fully -- many of them will be fully implemented as we get into the back half of the year and should gain momentum. And then on operating profit, as evidenced by the Q1 results, the team is very effectively managing all the levers to deliver that 42 basis points of expansion with growth in both gross margin and SG&A. And the newest lever, zero-based budgeting, we're really seeing that start to contribute very rapidly and really become ingrained in the fabric in which we operate here. And then lastly, we feel great about the amount of cash that this business continues to kick off, allowing us to reinvest in this low-risk, high-return new unit growth and the structure to support it, while continuing to pay a competitive, and over time, growing dividend as well as consistent robust share repurchases. So the model is working great. We think that's evidenced by the Q1 results and feel great about the long-term impact of this and the ability to continue improving it."

I could tell you that when we started this journey 8 years ago to really look at exactly how much opportunity we had, we always weighted that depending on also where the consumer was going. And we still think that the consumer is looking for national brands in a lot cases, but also great value in our private brand offerings, which really goes toward that -- goes toward that import piece.

And I see people of all levels of the organization now looking at everything they do through the lens of zero-based budgeting and the filters we've talked about, with the customer, our strategic priorities, risk management and looking at things in terms of return on investment.

And we like the trade-off right now. We're not happy with it, we're looking at ways to mitigate that exposure on shrink. But what we felt that was even more compelling was to make sure that the customer, when they came in our store, had the product they needed on the shelf to purchase, and that was really the key driver. But rest assured that our operating team and our merchant marketing teams are working very, very hard, along with supply chain, to reduce that shrink number as we go forward. We still have a lot of levers to pull, still putting a lot of defensive merchandising tools and other tools for our district managers and our store managers to be able to monitor shrink even closer to the actual event.

In saying that, there's always retailers that at times will try different things.

And we also, every quarter, check it on the full book so we know exactly where we stand. And we, today, feel very confident in the where we sit on pricing, and if we see folks moving, you'll see us move because this is all about ensuring that we continue to drive units out of our stores, and of course, drive traffic into our stores. So anywhere that we may see where we need to be sharper on price, we'll take that action. and the great thing about Dollar General is, again, we've got the levers to enable us to do that.

We're not really going to say exactly how big it is, because what we're doing is making sure that we can refine the model appropriately with, again, only 45 open, but we've got a good idea. The important thing here is we are concentrating a lot, though, in those rural areas, where there is only room for one store. And that's why you see us moving very quickly in a lot of cases with our growth of 900 stores this year and up to 1,000 next year. And a lot of those areas are in these towns or even crossroads that can only support one retailer. And I sure would rather it be Dollar General and that's how we're going about this.

It really focuses our efforts and focuses our resources towards the highest returning mission-critical activities. And there's a lot of power to that and it really has a compounding effect. In addition, we have teams, we have 23 different cost packages, teams, with senior-level folks on the teams, cross-functional engagement, interaction. And we have a pretty rigorous routine now; monthly meetings with the senior leadership team, where we go deep and wide through all the costs. And with that increased learning, with that sharing across the company, it really drives best practices that feeds on itself. And we're going after costs. In process improvement, we're going after costs. In efficiencies, we're going after costs in just good old-fashioned prioritization of spending, working very closely with procurement to go deeper and wider on those activities. So it really cuts across the entire P&L. It really is the power of the teams working together to uncover. We've always had good cost management here and it's been a strength of ours, but with this zero-based budgeting, it really allows us to go that layer deeper to get those costs on the baseline that are hard to bring out and really drive an ownership type of mentality where it's not a use it, lose it budget that rolls ever but really everything has to pay for itself."

266974,378084082,1038948,"Dollar General Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. For the second quarter, we are pleased with our double-digit earnings per share growth even as our same-store sales performance fell short of our expectations. I'm particularly proud of the t",454,"Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. For the second quarter, we are pleased with our double-digit earnings per share growth even as our same-store sales performance fell short of our expectations. I'm particularly proud of the team's ability to effectively manage our gross profit margin and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in what proved to be a difficult sales environment. 
Key factors that negatively impacted our expected same-store sales performance included a greater-than-anticipated headwind from price deflation across key perishable items, with retail prices down about 8% for milk and over 50% for eggs, our 2 largest products within perishables; second, a reduction in both SNAP participation rates and benefit levels; third, an unseasonably mild spring; and lastly, an intensified promotional environment in select regions of the country. 
We estimate that the headwinds from price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the second quarter by approximately 60 to 70 basis points. As you will -- as I will discuss in more detail later in the call, we are taking aggressive action across merchandising and store operations to address these factors and help drive same-store sales, and we will continue to be very disciplined in our SG&A spending. I'm pleased with our overall financial performance and the team's ongoing focus on our long-term strategy despite the challenging retail environment. Highlights of the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year's second quarter include: net sales increased 5.8% to $5.4 billion, and same-store sales grew at 0.7%. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in nonconsumable category. 
Gross margin was 31.2%, an increase of 2 basis points. We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 8 basis points as our zero-based budgeting initiatives continue to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 7%, with operating profit margin expansion of 10 basis points. Net income in the second quarter increased 9% to $307 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08. Year-to-date through the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was 18%. Cash from operations increased 36% year-to-date through the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we returned over $294 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. We continue to grow market share as reported in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent low single digit to mid single digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. 
Now I'll turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter."
266974,378084082,1038948,"Dollar General Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter",1015,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit. 
Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter was $1.7 billion or 31.2% of sales, an increase of 2 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year's second quarter, higher additional markups on inventory purchases and lower transportation cost contributed to the gross profit rate increase, offset by higher markdowns, a greater proportion of sales growth in consumables, which carries a lower margin than non-consumables and higher inventory shrink. SG&A expense decreased by 8 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.2 billion or 21.7% of sales in the second quarter. The majority of the SG&A percentage decrease was due to reductions in administrative payroll costs, advertising costs and incentive compensation expenses, Partially offsetting these items were our retail, labor and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.  Similar to last quarter, our zero-based budgeting initiatives were a key driver of our SG&A performance. The team continues to actively work on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company, leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove cost that don't affect the customer experience.
Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% as compared to 38% in the second quarter last year. As in the first quarter, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by Congress in December 2015. 
Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Merchandise inventories at second quarter end were $3.27 billion. For the quarter, total inventory was up 8% and 1.6% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goals continues to be inventory growth, in line with our sales growth. Year-to-date in the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $793 million, an increase of 36% or $208 million compared to the 2015 second quarter as a result of both higher net income and working capital improvements. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $224 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. Year-to-date to the end of the second quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $597 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends.
From December 2011 through the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4 billion or 67.3 million shares of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.4 billion under the repurchase program. We are pleased to note that during the second quarter, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Baa2. In mid-August, we implemented a commercial paper program, with the goal to reduce our short-term borrowing rate as commercial paper rates are typically lower than rates under a revolver facility. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. 
Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
Looking ahead, items to keep in mind that will impact our results during the second half of the year include the purchase of 42 former Walmart Express locations, the implementation of the Department of Labor changes to the overtime exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the calendar shifts between the third and fourth quarters of this year. As we look to relocate 40 Dollar General locations into these purchase sites, we anticipate taking a charge in the 2016 third quarter of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to closed store lease obligations.
For the FLSA implementation, we continue to prepare for the changes, which are effective December 1 of this year by gaining experience with various test-and-learn scenarios. We anticipated the incremental expense will be about $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter this year. 
Please keep in mind this is a higher run rate in fiscal 2016 than we would expect next year due to the 53rd week in the fourth quarter this year and because certain initiatives intended to offset the incremental impact will not be in place until next year. Due to the calendar shifts year-over-year between the third and fourth quarter, our third quarter 2016 will be negatively impacted by the shift of 2 selling days prior to Halloween, along with the timing of a key payday into the fourth quarter 2016 as compared to being included in the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to our outlook. Recall that we stated that we intend to update our diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 only if we no longer reasonably expect diluted EPS to fall within the 10% to 15% range, outlined in the model included in our press release issued on March 10, 2016. We continue to forecast diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 within this range of 10% to 15%. 
Please keep in mind that the investments we are making across merchandising and store operation will take time to gain traction with our consumers. We remain committed to focusing on long-term profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. We are investing in initiatives intended to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base, with prices that they trust from us. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd."
266974,378084082,1038948,"Dollar General Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. We have a track record of strong financial results, and the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time for initiatives to resonate with our consumer.

We have a track record of strong financial results, and the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time for initiatives to resonate with our consumer. As we have said consistently, we are committed to increasing market share by growing both item units and traffic, and we will invest, as we deem appropriate, to meet this objective. To that end, we are making aggressive pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas that we see, as opportunities to be proactive, as we look to improve same-store sales and market share, all while providing our consumers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our focus is on the consumable categories to drive traffic and units. 
For example, we have taken retail price reductions on average of 10% on about 450 of our best-selling SKUs across 2,200 stores, representing nearly 17% of our store base. We believe that these price reductions are meaningful and recognizable to our consumers. We are committed to further price moves, as appropriate, over time. We are being strategic as we look to proactively address our pricing actions across our store base. These targeted price investments are in high household penetration, fast-turning categories. At the same time, we are investing and communicating these price breaks to our consumers through incremental store signage, ad circulars, digital coupons, e-mail and digital media. 
While we're still very early in making these investments, the results are on track with where we would like for the performance to be on increasing units and traffic. We will continue to monitor our pricing actions and assess the opportunity for ongoing preemptive moves to enhance our competitive positioning. We anticipate refreshing these price investments across items and categories, as well as incremental markets, as needed, as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture additional market share. 
As for our core consumer, we operate with the reality that it is always challenging for her to stretch her budget, given the pressures on her income and spending. We have seen an ongoing contraction in core consumer all outlet retail spending, as reflected in the Nielsen panel data. Given that our core consumer skews toward a lower income household, I believe the cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as reduction in SNAP participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses are taking a noticeable toll on her spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. We will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. Over the long term, we believe our pricing, labor and marketing investments will pay off in trips and units through increased customer loyalty. As we work through our category management process for 2016, we assess the expansion of product groups that were most likely to drive traffic in our stores. 
Through the first half of 2016, we have a made great progress on expanding space allocation for perishables, health and beauty care and party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across, not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also in our mature store base to a greater degree than in the last several years. Implementation of these initiatives will be completed in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have added nearly 21,000 cooler doors to our mature stores to allow for an expanded offering of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores have seen planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores receiving expansions in each of these product areas. This initiative was completed in the second quarter of this year.
Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up in package size and brands over time. Currently, nearly 49% of our baskets contain a $1 item. 
In our new DG16 format, these baskets are nearly $3 higher than our average basket, indicating these are incremental purchases. Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales growth as these items contribute to sales and enhance gross margins.
Our consumers rely on the quality, value and affordability of our private brands. Our private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers, and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our consumers. We continue to have private brand opportunity, as our customer penetration is below the average in the mass merchant and grocery segments. We are actively engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our consumers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private line named Heartland Harvest, to expand our better-for-you offerings, which really resonates with our millennials. By next month, we anticipate offering over 50 new SKUs under this better-for-you brand. 
This year, we have also expanded our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. In select Dollar General Plus locations, we initiated a test of limited assortments of the industry's best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience with these products and capitalize on our consumers' continued desire for fresh options. So far, we are pleased with the early results. 
Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting of coupons. The program provides consumers exclusive savings available only as DG Digital Coupons. The compelling offerings, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. Importantly, we are seeing a higher average basket when the DG digital coupons are utilized. The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have reduced their core out-of-stocks by more than 20%. 
Throughout the chain, our consumers are taking note of our improved in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years based on comparable quarters. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets, and are pleased with the comp sales performance, operating profit gains and customer satisfaction scores. 
Second, we're focused on initiative to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth for -- with a proven high-return, low-risk model. As we previously announced, we are on track to accelerate our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increase this growth to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. We continue to be very pleased with the strong results that we have gained through this program. Our new store productivity remains in the range of 80% to 85% of our comp store base, all while driving returns of 20% plus.
Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. Through the second quarter, the team has already completed nearly 1,100 real estate projects in this new layout. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new consumer trips to Dollar General, as we place an even greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience.
The early results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we are seeing stronger perishables sales and a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is exceeding our expectations. Even more importantly, our customers are telling us they like it, as our customer satisfaction scores are significantly higher for the DG16 layout. 
In addition, we are utilizing a smaller footprint store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. To date, we are currently operating more than 80 of these new stores, with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional store. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns of the small-format stores are very encouraging. This store footprint incorporates all of our strategic initiatives, but with edited assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection.
We anticipate that the smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household count as well. With this format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. In total, we anticipate we will have approximately 120 of the smaller format stores, including remodels, open as we exit the 2016 fiscal year.
In July, we announced the purchase of former Walmart Express locations that we intend to have operating as Dollar General stores by the end of October. 40 of the 42 sites will be considered relocations of existing stores. Each of these locations will have fresh meat and produce, and 38 will have fueling stations. The team is moving very fast to get these locations up and running to better serve these communities with the everyday low prices and convenience our customers count on from us. 
We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brands relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 900 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with a similar level of product -- projects slated for fiscal 2017. 
We anticipate expanding our footprint in 2017 into North Dakota, representing our 44th state of operations. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017 as our 1,000 store pipeline is already over 80% complete. We remain disciplined and focused as our new store program continues to drive compelling returns with a low cost to build and a low cost to operate.
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our second quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process is working as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth significantly below our 2.5% to 3% SG&A leverage target. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store management development through great onboarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements in our store manager turnover and are on track to have our best retention rate in several years. 
To build on these improvements coming forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on the store characteristics to -- in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in-store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate retention. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are clearly focused on providing our customers with value and convenience in the current environment as our customers need us more than ever to help stretch her household spending.
Earlier this month, we had over 1,000 field leaders together in Nashville to discuss our plans for the future. As I engage with the team, it was clear to me they are energized and excited about our plans. We are acting with a sense of urgency across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. I believe we are well-positioned for the future and are focused on capturing the long-term opportunities ahead of us. 
Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in new store growth while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend. 
To the more than 119,000 Dollar General employees across our 13,000 store locations, distribution centers and the store support center that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with convenience, value and service every day, please accept my thanks and appreciation for all that you do as we gear up for the holiday selling season. 
With that, Mary Winn, we'd now like to turn the call open for questions."

So what we are looking at in our 2,200 stores that we've reduced prices on average of 10%, what we have done is a proactive approach to it, not necessarily chasing anybody, but actually, putting price where we believe that will best serve our consumer and best to be able to capture market share. And as we continue to move forward and expand that, whether it be other markets and/or other items, we'll take that the same tack being proactive and not reactive.

Is it just the adjustments from the labor expense being added into the fourth quarter and the kind of rent and expenses associated with the stores that you acquired?

And I'll reiterate what I said at the beginning of the call is that and we stated this previously, it was in our earnings release that we were talking to the 10% to 15% range and is still forecasting to be within that range for full year EPS but not otherwise updating any specific aspect of the guidance today. But what I also want to reiterate is that this team has a strong track record of managing all the business levers to deliver profit cash growth and feel good about the first half performance at 14%, 18% year-to-date EPS growth and 14% in Q2 as well as the strong cash growth. But what I will tell you is that we have had headwinds in the second half. We mentioned the charge associated with the 42 newly acquired stores. That will be about $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share impact. We also have the implementation of FLSA, which is about $0.03 to $0.04 impact in Q4. And I think it's important to note there, but even though that's only over 2 months, we can extrapolate that over the course of next year given that we have a 53rd week at the end of the year as well as many of the actions that help mitigate that cost next year won't be fully implemented until next year. But those 2 will have impacts on the balance of the year. And then again bear in mind, we are focused on the long term here and making the right decision to be there for our customer out when she needs us the most and with the eye in the long term, are making investments that we talked about earlier in the call. But again, the business fundamental that remained unchanged with we're very excited about opening 900 new units this year, on track for 1,000 next year. As Todd mentioned, pipeline is 80% full, and we're still seeing the same compelling, great unit level economics since we opened the stores with the same productivity and the same great returns over 20%."

And also, our core consumer continues to be under a lot of pressure. I know that when we look at globally, the overall U.S. population, it's seemingly -- it seems like things are getting better but when you start breaking it down and you look at that core consumer that we serve on the lower economic scale that's out there, that demographic, things have not gotten any better for her. And arguably, they're worse. And they're worse because rents are accelerating, health care is accelerating on her at a very, very rapid clip. And now, you couple that in upwards of 20 states where they have reduced or eliminated the SNAP benefit, and it has really put a toll on her. That SNAP benefit reduction and/or elimination happened in April, right? That was the kickoff, and you could see it immediately in the numbers. So I believe that those are the things that are affecting her today, again our core customer. And by the way, we've seen this play out before. If you dial the clock back to October of '13 and coming into November of 2013 when the last large SNAP benefit reduction happened, it happened almost exactly the same way on our comps and how we saw traffic. Obviously, we were up a little higher level at that time. But rest assured that our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar as it did now. The difference here is we're going to take aggressive price action to get that consumer back in the store. She needs a little motivation to get back in. We need to help her stretch her budget for a time period until she figures it out. Our core customer's very resilient. They'll figure it out over time, but they need a little help as they tend to now try to figure out how to make ends meet with less money during the month."

Predominantly, that's what we're talking about here. And it's in big categories for us it, right, in milk and eggs. Remember, we don't have the breadth and depth that mass grocery has in our perishable and food businesses. So when that deflation hits in some of these key categories, it hits us a little harder so in those 2, but also beyond that in dry grocery, we still see sugar, grain, cereals, coffee, so some of our largest categories being affected by cost decreases, which then, in turn, become retail decreases.

And we see first-hand this consumer each and every time we're out. And this core consumer, I tell you is got to know better as far as her economic well-being. As a matter of fact, she tells us while we're out in the stores or even through all our panel data that we do, that while things haven't gotten a lot worse as far as income coming in other than the recent SNAP decrease, I -- my expenditures are going up at a very rapid rate. Health care is one of the big ones because most of our consumers, while she may be working doesn't have health care, and we all know that she's having to now pay for this health care or be taxed on it, right? So that this starting to really play against that low-end consumer right now, and it will continue to play against her. You couple that with those rents that we talked about, those increased rents are real. And in any many parts where we serve our customer, the affordability and availability of rental units are getting more and more scarce, which is driving up prices. And we're seeing that because most of our core customers cannot and do not own their own homes. And when we're out in the stores and we drop prices like we do, I can tell you, I've been out in stores in the middle of the aisle and heard customers come up to our store manager in tears and thanking them for being there and thanking them for the prices that we offer in a real convenient nature where we can she can walk to the store because she can afford anything else. When you hear that, that really brings home where this core customer is."

We continue to have expense control and efficiencies around DC and trends, and the team continues to effectively manage the levers of category management, private label and foreign sourcing. And we also work with our vendors to make sure that we can hit at those price points. On the SG&A side, as you saw, we had tremendous improvement over the last 2 periods zero-based budgeting. We've had history of lean cost management, and zero-based budgeting is really taken hold and help us get to that next level of savings, and you see that in the results, and the team is working on a pipeline of future savings focused on noncustomer-facing areas, and the rigors really becoming ingrained. So we will continue to work those too over time. As we said, not every quarter is created the same and headwinds in the near term. But we continue to see opportunity over the longer term, managing all these levers as we have in the past."

266974,378084082,1039039,"Dollar General Corporation, Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Mary Winn, and welcome to everyone joining our call. For the second quarter, we are pleased with our double-digit earnings per share growth even as our same-store sales performance fell short of our expectations.

For the second quarter, we are pleased with our double-digit earnings per share growth even as our same-store sales performance fell short of our expectations. I'm particularly proud of the team's ability to effectively manage our gross profit margin and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in what proved to be a difficult sales environment. 
Key factors that negatively impacted our expected same-store sales performance included a greater-than-anticipated headwind from price deflation across key perishable items, with retail prices down about 8% for milk and over 50% for eggs, our 2 largest products within perishables; second, a reduction in both SNAP participation rates and benefit levels; third, an unseasonably mild spring; and lastly, an intensified promotional environment in select regions of the country. 
We estimate that the headwinds from price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the second quarter by approximately 60 to 70 basis points. As you will -- as I will discuss in more detail later in the call, we are taking aggressive action across merchandising and store operations to address these factors and help drive same-store sales, and we will continue to be very disciplined in our SG&A spending. I'm pleased with our overall financial performance and the team's ongoing focus on our long-term strategy despite the challenging retail environment. Highlights of the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year's second quarter include: net sales increased 5.8% to $5.4 billion, and same-store sales grew at 0.7%. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in nonconsumable category. 
Gross margin was 31.2%, an increase of 2 basis points. We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 8 basis points as our zero-based budgeting initiatives continue to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 7%, with operating profit margin expansion of 10 basis points. Net income in the second quarter increased 9% to $307 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08. Year-to-date through the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was 18%. Cash from operations increased 36% year-to-date through the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we returned over $294 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. We continue to grow market share as reported in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent low single digit to mid single digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. 
Now I'll turn the call over to John to go through more details of the quarter."

As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit.

As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit. 
Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter was $1.7 billion or 31.2% of sales, an increase of 2 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year's second quarter, higher additional markups on inventory purchases and lower transportation cost contributed to the gross profit rate increase, offset by higher markdowns, a greater proportion of sales growth in consumables, which carries a lower margin than non-consumables and higher inventory shrink. SG&A expense decreased by 8 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.2 billion or 21.7% of sales in the second quarter. The majority of the SG&A percentage decrease was due to reductions in administrative payroll costs, advertising costs and incentive compensation expenses, Partially offsetting these items were our retail, labor and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.  Similar to last quarter, our zero-based budgeting initiatives were a key driver of our SG&A performance. The team continues to actively work on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company, leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove cost that don't affect the customer experience.
Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% as compared to 38% in the second quarter last year. As in the first quarter, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by Congress in December 2015. 
Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Merchandise inventories at second quarter end were $3.27 billion. For the quarter, total inventory was up 8% and 1.6% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goals continues to be inventory growth, in line with our sales growth. Year-to-date in the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $793 million, an increase of 36% or $208 million compared to the 2015 second quarter as a result of both higher net income and working capital improvements. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $224 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. Year-to-date to the end of the second quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $597 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends.
From December 2011 through the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4 billion or 67.3 million shares of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.4 billion under the repurchase program. We are pleased to note that during the second quarter, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Baa2. In mid-August, we implemented a commercial paper program, with the goal to reduce our short-term borrowing rate as commercial paper rates are typically lower than rates under a revolver facility. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. 
Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
Looking ahead, items to keep in mind that will impact our results during the second half of the year include the purchase of 42 former Walmart Express locations, the implementation of the Department of Labor changes to the overtime exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the calendar shifts between the third and fourth quarters of this year. As we look to relocate 40 Dollar General locations into these purchase sites, we anticipate taking a charge in the 2016 third quarter of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to closed store lease obligations.
For the FLSA implementation, we continue to prepare for the changes, which are effective December 1 of this year by gaining experience with various test-and-learn scenarios. We anticipated the incremental expense will be about $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter this year. 
Please keep in mind this is a higher run rate in fiscal 2016 than we would expect next year due to the 53rd week in the fourth quarter this year and because certain initiatives intended to offset the incremental impact will not be in place until next year. Due to the calendar shifts year-over-year between the third and fourth quarter, our third quarter 2016 will be negatively impacted by the shift of 2 selling days prior to Halloween, along with the timing of a key payday into the fourth quarter 2016 as compared to being included in the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to our outlook. Recall that we stated that we intend to update our diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 only if we no longer reasonably expect diluted EPS to fall within the 10% to 15% range, outlined in the model included in our press release issued on March 10, 2016. We continue to forecast diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 within this range of 10% to 15%. 
Please keep in mind that the investments we are making across merchandising and store operation will take time to gain traction with our consumers. We remain committed to focusing on long-term profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. We are investing in initiatives intended to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base, with prices that they trust from us. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd."

We have a track record of strong financial results, and the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time for initiatives to resonate with our consumer.

We have a track record of strong financial results, and the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time for initiatives to resonate with our consumer. As we have said consistently, we are committed to increasing market share by growing both item units and traffic, and we will invest, as we deem appropriate, to meet this objective. To that end, we are making aggressive pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas that we see, as opportunities to be proactive, as we look to improve same-store sales and market share, all while providing our consumers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our focus is on the consumable categories to drive traffic and units. 
For example, we have taken retail price reductions on average of 10% on about 450 of our best-selling SKUs across 2,200 stores, representing nearly 17% of our store base. We believe that these price reductions are meaningful and recognizable to our consumers. We are committed to further price moves, as appropriate, over time. We are being strategic as we look to proactively address our pricing actions across our store base. These targeted price investments are in high household penetration, fast-turning categories. At the same time, we are investing and communicating these price breaks to our consumers through incremental store signage, ad circulars, digital coupons, e-mail and digital media. 
While we're still very early in making these investments, the results are on track with where we would like for the performance to be on increasing units and traffic. We will continue to monitor our pricing actions and assess the opportunity for ongoing preemptive moves to enhance our competitive positioning. We anticipate refreshing these price investments across items and categories, as well as incremental markets, as needed, as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture additional market share. 
As for our core consumer, we operate with the reality that it is always challenging for her to stretch her budget, given the pressures on her income and spending. We have seen an ongoing contraction in core consumer all outlet retail spending, as reflected in the Nielsen panel data. Given that our core consumer skews toward a lower income household, I believe the cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as reduction in SNAP participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses are taking a noticeable toll on her spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. We will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. Over the long term, we believe our pricing, labor and marketing investments will pay off in trips and units through increased customer loyalty. As we work through our category management process for 2016, we assess the expansion of product groups that were most likely to drive traffic in our stores. 
Through the first half of 2016, we have a made great progress on expanding space allocation for perishables, health and beauty care and party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across, not just new stores, relocations and remodels, but also in our mature store base to a greater degree than in the last several years. Implementation of these initiatives will be completed in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have added nearly 21,000 cooler doors to our mature stores to allow for an expanded offering of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores have seen planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores receiving expansions in each of these product areas. This initiative was completed in the second quarter of this year.
Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up in package size and brands over time. Currently, nearly 49% of our baskets contain a $1 item. 
In our new DG16 format, these baskets are nearly $3 higher than our average basket, indicating these are incremental purchases. Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales growth as these items contribute to sales and enhance gross margins.
Our consumers rely on the quality, value and affordability of our private brands. Our private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers, and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our consumers. We continue to have private brand opportunity, as our customer penetration is below the average in the mass merchant and grocery segments. We are actively engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our consumers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private line named Heartland Harvest, to expand our better-for-you offerings, which really resonates with our millennials. By next month, we anticipate offering over 50 new SKUs under this better-for-you brand. 
This year, we have also expanded our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. In select Dollar General Plus locations, we initiated a test of limited assortments of the industry's best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience with these products and capitalize on our consumers' continued desire for fresh options. So far, we are pleased with the early results. 
Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting of coupons. The program provides consumers exclusive savings available only as DG Digital Coupons. The compelling offerings, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. Importantly, we are seeing a higher average basket when the DG digital coupons are utilized. The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have reduced their core out-of-stocks by more than 20%. 
Throughout the chain, our consumers are taking note of our improved in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years based on comparable quarters. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets, and are pleased with the comp sales performance, operating profit gains and customer satisfaction scores. 
Second, we're focused on initiative to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth for -- with a proven high-return, low-risk model. As we previously announced, we are on track to accelerate our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increase this growth to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. We continue to be very pleased with the strong results that we have gained through this program. Our new store productivity remains in the range of 80% to 85% of our comp store base, all while driving returns of 20% plus.
Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. Through the second quarter, the team has already completed nearly 1,100 real estate projects in this new layout. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new consumer trips to Dollar General, as we place an even greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience.
The early results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we are seeing stronger perishables sales and a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is exceeding our expectations. Even more importantly, our customers are telling us they like it, as our customer satisfaction scores are significantly higher for the DG16 layout. 
In addition, we are utilizing a smaller footprint store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. To date, we are currently operating more than 80 of these new stores, with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional store. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns of the small-format stores are very encouraging. This store footprint incorporates all of our strategic initiatives, but with edited assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection.
We anticipate that the smaller format will work in rural locations with lower household count as well. With this format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites. In total, we anticipate we will have approximately 120 of the smaller format stores, including remodels, open as we exit the 2016 fiscal year.
In July, we announced the purchase of former Walmart Express locations that we intend to have operating as Dollar General stores by the end of October. 40 of the 42 sites will be considered relocations of existing stores. Each of these locations will have fresh meat and produce, and 38 will have fueling stations. The team is moving very fast to get these locations up and running to better serve these communities with the everyday low prices and convenience our customers count on from us. 
We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brands relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 900 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with a similar level of product -- projects slated for fiscal 2017.  We anticipate expanding our footprint in 2017 into North Dakota, representing our 44th state of operations. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017, as our 1,000 store pipeline is already over 80% complete. We remain disciplined and focused as our new store program continues to drive compelling returns with a low cost to build and a low cost to operate.
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our second quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process is working, as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth significantly below our 2.5% to 3% SG&A leverage target. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple, but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements in our store manager turnover, and are on track to have our best retention rate in several years. 
To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics to -- in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate retention. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are clearly focused on providing our customers with value and convenience in the current environment, as our customers need us more than ever to help stretch her household spending.
Earlier this month, we had over 1,000 field leaders together in Nashville to discuss our plans for the future. As I engage with the team, it was clear to me they are energized and excited about our plans. We are acting with a sense of urgency across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. I believe we are well-positioned for the future and are focused on capturing the long-term opportunities ahead of us. 
Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in new store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend. To the more than 119,000 Dollar General employees across our 13,000 store locations, distribution centers and store support center that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with convenience, value and service every day, please accept my thanks and appreciation for all that you do, as we gear up for the holiday selling season. 
With that, Mary Winn, we'd now like to turn the call open for questions."

I guess take me forward in how you see this rolling through DG's numbers, how it ends well for most people that are selling consumables because everyone is saying the same thing, ""We got to get aggressive.

There is no doubt about it. But you know what? Retail is always aggressive, and there's always folks doing different things, and we compete and have competed for many, many years with many retailers. In saying that, the way we look at it this is being proactive. So what we are looking at in our 2,200 stores that we've reduced prices on average of 10%, what we have done is a proactive approach to it, not necessarily chasing anybody, but actually, putting price where we believe will best serve our consumer and best to be able to capture market share. And as we continue to move forward and expand that, whether it be other markets and/or other items, we'll take that same tack being proactive and not reactive. Because you're right, if everyone is reactive then, in fact, sometimes, it doesn't end well. Lastly, the great thing about Dollar General is that we have the wherewithal to do this. We have the wherewithal to do it within our P&L, and others may or may not have that same luxury. So we see it as a real advantage for Dollar General.

But what I will tell you is that we have headwinds in the second half. We mentioned the charge associated with the 42 newly acquired stores. That will be about $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share impact. We also have the implementation of FLSA, which is about $0.03 to $0.04 impact in Q4. And I think it's important to note there that even though that's only over 2 months, you can't extrapolate that over the course of next year, given that we have a 53rd week in -- at the end of the year as well as many of the actions that help mitigate that cost next year won't be fully implemented until next year. But those 2 will have impacts on the balance of the year. And then again, bear in mind, we're focused on the long term here and making the right decision to be there for our customer when she needs us the most, and with the eye in the long term, are making investments that we talked about earlier in the call. But again, the business fundamental that we've stressed remain unchanged with we're very excited about opening 900 new units this year, on track for 1,000 next year.

And also, our core consumer continues to be under a lot of pressure. I know that when we look at globally the overall U.S. population, it's seemingly -- it seems like things are getting better. But when you really start breaking it down and you look at that core consumer that we serve on the lower economic scale that's out there, that demographic, things have not gotten any better for her, and arguably, they're worse. And they're worse because rents are accelerating. Health care is accelerating on her at a very, very rapid clip. And now you couple that in upwards of 20 states where they have reduced or eliminated the SNAP benefit, and it has really put a toll on her. That SNAP benefit reduction and/or elimination happened in April, right? That was the kickoff, and you could see it immediately in the numbers. So I believe that those are the things that are affecting her today, again, our core customer. And by the way, we've seen this play out before. If you dial the clock back to October of '13 and coming into November of 2013 when the last large SNAP benefit reduction happened, it happened almost exactly the same way on our comps and how we saw traffic. Obviously, we were up at a little higher level at that time, but rest assured that our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar as it did now. The difference here is we're going to take aggressive price action to get that consumer back in the store. She needs a little motivation to get back in. We need to help her stretch her budget for a time period until she figures it out. Our core customer's very resilient. They'll figure it out over time, but they need a little help as they tend to now try to figure out how to make ends meet with less money during the month."

So I believe everyone knows some of the retailers that are working price right now. But as I mentioned earlier, we've seen that over the years and over time. And we compete very well with mass merchant retailers, grocery and drug retailers. And then the only thing is we, again, our consumers give us a lot of credit where our prices are today. We're some of the lowest in the marketplace with nearly being at parity with mass, 20% on average lower than grocery and 40% plus lower everyday than drug on the shelf. And when you think about it in those terms, we feel very confident that our pricing structure is well intact, and this is all about everyday low price for our consumer. She needs to have the confidence that if she walks in, she has an everyday low price. She doesn't have to wonder whether it's on sale or she has to buy 5 or 10 at a time to get a deal.

Once again, we just don't see that competitive nature being the largest factor here. What we see again is that SNAP reduction and that deflation being some of the biggest headwind, and then second -- third after that being just the overall macro environment for our core consumer. When you look at the deflation, it is primarily due to commodity price reduction, so cost reductions to us, which we then pass on to the consumer at lower retails. Predominantly, that's what we're talking about here, and it's in big categories for us, right, in milk and eggs. Remember, we don't have the breadth and depth that mass grocery has in our perishable and food businesses. So when that deflation hits in some of these key categories, it hits us a little harder, so in those 2. But also beyond that in dry grocery, we still see sugar, grain, cereals, coffee, so some of our largest categories being affected by cost decreases, which then, in turn, become retail decreases. And as we all know, the consumers don't consume that much more just because the price is a little less expensive. So that is really the impetus behind what we see as some of those headwinds. And as I said before, those headwinds, we anticipate seeing with us through the back half of the year."

I'm out a couple of times a month with our head merchant, our head operator, and we see first-hand this consumer each and every time we're out. And this core consumer, I tell you, has got to know better as far as her economic well-being. As a matter of fact, she tells us while we're out in the stores or even through all of our panel data that we do, that while things haven't gotten a lot worse as far as income coming in, other than the recent SNAP decrease, I -- my expenditures are going up at a very rapid rate. Health care is one of the big ones because most of our consumers, while she may be working, doesn't have health care, and we all know that she's having to now pay for this health care or be taxed on it, right? So that is starting to really play against that low-end consumer right now, and it will continue to play against her. You couple that with those rents that we talked about, those increased rents are real. And in any many parts of where we serve our customer, the affordability and availability of rental units are getting more and more scarce, which is driving up prices, and we're seeing that because most of our core customers cannot and do not own their own homes. And when we're out in the stores and we drop prices like we do, I can tell you, I've been out in stores in the middle of the aisle, and heard customers come up to our store manager in tears and thanking them for being there and thanking them for the prices that we offer in a real convenient nature for her where we can she can walk to the store because she can afford anything else.

For the second quarter, we are pleased with our double-digit earnings per share growth even as our same-store sales performance fell short of our expectations. I'm particularly proud of the team's ability to effectively manage our gross profit margin and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in what proved to be a difficult sales environment. 
Key factors that negatively impacted our expected same-store sales performance included a greater-than-anticipated headwind from price deflation across key perishable items, with retail prices down about 8% for milk and over 50% for eggs, our 2 largest products within perishables; second, a reduction in both SNAP participation rates and benefit levels; third, an unseasonably mild spring; and lastly, an intensified promotional environment in select regions of the country. 
We estimate that the headwinds from price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the second quarter by approximately 60 to 70 basis points. As you will -- as I will discuss in more detail later in the call, we are taking aggressive action across merchandising and store operations to address these factors and help drive same-store sales, and we will continue to be very disciplined in our SG&A spending. I'm pleased with our overall financial performance and the team's ongoing focus on our long-term strategy despite the challenging retail environment. Highlights of the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year's second quarter include: net sales increased 5.8% to $5.4 billion, and same-store sales grew at 0.7%. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by a decline in nonconsumable category. 
Gross margin was 31.2%, an increase of 2 basis points. We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 8 basis points as our zero-based budgeting initiatives continue to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 7%, with operating profit margin expansion of 10 basis points. Net income in the second quarter increased 9% to $307 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08. Year-to-date through the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was 18%. Cash from operations increased 36% year-to-date through the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we returned over $294 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. We continued to grow market share as reported in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods.

As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit. Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter",1016,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit. 
Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter was $1.7 billion or 31.2% of sales, an increase of 2 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year's second quarter, higher additional markups on inventory purchases and lower transportation costs contributed to the gross profit rate increase, offset by higher markdowns, a greater proportion of sales growth in consumables, which carries a lower margin than non-consumables and higher inventory shrink. SG&A expense decreased by 8 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.2 billion or 21.7% of sales in the second quarter. The majority of the SG&A percentage decrease was due to reductions in administrative payroll costs, advertising costs and incentive compensation expenses. Partially offsetting these items were our retail, labor and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.  Similar to last quarter, our zero-based budgeting initiatives were a key driver of our SG&A performance. The team continues to actively work on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company, leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove costs that don't affect the customer experience.
Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% as compared to 38% in the second quarter last year. As in the first quarter, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by Congress in December 2015. 
Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Merchandise inventories at second quarter end were $3.27 billion. For the quarter, total inventory was up 8% and 1.6% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth, in line with our sales growth. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $793 million, an increase of 36% or $208 million compared to the 2015 second quarter as a result of both higher net income and working capital improvements. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $224 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. Year-to-date through the end of the second quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $597 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends.
From December 2011 through the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4 billion or 67.3 million shares of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.4 billion under the repurchase program. We are pleased to note that, during the second quarter, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Baa2. In mid-August, we implemented a commercial paper program with the goal to reduce our short-term borrowing rate as commercial paper rates are typically lower than rates under a revolver facility. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. 
Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
Looking ahead, items to keep in mind that will impact our results during the second half of the year include the purchase of 42 former Walmart Express locations, the implementation of the Department of Labor changes to the overtime exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the calendar shifts between the third and fourth quarters of this year. As we look to relocate 40 Dollar General locations into these purchase sites, we anticipate taking a charge in the 2016 third quarter of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to closed store lease obligations.
For the FLSA implementation, we continue to prepare for the changes, which are effective December 1 of this year, by gaining experience with various test-and-learn scenarios. We anticipate the incremental expense will be about $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter this year. 
Please keep in mind this is a higher run rate in fiscal 2016 than we would expect next year due to the 53rd week in the fourth quarter this year and because certain initiatives intended to offset the incremental impact will not be in place until next year. Due to the calendar shifts, year-over-year, between the third and fourth quarter, our third quarter 2016 will be negatively impacted by the shift of 2 selling days, prior to Halloween, along with the timing of a key payday into the fourth quarter 2016 as compared to being included in the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to our outlook. Recall that we stated that we intend to update our diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 only if we no longer reasonably expect diluted EPS to fall within the 10% to 15% range, outlined in the model included in our press release issued on March 10, 2016. We continue to forecast diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 within this range of 10% to 15%. 
Please keep in mind that the investments we are making across merchandising and store operations will take time to gain traction with our consumers. We remain committed to focusing on the long-term profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. We are investing in initiatives intended to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base, with prices that they trust from us. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd."

We have a track record of strong financial results and the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time for our initiatives to resonate with our consumer. As we have said consistently, we are committed to increasing market share by growing both item units and traffic, and we will invest, as we deem appropriate, to meet this objective. To that end, we are making aggressive pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas that we see as opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share, all while providing our consumers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our focus is on the consumable categories to drive traffic and units. 
For example, we have taken retail price reductions on average of 10% on about 450 of our best-selling SKUs across 2,200 stores, representing nearly 17% of our store base. We believe that these price reductions are meaningful and recognizable to our consumers. We are committed to further price moves, as appropriate, over time. We are being strategic as we look to proactively address our pricing actions across our store base. These targeted price investments are in high household penetration, fast-turning categories. At the same time, we are investing and communicating these price breaks to our consumers through incremental store signage, ad circulars, digital coupons, e-mail and digital media. 
While it is still very early in making these investments, the results are on track with where we would like for the performance to be on increasing units and traffic. We will continue to monitor our pricing actions and assess the opportunity for ongoing preemptive moves to enhance our competitive positioning. We anticipate refreshing these price investments across items and categories, as well as incremental markets, as needed, as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture additional market share. 
As for our core consumer, we operate with the reality that it is always challenging for her to stretch her budget, given the pressures on her income and spending. We have seen an ongoing contraction in core consumer all-outlet retail spending, as reflected in the Nielsen panel data. Given that our core consumer skews toward a lower income household, I believe the cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as a reduction in SNAP participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses are taking a noticeable toll on her spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. We will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. Over the long term, we believe our pricing, labor and marketing investments will pay off in trips and units through increased customer loyalty. As we work through our category management process for 2016, we assessed the expansion of product groups that were most likely to drive traffic in our stores. 
Through the first half of 2016, we have made great progress on expanding space allocation for perishables, health and beauty care, and party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels but also in our mature store base to a greater degree than in the last several years. Implementation of these initiatives will be completed in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have added nearly 21,000 cooler doors to our mature stores to allow for an expanded offering of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores have seen planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores receiving expansions in each of these product areas. This initiative was completed in the second quarter of this year.
Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up in package size and brands over time. Currently, nearly 49% of our baskets contain a $1 item. 
In our new DG16 format, these baskets are nearly $3 higher than our average basket, indicating these are incremental purchases. Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales growth as these items contribute to sales and enhance gross margins.
Our consumers rely on the quality, value and affordability of our private brands. Our private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our consumers. We continue to have private brand opportunity as our customer penetration is below the average in the mass merchant and grocery segments. We are actively engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our consumers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private line named Heartland Harvest, to expand our better-for-you offerings, which really resonate with our millennials. By next month, we anticipate offering over 15 new SKUs under this better-for-you brand. 
This year, we have also expanded our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. In select Dollar General Plus locations, we initiated a test of limited assortments of the industry's best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience with these products and capitalize on our consumers' continued desire for fresh options. So far, we are pleased with the early results. 
Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting of coupons. The program provides consumers exclusive savings available only as DG Digital Coupons. The compelling offerings, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. Importantly, we are seeing a higher average basket when the DG digital coupons are utilized. The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have reduced their core out-of-stocks by more than 20%. 
Throughout the chain, our consumers are taking note of our improved in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years based on comparable quarters. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the comp sales performance, operating profit gains and customer satisfaction scores. 
Second, we're focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth for -- with a proven high-return, low-risk model. As we previously announced, we are on track to accelerate our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increase this growth to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. We continue to be very pleased with the strong results that we have gained through this program. Our new store productivity remains in the range of 80% to 85% of our comp store base, all while driving returns of 20% plus.
Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. Through the second quarter, the team has already completed nearly 1,100 real estate projects in this new layout. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place an even greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience.
The early results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we are seeing stronger perishable sales and a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is exceeding our expectations. Even more importantly, our customers are telling us they like it as our customer satisfaction scores are significantly higher for the DG16 layout. 
In addition, we are utilizing a smaller footprint store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. To date, we are currently operating more than 80 of these new stores, with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional store. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns of the small-format stores are very encouraging. This store footprint incorporates all of our strategic initiatives, but with edited assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection.
We anticipate that this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count as well. With this format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower-household rural sites. In total, we anticipate we will have approximately 120 of the smaller format stores, including remodels, open as we exit the 2016 fiscal year.
In July, we announced the purchase of former Walmart Express locations that we intend to have operating as Dollar General stores by the end of October. 40 of the 42 sites will be considered relocations of existing stores. Each of these locations will have fresh meat and produce, and 38 will have fueling stations. The team is moving very fast to get these locations up and running to better serve these communities with the everyday low prices and convenience our customers count on from us. 
We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brands relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 900 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with a similar level of product -- projects slated for fiscal 2017.  We anticipate expanding our footprint in 2017 into North Dakota, representing our 44th state of operations. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017, as our 1,000 store pipeline is already over 80% complete. We remain disciplined and focused as our new store program continues to drive compelling returns with a low cost to build and a low cost to operate.
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our second quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process is working as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth significantly below our 2.5% to 3% SG&A leverage target. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements in our store manager turnover and are on track to have our best retention rate in several years. 
To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics to -- in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate retention. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are clearly focused on providing our customers with value and convenience in the current environment as our customers need us more than ever to help stretch her household spending.
Earlier this month, we had over 1,000 field leaders together in Nashville to discuss our plans for the future. As I engaged with the team, it was clear to me they are energized and excited about our plans. We are acting with a sense of urgency across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our long-term commitment to growth in shareholder value is unchanged. I believe we are well-positioned for the future and are focused on capturing the long-term opportunities ahead of us. 
Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in new store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend. To the more than 119,000 Dollar General employees across our 13,000 store locations, distribution centers and store support center that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with convenience, value and service every day, please accept my thanks and appreciation for all that you do as we gear up for the holiday selling season. 
With that, Mary Winn, we'd now like to turn the call open for questions."

In saying that, we see an opportunity, especially with our millennial group, but even our core customer on some more fresh opportunities and offerings for her, not only in fruits and vegetables, some fresh meats, that makes sense, but also, as I indicated, in some of our better-for-you lines that we're now starting to put out. Our core consumer is starting to gravitate to that, and our next level up, our ""Best Friends Forever"" group in that millennial segment really resonate with it.

And if Walmart continues on their path and now we've seen Delhaize follow suit and it will, obviously, up their consumable -- aggressiveness in consumables. Target has referenced it. We have Albertsons-Safeway being pretty aggressive in certain markets. I guess take me forward in how you see this rolling through DG's numbers, how it ends well for most people that are selling consumables, because everyone is saying the same thing, ""We got to get aggressive. We got to drive the traffic."" But it seems like we're just descending into a price war."

There is no doubt about it. But you know what? Retail is always aggressive, and there's always folks doing different things, and we compete and have competed for many, many years with many retailers. In saying that, the way we look at this is being proactive. So what we are looking at in our 2,200 stores that we've reduced prices on average of 10%, what we have done is a proactive approach to it, not necessarily chasing anybody but, actually, putting price where we believe will best serve our consumer and best be able to capture market share. And as we continue to move forward and expand that, whether it be other markets and/or other items, we'll take that same tack on being proactive and not reactive. Because you're right, if everyone is reactive then, in fact, sometimes, it doesn't end well. Lastly, the great thing about Dollar General is that we have the wherewithal to do this. We have the wherewithal to do it within our P&L and others may or may not have that same luxury. So we see it as a real advantage for Dollar General.

But what I will tell you is that we have headwinds in the second half. We mentioned the charge associated with the 42 newly acquired stores. That will be about $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share impact. We also have the implementation of FLSA, which is about $0.03 to $0.04 impact in Q4. And I think it's important to note there that even though that's only over 2 months, you can't extrapolate that over the course of next year, given that we have a 53rd week in -- at the end of the year as well as many of the actions that help mitigate that cost next year won't be fully implemented until next year. But those 2 will have impacts on the balance of the year. And then again, bear in mind, we're focused on the long term here and making the right decision to be there for our customer when she needs us the most and, with an eye on the long term, are making investments that we talked about earlier in the call. But again, the business fundamentals, I will stress, remain unchanged with -- we're very excited about opening 900 new units this year, on track for 1,000 next year.

And also, our core consumer continues to be under a lot of pressure. I know that when we look at, globally, the overall U.S. population, it's seemingly -- it seems like things are getting better. But when you really start breaking it down and you look at that core consumer that we serve on the lower economic scale that's out there, that demographic, things have not gotten any better for her, and arguably, they're worse. And they're worse because rents are accelerating. Health care is accelerating on her at a very, very rapid clip. And now you couple that in upwards of 20 states where they have reduced or eliminated the SNAP benefit, and it has really put a toll on her. That SNAP benefit reduction and/or elimination happened in April, right? That was the kickoff, and you could see it immediately in the numbers. So I believe that those are the things that are affecting her today, again, our core customer. And by the way, we've seen this play out before. If you dial the clock back to October of '13 and coming into November of 2013 when the last large SNAP benefit reduction happened, it happened almost exactly the same way on our comps and how we saw traffic. Obviously, we were up at a little higher level at that time, but rest assured that our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar as it did now. The difference here is we're going to take aggressive price action to get that consumer back in the store. She needs a little motivation to get back in. We need to help her stretch her budget for a time period until she figures it out. Our core customer's very resilient. They'll figure it out over time, but they need a little help as they tend to now try to figure out how to make ends meet with less money during the month."

So really, we'll control what we can control, monitor the environment and take pricing on an as-needed basis to make sure we're there for our customer when she needs us, and to make sure we're making the right decision for the long-term health of the business.

Once again, we just don't see that competitive nature being the largest factor here. What we see again is that SNAP reduction and that deflation being some of the biggest headwind, and then second -- third after that being just the overall macro environment for our core consumer. When you look at the deflation, it is primarily due to commodity price reductions, so cost reductions to us, which we then pass on to the consumer at lower retails. Predominantly, that's what we're talking about here, and it's in big categories for us, right, in milk and eggs. Remember, we don't have the breadth and depth that mass or grocery has in our perishable and food businesses. So when that deflation hits in some of these key categories, it hits us a little harder, so in those 2. But also beyond that in dry grocery, we still see sugar, grain, cereals, coffee, so some of our largest categories being affected by cost decreases, which then, in turn, become retail decreases. And as we all know, the consumers don't consume that much more just because the price is a little less expensive. So that is really the impetus behind what we see as some of those headwinds.

I'm out a couple of times a month with our head merchant, our head operator, and we see first-hand this consumer each and every time we're out. And this core consumer, I tell you, has gotten no better as far as her economic well-being. As a matter of fact, she tells us, while we're out in the stores or even through all of our panel data that we do, that while things haven't gotten a lot worse as far as income coming in, other than the recent SNAP decrease, I -- my expenditures are going up at a very rapid rate. Health care is one of the big ones because most of our consumers, while she may be working, doesn't have health care, and we all know that she's having to now pay for this health care or be taxed on it, right? So that is starting to really play against that low-end consumer right now, and it will continue to play against her. You couple that with those rents that we talked about, those increased rents are real. And in any many parts of where we serve our customer, the affordability and availability of rental units are getting more and more scarce, which is driving up prices, and we're seeing that because most of our core customers cannot and do not own their own homes. And when we're out in the stores and we drop prices like we do, I can tell you, I've been out in stores in the middle of the aisle, and heard customers come up to our store manager in tears and thanking them for being there and thanking them for the prices that we offer in a real convenient nature for her where we can she can walk to the store because she can afford anything else.

We've always had a history of lean cost management and zero-based budgeting has really taken hold and helped us get to that next level of savings.

For the second quarter, we are pleased with our double-digit earnings per share growth even as our same-store sales performance fell short of our expectations. I'm particularly proud of the team's ability to effectively manage our gross profit margin and leveraging our selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of sales in what proved to be a difficult sales environment. 
Key factors that negatively impacted our expected same-store sales performance included a greater-than-anticipated headwind from price deflation across key perishable items, with retail prices down about 8% for milk and over 50% for eggs, our 2 largest products within perishables; second, a reduction in both SNAP participation rates and benefit levels; third, an unseasonably mild spring; and lastly, an intensified promotional environment in select regions of the country. 
We estimate that the headwinds from price deflation and the reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the second quarter by approximately 60 to 70 basis points. As you will -- as I will discuss in more detail later in the call, we are taking aggressive action across merchandising and store operations to address these factors and help drive same-store sales, and we will continue to be very disciplined in our SG&A spending. I'm pleased with our overall financial performance and the team's ongoing focus on our long-term strategy despite the challenging retail environment. Highlights of the second quarter of 2016 as compared to the prior year's second quarter include: net sales increased 5.8% to $5.4 billion, and same-store sales grew at 0.7%. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by a decline in nonconsumable category. 
Gross margin was 31.2%, an increase of 2 basis points. We leveraged selling, general and administrative expenses by 8 basis points as our zero-based budgeting initiatives continue to contribute to our results. Operating profit increased 7%, with operating profit margin expansion of 10 basis points. Net income in the second quarter increased 9% to $307 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.08. Year-to-date through the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was 18%. Cash from operations increased 36% year-to-date through the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we returned over $294 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.5 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. We continued to grow market share as reported in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced relatively consistent low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods.

Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter",1016,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. As Todd has taken you through the highlights of our second quarter, I'll share more details on the rest of the quarterly financial results starting with gross profit. 
Gross profit for the 2016 second quarter was $1.7 billion or 31.2% of sales, an increase of 2 basis points from last year's second quarter. As compared to the prior year's second quarter, higher additional markups on inventory purchases and lower transportation costs contributed to the gross profit rate increase, offset by higher markdowns, a greater proportion of sales growth in consumables, which carries a lower margin than nonconsumables and higher inventory shrink. SG&A expense decreased by 8 basis points over the 2015 quarter to $1.2 billion or 21.7% of sales in the second quarter. The majority of the SG&A percentage decrease was due to reductions in administrative payroll costs, advertising costs and incentive compensation expenses. Partially offsetting these items were our retail, labor and occupancy costs, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales.  Similar to last quarter, our zero-based budgeting initiatives were a key driver of our SG&A performance. The team continues to actively work on a pipeline of additional future savings opportunities across the company, leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove costs that don't affect the customer experience.
Moving down the income statement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.8% as compared to 38% in the second quarter last year. As in the first quarter, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by Congress in December 2015. 
Looking at a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Merchandise inventories at second quarter end were $3.27 billion. For the quarter, total inventory was up 8% and 1.6% on a per-store basis. We believe our inventory is in great shape, and we are comfortable with the quality. Our longer-term goal continues to be inventory growth, in line with our sales growth. Year-to-date through the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $793 million, an increase of 36% or $208 million compared to the 2015 second quarter as a result of both higher net income and working capital improvements. 
During the quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of our common stock for $224 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding, totaling $71 million. Year-to-date through the end of the second quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $597 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividends.
From December 2011 through the second quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4 billion or 67.3 million shares of our common stock. With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization of $1 billion, we currently have a remaining authorization of approximately $1.4 billion under the repurchase program. We are pleased to note that, during the second quarter, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to Baa2. In mid-August, we implemented a commercial paper program with the goal to reduce our short-term borrowing rate as commercial paper rates are typically lower than rates under a revolver facility. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. 
Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store growth, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
Looking ahead, items to keep in mind that will impact our results during the second half of the year include the purchase of 42 former Walmart Express locations, the implementation of the Department of Labor changes to the overtime exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the calendar shifts between the third and fourth quarters of this year. As we look to relocate 40 Dollar General locations into these purchase sites, we anticipate taking a charge in the 2016 third quarter of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share, primarily related to closed store lease obligations.
For the FLSA implementation, we continue to prepare for the changes, which are effective December 1 of this year, by gaining experience with various test-and-learn scenarios. We anticipate the incremental expense will be about $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter this year. 
Please keep in mind this is a higher run rate in fiscal 2016 than we would expect next year due to the 53rd week in the fourth quarter this year and because certain initiatives intended to offset the incremental impact will not be in place until next year. Due to the calendar shifts, year-over-year, between the third and fourth quarter, our third quarter 2016 will be negatively impacted by the shift of 2 selling days, prior to Halloween, along with the timing of a key payday into the fourth quarter 2016 as compared to being included in the third quarter of last year. 
Turning to our outlook. Recall that we stated that we intend to update our diluted EPS guidance for fiscal 2016 only if we no longer reasonably expect diluted EPS to fall within the 10% to 15% range, outlined in the model included in our press release issued on March 10, 2016. We continue to forecast diluted EPS for fiscal 2016 within this range of 10% to 15%. 
Please keep in mind that the investments we are making across merchandising and store operations will take time to gain traction with our consumers. We remain committed to focusing on the long-term profitable growth, reinvesting in our business and capturing cost savings through our zero-based budgeting program. We are investing in initiatives intended to drive same-store sales and build loyalty across our consumer base, with prices that they trust from us. 
With that, I will turn the call back over to Todd."

We have a track record of strong financial results and the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time for our initiatives to resonate with our consumer.

We have a track record of strong financial results and the team is taking steps designed to improve our sales performance, but it will take time for our initiatives to resonate with our consumer. As we have said consistently, we are committed to increasing market share by growing both item units and traffic, and we will invest, as we deem appropriate, to meet this objective. To that end, we are making aggressive pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas that we see as opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share, all while providing our consumers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our focus is on the consumable categories to drive traffic and units. 
For example, we have taken retail price reductions on average of 10% on about 450 of our best-selling SKUs across 2,200 stores, representing nearly 17% of our store base. We believe that these price reductions are meaningful and recognizable to our consumers. We are committed to further price moves, as appropriate, over time. We are being strategic as we look to proactively address our pricing actions across our store base. These targeted price investments are in high household penetration, fast-turning categories. At the same time, we are investing and communicating these price breaks to our consumers through incremental store signage, ad circulars, digital coupons, e-mail and digital media. 
While it is still very early in making these investments, the results are on track with where we would like for the performance to be on increasing units and traffic. We will continue to monitor our pricing actions and assess the opportunity for ongoing preemptive moves to enhance our competitive positioning. We anticipate refreshing these price investments across items and categories, as well as incremental markets, as needed, as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture additional market share. 
As for our core consumer, we operate with the reality that it is always challenging for her to stretch her budget, given the pressures on her income and spending. We have seen an ongoing contraction in core consumer all-outlet retail spending, as reflected in the Nielsen panel data. Given that our core consumer skews toward a lower income household, I believe the cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as a reduction in SNAP participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses are taking a noticeable toll on her spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. We will do everything we can to provide them with the value and convenience they expect from Dollar General. We remain committed to our long-term operating priorities: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. Our first priority is to continue to drive profitable sales growth. Over the long term, we believe our pricing, labor and marketing investments will pay off in trips and units through increased customer loyalty. As we work through our category management process for 2016, we assessed the expansion of product groups that were most likely to drive traffic in our stores. 
Through the first half of 2016, we have made great progress on expanding space allocation for perishables, health and beauty care, and party and stationery. These 2016 sales-driving initiatives are being implemented across not just new stores, relocations and remodels but also in our mature store base to a greater degree than in the last several years. Implementation of these initiatives will be completed in the third quarter. 
Year-to-date through the second quarter, we have added nearly 21,000 cooler doors to our mature stores to allow for an expanded offering of cold beer, more immediate consumption items and greater product selection. Additionally, more than 7,000 existing stores have seen planogram expansions across health and beauty care, party and/or stationery, with many of these stores receiving expansions in each of these product areas. This initiative was completed in the second quarter of this year.
Our ongoing affordability initiative is front and center with an expanded $1 offering, including a greater selection of national brands. Increased penetration of national brands at the $1 price point gives us the opportunity to increase trial with our consumers, which leads to brand acceptance. Acceptance drives loyalty, which tends to encourage trade-up in package size and brands over time. Currently, nearly 49% of our baskets contain a $1 item. 
In our new DG16 format, these baskets are nearly $3 higher than our average basket, indicating these are incremental purchases. Our private brand portfolio plays a key role in driving profitable sales growth as these items contribute to sales and enhance gross margins.
Our consumers rely on the quality, value and affordability of our private brands. Our private brands offer exceptional value to our core consumers and they offer lower opening price points, which is especially important to our consumers. We continue to have private brand opportunity as our customer penetration is below the average in the mass merchant and grocery segments. We are actively engaging our store associates as private brand ambassadors. In addition, we will continue to communicate with our consumers the unparalleled value our private brands offer. In the first quarter, we launched a new private line named Heartland Harvest, to expand our better-for-you offerings, which really resonate with our millennials. By next month, we anticipate offering over 15 new SKUs under this better-for-you brand. 
This year, we have also expanded our private brand offerings in health and beauty care. In select Dollar General Plus locations, we initiated a test of limited assortments of the industry's best-selling fresh fruits and vegetables as we look to gain more experience with these products and capitalize on our consumers' continued desire for fresh options. So far, we are pleased with the early results. 
Our Fast Way to Save digital coupon offering continues to gain traction since we first brought this innovation to the channel in September of 2014. We are on track to more than double enrollment in the program by the end of this fiscal year, allowing for greater shopper analytics and targeting of coupons. The program provides consumers exclusive savings available only as DG Digital Coupons. The compelling offerings, which include national brands, private brands and instant savings, are helping to drive enrollment. Importantly, we are seeing a higher average basket when the DG digital coupons are utilized. The store operations team is aggressively improving our on-shelf availability. Across the board, we are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate that our stores have reduced their core out-of-stocks by more than 20%. 
Throughout the chain, our consumers are taking note of our improved in-stock position with recent customer satisfaction scores for our in-stock position at the highest level in 2 years based on comparable quarters. In addition, we continue to optimize our labor investments in our more competitive markets and are pleased with the comp sales performance, operating profit gains and customer satisfaction scores. 
Second, we're focused on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. Our real estate program is the foundation of our growth for -- with a proven high-return, low-risk model. As we previously announced, we are on track to accelerate our square footage growth in 2016 to about 7% with 900 new stores and increase this growth to 7.5% in 2017 with about 1,000 new stores. We continue to be very pleased with the strong results that we have gained through this program. Our new store productivity remains in the range of 80% to 85% of our comp store base, all while driving returns of 20% plus.
Our new DG16 store layout is being used for all new stores, relocations and remodels. Through the second quarter, the team has already completed nearly 1,100 real estate projects in this new layout. The layout is designed to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format with faster checkout. We believe this layout can drive both existing and new consumer trips to Dollar General as we place an even greater emphasis in the store on value, affordability and convenience.
The early results of this DG16 layout are encouraging. For instance, we are seeing stronger perishable sales and a double-digit lift in our new front-end items. Overall, sales performance in stores using the DG16 layout is exceeding our expectations. Even more importantly, our customers are telling us they like it as our customer satisfaction scores are significantly higher for the DG16 layout. 
In addition, we are utilizing a smaller footprint store that allows us to capture growth opportunities in more densely populated metropolitan areas. To date, we are currently operating more than 80 of these new stores, with selling space of less than 6,000 square feet, about 20% smaller than our traditional store. Based on the early results, sales productivity and returns of the small-format stores are very encouraging. This store footprint incorporates all of our strategic initiatives, but with edited assortments. By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our metro market consumers, we believe this smaller, more flexible format store will allow us to have a higher capture rate for site selection.
We anticipate that this smaller format will work in rural locations with a lower household count as well. With this format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower-household rural sites. In total, we anticipate we will have approximately 120 of the smaller format stores, including remodels, open as we exit the 2016 fiscal year.
In July, we announced the purchase of former Walmart Express locations that we intend to have operating as Dollar General stores by the end of October. 40 of the 42 sites will be considered relocations of existing stores. Each of these locations will have fresh meat and produce, and 38 will have fueling stations. The team is moving very fast to get these locations up and running to better serve these communities with the everyday low prices and convenience our customers count on from us. 
We have an active remodel and relocation program designed to keep our brands relevant as we utilize our most current store layout and in-store communication of value to drive same-store sales and returns. About 900 locations are expected to be relocated or remodeled in fiscal 2016 with a similar level of product -- projects slated for fiscal 2017.  We anticipate expanding our footprint in 2017 into North Dakota, representing our 44th state of operations. We are very optimistic about our new store outlook for 2017, as our 1,000 store pipeline is already over 80% complete. We remain disciplined and focused as our new store program continues to drive compelling returns with a low cost to build and a low cost to operate.
Third, we will leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. As evidenced by our second quarter performance, our zero-based budgeting process is working as we successfully leveraged our SG&A expenses on same-store sales growth significantly below our 2.5% to 3% SG&A leverage target. Our underlying principles are to keep the business simple but move quickly to capture opportunities, control expenses and always be a low-cost operator.
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. Our strategy is focused on talent selection, store manager development through great onboarding and training and open communication. We continue to make improvements in our store manager turnover and are on track to have our best retention rate in several years. 
To build on these improvements going forward, we have been focused on aligning our talent with the skill set required for success based on store characteristics to -- in addition to revamping our store manager training. We believe that continued improvements in store manager turnover will take time, but the payoff is there through higher sales, lower shrink and improved store associate retention. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are clearly focused on providing our customers with value and convenience in the current environment as our customers need us more than ever to help stretch her household spending.
Earlier this month, we had over 1,000 field leaders together in Nashville to discuss our plans for the future. As I engaged with the team, it was clear to me they are energized and excited about our plans. We are acting with a sense of urgency across merchandising, store operations and supply chain. Our long-term commitment to growth in shareholder value is unchanged. I believe we are well positioned for the future and are focused on capturing the long-term opportunities ahead of us. 
Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in new store growth, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and a competitive dividend. To the more than 119,000 Dollar General employees across our 13,000 store locations, distribution centers and store support center that fulfill our mission of serving others by providing our consumers with convenience, value and service every day, please accept my thanks and appreciation for all that you do as we gear up for the holiday selling season. 
With that, Mary Winn, we'd now like to turn the call open for questions."

But what I will tell you is that we have headwinds in the second half. We mentioned the charge associated with the 42 newly acquired stores. That will be about $0.02 to $0.03 earnings per share impact. We also have the implementation of FLSA, which is about $0.03 to $0.04 impact in Q4. And I think it's important to note there that even though that's only over 2 months, you can't extrapolate that over the course of next year, given that we have a 53rd week in -- at the end of the year as well as many of the actions that help mitigate that cost next year won't be fully implemented until next year. But those 2 will have impacts on the balance of the year.

Deflation, as well as SNAP, that 60 to 70 basis points -- the headwind that is not going to go away. Now trying to counter that obviously will be our price investments. Now as you know, though, price investments take time to resonate with the consumer. And while we're very, very confident that it will drive units and traffic, it'll take a little time for that initiative to take hold. So we're doing everything possible here to ensure that we're giving the consumer the deal that she needs, so that we can continue to have her come into our store and for us to continue to capture market share."

And also, our core consumer continues to be under a lot of pressure. I know that when we look at, globally, the overall U.S. population, it's seemingly -- it seems like things are getting better. But when you really start breaking it down and you look at that core consumer that we serve on the lower economic scale that's out there, that demographic, things have not gotten any better for her, and arguably, they're worse. And they're worse because rents are accelerating. Health care is accelerating on her at a very, very rapid clip. And now you couple that in upwards of 20 states where they have reduced or eliminated the SNAP benefit, and it has really put a toll on her. That SNAP benefit reduction and/or elimination happened in April, right? That was the kickoff, and you could see it immediately in the numbers. So I believe that those are the things that are affecting her today, again, our core customer. And by the way, we've seen this play out before. If you dial the clock back to October of '13 and coming into November of 2013 when the last large SNAP benefit reduction happened, it happened almost exactly the same way on our comps and how we saw traffic. Obviously, we were up at a little higher level at that time, but rest assured that our traffic slowed tremendously then, very similar as it did now. The difference here is we're going to take aggressive price action to get that consumer back in the store. She needs a little motivation to get back in. We need to help her stretch her budget for a time period until she figures it out. Our core customer's very resilient. They'll figure it out over time, but they need a little help as they tend to now try to figure out how to make ends meet with less money during the month."

When you look at the deflation, it is primarily due to commodity price reductions, so cost reductions to us, which we then pass on to the consumer at lower retails. Predominantly, that's what we're talking about here, and it's in big categories for us, right, in milk and eggs. Remember, we don't have the breadth and depth that mass or grocery has in our perishable and food businesses. So when that deflation hits in some of these key categories, it hits us a little harder, so in those 2. But also beyond that in dry grocery, we still see sugar, grain, cereals, coffee, so some of our largest categories being affected by cost decreases, which then, in turn, become retail decreases. And as we all know, the consumers don't consume that much more just because the price is a little less expensive. So that is really the impetus behind what we see as some of those headwinds.

This team has done a phenomenal job over the years managing the multiple levers within gross margin and you've seen that with 6 straight quarters of margin expansion. And it continues to be the same levers in terms of shrink, which we continue to see as an improvement opportunity over time. We continue to drive expense control and efficiencies around DC and trans, and the team continues to effectively manage the levers of category management, private label and foreign sourcing, and we also work with our vendors to make sure that we can hit those price points. On the SG&A side, as you saw, we had tremendous performance over the last 2 periods with zero-based budgeting. We've always had a history of lean cost management and zero-based budgeting has really taken hold and helped us get to that next level of savings. And you've see that in the results, and the team is working on a pipeline of future savings focused on noncustomer-facing areas, and the rigor is really becoming ingrained. So we will continue to work those 2 over time. As we've said, not every quarter is created the same and there's some headwinds in the near term. But we continue to see opportunity over the longer term, managing all these levers, as we have in the past."

On today's call, I would first like to share our perspectives on the third quarter and review some of its highlights, then turn it over to John to take you through a more detailed review of the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year. I will then provide insights into our strategic action plans going forward. 
Since we last spoke in our earnings call at the end of August, the retail environment has continued to be challenging, although we are pleased to see some of our traffic and sales-driving actions beginning to take hold as we exited the third quarter. As I shared with you last quarter, we have taken a number of actions across merchandising and store operations to drive same-store sales, all while being very disciplined in our SG&A spending. Although our sales and earnings fell short of our expectation, I believe we made progress on our initiatives in the quarter. Together, the team has spent a tremendous amount of time and resources on the analytics of our business and the targeted actions going forward. 
As the deflation cycle continued in the quarter, we have reevaluated how we're looking at the impact, ultimately taking a more broad-based view. Rather than limiting our view to commodity cost of milk and eggs, we expanded our analysis to the average unit retail price deflation. Applying this broader view of deflation to both our second and third quarters, we experienced a greater impact in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. We estimate that the combined headwinds from the average unit retail price deflation and reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the third quarter by approximately 150 to 175 basis points and for our second quarter by approximately 100 to 115 basis points. We believe many of these issues are transitory in nature. 
Now let's turn to some of the highlights for the third quarter of 2016 as we compare it to the prior year quarter. Third quarter sales increased 5% to $5.3 billion. Year-to-date through the third quarter, net sales were $16 billion, an increase of 5.9%, over the comparable prior year period. Same-store sales declined 0.1% for the quarter as an increase in average transaction size was offset by softer customer traffic. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in the nonconsumable categories.  
In terms of the sales cadence for the quarter, August and October were both positive with October being the strongest period of the quarter. Year-to-date through the third quarter, same-store sales increased 0.9% over the comparable prior year period. 
For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.84, including approximately $0.05 for store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses. During the quarter, we returned $295 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.9 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. 
We successfully converted 42 Walmart Express locations to the Dollar General banner. These locations are performing well ahead of our expectation and provide us with great insights to apply to our existing store formats and future opportunities. 
The store operation team continues to aggressively work towards improving our on-shelf availability. We are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate, that our stores have reduced their out of stocks on core items by 13% over prior year third quarter. 
Our real estate model is the foundation of driving strong returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 80% to 85% of our comp base, all while driving returns over 20%. For 2016, we're on track to open 900 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 900 stores. The real estate and store operations team have done a tremendous job in executing our store growth plans. 
We continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced low single digit to mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. I'm especially encouraged that we experienced a notable share change trend improvement in the most recent 8-week data. 
During the third quarter, we invested gross margin dollars in a number of strategies designed to drive traffic. Some of these initiatives performed better than others, but I believe we learned important lessons that will guide us in being more effective with the spending going forward. Based on the recent work we've done to analyze the business and to test various initiatives, we believe that we have identified those actions and strategies that provide the best opportunity to drive traffic and ultimately, profitable sales growth. We are moving fast to aggressively pursue the actions that we believe will drive our same-store sales performance improvements. 
During the quarter, we made pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas where we saw opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share with the objective to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our proactive pricing actions were implemented selectively across about 17% of our store base or on about [indiscernible] about 450 [ph] items targeting high household penetration, fast turning categories. While these investments take time to deliver the full impact, we are seeing the expected improvement in transactions, unit and weekly same-store sales across the vast majority of stores where we have made these investments. We believe we are on the right track with the selective price investments which are noticeable to our consumers. 
As I mentioned, while some of the third quarter investments resulted in the desired performance, others did not. For instance, we invested in incremental promotional activities that drive traffic, although results were mixed and did not meet our overall expectations. As such, this is an area we look to be more effective in deploying gross profit dollars going forward. 
Additionally, as we move through the quarter, it became apparent 2 [ph] our incremental actions would not be able to overcome the decline in traffic in our stores. Both traffic-driving consumables and basket-building nonconsumables were impacted, requiring greater-than-anticipated markdowns to move through the inventory and keep our merchandise in the stores fresh. Based on our learnings, we have focused our efforts on the most efficient and impactful activities, and we will continue to monitor these traffic-driving initiatives and continue to optimize these investments to achieve the best returns. I have confidence in this retail management team that has successfully navigated other challenging sales environment. We remain committed to controlling the factors that we can control and seizing the opportunities we have identified to improve our performance. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to John."
266974,408513674,1095423,"Dollar General Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2016",2016-12-01,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales,",875,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. 
Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales, a decrease of 49 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year third quarter, the most significant drivers were higher markdown, primarily for inventory clearance and promotion; greater proportion of sales of lower-margin consumables; and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory markups. 
SG&A expense in the quarter increased by 48 basis points over the comparable 2015 period to $1.2 billion or 22.5% of sales. The SG&A increase was due in part to increased retail labor and occupancy cost. In addition, we incurred charges and related expenses of $13 million or 25 basis points associated with the acquisition of the former Walmart Express store location. These expenses were primarily related to lease termination cost for existing stores and costs related to the conversion of acquired stores to DG stores. We also incurred an increase of $7.7 million or 14 basis points of disaster-related expenses in the 2016 period, most of which were hurricane related. Partially offsetting these items were reductions in administrative payroll cost, incentive compensation expenses and advertising cost. For comparability, please keep in mind that 2015 third quarter SG&A results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points for severance-related benefit costs associated with the corporate restructuring of certain support function. In light of our same-store sales performance for the quarter, I am pleased with the way the team managed our SG&A expense. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we would have successfully leverage the SG&A expenses on our same-store sales performance of 0.9% had it not been for the store relocation cost and disaster-related expenses mentioned earlier. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.2%. As in the first half of the year, our effective tax rate was lowered this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by Congress in December 2015. 
Moving out our balance sheet and cash flow statement. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.49 billion, up 5.6% on a per-store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with our sales performance with the actions we have in place designed to help inventory growth in line with our sales growth. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape and we are comfortable with the quality, and the increase was mainly in our everyday [indiscernible] categories or what we think of as core items. 
Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated cash from operations of $1.12 billion, an increase of 39% or $315 million compared to the 2015 third quarter, primarily as a result of working capital improvements and higher net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $225 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding totaling $70 [ph] million. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $892 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend. From December 2011 to the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4.3 billion of 70.2 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the third quarter, our remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1.2 billion. We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store base, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. 
Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to leverage ratio of approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Looking ahead, we are realistic about the environment in which we are operating. We now expect that our fiscal 2016 diluted EPS growth will be at the low end of our long-term growth mile range of 10% to 15%. This outlook includes the impact of the charge for the store relocation cost and disaster-related expenses in the third quarter and the benefit from the 53rd week this year of approximately $0.09 per diluted share. 
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Fair Labor Standard Act new salary requirement, it does not include any incremental expense related to the potential implementation of that regulation. In the event that the new salary requirement under the Fair Labor Standards Act is implemented, we anticipate that this would be an incremental annualized expense of approximately $60 million to $70 million or $0.03 for the 2016 fourth quarter. Please keep in mind that we had an incremental $0.04 per diluted share benefit from the reenactment of the Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit in Q4 2015. We anticipate providing further details on our 2017 initiatives when we release our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results in March 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd."

Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 [ph] operating priorities for growth: First, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our positi",1347,"Thank you, John. Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 [ph] operating priorities for growth: First, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. 
Our first priority is to drive profitable sales growth. Our goal is to attract and grow new consumers and trips and capture share with existing customers, utilizing our customer segmentation work and our disciplined approach to category management. To enhance our value proposition, we are committed to providing our customers with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us. Clearly, our consumer budgets are pinched. The cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors such as the reduction of staff participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses appear to have taken a noticeable toll on their spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. 
We remain committed to refreshing our price investments across items and categories as well as incremental markets. Our changes would be made as needed in a very rational manner as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture market share. To further enhance our value proposition, we are also focused on refining our advertising effectiveness to drive productive sales growth with a continued focus on everyday low prices that resonate with our customers. For 2017, we plan to further integrate our traditional and digital media mix to work together to ensure we are reaching our target consumers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. Through applied predictive technology, we are conducting a test to learn to gain further insights into our ability to achieve a higher return on investment on our advertising media mix. 
A key area of focus for 2017 is to build on our 2016 progress to expand the merchandising initiatives that focus on our mature store base to drive our same-store sales. For a select group of these stores, we anticipate a more extensive 4-wall remodeling effort that we believe will provide compelling returns. The recent acquisition of the former Walmart Express stores gives us great insights as we develop the remodel program for these stores. Merchandising initiatives across all departments have been deployed to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day across this group of stores. 
Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. In 2017, we plan to accelerate our square footage growth to about 7.5%. Our 2017 pipeline is essentially complete as we continue to plan for about 1,000 new store openings. The primary format will be our traditional Digi box, which is about 7,300 square feet of selling space and provides us with strong new store economics and returns. This format consistently proves to be our highest return format against which we benchmark the performance of all other formats. We expect that these traditional stores will utilize our successful Dollar General sixteen [ph] layout to expand high growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format, all while providing consumers with a faster checkout. We are planning for the future as we segment our store opportunities that we believe can have a greater impact on sales and productivity, all while continuing to drive compelling returns. We view this as more of an evolution of our existing, highly productive, traditional store format rather than a wholesale change. We are in a unique position to leverage knowledge across our multiple formats, given that Dollar General has always been a leader in store format innovation. I view our store formats along a continuum of selling square footage. On one end, we apply lessons from the best-selling items in our 16,000-square-foot Dollar General market stores to our newly acquired 10,000 square-foot box. Both of these formats give us great experience with fresh produce and meats. From there, we move along the continuum to the 9,000-square-foot Dollar General Plus with about 30-or-so corridors and more holding power on the shelf. Next, we tailor our assortments to our 7,300-square-foot traditional box. With over 12,500 traditional stores, this box will always be core to our model. Finally, we have been pleased with the test results of our smaller box that is less than 6,000 square feet for certain metro and rural locations. Across the formats, we constantly are editing the assortments and taking our best-selling items from 1 format to the next to satisfy our customers' changing needs while driving -- while continuing to drive productivity. 
Key consumer trends going forward that are becoming more important to our core consumers include healthier, better-for-you options and a greater fresh assortment. Our range of formats positions us well to seek opportunities to capture this growing customer sentiment. Given that we are still in the planning process, I look forward to sharing more with you over the coming months. 
To support our new store growth and productivity, we continue to make investments in our distribution center network. Our Janesville, Wisconsin distribution center is nearing completion with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in early 2017. Our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia, is also under construction, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in late 2017. 
Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. The team has embraced the spirit and process of zero-based budgeting that we implemented last year as part of the 2016 budget. We have had great success in leveraging our culture and heritage of cost management with our zero-based budgeting program across our cost structure. As we enter year 2 of our zero-based budgeting process, the team is actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings, opportunities across the company leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove cost that don't affect the customer experience. 
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are our competitive advantage. In the third quarter, we redesigned our store manager training program. And while it's still early, we are seeing almost a 20% improvement in satisfaction scores from those store managers who have gone through the program. 
We have exciting opportunities ahead of us. Our test and learn program is a foundation of our continued improvement. We believe our positioning Dollar General to be even more relevant to help our customers save time and money now and in the future. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects of the company and are moving quickly and deliberately to restore traffic to our stores. Our stores are prepared for the holidays, and we have a strong plan in place for the remainder of the holiday selling season with exciting gifts, decor, toys and other holiday accessories and multiple avenues to save in-store and online. Our customers can take advantage of our holiday offerings and stretch their holiday budget even further. 
Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. We have strong new store economics with returns above 20% and a payback under 2 years. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth as well as our mature store base, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends. We remain very excited about our business over time. 
In closing, I want to recognize more than -- the more than 120,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers every day. We are in the midst of our busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and everyday low prices. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions to our mission of serving others. 
With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

So again, around perishables in the food area and immediate consumption. So while we're facing great headwinds on deflation there, what we're starting to see is that those initiatives are overtaking even some of those deflationary pressures. But make no mistake, those headwinds are pretty strong, and that's why we said we feel pretty good about where we're headed because the initiatives are really taking hold in those categories. And as we look at this pretty transitory and as those deflationary pressures hopefully start to ease mid next year, when we pop out of the other side, we should be in very good shape because of the initiatives that we deployed to include some of the traffic-driving initiatives around our pricing that we've recently implemented are in a lot of those consumable, high discretionary categories that are out there for the consumer. So I think, all in all, we made the right decision. And as we come out of this, we should be in a much better shape."

The way we see it now, this is something we watch very closely, monitor the sales performance and the returns. And we continue, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we continue to see the stores open as expected at the 80% to 85% sales productivity. We continue to see the returns above 20% of our target. We continue to see paybacks of less than 2 years. And given the low-risk, low cost, high-return opportunity we see here, we are proceeding, but watching it very carefully and understand that this is something that we could dial back quickly if needed. But based on the great results we continue to see and the belief that the pressures on the comps are largely transitory in nature, we don't see the need to do that thus far part, but we'll closely manage that. And in terms of your second question around zero-based budgeting, our ability to dial back that even more, we're very pleased with the performance that we've seen with zero-based budgeting. When you consider in the difficult environment we've been operating, the team has done a phenomenal job managing costs, looking at everything through the lens of does it touch the customer, is it in line with our strategic priorities, does not doing this put the business at risk. And so what we have are going to continue to go after all the cost we can continually but thoughtfully and making sure that over time, we're -- as we manage the business for the long term, investing in those initiative that will drive long-term growth. But rest assured, the team is hard at work on zero-based budgeting. It's performing better than expected this year. When you consider it, if you exclude the impact of the relocations of the acquired stores and related cost, we would be leveraging our SG&A at 0.9% versus the stated target beginning in the year where we lowered it from 3.5% to -- and creeping up toward 4% to 2.5% to 3%.

And I can tell you, as late as mid-third quarter, they were telling us that their sentiment, feeling is even more dire than it was in previous quarters in early 2016. And what they're citing and continue to cite is the rising health care cost that they're facing. I don't believe any of our core customers realize what they were up against on those rising costs. And then rental cost continue and they'd call that out second on paying rent because most of our, again, core customers rent, don't own, and those rents are going up across the nation at a pretty high rate. And they have to continue to allocate their spending. So anywhere they are saving, they are doing some things a little differently than they've done before. For instance, they're investing in smartphone technology at a greater rate than we've ever seen. And those expense, as we all know, a monthly expense. And so a little bit of money that she does may have from maybe lower gas prices and some other tailwinds, she is moving into a little bit of a technology world herself very slowly, albeit, but she is moving there. So we're hearing a lot of the same things we've heard over the last couple quarters, but what was interesting to us was that she was feeling more soft today, middle of the third quarter, than she was earlier in the year."

And we've always said that the consumable initiatives and the consumable products will drive traffic in our nonconsumable businesses will drive the basket. We see that no differently. And actually, we've seen our nonconsumable business tail off along with our consumable business as that customer pulled back and especially in this SNAP affected states. In saying that, a lot of our initiatives for this year and next year are both in consumables and nonconsumables because we believe that you have to have a fine balance between the 2 to really round out the shopping experience for the consumer. And so we're looking at it really no differently. Now in consumables, there may be some differences in some of the products that we bring in because, again, our consumers are starting to look for better-for-you, healthy, a little bit more fresh products. And the great thing about having the market stores, 150 or 160 [ph] market stores that we have as well as our Plus stores, we are able to infuse the best learnings and products into our traditional store from those formats. So there isn't any test and learn periods. We know what works and we continue to bring those type of products to market in our 7,300-square-foot store. And you'll see even more of that maybe on the low accelerated rate as we move into 2017 because, again, our consumer preferences are changing."

But in saying that, we're still seeing we affectionately call our BFF, which is our core best customers, continue to really resonate with our everyday low price. And through Q2 to Q3, with all of the traffic-driving initiatives we did, what's really stuck and resonated the most was everyday low price. And that really goes to show you that the segmentation work that we do is right on in key, and that is our best customers look to us to deliver everyday low price first because she needs to count on us each and every day. But beyond that, we're still seeing a healthy customer base outside of our core. Some of our reached customers, we're still seeing trade inventory down type customers coming in, and we're still seeing a decent millennial type customer that really just started to emerge. And that's some of the reasons we're looking at even more better-for-you and healthier as well as maybe some fresh options as we go forward because that consumer is really starting to emerge as a real player with Dollar General."

On today's call, I would first like to share our perspectives on the third quarter and review some of its highlights, then turn it over to John to take you through a more detailed review of the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year. I will then provide insights into our strategic action plans going forward. 
Since we last spoke in our earnings call at the end of August, the retail environment has continued to be challenging, although we are pleased to see some of our traffic and sales-driving actions beginning to take hold as we exited the third quarter. As I shared with you last quarter, we have taken a number of actions across merchandising and store operations to drive same-store sales, all while being very disciplined in our SG&A spending. Although our sales and earnings fell short of our expectation, I believe we made progress on our initiatives in the quarter. Together, the team has spent a tremendous amount of time and resources on the analytics of our business and the targeted actions going forward. 
As the deflation cycle continued in the quarter, we have reevaluated how we're looking at the impact, ultimately taking a more broad-based view. Rather than limiting our view to commodity cost of milk and eggs, we expanded our analysis to the average unit retail price deflation. Applying this broader view of deflation to both our second and third quarters, we experienced a greater impact in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. We estimate that the combined headwinds from the average unit retail price deflation and reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the third quarter by approximately 150 to 175 basis points and for our second quarter by approximately 100 to 115 basis points. We believe many of these issues are transitory in nature. 
Now let's turn to some of the highlights for the third quarter of 2016 as we compare it to the prior year quarter. Third quarter sales increased 5% to $5.3 billion. Year-to-date through the third quarter, net sales were $16 billion, an increase of 5.9%, over the comparable prior year period. Same-store sales declined 0.1% for the quarter as an increase in average transaction size was offset by softer customer traffic. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in the nonconsumable categories. 
In terms of the sales cadence for the quarter, August and October were both positive with October being the strongest period of the quarter. Year-to-date through the third quarter, same-store sales increased 0.9% over the comparable prior year period. 
For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.84, including approximately $0.05 for store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses. During the quarter, we returned $295 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.9 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. 
We successfully converted 42 Walmart Express locations to the Dollar General banner. These locations are performing well ahead of our expectation and provide us with great insights to apply to our existing store formats and future opportunities. 
The store operation team continues to aggressively work towards improving our on-shelf availability. We are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate, that our stores have reduced their out of stocks on core items by 13% over prior year third quarter. 
Our real estate model is the foundation of driving strong returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 80% to 85% of our comp base, all while driving returns over 20%. For 2016, we're on track to open 900 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 900 stores. The real estate and store operations team have done a tremendous job in executing our store growth plans. 
We continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced low single digit to mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. I'm especially encouraged that we experienced a notable share change trend improvement in the most recent 8-week data. 
During the third quarter, we invested gross margin dollars in a number of strategies designed to drive traffic. Some of these initiatives performed better than others, but I believe we learned important lessons that will guide us in being more effective with the spending going forward. Based on the recent work we've done to analyze the business and to test various initiatives, we believe that we have identified those actions and strategies that provide the best opportunity to drive traffic and ultimately, profitable sales growth. We are moving fast to aggressively pursue the actions that we believe will drive our same-store sales performance improvements. 
During the quarter, we made pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas where we saw opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share with the objective to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our proactive pricing actions were implemented selectively across about 70% of our store base or on about -- and on about 450 items targeting high-household-penetration, fast-turning categories. While these investments take time to deliver the full impact, we are seeing the expected improvements in transactions, units and weekly same-store sales across the vast majority of stores where we have made these investments. We believe we are on the right track with these selective price investments, which are noticeable to our consumers. 
As I mentioned, while some of the third quarter investments resulted in the desired performance, others did not. For instance, we invested in incremental promotional activities to drive traffic, although results were mixed and did not meet our overall expectations. As such, this is an area we look to be more effective in deploying gross profit dollars going forward. 
Additionally, as we move through the quarter, it became apparent to our -- incremental actions would not be able to overcome the decline in traffic in our stores. Both traffic-driving consumables and basket-building nonconsumables were impacted, requiring greater-than-anticipated markdowns to move through the inventory and keep our merchandise in the stores fresh. Based on our learnings, we have focused our efforts on the most efficient and impactful activities, and we will continue to monitor these traffic-driving initiatives and continue to optimize these investments to achieve the best returns. I have confidence in this retail management team that has successfully navigated other challenging sales environments. We remain committed to controlling the factors that we can control and seizing the opportunities we have identified to improve our performance. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to John."

For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales,",876,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. 
Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales, a decrease of 49 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year third quarter, the most significant drivers were higher markdown, primarily for inventory clearance and promotions; a greater proportion of sales of lower-margin consumables; and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory markups. 
SG&A expense in the quarter increased by 48 basis points over the comparable 2015 period to $1.2 billion or 22.5% of sales. The SG&A increase was due in part to increased retail labor and occupancy costs. In addition, we incurred charges and related expenses of $13 million or 25 basis points associated with the acquisition of the former Walmart Express store locations. These expenses were primarily related to lease termination costs for existing stores and costs related to the conversion of acquired stores to DG stores. We also incurred an increase of $7.7 million or 14 basis points of disaster-related expenses in the 2016 period, most of which were hurricane related. Partially offsetting these items were reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation expenses and advertising costs. For comparability, please keep in mind that 2015 third quarter SG&A results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points for severance-related benefit costs associated with the corporate restructuring of certain support functions. In light of our same-store sales performance for the quarter, I am pleased with the way the team managed our SG&A expenses. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we would have successfully leveraged SG&A expenses on our same-store sales performance of 0.9% had it not been for the store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses mentioned earlier. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.2%. As in the first half of the year, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by congress in December 2015. 
Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.49 billion, up 5.6% on a per-store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with our sales performance with the actions we have in place designed to help get inventory growth in line with our sales growth. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape and we are comfortable with the quality. And the increase was mainly in our everyday planogram categories or what we think of as core items. 
Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated cash from operations of $1.12 billion, an increase of 39% or $315 million compared to the 2015 third quarter, primarily as a result of working capital improvements and higher net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $225 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding totaling $70 million. Year-to-date to the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $892 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend. From December 2011 to the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4.3 billion of 70.2 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the third quarter, our remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1.2 billion. 
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store base, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
Looking ahead, we are realistic about the environment in which we are operating. We now expect that our fiscal 2016 diluted EPS growth will be at the low end of our long-term growth model range of 10% to 15%. This outlook includes the impact of the charge for the store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses in the third quarter and the benefit from the 53rd week this year of approximately $0.09 per diluted share. 
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Fair Labor Standard Act's new salary requirement, it does not include any incremental expense related to the potential implementation of that regulation. In the event that the new salary requirement under the Fair Labor Standards Act is implemented, we anticipate that this would be an incremental annualized expense of approximately $60 million to $70 million or $0.03 for the 2016 fourth quarter. Please keep in mind that we had an incremental $0.04 per diluted share benefit from the reenactment of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit in Q4 2015. We anticipate providing further details on our 2017 initiatives when we release our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results in March 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd."

Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 operating priorities for growth: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as",1340,"Thank you, John. Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 operating priorities for growth: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. 
Our first priority is to drive profitable sales growth. Our goal is to attract and grow new consumers and trips and capture share with existing customers, utilizing our customer segmentation work and our disciplined approach to category management. To enhance our value proposition, we are committed to providing our customers with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us. Clearly, our consumers' budgets are pinched. The cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as the reduction of staff participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses, appear to have taken a noticeable toll on their spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. 
We remain committed to refreshing our price investments across items and categories as well as incremental markets. Our changes would be made as needed in a very rational manner as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture market share. 
To further enhance our value proposition, we are also focused on refining our advertising effectiveness to drive productive sales growth with a continued focus on everyday low prices that resonate with our customers. For 2017, we plan to further integrate our traditional and digital media mix to work together to ensure we are reaching our target consumers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. Through applied predictive technology, we are conducting a test and learn to gain further insights into our ability to achieve a higher return on investment on our advertising media mix. 
A key area of focus for 2017 is to build on our 2016 progress to expand the merchandising initiatives that focus on our mature store base to drive our same-store sales. For a select group of these stores, we anticipate a more extensive 4-wall remodeling effort that we believe will provide compelling returns. The recent acquisition of the former Walmart Express stores gives us great insights as we develop the remodel program for these stores. Merchandising initiatives across all departments have been deployed to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day across this group of stores. 
Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. In 2017, we plan to accelerate our square footage growth to about 7.5%. Our 2017 pipeline is essentially complete as we continue to plan for about 1,000 new store openings. The primary format will be our traditional DG box, which is about 7,300 square feet of selling space and provides us with strong new store economics and returns. This format consistently proves to be our highest-return format against which we benchmark the performance of all other formats. We expect that these traditional stores will utilize our successful Dollar General 16 layout to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format, all while providing consumers with a faster checkout. 
We are planning for the future as we segment our store opportunities that we believe can have a greater impact on sales and productivity, all while continuing to drive compelling returns. We view this as more of an evolution of our existing, highly productive, traditional store format rather than a wholesale change. We are in a unique position to leverage knowledge across our multiple formats, given that Dollar General has always been a leader in store format innovation. I view our store formats along a continuum of selling square footage. On one end, we apply lessons from the best-selling items in our 16,000-square-foot Dollar General market stores to our newly acquired 10,000-square-foot box. Both of these formats give us great experience with fresh produce and meats. From there, we move along the continuum to the 9,000-square-foot Dollar General Plus with about 30-or-so cooler doors and more holding power on the shelf. Next, we tailor the assortment to our 7,300-square-foot traditional box. With over 12,500 traditional stores, this box will always be core to our model. 
Finally, we have been pleased with the test results of our smaller box, that is less than 6,000 square feet for certain metro and rural locations. Across the formats, we constantly are editing the assortments and taking our best-selling items from one format to the next to satisfy our customers' changing needs while driving -- while continuing to drive productivity. 
Key consumer trends going forward that are becoming more important to our core consumers include healthier, better-for-you options and a greater fresh assortment. Our range of formats positions us well to seek opportunities to capture this growing customer sentiment. Given that we are still in the planning process, I look forward to sharing more with you over the coming months. 
To support our new store growth and productivity, we continue to make investments in our distribution center network. Our Janesville, Wisconsin distribution center is nearing completion, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in early 2017. Our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia is also under construction, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in late 2017. 
Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. The team has embraced the spirit and process of zero-based budgeting that we implemented last year as part of the 2016 budget. We have had great success in leveraging our culture and heritage of cost management with our zero-based budgeting program across our cost structure. As we enter year 2 of our zero-based budgeting process, the team is actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings, opportunities across the company leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove costs that don't affect the customer experience. 
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. In the third quarter, we redesigned our store manager training program. And while it's still early, we are seeing almost a 20% improvement in satisfaction scores from those store managers who have gone through the program. 
We have exciting opportunities ahead of us. Our test-and-learn program is a foundation of our continual improvement we believe are positioning Dollar General to be even more relevant to help our customers save time and money now and in the future. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects of the company and are moving quickly and deliberately to restore traffic to our stores. 
Our stores are prepared for the holidays, and we have a strong plan in place for the remainder of the holiday selling season with exciting gifts, decor, toys and other holiday necessities and multiple avenues to save in-store and online. Our customers can take advantage of our holiday offerings and stretch their holiday budget even further. 
Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. We have strong new-store economics with returns above 20% and a payback under 2 years. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth as well as our mature store base, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends. We remain very excited about our business over time. 
In closing, I want to recognize more than -- the more than 120,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers every day. We are in the midst of our busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and everyday low prices. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions to our mission of serving others. 
With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

Those continue to gain traction throughout the year and especially in the third quarter and now into the fourth.

So a little choppiness is probably the right way to look at it, but we're very encouraged on how we see our initiatives taking hold and taking shape.

The real thing to look at there is that a lot of our initiatives coming into the year 2016 were around those traffic-driving areas. So again, around perishables in the food areas and immediate consumption. So while we're facing great headwinds on deflation there, what we're starting to see is that those initiatives are overtaking even some of those deflationary pressures. But make no mistake, those headwinds are pretty strong, and that's why we said we feel pretty good about where we're headed because those initiatives are really taking hold in those categories. And as we look at this pretty transitory. And as those deflationary pressures hopefully start to ease mid next year, when we pop out of the other side, we should be in very good shape. Because the initiatives that we deployed to include some of the traffic-driving initiatives around our pricing that we've recently implemented are in a lot of those consumable, high-discretionary categories that are out there for the consumer. So I think, all in all, we made the right decisions. And as we come out of this, we should be in a much better shape."

The way we see it now, this is something we watch very closely, monitor the sales performance and the returns.

We continue to see paybacks in less than 2 years. And given the low-risk, low-cost, high-return opportunity we see here, we're proceeding, but watching it very carefully and understand that this is something that we could dial back quickly if needed. But based on the great results we continue to see and the belief that the pressures on the comps are largely transitory in nature, we don't see a need to do that thus far part, but we'll closely manage that. And in terms of the second question around zero-based budgeting, our ability to dial back that even more, we're very pleased with the performance that we've seen with zero-based budgeting. When you consider in the difficult environment we've been operating, the team's done a phenomenal job managing costs, looking at everything through the lens of, does it touch the customer? Is it in line with our strategic priorities? Does not doing this put the business at risk? And so work that we have, we're going to continue to go after all the cost we can, continually but thoughtfully, and making sure that over time, we're also -- as we manage the business for the long term, investing in those initiatives that will drive long-term growth. But rest assured, the team is hard at work on zero-based budgeting. It's performing better than expected this year. When you consider it, if you exclude the impact of the relocations of the acquired stores and the disaster-related costs, we would be leveraging our SG&A at 0.9% comp versus the stated target at the beginning of the year where we lowered it from 3.5% to -- and creeping up toward 4% to 2.5% to 3%.

And as that happens and we see it performing the way we think it's going to perform, then as we get into next year, I think we'll continue to look at ways to expand that and to be there for our customer to continue to give her that everyday low price that she needs."

The key drivers there were markdown, mix and inventory shrink. Markdowns, being the most significant driver, was the first. And then with both the consumables and nonconsumables, first is we moved through inventory with clearance and markdowns to keep the inventory fresh. The good news here is that the quality of the inventory is in great shape. And then also with the tougher sales environment in Q3, we had additional promotional activity, as we mentioned, with the goal of driving the top line and are pleased with the results we're seeing and the learnings we've captured from that to be more targeted, more focused on targeted pricing and EDLP and optimizing the spend for maximum results going forward. And again, pleased with the momentum we saw coming out of the quarter and into this quarter. So those were the key drivers there. We feel like with the actions we've taken here, that's the best actions for the long term. And I think with the learnings going forward, we'll be able to be more targeted with this and continue to see opportunity over the long term.

And I can tell you, as late as mid-third quarter, they were telling us that their sentiment, feeling is even more dire than it was in previous quarters in early 2016. And what they're citing and continue to cite is the rising health care costs that they're facing. I don't believe any of our core customers realize what they were up against on those rising costs. And then rental costs continue, and they called that out second on paying rent. Because most of our, again, core customers rent, don't own, and those rents are going up across the nation at a pretty high rate. And they have to continue to allocate their spending. So anywhere they are saving, they are doing some things a little differently than they've done before. For instance, they're investing in smartphone technology at a greater rate than we've ever seen. And those come with an expense, as we all know, a monthly expense. And so the little bit of money that she does may have, from maybe lower gas prices and some other tailwinds, she is moving into a little bit of a technology world herself very slowly, albeit, but she is moving there. So we're hearing a lot of the same things we've heard over the last couple quarters, but what was interesting to us was that she was feeling worse off today, middle of the third quarter, than she was earlier in the year."

They do a great job in evaluating each and every year what should be inside of our stores and what those initiatives should be. And we've always said that the consumable initiatives and the consumable products will drive traffic, and our nonconsumable businesses will drive the basket. We see that no differently. And actually, we've seen our nonconsumable business tail off along with our consumable business, as that customer pulled back and especially in the SNAP-affected states. In saying that, a lot of our initiatives for this year and next year are both in consumables and i nnonconsumables. Because we believe that you have to have a fine balance between the 2 to really round out the shopping experience for the consumer. And so we're looking at it really no differently. Now in consumables, there may be some differences in some of the products that we bring in because, again, our consumers are starting to look for better-for-you, more healthy, a little bit more fresh products. And the great thing about having the market stores, 150 or 160 market stores that we have as well as our Plus stores, we're able to infuse the best learnings and products into our traditional store from those formats.

But in saying that, we're still seeing our -- what we affectionately call our BFF, which is our core best customers, continue to really resonate with our everyday low price. And through Q2 to Q3, with all the traffic-driving initiatives we did, what really stuck and resonated the most was everyday low price. And that really goes to show you that the segmentation work that we do is right on in key, and that is our best customers look to us to deliver everyday low price first, because she needs to count on us each and every day. But in -- but beyond that, we're still seeing a healthy customer base outside of our core. Some of our reach customers, we're still seeing trade inventory-down-type customers coming in, and we're still seeing a decent millennial-type customer that really just started to emerge. And that's some of the reasons we're looking at even more better-for-you and healthier as well as maybe some fresh options as we go forward because that consumer is really starting to emerge as a real player at Dollar General."

On today's call, I would first like to share our perspectives on the third quarter and review some of its highlights, then turn it over to John to take you through a more detailed review of the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year. I will then provide insights into our strategic action plans going forward. 
Since we last spoke in our earnings call at the end of August, the retail environment has continued to be challenging, although we are pleased to see some of our traffic and sales-driving actions beginning to take hold as we exited the third quarter. As I shared with you last quarter, we have taken a number of actions across merchandising and store operations to drive same-store sales, all while being very disciplined in our SG&A spending. Although our sales and earnings fell short of our expectation, I believe we made progress on our initiatives in the quarter. Together, the team has spent a tremendous amount of time and resources on the analytics of our business and the targeted actions going forward. 
As the deflation cycle continued in the quarter, we have reevaluated how we're looking at the impact, ultimately taking a more broad-based view. Rather than limiting our view to commodity cost of milk and eggs, we expanded our analysis to the average unit retail price deflation. Applying this broader view of deflation to both our second and third quarters, we experienced a greater impact in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. We estimate that the combined headwinds from the average unit retail price deflation and reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the third quarter by approximately 150 to 175 basis points and for our second quarter by approximately 100 to 115 basis points. We believe many of these issues are transitory in nature. 
Now let's turn to some of the highlights for the third quarter of 2016 as we compare it to the prior year quarter. Third quarter sales increased 5% to $5.3 billion. Year-to-date through the third quarter, net sales were $16 billion, an increase of 5.9%, over the comparable prior year period. Same-store sales declined 0.1% for the quarter as an increase in average transaction size was offset by softer customer traffic. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in the nonconsumable categories 
In terms of the sales cadence for the quarter, August and October were both positive with October being the strongest period of the quarter. Year-to-date through the third quarter, same-store sales increased 0.9% over the comparable prior year period. 
For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.84, including approximately $0.05 for store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses. During the quarter, we returned $295 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.9 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. 
We successfully converted 42 Walmart Express locations to the Dollar General banner. These locations are performing well ahead of our expectation and provide us with great insights to apply to our existing store formats and future opportunities. 
The store operation team continues to aggressively work towards improving our on-shelf availability. We are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate, that our stores have reduced their out of stocks on core items by 13% over prior year third quarter. 
Our real estate model is the foundation of driving strong returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 80% to 85% of our comp base, all while driving returns over 20%. For 2016, we're on track to open 900 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 900 stores. The real estate and store operations team have done a tremendous job in executing our store growth plans. 
We continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced low single digit to mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. I'm especially encouraged that we experienced a notable share change trend improvement in the most recent 8-week data. 
During the third quarter, we invested gross margin dollars in a number of strategies designed to drive traffic. Some of these initiatives performed better than others, but I believe we learned important lessons that will guide us in being more effective with the spending going forward. Based on the recent work we've done to analyze the business and to test various initiatives, we believe that we have identified those actions and strategies that provide the best opportunity to drive traffic and ultimately, profitable sales growth. We are moving fast to aggressively pursue the actions that we believe will drive our same-store sales performance improvements. 
During the quarter, we made pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas where we saw opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share with the objective to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our proactive pricing actions were implemented selectively across about 70% of our store base or on about -- and on about 450 items targeting high-household-penetration, fast-turning categories. While these investments take time to deliver the full impact, we are seeing the expected improvements in transactions, units and weekly same-store sales across the vast majority of stores where we have made these investments. We believe we are on the right track with these selective price investments, which are noticeable to our consumers. 
As I mentioned, while some of the third quarter investments resulted in the desired performance, others did not. For instance, we invested in incremental promotional activities to drive traffic, although results were mixed and did not meet our overall expectations. As such, this is an area we look to be more effective in deploying gross profit dollars going forward. 
Additionally, as we move through the quarter, it became apparent to our -- incremental actions would not be able to overcome the decline in traffic in our stores. Both traffic-driving consumables and basket-building nonconsumables were impacted, requiring greater-than-anticipated markdowns to move through the inventory and keep our merchandise in the stores fresh. Based on our learnings, we have focused our efforts on the most efficient and impactful activities, and we will continue to monitor these traffic-driving initiatives and continue to optimize these investments to achieve the best returns. I have confidence in this retail management team that has successfully navigated other challenging sales environments. We remain committed to controlling the factors that we can control and seizing the opportunities we have identified to improve our performance. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to John."
266974,408513674,1095776,"Dollar General Corporation, Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2016",2016-12-01,"Earnings Calls","Dollar General Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales,",876,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. 
Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales, a decrease of 49 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year third quarter, the most significant drivers were higher markdown, primarily for inventory clearance and promotions; a greater proportion of sales of lower-margin consumables; and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory markups. 
SG&A expense in the quarter increased by 48 basis points over the comparable 2015 period to $1.2 billion or 22.5% of sales. The SG&A increase was due in part to increased retail labor and occupancy costs. In addition, we incurred charges and related expenses of $13 million or 25 basis points associated with the acquisition of the former Walmart Express store locations. These expenses were primarily related to lease termination costs for existing stores and costs related to the conversion of acquired stores to DG stores. We also incurred an increase of $7.7 million or 14 basis points of disaster-related expenses in the 2016 period, most of which were hurricane related. Partially offsetting these items were reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation expenses and advertising costs. For comparability, please keep in mind that 2015 third quarter SG&A results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points for severance-related benefit costs associated with the corporate restructuring of certain support functions. In light of our same-store sales performance for the quarter, I am pleased with the way the team managed our SG&A expenses. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we would have successfully leveraged SG&A expenses on our same-store sales performance of 0.9% had it not been for the store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses mentioned earlier. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.2%. As in the first half of the year, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by congress in December 2015. 
Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.49 billion, up 5.6% on a per-store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with our sales performance with the actions we have in place designed to help get inventory growth in line with our sales growth. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape and we are comfortable with the quality. And the increase was mainly in our everyday planogram categories or what we think of as core items. 
Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated cash from operations of $1.12 billion, an increase of 39% or $315 million compared to the 2015 third quarter, primarily as a result of working capital improvements and higher net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $225 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding totaling $70 million. Year-to-date to the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $892 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend. From December 2011 through the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4.3 billion of 70.2 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the third quarter, our remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1.2 billion. 
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store base, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
Looking ahead, we are realistic about the environment in which we are operating. We now expect that our fiscal 2016 diluted EPS growth will be at the low end of our long-term growth model range of 10% to 15%. This outlook includes the impact of the charge for the store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses in the third quarter and the benefit from the 53rd week this year of approximately $0.09 per diluted share. 
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Fair Labor Standard Act's new salary requirement, it does not include any incremental expense related to the potential implementation of that regulation. In the event that the new salary requirement under the Fair Labor Standards Act is implemented, we anticipate that this would be an incremental annualized expense of approximately $60 million to $70 million or $0.03 for the 2016 fourth quarter. Please keep in mind that we had an incremental $0.04 per diluted share benefit from the reenactment of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit in Q4 2015. We anticipate providing further details on our 2017 initiatives when we release our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results in March 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd."

Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 operating priorities for growth: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as",1340,"Thank you, John. Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 operating priorities for growth: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. 
Our first priority is to drive profitable sales growth. Our goal is to attract and grow new consumers and trips and capture share with existing customers, utilizing our customer segmentation work and our disciplined approach to category management. To enhance our value proposition, we are committed to providing our customers with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us. Clearly, our consumers' budgets are pinched. The cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as the reduction of staff participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses, appear to have taken a noticeable toll on their spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. 
We remain committed to refreshing our price investments across items and categories as well as incremental markets. Our changes would be made as needed in a very rational manner as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture market share. 
To further enhance our value proposition, we are also focused on refining our advertising effectiveness to drive productive sales growth with a continued focus on everyday low prices that resonate with our customers. For 2017, we plan to further integrate our traditional and digital media mix to work together to ensure we are reaching our target consumers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. Through applied predictive technology, we are conducting a test and learn to gain further insights into our ability to achieve a higher return on investment on our advertising media mix. 
A key area of focus for 2017 is to build on our 2016 progress to expand the merchandising initiatives that focus on our mature store base to drive our same-store sales. For a select group of these stores, we anticipate a more extensive 4-wall remodeling effort that we believe will provide compelling returns. The recent acquisition of the former Walmart Express stores gives us great insights as we develop the remodel program for these stores. Merchandising initiatives across all departments have been deployed to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day across this group of stores. 
Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. In 2017, we plan to accelerate our square footage growth to about 7.5%. Our 2017 pipeline is essentially complete as we continue to plan for about 1,000 new store openings. The primary format will be our traditional DG box, which is about 7,300 square feet of selling space and provides us with strong new store economics and returns. This format consistently proves to be our highest-return format against which we benchmark the performance of all other formats. We expect that these traditional stores will utilize our successful Dollar General 16 layout to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format, all while providing consumers with a faster checkout. 
We are planning for the future as we segment our store opportunities that we believe can have a greater impact on sales and productivity, all while continuing to drive compelling returns. We view this as more of an evolution of our existing, highly productive, traditional store format rather than a wholesale change. We are in a unique position to leverage knowledge across our multiple formats, given that Dollar General has always been a leader in store format innovation. I view our store formats along a continuum of selling square footage. On one end, we apply lessons from the best-selling items in our 16,000-square-foot Dollar General market stores to our newly acquired 10,000-square-foot box. Both of these formats give us great experience with fresh produce and meats. From there, we move along the continuum to the 9,000-square-foot Dollar General Plus with about 30-or-so cooler doors and more holding power on the shelf. Next, we tailor the assortment to our 7,300-square-foot traditional box. With over 12,500 traditional stores, this box will always be core to our model. 
Finally, we have been pleased with the test results of our smaller box, that is less than 6,000 square feet for certain metro and rural locations. Across the formats, we constantly are editing the assortments and taking our best-selling items from one format to the next to satisfy our customers' changing needs while driving -- while continuing to drive productivity. 
Key consumer trends going forward that are becoming more important to our core consumers include healthier, better-for-you options and a greater fresh assortment. Our range of formats positions us well to seek opportunities to capture this growing customer sentiment. Given that we are still in the planning process, I look forward to sharing more with you over the coming months. 
To support our new store growth and productivity, we continue to make investments in our distribution center network. Our Janesville, Wisconsin distribution center is nearing completion, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in early 2017. Our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia is also under construction, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in late 2017. 
Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. The team has embraced the spirit and process of zero-based budgeting that we implemented last year as part of the 2016 budget. We have had great success in leveraging our culture and heritage of cost management with our zero-based budgeting program across our cost structure. As we enter year 2 of our zero-based budgeting process, the team is actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings, opportunities across the company leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove costs that don't affect the customer experience. 
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. In the third quarter, we redesigned our store manager training program. And while it's still early, we are seeing almost a 20% improvement in satisfaction scores from those store managers who have gone through the program. 
We have exciting opportunities ahead of us. Our test-and-learn program is a foundation of our continual improvement we believe are positioning Dollar General to be even more relevant to help our customers save time and money now and in the future. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects of the company and are moving quickly and deliberately to restore traffic to our stores. 
Our stores are prepared for the holidays, and we have a strong plan in place for the remainder of the holiday selling season with exciting gifts, decor, toys and other holiday necessities and multiple avenues to save in-store and online. Our customers can take advantage of our holiday offerings and stretch their holiday budget even further. 
Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. We have strong new-store economics with returns above 20% and a payback under 2 years. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth as well as our mature store base, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends. We remain very excited about our business over time. 
In closing, I want to recognize more than -- the more than 120,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers every day. We are in the midst of our busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and everyday low prices. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions to our mission of serving others. 
With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

The real thing to look at there is that a lot of our initiatives coming into the year 2016 were around those traffic-driving areas. So again, around perishables in the food areas and immediate consumption. So while we're facing great headwinds on deflation there, what we're starting to see is that those initiatives are overtaking even some of those deflationary pressures. But make no mistake, those headwinds are pretty strong, and that's why we said we feel pretty good about where we're headed because those initiatives are really taking hold in those categories. And as we look at this pretty transitory. And as those deflationary pressures hopefully start to ease mid next year, when we pop out of the other side, we should be in very good shape. Because the initiatives that we deployed to include some of the traffic-driving initiatives around our pricing that we've recently implemented are in a lot of those consumable, high-discretionary categories that are out there for the consumer. So I think, all in all, we made the right decisions. And as we come out of this, we should be in a much better shape."

The way we see it now, this is something we watch very closely, monitor the sales performance and the returns. And we continue, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we continue to see the stores open as expected at the 80% to 85% sales productivity. We continue to see the returns above 20% above our target. We continue to see paybacks in less than 2 years. And given the low-risk, low-cost, high-return opportunity we see here, we're proceeding, but watching it very carefully and understand that this is something that we could dial back quickly if needed. But based on the great results we continue to see and the belief that the pressures on the comps are largely transitory in nature, we don't see a need to do that thus far part, but we'll closely manage that. And in terms of the second question around zero-based budgeting, our ability to dial back that even more, we're very pleased with the performance that we've seen with zero-based budgeting. When you consider in the difficult environment we've been operating, the team's done a phenomenal job managing costs, looking at everything through the lens of, does it touch the customer? Is it in line with our strategic priorities? Does not doing this put the business at risk? And so were -- we have, and we're going to continue to go after all the cost we can, continually but thoughtfully, and making sure that over time, we're also -- as we manage the business for the long term, investing in those initiatives that will drive long-term growth. But rest assured, the team is hard at work on zero-based budgeting. It's performing better than expected this year. When you consider it, if you exclude the impact of the relocations of the acquired stores and the disaster-related costs, we would be leveraging our SG&A at 0.9% comp versus the stated target at the beginning of the year where we lowered it from 3.5% to -- and creeping up toward 4% to 2.5% to 3%. So we're ahead of schedule. We feel great about what we've done. But we'd be very balanced going forward in doing the right things for the business for the right long term."

And I can tell you, as late as mid-third quarter, they were telling us that their sentiment, feeling is even more dire than it was in previous quarters in early 2016. And what they're citing and continue to cite is the rising health care costs that they're facing. I don't believe any of our core customers realize what they were up against on those rising costs. And then rental costs continue, and they called that out second on paying rent. Because most of our, again, core customers rent, don't own, and those rents are going up across the nation at a pretty high rate. And they have to continue to allocate their spending. So anywhere they are saving, they are doing some things a little differently than they've done before. For instance, they're investing in smartphone technology at a greater rate than we've ever seen. And those come with an expense, as we all know, a monthly expense. And so the little bit of money that she does may have, from maybe lower gas prices and some other tailwinds, she is moving into a little bit of a technology world herself very slowly, albeit, but she is moving there. So we're hearing a lot of the same things we've heard over the last couple quarters, but what was interesting to us was that she was feeling worse off today, middle of the third quarter, than she was earlier in the year."

As we look at the entire box, and we've got one of the most robust category management processes and teams in consumable retailing today. They do a great job in evaluating each and every year what should be inside of our stores and what those initiatives should be. And we've always said that the consumable initiatives and the consumable products will drive traffic, and our nonconsumable businesses will drive the basket. We see that no differently. And actually, we've seen our nonconsumable business tail off along with our consumable business, as that customer pulled back and especially in the SNAP-affected states. In saying that, a lot of our initiatives for this year and next year are both in consumables and in nonconsumables. Because we believe that you have to have a fine balance between the 2 to really round out the shopping experience for the consumer. And so we're looking at it really no differently. Now in consumables, there may be some differences in some of the products that we bring in because, again, our consumers are starting to look for better-for-you, more healthy, a little bit more fresh products. And the great thing about having the market stores, 150 or 160 market stores that we have as well as our Plus stores, we're able to infuse the best learnings and products into our traditional store from those formats. So there isn't any test-and-learn periods. We know what works, and we continue to bring those type of products to market in our 7,300-square-foot store. And you'll see even more of that, maybe even in a low accelerated rate as we move into 2017 because, again, our consumer preferences are changing."

But in saying that, we're still seeing our -- what we affectionately call our BFF, which is our core best customers, continue to really resonate with our everyday low price. And through Q3, with all the traffic-driving initiatives we did, what really stuck and resonated the most was everyday low price. And that really goes to show you that the segmentation work that we do is right on in key, and that is our best customers look to us to deliver everyday low price first, because she needs to count on us each and every day. But in -- but beyond that, we're still seeing a healthy customer base outside of our core. Some of our reach customers, we're still seeing trade in and trade down-type customers coming in, and we're still seeing a decent millennial-type customer that really just started to emerge. And that's some of the reasons we're looking at even more better-for-you and healthier as well as maybe some fresh options as we go forward because that consumer is really starting to emerge as a real player here at Dollar General."

On today's call, I would first like to share our perspectives on the third quarter and review some of its highlights, then turn it over to John to take you through a more detailed review of the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year. I will then provide insights into our strategic action plans going forward. 
Since we last spoke in our earnings call at the end of August, the retail environment has continued to be challenging, although we are pleased to see some of our traffic and sales-driving actions beginning to take hold as we exited the third quarter. As I shared with you last quarter, we have taken a number of actions across merchandising and store operations to drive same-store sales, all while being very disciplined in our SG&A spending. Although our sales and earnings fell short of our expectation, I believe we made progress on our initiatives in the quarter. Together, the team has spent a tremendous amount of time and resources on the analytics of our business and the targeted actions going forward. 
As the deflation cycle continued in the quarter, we have reevaluated how we're looking at the impact, ultimately taking a more broad-based view. Rather than limiting our view to commodity cost of milk and eggs, we expanded our analysis to the average unit retail price deflation. Applying this broader view of deflation to both our second and third quarters, we experienced a greater impact in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. We estimate that the combined headwinds from the average unit retail price deflation and reduction in SNAP benefits negatively impacted our same-store sales for the third quarter by approximately 150 to 175 basis points and for our second quarter by approximately 100 to 115 basis points. We believe many of these issues are transitory in nature. 
Now let's turn to some of the highlights for the third quarter of 2016 as we compare it to the prior year quarter. Third quarter sales increased 5% to $5.3 billion. Year-to-date through the third quarter, net sales were $16 billion, an increase of 5.9%, over the comparable prior year period. Same-store sales declined 0.1% for the quarter as an increase in average transaction size was offset by softer customer traffic. Same-store sales growth was positive for consumables, offset by decline in the nonconsumable categories 
In terms of the sales cadence for the quarter, August and October were both positive with October being the strongest period of the quarter. Year-to-date through the third quarter, same-store sales increased 0.9% over the comparable prior year period. 
For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.84, including approximately $0.05 for store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses. During the quarter, we returned $295 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 2.9 million shares of common stock and the payment of a quarterly dividend. 
We successfully converted 42 Walmart Express locations to the Dollar General banner. These locations are performing well ahead of our expectation and provide us with great insights to apply to our existing store formats and future opportunities. 
The store operation team continues to aggressively work towards improving our on-shelf availability. We are seeing progress, as our third-party audits indicate, that our stores have reduced their out of stocks on core items by 13% over prior year third quarter. 
Our real estate model is the foundation of driving strong returns. We continue to see our new store productivity at around 80% to 85% of our comp base, all while driving returns over 20%. For 2016, we're on track to open 900 new stores and relocate or remodel a combined 900 stores. The real estate and store operations team have done a tremendous job in executing our store growth plans. 
We continue to grow transaction and item units in syndicated share data for the quarter. In the most recent syndicated data, we experienced low single digit to mid-single-digit growth in both units and dollar share for the 4-, 12-, 24- and 52-week periods. I'm especially encouraged that we experienced a notable share change trend improvement in the most recent 8-week data. 
During the third quarter, we invested gross margin dollars in a number of strategies designed to drive traffic. Some of these initiatives performed better than others, but I believe we learned important lessons that will guide us in being more effective with the spending going forward. Based on the recent work we've done to analyze the business and to test various initiatives, we believe that we have identified those actions and strategies that provide the best opportunity to drive traffic and ultimately, profitable sales growth. We are moving fast to aggressively pursue the actions that we believe will drive our same-store sales performance improvements. 
During the quarter, we made pricing, labor and marketing investments in designated market areas where we saw opportunities to be proactive as we look to improve same-store sales and market share with the objective to provide our customers with affordability, value and convenience at a time when they need us most. Our proactive pricing actions were implemented selectively across about 70% of our store base or on about -- and on about 450 items targeting high-household-penetration, fast-turning categories. While these investments take time to deliver the full impact, we are seeing the expected improvements in transactions, units and weekly same-store sales across the vast majority of stores where we have made these investments. We believe we are on the right track with these selective price investments, which are noticeable to our consumers. 
As I mentioned, while some of the third quarter investments resulted in the desired performance, others did not. For instance, we invested in incremental promotional activities to drive traffic, although results were mixed and did not meet our overall expectations. As such, this is an area we look to be more effective in deploying gross profit dollars going forward. 
Additionally, as we move through the quarter, it became apparent to our -- incremental actions would not be able to overcome the decline in traffic in our stores. Both traffic-driving consumables and basket-building nonconsumables were impacted, requiring greater-than-anticipated markdowns to move through the inventory and keep our merchandise in the stores fresh. Based on our learnings, we have focused our efforts on the most efficient and impactful activities, and we will continue to monitor these traffic-driving initiatives and continue to optimize these investments to achieve the best returns. I have confidence in this retail management team that has successfully navigated other challenging sales environments. We remain committed to controlling the factors that we can control and seizing the opportunities we have identified to improve our performance. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to John."

For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales,",876,"Thank you, Todd, and good morning, everyone. For the 2016 third quarter and year-to-date, I will share more insights on some of the important financial details and our outlook. 
Gross profit for the 2016 third quarter was $1.6 billion or 29.8% of sales, a decrease of 49 basis points from last year's third quarter. As compared to the prior year third quarter, the most significant drivers were higher markdown, primarily for inventory clearance and promotions; a greater proportion of sales of lower-margin consumables; and increased inventory shrink, partially offset by higher initial inventory markups. 
SG&A expense in the quarter increased by 48 basis points over the comparable 2015 period to $1.2 billion or 22.5% of sales. The SG&A increase was due in part to increased retail labor and occupancy costs. In addition, we incurred charges and related expenses of $13 million or 25 basis points associated with the acquisition of the former Walmart Express store locations. These expenses were primarily related to lease termination costs for existing stores and costs related to the conversion of acquired stores to DG stores. We also incurred an increase of $7.7 million or 14 basis points of disaster-related expenses in the 2016 period, most of which were hurricane related. Partially offsetting these items were reductions in administrative payroll costs, incentive compensation expenses and advertising costs. For comparability, please keep in mind that 2015 third quarter SG&A results reflect expenses of $6.1 million or 12 basis points for severance-related benefit costs associated with the corporate restructuring of certain support functions. In light of our same-store sales performance for the quarter, I am pleased with the way the team managed our SG&A expenses. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we would have successfully leveraged SG&A expenses on our same-store sales performance of 0.9% had it not been for the store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses mentioned earlier. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.2%. As in the first half of the year, our effective tax rate was lower this quarter as compared to the 2015 quarter, primarily due to the recognition of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit in the quarter in which it is earned, given changes by congress in December 2015. 
Moving now to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. At quarter end, merchandise inventories were $3.49 billion, up 5.6% on a per-store basis. Key factors impacting this increase were our on-shelf availability initiative and the timing of receipts, coupled with our sales performance with the actions we have in place designed to help get inventory growth in line with our sales growth. Even with this increase, we believe our inventory is in good shape and we are comfortable with the quality. And the increase was mainly in our everyday planogram categories or what we think of as core items. 
Year-to-date through the third quarter, we generated cash from operations of $1.12 billion, an increase of 39% or $315 million compared to the 2015 third quarter, primarily as a result of working capital improvements and higher net income. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our common stock for $225 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per common share outstanding totaling $70 million. Year-to-date to the end of the third quarter, we have returned cash to shareholders totaling $892 million through the combination of share repurchases and quarterly dividend. From December 2011 through the third quarter of 2016, we repurchased $4.3 billion of 70.2 million shares of our common stock. At the end of the third quarter, our remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $1.2 billion. 
We remain committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy to create lasting value for our shareholders. Our first priority remains investing in new stores and the infrastructure to support our store base, while our second priority is to return cash to shareholders through anticipated dividends and share repurchases. Underlying our capital allocation strategy is our goal to maintain our investment-grade rating by managing to a leverage ratio approximately 3x adjusted debt to EBITDAR. 
Looking ahead, we are realistic about the environment in which we are operating. We now expect that our fiscal 2016 diluted EPS growth will be at the low end of our long-term growth model range of 10% to 15%. This outlook includes the impact of the charge for the store relocation costs and disaster-related expenses in the third quarter and the benefit from the 53rd week this year of approximately $0.09 per diluted share. 
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Fair Labor Standard Act's new salary requirement, it does not include any incremental expense related to the potential implementation of that regulation. In the event that the new salary requirement under the Fair Labor Standards Act is implemented, we anticipate that this would be an incremental annualized expense of approximately $60 million to $70 million or $0.03 for the 2016 fourth quarter. Please keep in mind that we had an incremental $0.04 per diluted share benefit from the reenactment of the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit in Q4 2015. We anticipate providing further details on our 2017 initiatives when we release our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results in March 2017. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Todd."

Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 operating priorities for growth: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as",1340,"Thank you, John. Well, while we are still in our planning process for fiscal 2017, we remain focused on our 4 operating priorities for growth: first, driving profitable sales growth; second, capturing growth opportunities; third, enhancing our position as a low-cost operator; and fourth, investing in our people as a competitive advantage. 
Our first priority is to drive profitable sales growth. Our goal is to attract and grow new consumers and trips and capture share with existing customers, utilizing our customer segmentation work and our disciplined approach to category management. To enhance our value proposition, we are committed to providing our customers with everyday low prices that they know and trust from us. Clearly, our consumers' budgets are pinched. The cumulative effect of macroeconomic factors, such as the reduction of staff participation and benefit levels and increased housing and health care expenses, appear to have taken a noticeable toll on their spending. Our goal is to be there for our customers when they need us the most. 
We remain committed to refreshing our price investments across items and categories as well as incremental markets. Our changes would be made as needed in a very rational manner as we move through the coming quarters with the goal to drive traffic and units and capture market share. 
To further enhance our value proposition, we are also focused on refining our advertising effectiveness to drive productive sales growth with a continued focus on everyday low prices that resonate with our customers. For 2017, we plan to further integrate our traditional and digital media mix to work together to ensure we are reaching our target consumers where, when and how they decide to engage with us. Through applied predictive technology, we are conducting a test and learn to gain further insights into our ability to achieve a higher return on investment on our advertising media mix. 
A key area of focus for 2017 is to build on our 2016 progress to expand the merchandising initiatives that focus on our mature store base to drive our same-store sales. For a select group of these stores, we anticipate a more extensive 4-wall remodeling effort that we believe will provide compelling returns. The recent acquisition of the former Walmart Express stores gives us great insights as we develop the remodel program for these stores. Merchandising initiatives across all departments have been deployed to provide consumers with more of the products and brands they want and need to save time and money every day across this group of stores. 
Second, we will focus on initiatives to capture growth opportunities. In 2017, we plan to accelerate our square footage growth to about 7.5%. Our 2017 pipeline is essentially complete as we continue to plan for about 1,000 new store openings. The primary format will be our traditional DG box, which is about 7,300 square feet of selling space and provides us with strong new store economics and returns. This format consistently proves to be our highest-return format against which we benchmark the performance of all other formats. We expect that these traditional stores will utilize our successful Dollar General 16 layout to expand high-growth, traffic-building categories in a more customer-friendly format, all while providing consumers with a faster checkout. 
We are planning for the future as we segment our store opportunities that we believe can have a greater impact on sales and productivity, all while continuing to drive compelling returns. We view this as more of an evolution of our existing, highly productive, traditional store format rather than a wholesale change. We are in a unique position to leverage knowledge across our multiple formats, given that Dollar General has always been a leader in store format innovation. I view our store formats along a continuum of selling square footage. On one end, we apply lessons from the best-selling items in our 16,000-square-foot Dollar General market stores to our newly acquired 10,000-square-foot box. Both of these formats give us great experience with fresh produce and meats. From there, we move along the continuum to the 9,000-square-foot Dollar General Plus with about 30-or-so cooler doors and more holding power on the shelf. Next, we tailor the assortment to our 7,300-square-foot traditional box. With over 12,500 traditional stores, this box will always be core to our model. 
Finally, we have been pleased with the test results of our smaller box, that is less than 6,000 square feet for certain metro and rural locations. Across the formats, we constantly are editing the assortments and taking our best-selling items from one format to the next to satisfy our customers' changing needs while driving -- while continuing to drive productivity. 
Key consumer trends going forward that are becoming more important to our core consumers include healthier, better-for-you options and a greater fresh assortment. Our range of formats positions us well to seek opportunities to capture this growing customer sentiment. Given that we are still in the planning process, I look forward to sharing more with you over the coming months. 
To support our new store growth and productivity, we continue to make investments in our distribution center network. Our Janesville, Wisconsin distribution center is nearing completion, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in early 2017. Our 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia is also under construction, with a goal to begin shipping from this facility in late 2017. 
Our third operating priority is to leverage and reinforce our positioning as a low-cost operator. The team has embraced the spirit and process of zero-based budgeting that we implemented last year as part of the 2016 budget. We have had great success in leveraging our culture and heritage of cost management with our zero-based budgeting program across our cost structure. As we enter year 2 of our zero-based budgeting process, the team is actively working on a pipeline of additional future savings, opportunities across the company leveraging process improvement, procurement and prioritization to remove costs that don't affect the customer experience. 
Our fourth operating priority is to invest in our people. We believe that our people are a competitive advantage. In the third quarter, we redesigned our store manager training program. And while it's still early, we are seeing almost a 20% improvement in satisfaction scores from those store managers who have gone through the program. 
We have exciting opportunities ahead of us. Our test-and-learn program is a foundation of our continual improvement we believe are positioning Dollar General to be even more relevant to help our customers save time and money now and in the future. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects of the company and are moving quickly and deliberately to restore traffic to our stores. 
Our stores are prepared for the holidays, and we have a strong plan in place for the remainder of the holiday selling season with exciting gifts, decor, toys and other holiday necessities and multiple avenues to save in-store and online. Our customers can take advantage of our holiday offerings and stretch their holiday budget even further. 
Our long-term commitment to growth and shareholder value is unchanged. We have a business model that is proven and resilient. We have strong new-store economics with returns above 20% and a payback under 2 years. Our team is energized to seize growth opportunities. Our business generates significant cash flow, and we are in a position to invest in accelerated store growth as well as our mature store base, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and anticipated dividends. We remain very excited about our business over time. 
In closing, I want to recognize more than -- the more than 120,000 Dollar General employees who serve our customers every day. We are in the midst of our busiest season in retail, and our customers are depending on us for convenience and everyday low prices. I want to thank all of our employees for their contributions to our mission of serving others. 
With that, Mary Winn, we would now like to open the lines for questions."

Those continue to gain traction throughout the year and especially in the third quarter and now into the fourth.

So a little choppiness is probably the right way to look at it, but we're very encouraged on how we see our initiatives taking hold and taking shape.

The real thing to look at there is that a lot of our initiatives coming into the year 2016 were around those traffic-driving areas. So again, around perishables in the food areas and immediate consumption. So while we're facing great headwinds on deflation there, what we're starting to see is that those initiatives are overtaking even some of those deflationary pressures. But make no mistake, those headwinds are pretty strong, and that's why we said we feel pretty good about where we're headed because those initiatives are really taking hold in those categories. And as we look at this pretty transitory. And as those deflationary pressures hopefully start to ease mid next year, when we pop out of the other side, we should be in very good shape. Because the initiatives that we deployed to include some of the traffic-driving initiatives around our pricing that we've recently implemented are in a lot of those consumable, high-discretionary categories that are out there for the consumer. So I think, all in all, we made the right decisions. And as we come out of this, we should be in a much better shape."

The way we see it now, this is something we watch very closely, monitor the sales performance and the returns.

We continue to see the returns above 20% above our target. We continue to see paybacks in less than 2 years. And given the low-risk, low-cost, high-return opportunity we see here, we're proceeding, but watching it very carefully and understand that this is something that we could dial back quickly if needed. But based on the great results we continue to see and the belief that the pressures on the comps are largely transitory in nature, we don't see a need to do that thus far part, but we'll closely manage that. And in terms of the second question around zero-based budgeting, our ability to dial back that even more, we're very pleased with the performance that we've seen with zero-based budgeting. When you consider in the difficult environment we've been operating, the team's done a phenomenal job managing costs, looking at everything through the lens of, does it touch the customer? Is it in line with our strategic priorities? Does not doing this put the business at risk? And so were -- we have, and we're going to continue to go after all the cost we can, continually but thoughtfully, and making sure that over time, we're also -- as we manage the business for the long term, investing in those initiatives that will drive long-term growth. But rest assured, the team is hard at work on zero-based budgeting. It's performing better than expected this year. When you consider it, if you exclude the impact of the relocations of the acquired stores and the disaster-related costs, we would be leveraging our SG&A at 0.9% comp versus the stated target at the beginning of the year where we lowered it from 3.5% to -- and creeping up toward 4% to 2.5% to 3%. So we're ahead of schedule. We feel great about what we've done. But we'd be very balanced going forward in doing the right things for the business for the right long term."

The key drivers there were markdown, mix and inventory shrink. Markdowns, being the most significant driver, as it was listed first. And that was both in consumables and nonconsumables, first is we moved through inventory with clearance and markdowns to keep the inventory fresh. The good news here is that the quality of the inventory is in great shape. And then also with the tougher sales environment in Q3, we had additional promotional activity, as we mentioned, with the goal of driving the top line and are pleased with the results we're seeing and the learnings we've captured from that to be more targeted, more focused on targeted pricing and EDLP and optimizing the spend for maximum results going forward. And again, pleased with the momentum we saw coming out of the quarter and into this quarter. So those were the key drivers there.

And I think with the learnings going forward, we'll be able to be more targeted with this and continue to see opportunity over the long term.

And I can tell you, as late as mid-third quarter, they were telling us that their sentiment, feeling is even more dire than it was in previous quarters in early 2016. And what they're citing and continue to cite is the rising health care costs that they're facing. I don't believe any of our core customers realize what they were up against on those rising costs. And then rental costs continue, and they called that out second on paying rent. Because most of our, again, core customers rent, don't own, and those rents are going up across the nation at a pretty high rate. And they have to continue to allocate their spending. So anywhere they are saving, they are doing some things a little differently than they've done before. For instance, they're investing in smartphone technology at a greater rate than we've ever seen. And those come with an expense, as we all know, a monthly expense. And so the little bit of money that she does may have, from maybe lower gas prices and some other tailwinds, she is moving into a little bit of a technology world herself very slowly, albeit, but she is moving there. So we're hearing a lot of the same things we've heard over the last couple quarters, but what was interesting to us was that she was feeling worse off today, middle of the third quarter, than she was earlier in the year."

They do a great job in evaluating each and every year what should be inside of our stores and what those initiatives should be. And we've always said that the consumable initiatives and the consumable products will drive traffic, and our nonconsumable businesses will drive the basket. We see that no differently. And actually, we've seen our nonconsumable business tail off along with our consumable business, as that customer pulled back and especially in the SNAP-affected states. In saying that, a lot of our initiatives for this year and next year are both in consumables and in nonconsumables. Because we believe that you have to have a fine balance between the 2 to really round out the shopping experience for the consumer. And so we're looking at it really no differently. Now in consumables, there may be some differences in some of the products that we bring in because, again, our consumers are starting to look for better-for-you, more healthy, a little bit more fresh products. And the great thing about having the market stores, 150 or 160 market stores that we have as well as our Plus stores, we're able to infuse the best learnings and products into our traditional store from those formats.

We, again, as I mentioned earlier, we go out and talk to the customers each and every quarter. And again, I believe that the majority of what we communicated to everyone earlier in the year pretty well is still well intact as far as the consumer is concerned, except for the notion that she may be a little worse off today economically than she was even earlier in the year. At least, her sentiment is a little less positive. But in saying that, we're still seeing our -- what we affectionately call our BFF, which is our core best customers, continue to really resonate with our everyday low price. And through Q3, with all the traffic-driving initiatives we did, what really stuck and resonated the most was everyday low price. And that really goes to show you that the segmentation work that we do is right on in key, and that is our best customers look to us to deliver everyday low price first, because she needs to count on us each and every day. But in -- but beyond that, we're still seeing a healthy customer base outside of our core. Some of our reach customers, we're still seeing trade in and trade down-type customers coming in, and we're still seeing a decent millennial-type customer that really just started to emerge. And that's some of the reasons we're looking at even more better-for-you and healthier as well as maybe some fresh options as we go forward because that consumer is really starting to emerge as a real player here at Dollar General."
