Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on our consistent strategy then an overview of Q1 fiscal year -- of fiscal year '16 and update you on our guidance, and then Terry will run through the fina",2275,"Good morning and thanks to everyone for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on our consistent strategy then an overview of Q1 fiscal year -- of fiscal year '16 and update you on our guidance, and then Terry will run through the financials for Q1.
To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry both in its consistency and its ability to sustain, create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and around 3/4 of our net sales come from products from which we believe we are the sole-source provider. Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales, aftermarket revenues and historically produced a higher gross margin and provided relative stability through the cycles. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has year in and year out generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structure flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have a simple, well-proven value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value driver concept that is steady cost reduction, profitable new business and value-based pricing. We maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system with executive and senior managements who think, act and are paid like owners. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we can see a clear path to P/E-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have 4. Our priorities are typically as follows: first is to invest in our existing businesses; second is to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. These are almost always our first 2 choices. Our third is to give the extra back to the shareholders through either special dividends or stock buybacks, and fourth is to pay off debt. And as I've said before, given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions. As we've done consistently in the past, based on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize our returns. 
To update you on a few items. The credit markets have been erratic over the last few months. However, our bonds have not traded down significantly, and we believe we still have adequate access to the debt market at reasonable cost. Terry will give a little more detail on the rates. As we mentioned in previous calls, the rates we pay on our current debt are significantly hedged or collared for about the next 4 years.
Through January, we have bought back about $100 million of TransDigm stock at roughly $218 a share. About $70 million of this occurred in Q1 and the balance during January. We currently have an additional $450 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything about our current plans for capital allocation. We closed the Breeze acquisition in early January. That is the start of our second quarter for about $178 million, net of $27 million of acquired cash. The 9/30/2015 LTM EBITDA was publicly disclosed by the seller at about $23 million and revenue of about $98 million. The seller's 2016 forecast was also a public number at about $19 million of EBITDA and $98 million of revenue that were certain onetime items and 2015 that positively impacted the EBITDA. 
Breeze is a good proprietary, mostly sole-sourced business with about 70% aftermarket. It's a good fit with TransDigm. Though the margins may not get all the way to our overall average, we see significant opportunities for margin expansion. As usual, we see solid P/E-type returns on our equity in this field.
At January 2, 2016, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make about $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated levels for fiscal year '16. The commercial transport aftermarket continues weaker than the traffic growth would suggest. Though not clear, this still seems, at least for our company's products, to be driven primarily by some mix of inventory management by airlines and deferrals of spending. If you look over the last 5 to 6 years, this does not appear dissimilar to prior market variations.
We also look carefully at the impact of the surplus market on our sales. We are advised that parts above the $5,000 to $10,000 unit price are likely candidates. We looked at our last 3 years of sales. Commercial aftermarket parts sales with a unit price over $5,000 only make up about 4% to 5% of our total revenues and about 10% of our commercial aftermarket. In total, this group of parts with the unit price over $5,000 has grown nicely over the past few years. A few parts are down but is a very small dollar value, and other parts are up significantly. On balance, at this time, we can see little, if any quantifiable impact, from surplus parts over the last few years on our parts.
We see a number of factors that could contribute to stronger aftermarket growth in 2016 plus such as the continuing strong passenger traffic, a slowdown in retirements, potential end of deferral inventory cycle. But obviously, these have not yet resulted in much of a bump.
Turning now to our fiscal year -- or Q1 of our fiscal year 2016 performance. I'll remind you this is the first quarter for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2015. Also as a reminder, Q1 has about 10% less shipping days than the other 3 quarters. 
As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by differences in the OEM aftermarket mix, order timing, inventory fluctuations, modest seasonality and the like. Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA were strong. Both were up in the range of 20% versus the prior Q1. The organic revenue was slightly down on the quarter versus prior year quarter. Q1 revenues in total were on our expectations. That is, excluding Breeze, there are about 10% less than the average -- excluding Breeze, they're about 10% less than the average anticipated fiscal year '16 quarterly shipments. That is roughly in line with the reduced shipping days. The EBITDA As Defined was also one of our expectations. 
Reviewing the revenues by market category. Again, this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q1. That is assuming we owned the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up about 1% versus the prior Q1. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up about 85% of our commercial OEM revenues were up 5% versus the prior Q1. The commercial transport growth primarily reflects the market conditions and is in line with our expectations. 
On the other hand, biz jet and helicopter OEM revenues, which make up around 15% of our commercial OEM revenues, most of which is business jet, in total, revenues in these markets were down versus the prior Q1 about 11%. The significant drop pulled the total commercial average down. It appears this is mostly timing as: one, the business jet bookings ran well ahead of shipments; and two, our largest biz jet customers, Gulfstream and seems to still be expecting decent years in 2016. For the quarter, total commercial OEM bookings were modestly above shipments. The total commercial aftermarket revenues were about flat for this quarter versus the prior year Q1. Commercial transport aftermarket revenues, which also make up about 85% of our commercial aftermarket revenues, were up about 2%. This was offset by biz jet, helicopter and the GA market aftermarket revenues, which were down almost 15%. For the quarter, commercial aftermarket bookings in total were modestly above shipments with the commercial transport segment bookings up and the biz jet and helicopter markets down. 
In the defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q1 were down 1% versus the prior year Q1. One large international shipment was delayed by a customer about a week at year-end. Without that delay, revenues would have been up 2% versus the prior Q1. The revenues and other products were spotty with no clear pattern. Q1 defense bookings also ran modestly ahead of shipments.
Now moving on to profitability. Again, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The as-defined adjustments in Q1 were noncash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. 
Our EBITDA As Defined of about $319 million for Q1 was up 18% versus the prior Q1. The EBITDA As Defined margin was about 46% of revenues for Q1, about the same as last year's Q1 in spite of approximately 1.5% of margin dilution from the 2015 acquisitions. 
As we mentioned in the last quarter, we reduced our employment level about 4% to 5% over the 120 days prior to this quarter end. This combined with our other value drivers contributed to the strong margins.
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities looks a little light. This can change quickly. Closings are difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Moving on now to 2016. We continue to have some concerns about duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I said before, we're being cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well. And as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact the demand. However, in general, publicly reported commercial transport aftermarket revenue trends have been mixed, and we still see reports of potential economic softening. On balance, these factors tend to keep us cautious. But all in all, this is our best current estimate for the year. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond Breeze, in fiscal year '16, our revised guidance is as follows: the midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance is $3.2 billion, an increase of $70 million from our prior guidance. This is up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Organic growth is still anticipated to be in the range of 5% year-over-year. The revenue increase in our guidance is due primarily to the Breeze acquisition. The midpoint of fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.44 billion, an increase of $20 million. This is up 16% year-over-year. The increase in the EBITDA guidance is mostly driven by the Breeze acquisition with some modest upward adjustment in our base margin. The base business, excluding the 2015 acquisitions and Breeze, is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up roughly 2 points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $10.77 a share or up about $0.32 a share from our last guidance. This is a 20% increase from the prior year. The increase is guidance is due about 1/2 to the Breeze acquisition and the balance to a combination of improved margins, lower tax rate and slightly lower share count. Terry will review these details in a little more. On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions. Commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digit percent based on worldwide RPM growth of around 5. We are still cautious on the factors I've discussed earlier and frankly, due to somewhat softer Q1. 
Defense and military revenue growth is still forecast in the low single digits. Given world events, there could well be variations here. Commercial OEM revenue growth, we are guiding in the mid-single-digit percentage range, primarily due to the 2016 and '17 commercial transport production rates. We are still assuming commercial transport unit airframe shipments are up in the low single-digit percent for 2016. We are cautious about 2017 production rates and how this could reflect in our 2016 shipments.
At this time, we are assuming that the sharp drop in Q1 business jet shipments is mostly timing. 
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.2 billion in cash and over $500 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016. We also had additional capacity under our credit agreement. 
Again, assuming no additional acquisitions, our other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9x EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down roughly 1 turn. 
In summary, Q1 was a decent start to the year. We met our expectations. As I look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are somewhat unclear, and that makes us cautious. However, we may have some margin upside to help offset some market variations. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value focus strategy and strong mix of business we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors. And with that, let me hand us over to Terry."

I will now review our Q1 financial results. First quarter net sales were $702 million, up $115 million or approximately 20% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions, Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics and Franke, wa",750,"Thank you, Nick. I will now review our Q1 financial results. First quarter net sales were $702 million, up $115 million or approximately 20% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions, Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics and Franke, was an increase of $121 million, offset by a slight decline in organic sales. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $375 million, an increase of 17%. Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was 1.3 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related cost, which accounted for a decrease of over 2 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved over 1 margin point due to the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure despite slight decline in organic sales. 
Our selling, general and administrative expenses were 11.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.5% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.6% of sales the year ago. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $13 million versus the prior year quarter. This was a result of an increase to the outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was partially to fund the acquisitions in the fiscal 2015.
Our effective tax rate was 30% in the current quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates -- lower rates than the U.S. statutory rates and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our expected full year estimated tax rate has decreased slightly to below 31% due to the R&D tax credit. We believe we have an opportunity to increase the benefit of the R&D credit in the future, and we have just begun a study to explore this opportunity. We will update the progress with you next quarter. We still expect our cash taxes to be about $200 million for fiscal year 2016. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $19 million or 20% to $115 million, which is 16.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $96 million or 16% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, the lower tax rate partially offset by higher interest expense, noncash compensation and acquisition-related cost versus the prior period. 
GAAP EPS was $1.97 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.63 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.27 per share, an increase of 26% compared to $1.80 per share last year.
Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $805 million of cash on the balance sheet after spending $71 million to purchase 324,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, we continue to repurchase shares in January. We spent another $28 million to purchase 128,000 shares. So in total, we purchased 452,000 shares at a total cost of $99 million. We now expect the full year weighted average shares to be 56.5 million shares.
The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.7x pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and gross leverage was 6.3x pro forma EBITDA. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016, will be 4.9x, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions. As for access to the capital markets, we believe that high-yield market will be very receptive to our high-quality paper despite the current high-yield market conditions. We believe the coupon rate on the new offering could be 50 basis points higher from where our bonds are trading today depending on the tenure of the issuance. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $9.60. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $10.77. The $1.17 of adjustments to bridge the GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend equivalent payments; $0.56 from noncash stock option expense; and $0.56 of acquisition-related expenses, up $0.13 primarily related to Breeze.
Now I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

Thanks to everyone for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on our consistent strategy then an overview of Q1 fiscal year -- of fiscal year '16 and update you on our guidance, and then Terry will run through the financi",2284,"Good morning. Thanks to everyone for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on our consistent strategy then an overview of Q1 fiscal year -- of fiscal year '16 and update you on our guidance, and then Terry will run through the financials for Q1.
To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products and around 3/4 of our net sales come from products from which we believe we are the sole source provider. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and provided relative stability through the cycles. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has year in and year out generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structure flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have a simple, well-proven value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value driver concept, that is steady cost reduction, profitable new business and value-based pricing. We maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system with executive and senior management who think, act and are paid like owners. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we can see a clear path to P/E-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. 
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have 4. Our priorities are typically as follows: first is to invest in our existing businesses; second is to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. These are almost always our first 2 choices. Our third is to give the extra back to the shareholders through either special dividends or stock buybacks; and fourth is to pay off debt. And as I've said before, given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions. As we've done consistently in the past, based on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner we think has the best chance to maximize our returns.
To update you on a few items. The credit markets have been erratic over the last few months. However, our bonds have not traded down significantly, and we believe we still have adequate access to the debt market at reasonable cost. Terry will give a little more detail on the rates. As we mentioned in previous calls, the rates we pay on our current debt are significantly hedged or collared for about the next 4 years.
Through January, we have bought back about $100 million of TransDigm stock at roughly $218 a share. About $70 million of this occurred in Q1 and the balance during January. We currently have an additional $450 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything about our current plans for capital allocation. We closed the Breeze acquisition in early January. That is the start of our second quarter for about $178 million, net of $27 million of acquired cash. 
The 9/30/2015 LTM EBITDA was publicly disclosed by the seller at about $23 million and revenue of about $98 million. The seller's 2016 forecast was also a public number at about $19 million of EBITDA and $98 million of revenue. There were certain onetime items in 2015 that positively impacted the EBITDA. 
Breeze is a good proprietary, mostly sole sourced business. With about 70% aftermarket, it's a good fit with TransDigm. Though the margins may not get all the way to our overall average, we see significant opportunities for margin expansion. As usual, we see solid P/E-type returns on our equity in this deal.
At January 2, 2016, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make about $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated levels for fiscal year '16. The commercial transport aftermarket continues weaker than the traffic growth would suggest. Though not clear, this still seems, at least for our company's products, to be driven primarily by some mix of inventory management by airlines and deferrals of spending. If you look over the last 5 to 6 years, this does not appear dissimilar to prior market variations.
We also look carefully at the impact of the surplus market on our sales. We are advised that parts above the $5,000 to $10,000 unit price are the most likely candidates. We looked at our last 3 years of sales. Commercial aftermarket parts sales with a unit price over $5,000 only make up about 4% to 5% of our total revenues and about 10% of our commercial aftermarket. In total, this group of parts with a unit price over $5,000 has grown nicely over the last few years. A few parts are down, but is a very small dollar value, and other parts are up significantly. On balance, at this time, we can see little, if any, quantifiable impact from surplus parts over the last few years on our parts.
We see a number of factors that could contribute to stronger aftermarket growth in 2016 plus, such as the continuing strong passenger traffic, a slowdown in retirements, potential end of deferral inventory cycle. But obviously, these have not yet resulted in much of a bump.
Turning now to our fiscal year -- or Q1 of our fiscal year 2016 performance. I'll remind you this is the first quarter for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2015. Also as a reminder, Q1 has about 10% less shipping days than the other 3 quarters. 
As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons could be significantly impacted by differences in the OEM aftermarket mix, order timing, inventory fluctuations, modest seasonality and the like. Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA were strong. Both were up in the range of 20% versus the prior Q1. The organic revenue was slightly down on a quarter versus prior year quarter. Q1 revenues in total were on our expectations. That is, excluding Breeze, there are about 10% less than the average -- excluding Breeze, they're about 10% less than the average anticipated fiscal year '16 quarterly shipments. That is roughly in line with the reduced shipping days. The EBITDA As Defined was also one of our expectation. 
Reviewing the revenues by market category. Again, this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q1. That is assuming we owned the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up about 1% versus the prior Q1. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up about 85% of our commercial OEM revenues, were up 5% versus the prior Q1. The commercial transport growth primarily reflects the market conditions and is in line with our expectations. 
On the other hand, biz jet and helicopter OEM revenues, which make up around 15% of our commercial OEM revenues, most of which is business jet, in total revenues in these markets were down versus the prior Q1 about 11%. This significant drop pulled the total commercial average down. It appears this is mostly timing as, one, the business jet bookings ran well ahead of shipments; and two, our largest biz jet customers, Gulfstream and Textron, seem to still be expecting decent years in 2016. For the quarter, total commercial OEM bookings were modestly above shipments. The total commercial aftermarket revenues were about flat for this quarter versus the prior year Q1. Commercial transport aftermarket revenues, which also make up about 85% of our commercial aftermarket revenues, were up around 2%. This was offset by biz jet, helicopter and the GA market aftermarket revenues, which were down almost 15%. For the quarter, commercial aftermarket bookings in total were modestly above shipments with the commercial transport segment bookings up and the biz jet and helicopter markets down. 
In the defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q1 were down 1% versus the prior year Q1. One large international shipment was delayed by a customer about a week at year-end. Without that delay, revenues would have been up 2% versus the prior Q1. The revenues and other products were spotty with no clear pattern. Q1 defense bookings also ran modestly ahead of shipments.
Now moving on to profitability. Again, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q1 were noncash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. 
Our EBITDA As Defined of about $319 million for Q1 was up 18% versus the prior Q1. The EBITDA As Defined margin was about 46% of revenues for Q1, about the same as last year's Q1 in spite of approximately 1.5% of margin dilution from the 2015 acquisitions. 
As we mentioned in the last quarter, we reduced our employment level about 4% to 5% over the 120 days prior to this quarter end. This combined with our other value drivers contributed to the strong margins.
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities looks a little light. This can change quickly. Closings are difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Moving on now to 2016. We continue to have some concerns about duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I said before, we're being cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well. And as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact the demand. However, in general, publicly reported commercial transport aftermarket revenue trends have been mixed, and we still see reports of potential economic softening. On balance, these factors tend to keep us cautious. But all in all, this is our best current estimate for the year. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond Breeze, in fiscal year '16, our revised guidance is as follows: the midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance is $3.2 billion, an increase of $70 million from our prior guidance. This is up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Organic growth is still anticipated to be in the range of 5% year-over-year. The revenue increase in our guidance is due primarily to the Breeze acquisition. The midpoint of fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.44 billion, an increase of $20 million. This is up 16% year-over-year. The increase in the EBITDA guidance is mostly driven by the Breeze acquisition with some modest upward adjustment in our base margin. The base business, excluding the 2015 acquisitions and Breeze, is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up roughly 2 points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $10.77 a share or up about $0.32 a share from our last guidance. This is a 20% increase from the prior year. The increase in guidance is due about half to the Breeze acquisition and the balance to a combination of improved margins, lower tax rate and slightly lower share count. Terry will review these details in a little more -- a little more. On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions. Commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digit percent based on worldwide RPM growth of around 5. We are still cautious through the factors I discussed earlier and frankly, due to a somewhat softer Q1. 
Defense and military revenue growth is still forecasted in the low single digits. Given world events, there could well be variations here. Commercial OEM revenue growth, we are guiding in the mid-single-digit percentage range, primarily due to the 2016 and '17 commercial transport production rates. We're still assuming commercial transport unit airframe shipments are up in the low single-digit percent for 2016. We are cautious about 2017 production rates and how this could reflect in our 2016 shipments. At this time, we are assuming that the sharp drop in Q1 business jet shipments is mostly timing. 
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.2 billion in cash and over $500 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016. We also had additional capacity under our credit agreement. 
Again, assuming no additional acquisitions or other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9x EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down roughly one turn. 
In summary, Q1 was a decent start to the year. We met our expectations. As I look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are somewhat unclear, and that makes us cautious. However, we may have some margin upside to help offset some market variations. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value focus strategy and strong mix of business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors. 
And with that, let me hand this over to Terry."
22800180,322788163,929368,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Nick. I will now review our Q1 financial results. First quarter net sales were $702 million, up $115 million or approximately 20% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions, Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics and Franke, wa",750,"Thank you, Nick. I will now review our Q1 financial results. First quarter net sales were $702 million, up $115 million or approximately 20% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions, Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics and Franke, was an increase of $121 million, offset by a slight decline in organic sales. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $375 million, an increase of 17%. Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was 1.3 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of over 2 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved over 1 margin point due to the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure, despite slight decline in organic sales. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.5% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.6% of sales a year ago. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $13 million versus the prior year quarter. This was a result of an increase to the outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was partially to fund the acquisitions in the fiscal 2015.
Our effective tax rate was 30% in the current quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates -- lower rates than the U.S. statutory rates and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our expected full year estimated tax rate has decreased slightly to below 31% due to the R&D tax credit. We believe we have an opportunity to increase the benefit of the R&D credit in the future, and we have just began a study to explore this opportunity. We will update the progress with you next quarter. We still expect our cash taxes to be about $200 million for fiscal year 2016. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $19 million or 20% to $115 million, which is 16.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $96 million or 16% of net sales in the prior year. The increases in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, the lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense, noncash compensation and acquisition-related cost versus the prior period. 
GAAP EPS was $1.97 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.63 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.27 per share, an increase of 26% compared to $1.80 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $805 million of cash on the balance sheet after spending $71 million to purchase 324,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, we continue to repurchase shares in January. We spent another $28 million to purchase 128,000 shares. So in total, we purchased 452,000 shares at a total cost of $99 million. We now expect the full year weighted average shares to be 56.5 million shares.
The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.7x pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and gross leverage was 6.3x pro forma EBITDA. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016, will be 4.9x, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions. As for access to the capital markets, we believe that a high-yield market would be very receptive to our high-quality paper despite the current high-yield market conditions. We believe the coupon rate on the new offering could be 50 basis points higher from where our bonds are trading today depending on the tenure of the issuance. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $9.60. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $10.77. The $1.17 of adjustments to bridge the GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend equivalent payments; $0.56 from noncash stock option expense; and $0.56 of acquisition-related expenses, up $0.13 primarily related to Breeze.
Now I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

Thanks to everyone for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on our consistent strategy, then an overview of Q1 fiscal year -- of fiscal year '16 and update you on our guidance, and then Terry will run through the financ",2272,"Good morning. Thanks to everyone for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on our consistent strategy, then an overview of Q1 fiscal year -- of fiscal year '16 and update you on our guidance, and then Terry will run through the financials for Q1.
To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, and around 3/4 of our net sales come from products from which we believe we are the sole source provider. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and provided relative stability through the cycles. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins and relatively low capital expenditures, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and capital structure flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value-driver concept that is steady cost reduction, profitable new business and value-based pricing. We maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system with executive and senior management who think, act and are paid like owners. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we can see a clear path to PE-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. 
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have 4. Our priorities are typically as follows: First is to invest in our existing businesses; second is to make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. These are almost always our first 2 choices. Our third is to give the extra back to the shareholders through either special dividends or stock buybacks; and fourth is to pay off debt. And as I've said before, given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions. As we've done consistently in the past, based on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in the manner we think has the best chance to maximize our returns.
To update you on a few items. The credit markets have been erratic over the last few months. However, our bonds have not traded down significantly, and we believe we still have adequate access to the debt market at reasonable cost. Terry will give a little more detail on the rates. As we mentioned in previous calls, the rates we pay on our current debt are significantly hedged or collared for about the next 4 years.
Through January, we have bought back about $100 million of TransDigm stock at roughly $218 a share. About $70 million of this occurred in Q1 and the balance during January. We currently have an additional $450 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything about our current plans for capital allocation. We closed the Breeze acquisition in early January. That is the start of our second quarter for about $178 million, net of $27 million of acquired cash. 
The 9/30/2015 LTM EBITDA was publicly disclosed by the seller at about $23 million and revenue of about $98 million. The seller's 2016 forecast was also a public number at about $19 million of EBITDA and $98 million of revenue. There were certain onetime items in 2015 that positively impacted the EBITDA. 
Breeze is a good, proprietary, mostly sole-sourced business with about 70% aftermarket. It's a good fit with TransDigm. Though the margins may not get all the way to our overall average, we see significant opportunities for margin expansion. As usual, we see solid PE-type returns on our equity in this deal.
At January 2, 2016, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make about $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated levels for fiscal year '16. The commercial transport aftermarket continues weaker than the traffic growth would suggest. Though not clear, this still seems, at least for our company's products, to be driven primarily by some mix of inventory management by airlines and deferrals of spending. If you look over the last 5 to 6 years, this does not appear dissimilar to prior market variations.
We also look carefully at the impact of the surplus market on our sales. We are advised that parts above the $5,000 to $10,000 unit price are the most likely candidates. We looked at our last 3 years of sales. Commercial aftermarket part sales with a unit price over $5,000 only make up about 4% to 5% of our total revenues and about 10% of our commercial aftermarket. In total, this group of parts with a unit price over $5,000 has grown nicely over the last few years. A few parts are down, but is a very small dollar value, and other parts are up significantly. On balance, at this time, we can see little, if any, quantifiable impact from surplus parts over the last few years on our parts.
We see a number of factors that could contribute to stronger aftermarket growth in 2016, plus -- such as the continuing strong passenger traffic, a slowdown in retirements, potential end of deferral inventory cycle. But obviously, these have not yet resulted in much of a bump.
Turning now to our fiscal year -- or Q1 of our fiscal year 2016 performance. I'll remind you this is the first quarter for fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2015. Also as a reminder, Q1 has about 10% less shipping days than the other 3 quarters. 
As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons could be significantly impacted by differences in the OEM aftermarket mix, order timing, inventory fluctuations, modest seasonality and the like. Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA were strong. Both were up in the range of 20% versus the prior Q1. The organic revenue was slightly down on a quarter versus prior year quarter. Q1 revenues in total were on our expectations. That is, excluding Breeze, there are about 10% less than the average anticipated fiscal year '16 quarterly shipments. That is roughly in line with the reduced shipping days. The EBITDA As Defined was also on our expectation. 
Reviewing the revenues by market category. Again, this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q1. That is assuming we owned the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were up about 1% versus the prior Q1. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up about 85% of our commercial OEM revenues, were up 5% versus the prior Q1. The commercial transport growth primarily reflects the market conditions and is in line with our expectations. 
On the other hand, biz jet and helicopter OEM revenues, which make up around 15% of our commercial OEM revenues, most of which is business jet, in total revenues in these markets were down versus the prior Q1 about 11%. This significant drop pulled the total commercial average down. It appears this is mostly timing as, one, the business jet bookings ran well ahead of shipments; and two, our largest biz jet customers, Gulfstream and Textron, seem to still be expecting decent years in 2016. For the quarter, total commercial OEM bookings were modestly above shipments. The total commercial aftermarket revenues were about flat for this quarter versus the prior year Q1. Commercial transport aftermarket revenues, which also make up about 85% of our commercial aftermarket revenues, were up around 2%. This was offset by biz jet, helicopter and the GA market aftermarket revenues, which were down almost 15%. For the quarter, commercial aftermarket bookings in total were modestly above shipments, with the commercial transport segment bookings up and the biz jet and helicopter markets down. 
In the defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q1 were down 1% versus the prior year Q1. One large international shipment was delayed by a customer about a week at year-end. Without that delay, revenues would have been up 2% versus the prior Q1. The revenues and other products were spotty with no clear pattern. Q1 defense bookings also ran modestly ahead of shipments.
Now moving on to profitability. Again, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q1 were noncash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. 
Our EBITDA As Defined of about $319 million for Q1 was up 18% versus the prior Q1. The EBITDA As Defined margin was about 46% of revenues for Q1, about the same as last year's Q1 in spite of approximately 1.5% of margin dilution from the 2015 acquisitions. 
As we mentioned in the last quarter, we reduced our employment level about 4% to 5% over the 120 days prior to this quarter end. This combined with our other value drivers contributed to the strong margins.
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities looks a little light. This can change quickly. Closings are difficult to predict. We remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Moving on now to 2016. We continue to have some concerns about duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I said before, we're being cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well. And as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact the demand. However, in general, publicly reported commercial transport aftermarket revenue trends have been mixed, and we still see reports of potential economic softening. On balance, these factors tend to keep us cautious. But all in all, this is our best current estimate for the year. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond Breeze, in fiscal year 2016, our revised guidance is as follows: the midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 revenue guidance is $3.2 billion, an increase of $70 million from our prior guidance. This is up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Organic growth is still anticipated to be in the range of 5% year-over-year. The revenue increase in our guidance is due primarily to the Breeze acquisition. The midpoint of fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.44 billion, an increase of $20 million. This is up 16% year-over-year. The increase in the EBITDA guidance is mostly driven by the Breeze acquisition with some modest upward adjustment in our base margin. The base business, excluding the 2015 acquisitions and Breeze, is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up roughly 2 points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $10.77 a share or up about $0.32 a share from our last guidance. This is a 20% increase from the prior year. The increase in guidance is due about half to the Breeze acquisition and the balance to a combination of improved margins, lower tax rate and slightly lower share count. Terry will review these details in a little more -- a little more. On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: Commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid- to high single-digit percent based on worldwide RPM growth of around 5. We are still cautious due to the factors I discussed earlier and frankly, due to a somewhat softer Q1. 
Defense and military revenue growth is still forecasted in the low single digits. Given world events, there could well be variations here. Commercial OEM revenue growth, we are guiding in the mid-single-digit percentage range, primarily due to the 2016 and '17 commercial transport production rates. We're still assuming commercial transport unit airframe shipments are up in the low single-digit percent for 2016. We are cautious about 2017 production rates and how this could reflect in our 2016 shipments. At this time, we are assuming that the sharp drop in Q1 business jet shipments is mostly timing. 
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.2 billion in cash and over $500 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016. We also had additional capacity under our credit agreement. 
Again, assuming no additional acquisitions or other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9x EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down roughly one turn. 
In summary, Q1 was a decent start to the year. We met our expectations. As I look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are somewhat unclear, and that makes us cautious. However, we may have some margin upside to help offset some market variations. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors. 
And with that, let me hand this over to Terry."

I will now review our Q1 financial results. First quarter net sales were $702 million, up $115 million or approximately 20% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions, Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics and Franke, wa",748,"Thank you, Nick. I will now review our Q1 financial results. First quarter net sales were $702 million, up $115 million or approximately 20% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions, Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics and Franke, was an increase of $121 million, offset by a slight decline in organic sales. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $375 million, an increase of 17%. Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was 1.3 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of over 2 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved over 1 margin point due to the strength of our proprietary products and continually improving our cost structure, despite slight decline in organic sales. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 11.5% in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.6% of sales a year ago. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $13 million versus the prior year quarter. This was a result of an increase to the outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was partially to fund the acquisitions in the fiscal 2015.
Our effective tax rate was 30% in the current quarter compared to 32.6% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the U.S. statutory rates and the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit. Our expected full year estimated tax rate has decreased slightly to below 31% due to the R&D tax credit. We believe we have an opportunity to increase the benefit of the R&D credit in the future, and we have just began a study to explore this opportunity. We will update the progress with you next quarter. We still expect our cash taxes to be about $200 million for fiscal year 2016. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $19 million or 20% to $115 million, which is 16.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $96 million or 16% of net sales in the prior year. The increases in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, the lower tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense, noncash compensation and acquisition-related costs versus the prior period. 
GAAP EPS was $1.97 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.63 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.27 per share, an increase of 26% compared to $1.80 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $805 million of cash on the balance sheet after spending $71 million to purchase 324,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, we continued to repurchase shares in January. We spent another $28 million to purchase 128,000 shares. So in total, we purchased 452,000 shares at a total cost of $99 million. We now expect the full year weighted average shares to be 56.5 million shares.
The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.7x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and gross leverage was 6.3x pro forma EBITDA. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016, will be 4.9x, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions. As for access to the capital markets, we believe that a high-yield market would be very receptive to our high-quality paper despite the current high-yield market conditions. We believe the coupon rate on the new offering could be 50 basis points higher from where our bonds are trading today, depending on the tenure of the issuance. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $9.60. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $10.77. The $1.17 of adjustments to bridge the GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend equivalent payments; $0.56 from noncash stock option expense; and $0.56 of acquisition-related expenses, up $0.13 primarily related to Breeze.
Now I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview of fiscal year '16, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance for th",1956,"Good morning, and thanks to everybody for calling in. Today, as usual, I'll start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview of fiscal year '16, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance for the year. Kevin is then going to update you on some operating items, and Terry will run through the financials for the quarter.
To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, that is products for which we own the intellectual property. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margin, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated very strong free cash flow. This gives us lots of operating and financial flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have a well-proven value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value-driver concept. We maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path through PE, or private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. We basically have 4: first, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; third is to give extra money back to the shareholders through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly is to pay off debt. Given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice. Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the equity returns.
Now to update you on a few items this quarter. The credit markets, at least as of today, have firmed up nicely in the last quarter. Our bonds and secured debt are trading roughly at par. We have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent with those we pay now. 
In the first 6 months of the year, we bought back about 1 million shares of TransDigm stock at an average price of $205 [ph] a share. Almost all of this occurred in the December through February time frame. We currently have an additional $340 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything of our buyback plans. At 4/2/16, which is the end of the quarter, based on current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity and maintaining significant liquidity after we do debt. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. 
On a very positive note, the commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings picked up substantially this quarter. Quarterly bookings ran ahead of the strong shipments. Recoveries are often not straight upwardly -- upward lines, and we could still see bumps, but it's good to see a strong quarter like this. As I've said before, we see a number of factors that should contribute to continuing commercial transport aftermarket growth this year. Passenger traffic remains strong, slowdown in retirements and potential ends to the deferral of our inventory cycle. On the other hand, though much smaller in our revenues, the business jet freighter after markets could be weakening.
Turning to Q2 fiscal year '16 and year-to-date performance, and I'll remind you this is the second quarter for '16, our year started October 1. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be impacted by differences in mix, inventory fluctuation, seasonality and things like that. Total company GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong both for the Q2 and year-to-date. For Q2, the revenues are up 29% versus the prior Q2 and 24% versus the prior year-to-date. EBITDA As Defined was up about the same percent as the revenues. Overall organic revenues were up in the 4% to 5% range versus the prior year. Commercial revenues were up a bit more, while defense was modestly down. Defense bookings on the other hand ran well ahead of the shipments. EBITDA As Defined, dollars and margin percent were both strong.
To review the revenues by market category, again, this is on a pro forma or same-store kind of a basis versus the prior year, and this is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial aftermarket -- or the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were about flat for Q2 versus both the prior year-to-date and versus the prior year Q2. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the vast majority of our commercial OEM revenues, are up 2% versus the prior year-to-date. Q2 was flat versus a difficult comp in the prior year. We saw some modest inventory adjustments in certain commercial transport OEM Tier 1 accounts. Year-to-date commercial transport bookings are running slightly ahead of revenues. The biz jet and helicopter OEM revenues are a much smaller percent of our business and are heavily biz jet-weighted. In total, revenues in these markets were about flat versus the prior year Q2 and due to the weak Q1, down about 6% year-to-date. Business jet bookings for Q2 were slightly ahead of shipments. The biz jet market in total seems a little weaker than we originally anticipated.
Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 13% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, the commercial transport aftermarket is now up a little more than the overall average, and the business jet helicopter and freighter markets are flat to slightly down. For the quarter, total commercial aftermarket bookings were modestly above shipments. Commercial transport bookings were up 16% in Q2 versus the prior Q2. Biz jet, helicopter and other bookings were modestly down in Q2 versus the prior year Q2, but I'd remind you again these other categories are far smaller than the commercial transport. 
The defense aftermarket makes up about 30% of our revenue. Defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q2 were down 3% versus the prior Q2 and down about 1% on a year-to-date basis. The revenues by product lines were spotty with no clear patterns. However, as I said before, year-to-date bookings are running ahead of shipments. They're running about 11% ahead of shipments with a very strong quarter of bookings in Q2. 
Moving on to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q2 were noncash compensation expense and acquisition-related costs or amortizations. EBITDA As Defined of about $396 million for Q2 was up 28% versus the prior quarter -- prior Q2 and $688 million or up 23% on a year-to-date basis. The EBITDA As Defined margin was 46.5% of the revenue for Q2 and 46% year-to-date. This is about the same margin percent as last year in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.
As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5%. In Q1, this combined with our other value drivers contributes to the strong margins. With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities strengthened from the last quarter, and we are seeing more activity recently. Closings are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I said before, we're cautiously spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see increasing variability in various industry forecast and by platform, the news is somewhat mixed. In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well. And as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact demand. As I also said, the biz jet freighter markets could be a little softer than we originally anticipated. Recoveries don't always run in a straight line, so we tend to be a little cautious. All in all, this is our best estimate for the full year. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond Breeze in fiscal year 2016, the guidance is as follows. The midpoint of the 2016 revenue guidance is $3.17 billion. This is the same as our prior guidance. We've tightened the range up a little. It's up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.46 billion, an increase of about $25 million. This is up 18% year-over-year. The increase in guidance is driven by improvements in our EBITDA margin. The base business, that is excluding the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up around 2 points versus 2015 for the same mix of business -- businesses. The recent acquisition margins are running a bit ahead of our private -- prior estimates. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be 11 16 per share or up $0.39 a share from our last guidance. This is up 24% versus prior year. The increase in guidance is due to 2 factors, improved margins and a modestly lower share count as a result of our buybacks. Terry will run through some of the details.
On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket growth in the mid- to high-single digits or still somewhat cautious but obviously feel better than we did 90 days ago. In the defense military revenue, growth in the low single-digit percent or slightly down year-to-date with a strong year-to-date bookings and a strong Q2 bookings give us some confidence here. Commercial OEM revenues, we see growth in the low to mid-single-digit percent range. We're still assuming commercial transport shipments will be slightly up, but we're concerned that the biz jet shipments for the year could be flat to modestly down. We also expect to see a modest decrease in freighter revenue for the year based on the announced 747 rate decrease.
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.1 billion in cash and over $400 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016 -- $500 million. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activity, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9x EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down about 1 full turn.
In summary, Q2 is a good quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are still a little unclear, and that makes us cautious. However, we think we still may have some modest margin upside to help offset any market variations. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and a strong mix of businesses we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our shareholders.
And with that, let me turn this over to Terry."

Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had good second quarter. As we've stated previously, we believe our planning processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year. For an update on our acquisition-related value driver, let me give you an update on the last acquisitions we accomplished. To this point, let me once again provide some color on our acquisition strategy. As we do at each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes an implementation of our value-creation process and metrics; restructuring the company into our business unit focus groups; focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business; and finally, we tighten up cost -- the cost structure. 
For Telair, this was a significant acquisition in early 2015 for TransDigm and focuses on the defense and commercial cargo markets. To date, the acquisition is on track on its integration path and has delivered sales and EBITDA in excess of our model. In general, the defense market has performed well for us in this business, but the freight market may be beginning to soften. We remain confident that this is a fine business for TransDigm.
Additionally, we closed on Pexco in May of 2015, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used in galleys, lavatories, floors, ceilings and storage bins of aircraft. Today, Pexco Aerospace is performing at our expectations across all key financial and growth metrics with a strong focus on our value-generation strategy. The team successfully closed and completed the consolidation of the manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach with minimal customer disruption. While implementing a largely new management team at Pexco, we have realized better-than-expected productivity results with all of our manufacturing activities now under one roof. With performance in our value drivers ahead of plan, we currently are finding sales and EBITDA are additionally running ahead of plan. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and are confident that the acquisition will continue to run at expectations.
In August of 2015, we finalized the acquisition of PneuDraulics into the TransDigm family. PneuDraulics is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, about 6 miles east of Los Angeles. PneuDraulics' highly engineered and proprietary products primarily are valves, actuators and subsystem components used in hydraulic and pneumatic applications. PneuDraulics serves all of the major markets in aerospace, including commercial, regional, business jet and defense markets. We were confident when we acquired PneuDraulics that it was a solid business with an excellent management team. This has proven to be the case as the management team has proven to be fast adopters of the TransDigm value drivers culture. The integration of PneuDraulics is going according to plan. The company's performance has met or beat expectations for the 3 value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. Although we have experienced some softness in the business jet market, the commercial aerospace market is currently holding up well, and our EBITDA driven by our value driver concept has exceeded our expectations. In general, we are pleased with the results and expect this business to be a solid acquisition and a good company for TransDigm in the future.
Lastly, Breeze-Eastern was acquired by TransDigm on January 4 of 2016. Breeze, which is located in Whippany New Jersey, designs and manufacturers mission-critical electromechanical systems. The main products consist of rescue hoists, cargo hoax and winches, primarily for rescue helicopters and cargo aircraft. Approximately 75% of Breeze revenue comes from the defense sector, and approximately 70% of it comes from the aftermarket. In the first 90 days since the acquisition, we have established a new leadership team comprised of both existing Breeze-Eastern employees as well as experienced TransDigm personnel. We have also taken productivity actions to better align the size of the organization with the level of business activity, which will increase overall value, including the announcement of the consolidation of the Virginia facility into the main campus by late calendar year 2016. We were also realigning the business into our usual customer-focused business unit teams to enhance operational performance and responsiveness. These changes will be completed during the second half of our fiscal year as we align the financial reports with these 2 business units and we physically co-locate the team personnel within the facility. These changes will support and accelerate new product development activities as the teams are beginning to focus on rapidly bringing advanced hoist and winch technologies to market. To date, the Breeze-Eastern acquisition has delivered value as expected for TransDigm shareholders with revenue and EBITDA as expected. 
To update on the recent progress of our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to 3 recent wins we have received in the aerospace market. AvtechTyee recently was awarded significant bookings across multiple configurations of our recently updated sealed control panel used in the Boeing 737 next-generation. The bulk of these orders were primarily to satisfy initial provisioning of spares by airlines with upcoming deliveries from Boeing. The bookings also included upgraded sealed audio control panels with satellite communication functionality. This functionality enables the flight crew to directly dial and connect any phone number around the world through existing satellite communication networks in areas where HF and VHF radio functions can be unreliable.
Next, at PneuDraulics, we were awarded components in  4 major hydraulic system areas by Textron Aviation for the Cessna longitude program. PneuDraulics was awarded hydraulic components for spoiler actuation, brake systems, landing gear and central hydraulic systems. Additionally, this represents the largest total ship set award for PneuDraulics to date. 24 discrete components were awarded per aircraft with a forecasted build rate of 36 aircraft per year at peak and a production launch in the next couple of years. 
Lastly, Aero Fluid products has won an exciting new program for the A320 Neo. The Painesville, Ohio-based team was awarded the oil control manifold for this new program. The OCM is an aluminum block mounted on the main engine gearbox that contains multiple valves, openings and sensors that control the temperatures and pressures of the engine oil. This is a growth award as the team did not enjoy this business on the A320 legacy platform. 
Finally, I wanted to bring your attention to one of our key business planning processes. Last time, I updated all of you in a succession planning process. Given the time in the fiscal year, I now wanted to update on our fiscal year '17 planning process, which we have just kicked off. This process gives us an excellent glimpse of the aerospace market for commercial and defense applications. This process is a bottoms-up forecast done by each of our individual product lines, rolling up to business units, then the entire company with a focused emphasis on our TransDigm value drivers of productivity, value-based pricing and new business. This process, which is the foundation of our fiscal year guidance that we provide to the market each year, begins with a lot of hard work by each individual business units and culminates with focused reviews of each of our 51-plus operating companies and about 80 business unit teams throughout the back end of our fourth quarter. We believe this granular bottoms-up database review is the best way we know of to compile market intelligence and provide guidance to our shareholders. It has served us well and allowed us to generally be quite accurate in our annual guidance and internal planning.
With that, now, let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail. Terry?"

The collective impact of the acquisitions Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics, Breeze and Franke was an increase of $150 million. O",681,"Thank you, Kevin. I will now review -- second quarter net sales were $797 million or approximately 29% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics, Breeze and Franke was an increase of $150 million. Organic sales were up approximately 4.5%, driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $426 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was almost 2 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of over 3 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved about 1.5 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure as well as favorable mix from strong commercial aftermarket sales. Additionally, gross profit margins improved over 0.5 point sequentially, excluding all acquisition activity. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.9% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12% in the prior year. Excluding the acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $11 million versus the prior year quarter. This was the result of an increase to our outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase now stand borrowings was to fund acquisitions we did in fiscal 2015. 
Our effective tax rate was 31% in the current quarter compared to 29.2% in the prior year. The higher effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to a favorable discrete adjustment in the prior year related to finalizing IRS audits related to fiscal 2012 and 2013. Our expected full year estimated tax rate is still to be expected to be 31%. We now expect our cash taxes to be around $210 million for fiscal 2016. Our net income for the quarter increased $28 million or 25% to $139 million which is 17.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $111 million or 17.9% of [ph] net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income, primarily reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher interest expense and acquisition-related costs versus the prior period. 
GAAP EPS was $2.47 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.96 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.86 per share, an increase of 35.5% compared to $2.11 per share last year.
Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $612 million of cash. I want to remind you that during the quarter, we paid $146 million for the Breeze acquisition, net of $31 million of cash acquired. We also spent $137 million to purchase approximately 692,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, in total this year, we had purchased just over 1 million shares at a total cost of $208 million. We now expect our full year weighted average shares to be 56.2 million. 
The company's net leverage ratio at the quarter end was 5.6x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and the gross leverage was 6x pro forma EBITDA As Defined. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016 will be 4.9x, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.01. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.16. The $1.15 of adjustments that bridge GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend equivalent payments, $0.57 from noncash stock option expense and $0.53 of acquisition-related expenses.

Today, as usual, I will start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview then of fiscal year '16, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance",1962,"Good morning, and thanks to everybody for calling in. Today, as usual, I will start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview then of fiscal year '16, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance for the year. Kevin is then going to update you on some operating items, and Terry will run through the financials for the quarter.
To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, that is products for which we own the intellectual property. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margin, TransDigm has year in and year out generated very strong free cash flow. This gives us lots of operating and financial flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have a well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value-driver concept. We maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to PE, or private equity-like, returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. 
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. We basically have 4: first, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; third is to give extra money back to the shareholders even through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly is to pay off debt. Now given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice. Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the equity returns.
Now to update you on a few items from this quarter. The credit markets, at least as of today, have firmed up nicely in the last quarter. Our bonds and secured debt are trading roughly at par. We have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent with those we pay now. 
In the first 6 months of the year, we bought back about 1 million shares of TransDigm stock at an average price of $205 a share. Almost all of this occurred in the December through February time frame. We currently have an additional $340 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything of our buyback plans. At 4/2/16, which is the end of the quarter, based on current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity and maintaining significant liquidity after we do that. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. 
On a very positive note, the commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings picked up substantially this quarter. Quarterly bookings ran ahead of the strong shipments. Recoveries are often not straight upwardly -- upward lines, and we could still see bumps, but it's good to see a strong quarter like this. 
As I've said before, we see a number of factors that should contribute to continuing commercial transport aftermarket growth this year. Passenger traffic remained strong, slowdown in retirements and potential end to the deferral inventory cycle. On the other hand, though much smaller in our revenues, the business jet and freighter aftermarkets could be weakening.
Turning to Q2 fiscal year '16 and year-to-date performance and I remind you, this is the second quarter for '16 our year started October 1. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be impacted by differences in mix, inventory fluctuation, seasonality and things like that. 
Total company GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong, both for the Q2 and year-to-date. For Q2, the revenues were up 29% versus the prior Q2 and 24% versus the prior year-to-date. EBITDA As Defined was up about the same percent as the revenues. Overall, organic revenues were up in the 4% to 5% range versus the prior year. Commercial revenues were up a bit more, while defense was modestly down. Defense bookings, on the other hand, ran well ahead of the shipments. EBITDA As Defined, dollars and margin percent were both strong.
To review the revenues by market category, again this is on a pro forma or same-store kind of a basis versus the prior year, and this is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial -- or the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were about flat for Q2 versus both the prior year-to-date and versus the prior year Q2. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the vast majority of our commercial OEM revenues, are up 2% versus the prior year-to-date. Q2 was flat versus a difficult comp in the prior year. We saw some modest inventory adjustments in certain commercial transport OEM Tier 1 accounts. Year-to-date, commercial transport bookings are running slightly ahead of revenues. The biz jet and helicopter OEM revenues are a much smaller percent of our business and are heavily biz jet weighted. In total, revenues in these markets were about flat versus the prior year Q2 and due to the weak Q1, down about 6% year-to-date. Business jet bookings for Q2 were slightly ahead of shipments. The biz jet market in total seems a little weaker than we originally anticipated.
Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 13% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, the commercial transport aftermarket is now up a little more than the overall average, and the business jet helicopter and freighter markets are flat to slightly down. For the quarter, total commercial aftermarket bookings were modestly above shipments. Commercial transport bookings were up 16% in Q2 versus the prior Q2. Biz jet, helicopter and other bookings were modestly down in Q2 versus the prior year Q2. But I'd remind you again, these other categories are far smaller than the commercial transport. 
The defense aftermarket makes up about 30% of our revenue. Defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q2 were down 3% versus the prior Q2 and down about 1% on a year-to-date basis. The revenues by product lines were spotty with no clear patterns. However, as I said before, year-to-date bookings are running ahead of shipments. They're running about 11% ahead of shipments with a very strong quarter of bookings in Q2. 
Moving on to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q2 were noncash compensation expense and acquisition-related costs or amortizations. EBITDA As Defined of about $396 million for Q2 was up 28% versus the prior quarter -- prior Q2 and $688 million or up 23% on a year-to-date basis. The EBITDA As Defined margin was 46.5% of the revenue for Q2 and 46% year-to-date. This is about the same margin percents as last year in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.
As we mentioned last quarter, we've reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5%. In Q1, this combined with our other value drivers contributes to the strong margins. 
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities strengthened from the last quarter, and we are seeing more activity recently. Closings are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I've said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see increasing variability in various industry forecast, and by platform, the news is somewhat mixed. In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well. And as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact demand. As I also said, the biz jet and freighter markets could be a little softer than we originally anticipated. Recoveries don't always run in a straight line, so we tend to be a little cautious. 
All in all, this is our best estimate for the full year. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond Breeze in fiscal year 2016, the guidance is as follows: the midpoint of the 2016 revenue guidance is $3.17 billion. This is the same as our prior guidance. We've tightened the range up a little. It's up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.46 billion, an increase of about $25 million. This is up 18% year-over-year. The increase in guidance is driven by improvements in our EBITDA margin. The base business, that is excluding the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up around 2 points versus 2015 for the same mix of business -- businesses. The recent acquisition margins are running a bit ahead of our private -- prior estimates. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $11.16 per share or up $0.39 a share from our last guidance. This is up 24% versus prior year. The increase in guidance is due to 2 factors, improved margins and a modestly lower share count as a result of our buybacks. Terry will run through some of the details.
On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket growth in the mid- to high-single digits. We're still somewhat cautious but obviously feel better than we did 90 days ago. In the defense military revenue, growth in the low single-digit percent were slightly down year-to-date, but the strong year-to-date bookings and the strong Q2 bookings give us some confidence here. Commercial OEM revenues, we see growth in the low to mid-single-digit percent range. We're still assuming commercial transport shipments will be slightly up, but we're concerned that the biz jet shipments for the year could be flat to modestly down. We also expect to see a modest decrease in freighter revenue for the year based on the announced 747 rate decrease.
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.1 billion in cash and over $400 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016 -- excuse me, $500 million. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activity, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9x EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down about 1 full turn.
In summary, Q2 was a good quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are still a little unclear, and that makes us cautious. However, we think we still may have some modest margin upside to help offset any market variations. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and a strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our shareholders.
And with that, let me turn this over to Kevin."

Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good second quarter. As we have stated previously, we believe our planning processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year. For an update on our acquisition-related value driver, let me give you an update on the last acquisitions we accomplished. 
To this point, let me once again provide some color to our acquisition strategy. As we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes an implementation of our value-creation process and metrics; restructuring the company into our business unit focus groups; focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business; and finally, we tightened up cost -- the cost structure. 
For Telair. This was a significant acquisition in early 2015 for TransDigm and focuses on the defense and commercial cargo markets. To date, the acquisition is on track on its integration path and has delivered sales and EBITDA in excess of our model. In general, the defense market has performed well for us in this business, but the freight market may be beginning to soften. We remain confident that this is a fine business for TransDigm.
Additionally, we closed on Pexco in May of 2015, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used in the galleys, lavatories, floors, ceilings and storage bins of aircraft. Today, Pexco Aerospace is performing at our expectations across all key financial and growth metrics with a strong focus on our value-generation strategy. The team successfully closed and completed the consolidation of the manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach with minimal customer disruption. While implementing a largely new management team at Pexco, we have realized better-than-expected productivity results with all of our manufacturing activities now under one roof. With performance on our value drivers ahead of plan, we currently are finding sales and EBITDA are additionally running ahead of plan. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will continue to run at expectations.
In August of 2015, we finalized the acquisition of PneuDraulics into the TransDigm family. PneuDraulics is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, about 16 miles east of Los Angeles. PneuDraulics' highly engineered and proprietary products primarily are valves, actuators and subsystem components used in hydraulic and pneumatic applications. PneuDraulics serves all of the major markets in aerospace, including commercial, regional, business jet and defense markets. 
We were confident when we acquired PneuDraulics that it was a solid business with an excellent management team. This has proven to be the case as the management team has proven to be fast adopters of the TransDigm value-drivers culture. The integration of PneuDraulics is going according to plan. The company's performance has met or beat expectations for the 3 value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. Although we have experienced some softness in the business jet market, the commercial aerospace market is currently holding up well. And our EBITDA, driven by our value-driver concept, has exceeded our expectations. In general, we are pleased with the results and expect this business to be a solid acquisition and a good company for TransDigm in the future.
Lastly, Breeze-Eastern was acquired by TransDigm on January 4, 2016. Breeze, which is located in Whippany, New Jersey, designs and manufactures mission-critical electromechanical systems. The main products consist of rescue hoists, cargo hooks and winches, primarily for rescue helicopters and cargo aircraft. Approximately 75% of Breeze revenue comes from the defense sector, and approximately 70% of it comes from the aftermarket. 
In the first 90 days since the acquisition, we have established a new leadership team comprised of both existing Breeze-Eastern employees as well as experienced TransDigm personnel. We have also taken productivity actions to better align the size of the organization with the level of business activity which will increase overall value, including the announcement of the consolidation of the Virginia facility into the main campus by late calendar year 2016. We are also realigning the business into our usual customer-focused business unit teams to enhance operational performance and responsiveness. These changes will be completed during the second half of our fiscal year as we align the financial reports with these 2 business units and we physically co-locate the team personnel within the facility. These changes will support and accelerate new product development activities as the teams are beginning to focus on rapidly bringing advanced hoist and winch technologies to market. To date, the Breeze-Eastern acquisition has delivered value as expected for TransDigm shareholders with revenue and EBITDA as expected. 
To update on the recent progress of our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to 3 recent wins we have received in the aerospace market. AvtechTyee recently was awarded significant bookings across multiple configurations of a recently upgraded sealed audio control panel used on the Boeing 737 Next Generation. The bulk of these orders were primarily to satisfy initial provisioning of spares by airlines with upcoming deliveries from Boeing. The bookings also included upgraded sealed audio control panels with satellite communication functionality. This functionality enables the flight crew to directly dial and connect to any phone number around the world through existing satellite communication networks in areas where HF and VHF radio functions can be unreliable.
Next, at PneuDraulics, we were awarded components in 4 major hydraulic system areas by Textron Aviation for the Cessna longitude program. PneuDraulics was awarded hydraulic components for spoiler actuation, brake systems, landing gear and central hydraulic systems. Additionally, this represents the largest total ship set award for PneuDraulics to date. 24 discrete components were awarded per aircraft with a forecasted build rate of 36 aircraft per year at peak and a production launch in the next couple of years. 
Lastly, Aero Fluid Products has won an exciting new program for the A320neo. The Painesville, Ohio-based team was awarded the oil control manifold for this new program. The OCM is an aluminum block mounted on the main engine gearbox that contains multiple valves, openings and sensors that control the temperatures and pressures of the engine oil. This is a growth award as the team did not enjoy this business on the A320 legacy platform. 
Finally, I wanted to bring your attention to one of our key business planning processes. Last time, I updated all of you on our succession-planning process. Given the time in the fiscal year, I now wanted to update on our fiscal year '17 planning process, which we have just kicked off. This process gives us an excellent glimpse of the aerospace market for commercial and defense applications. This process is a bottoms-up forecast done by each of our individual product lines, rolling up to business units then the entire company with a focused emphasis on our TransDigm value drivers of productivity, value-based pricing and new business. This process, which is the foundation of our fiscal year guidance that we provide to the market each year, begins with a lot of hard work by each individual business unit and culminates with focused reviews of each of our 31-plus operating companies and about 80 business unit teams throughout the back end of our fourth quarter. We believe this granular bottoms-up database review is the best way we know of to compile market intelligence and provide guidance to our shareholders. It has served us well and allowed us to generally be quite accurate in our annual guidance and internal planning.
With that, now let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail. Terry?"

[Audio Gap] 
Second quarter net sales were $797 million or approximately 29% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics, Breeze and Franke was an increase of $150 million. Organic sales were up approximately 4.5%, driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $426 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was almost 2 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of over 3 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved about 1.5 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure as well as favorable mix from strong commercial aftermarket sales. Additionally, gross profit margins improved over 0.5 point sequentially, excluding all acquisition activity. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.9% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12% in the prior year. Excluding the acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $11 million versus the prior year quarter. This was the result of an increase in -- to our outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was to fund acquisitions we did in fiscal 2015. 
Our effective tax rate was 31% in the current quarter compared to 29.2% in the prior year. The higher effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to a favorable discrete adjustment in the prior year related to finalizing IRS audits related to fiscal 2012 and 2013. Our expected full year estimated tax rate is still to be expected to be 31%. We now expect our cash taxes to be around $210 million for fiscal 2016. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $28 million or 25% to $139 million, which is 17.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $111 million or 17.9% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher interest expense and acquisition-related costs versus the prior period. GAAP EPS was $2.47 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.96 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.86 per share, an increase of 35.5% compared to $2.11 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $612 million of cash. I want to remind you that during the quarter, we paid $146 million for the Breeze acquisition, net of $31 million of cash acquired. We also spent $137 million to purchase approximately 692,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, in total this year, we have purchased just over 1 million shares at a total cost of $208 million. We now expect our full year weighted average shares to be 56.2 million. 
The company's net leverage ratio at the quarter end was 5.6x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and the gross leverage was 6x pro forma EBITDA As Defined. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016, will be 4.9x, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.01. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.16. The $1.15 of adjustments that bridge GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend-equivalent payments, $0.57 from noncash stock option expense and $0.53 of acquisition-related expenses.
Now I'll hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

22800180,332688714,980310,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 10, 2016",2016-05-10,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Good morning, and thanks to everybody for calling in. Today, as usual, I will start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview then of fiscal year '16, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance",1963,"Good morning, and thanks to everybody for calling in. Today, as usual, I will start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview then of fiscal year '16, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance for the year. Kevin is then going to update you on some operating items, and Terry will run through the financials for the quarter.
To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, that is products for which we own the intellectual property. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margin, TransDigm has year in and year out generated very strong free cash flow. This gives us lots of operating and financial flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have a well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value-driver concept. We maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to PE, or private equity-like, returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. 
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. We basically have 4: first, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; third is to give extra money back to the shareholders either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly is to pay off debt. Now given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice. Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the equity returns.
Now to update you on a few items from this quarter. The credit markets, at least as of today, have firmed up nicely in the last quarter. Our bonds and secured debt are trading roughly at par. We have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent with those we pay now. 
In the first 6 months of the year, we bought back about 1 million shares of TransDigm stock at an average price of $205 a share. Almost all of this occurred in the December through February time frame. We currently have an additional $340 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything of our buyback plans. At 4/2/16, which is the end of the quarter, based on current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity and maintaining significant liquidity after we do that. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. 
On a very positive note, the commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings picked up substantially this quarter. Quarterly bookings ran ahead of the strong shipments. Recoveries are often not straight upwardly -- upward lines, and we could still see bumps, but it's good to see a strong quarter like this. 
As I've said before, we see a number of factors that should contribute to continuing commercial transport aftermarket growth this year. Passenger traffic remained strong, slowdown in retirements and potential end to the deferral or inventory cycle. On the other hand, though much smaller in our revenues, the business jet and freighter aftermarkets could be weakening.
Turning to Q2 fiscal year '16 and year-to-date performance and I remind you, this is the second quarter for '16, our year started October 1. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be impacted by differences in mix, inventory fluctuation, seasonality and things like that. 
Total company GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong, both for the Q2 and year-to-date. For Q2, the revenues were up 29% versus the prior Q2 and 24% versus the prior year-to-date. EBITDA As Defined was up about the same percent as the revenues. Overall, organic revenues were up in the 4% to 5% range versus the prior year. Commercial revenues were up a bit more, while defense was modestly down. Defense bookings, on the other hand, ran well ahead of the shipments. EBITDA As Defined, dollars and margin percent were both strong.
To review the revenues by market category, again this is on a pro forma or same-store kind of a basis versus the prior year, and this is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial -- or the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were about flat for Q2 versus both the prior year-to-date and versus the prior year Q2. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the vast majority of our commercial OEM revenues, are up 2% versus the prior year-to-date. Q2 was flat versus a difficult comp in the prior year. We saw some modest inventory adjustments in certain commercial transport OEM Tier 1 accounts. Year-to-date, commercial transport bookings are running slightly ahead of revenues. The biz jet and helicopter OEM revenues are a much smaller percent of our business and are heavily biz jet weighted. In total, revenues in these markets were about flat versus the prior year Q2 and due to the weak Q1, down about 6% year-to-date. Business jet bookings for Q2 were slightly ahead of shipments. The biz jet market in total seems a little weaker than we originally anticipated.
Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 13% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, the commercial transport aftermarket is now up a little more than the overall average, and the business jet helicopter and freighter markets are flat to slightly down. For the quarter, total commercial aftermarket bookings were modestly above shipments. Commercial transport bookings were up 16% in Q2 versus the prior Q2. Biz jet, helicopter and other bookings were modestly down in Q2 versus the prior year Q2. But I'd remind you again, these other categories are far smaller than the commercial transport. 
The defense aftermarket makes up about 30% of our revenue. Defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q2 were down 3% versus the prior Q2 and down about 1% on a year-to-date basis. The revenues by product lines were spotty with no clear patterns. However, as I said before, year-to-date bookings are running ahead of shipments. They're running about 11% ahead of shipments with a very strong quarter of bookings in Q2. 
Moving on to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q2 were noncash compensation expense and acquisition-related costs or amortizations. EBITDA As Defined of about $396 million for Q2 was up 28% versus the prior quarter -- prior Q2 and $688 million or up 23% on a year-to-date basis. The EBITDA As Defined margin was 46.5% of the revenue for Q2 and 46% year-to-date. This is about the same margin percents as last year in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.
As we mentioned last quarter, we've reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5%. In Q1, this combined with our other value drivers contributes to the strong margins. 
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities strengthened from the last quarter, and we are seeing more activity recently. Closings are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I've said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see increasing variability in various industry forecast, and by platform, the news is somewhat mixed. In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well. And as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact demand. As I also said, the biz jet and freighter markets could be a little softer than we originally anticipated. Recoveries don't always run in a straight line, so we tend to be a little cautious. 
All in all, this is our best estimate for the full year. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond Breeze in fiscal year 2016, the guidance is as follows: the midpoint of the 2016 revenue guidance is $3.17 billion. This is the same as our prior guidance. We've tightened the range up a little. It's up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.46 billion, an increase of about $25 million. This is up 18% year-over-year. The increase in guidance is driven by improvements in our EBITDA margin. The base business, that is excluding the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up around 2 points versus 2015 for the same mix of business -- businesses. The recent acquisition margins are running a bit ahead of our private -- prior estimates. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $11.16 per share or up $0.39 a share from our last guidance. This is up 24% versus prior year. The increase in guidance is due to 2 factors, improved margins and a modestly lower share count as a result of our buybacks. Terry will run through some of the details.
On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket growth in the mid- to high-single digits. We're still somewhat cautious but obviously feel better than we did 90 days ago. In the defense military revenue, growth in the low single-digit percent were slightly down year-to-date, but the strong year-to-date bookings and the strong Q2 bookings give us some confidence here. Commercial OEM revenues, we see growth in the low to mid-single-digit percent range. We're still assuming commercial transport shipments will be slightly up, but we're concerned that the biz jet shipments for the year could be flat to modestly down. We also expect to see a modest decrease in freighter revenue for the year based on the announced 747 rate decrease.
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.1 billion in cash and over $400 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016 -- excuse me, $500 million. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activity, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9x EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down about 1 full turn.
In summary, Q2 was a good quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are still a little unclear, and that makes us cautious. However, we think we still may have some modest margin upside to help offset any market variations. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and a strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our shareholders.
And with that, let me turn this over to Kevin."

Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good second quarter. As we have stated previously, we believe our planning processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year. For an update on our acquisition-related value driver, let me give you an update on the last acquisitions we accomplished. 
To this point, let me once again provide some color to our acquisition strategy. As we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes an implementation of our value-creation process and metrics; restructuring the company into our business unit focus groups; focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business; and finally, we tightened up cost -- the cost structure. 
For Telair. This was a significant acquisition in early 2015 for TransDigm and focuses on the defense and commercial cargo markets. To date, the acquisition is on track on its integration path and has delivered sales and EBITDA in excess of our model. In general, the defense market has performed well for us in this business, but the freight market may be beginning to soften. We remain confident that this is a fine business for TransDigm.
Additionally, we closed on Pexco in May of 2015, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used in the galleys, lavatories, floors, ceilings and storage bins of aircraft. Today, Pexco Aerospace is performing at our expectations across all key financial and growth metrics with a strong focus on our value-generation strategy. The team successfully closed and completed the consolidation of the manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach with minimal customer disruption. While implementing a largely new management team at Pexco, we have realized better-than-expected productivity results with all of our manufacturing activities now under one roof. With performance on our value drivers ahead of plan, we currently are finding sales and EBITDA are additionally running ahead of plan. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will continue to run at expectations.
In August of 2015, we finalized the acquisition of PneuDraulics into the TransDigm family. PneuDraulics is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, about 16 miles east of Los Angeles. PneuDraulics' highly engineered and proprietary products primarily are valves, actuators and subsystem components used in hydraulic and pneumatic applications. PneuDraulics serves all of the major markets in aerospace, including commercial, regional, business jet and defense markets. 
We were confident when we acquired PneuDraulics that it was a solid business with an excellent management team. This has proven to be the case as the management team has proven to be fast adopters of the TransDigm value-drivers culture. The integration of PneuDraulics is going according to plan. The company's performance has met or beat expectations for the 3 value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. Although we have experienced some softness in the business jet market, the commercial aerospace market is currently holding up well. And our EBITDA, driven by our value-driver concept, has exceeded our expectations. In general, we are pleased with the results and expect this business to be a solid acquisition and a good company for TransDigm in the future.
Lastly, Breeze-Eastern was acquired by TransDigm on January 4, 2016. Breeze, which is located in Whippany, New Jersey, designs and manufactures mission-critical electromechanical systems. The main products consist of rescue hoists, cargo hooks and winches, primarily for rescue helicopters and cargo aircraft. Approximately 75% of Breeze revenue comes from the defense sector, and approximately 70% of it comes from the aftermarket. 
In the first 90 days since the acquisition, we have established a new leadership team comprised of both existing Breeze-Eastern employees as well as experienced TransDigm personnel. We have also taken productivity actions to better align the size of the organization with the level of business activity which will increase overall value, including the announcement of the consolidation of the Virginia facility into the main campus by late calendar year 2016. We are also realigning the business into our usual customer-focused business unit teams to enhance operational performance and responsiveness. These changes will be completed during the second half of our fiscal year as we align the financial reports with these 2 business units and we physically co-locate the team personnel within the facility. These changes will support and accelerate new product development activities as the teams are beginning to focus on rapidly bringing advanced hoist and winch technologies to market. To date, the Breeze-Eastern acquisition has delivered value as expected for TransDigm shareholders with revenue and EBITDA as expected. 
To update on the recent progress of our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to 3 recent wins we have received in the aerospace market. AvtechTyee recently was awarded significant bookings across multiple configurations of a recently upgraded sealed audio control panel used on the Boeing 737 Next Generation. The bulk of these orders were primarily to satisfy initial provisioning of spares by airlines with upcoming deliveries from Boeing. The bookings also included upgraded sealed audio control panels with satellite communication functionality. This functionality enables the flight crew to directly dial and connect to any phone number around the world through existing satellite communication networks in areas where HF and VHF radio functions can be unreliable.
Next, at PneuDraulics, we were awarded components in 4 major hydraulic system areas by Textron Aviation for the Cessna longitude program. PneuDraulics was awarded hydraulic components for spoiler actuation, brake systems, landing gear and central hydraulic systems. Additionally, this represents the largest total ship set award for PneuDraulics to date. 24 discrete components were awarded per aircraft with a forecasted build rate of 36 aircraft per year at peak and a production launch in the next couple of years. 
Lastly, Aero Fluid Products has won an exciting new program for the A320neo. The Painesville, Ohio-based team was awarded the oil control manifold for this new program. The OCM is an aluminum block mounted on the main engine gearbox that contains multiple valves, openings and sensors that control the temperatures and pressures of the engine oil. This is a growth award as the team did not enjoy this business on the A320 legacy platform. 
Finally, I wanted to bring your attention to one of our key business planning processes. Last time, I updated all of you on our succession-planning process. Given the time in the fiscal year, I now wanted to update on our fiscal year '17 planning process, which we have just kicked off. This process gives us an excellent glimpse of the aerospace market for commercial and defense applications. This process is a bottoms-up forecast done by each of our individual product lines, rolling up to business units, then the entire company, with a focused emphasis on our TransDigm value drivers of productivity, value-based pricing and new business. This process, which is the foundation of our fiscal year guidance that we provide to the market each year, begins with a lot of hard work by each individual business unit and culminates with focused reviews of each of our 31-plus operating companies and about 80 business unit teams throughout the back end of our fourth quarter. We believe this granular bottoms-up database review is the best way we know of to compile market intelligence and provide guidance to our shareholders. It has served us well and allowed us to generally be quite accurate in our annual guidance and internal planning.
With that, now let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail. Terry?"

[Audio Gap] 
Second quarter net sales were $797 million or approximately 29% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics, Breeze and Franke was an increase of $150 million. Organic sales were up approximately 4.5%, driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $426 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was almost 2 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of over 3 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved about 1.5 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure as well as favorable mix from strong commercial aftermarket sales. Additionally, gross profit margins improved over 0.5 point sequentially, excluding all acquisition activity. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.9% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12% in the prior year. Excluding the acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $11 million versus the prior year quarter. This was the result of an increase in -- to our outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was to fund acquisitions we did in fiscal 2015. 
Our effective tax rate was 31% in the current quarter compared to 29.2% in the prior year. The higher effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to a favorable discrete adjustment in the prior year related to finalizing IRS audits related to fiscal 2012 and 2013. Our expected full year estimated tax rate is still to be -- expected to be 31%. We now expect our cash taxes to be around $210 million for fiscal 2016. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $28 million or 25% to $139 million, which is 17.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $111 million or 17.9% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher interest expense and acquisition-related costs versus the prior period. GAAP EPS was $2.47 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.96 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.86 per share, an increase of 35.5% compared to $2.11 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $612 million of cash. I want to remind you that during the quarter, we paid $146 million for the Breeze acquisition, net of $31 million of cash acquired. We also spent $137 million to purchase approximately 692,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, in total this year, we have purchased just over 1 million shares at a total cost of $208 million. We now expect our full year weighted average shares to be 56.2 million. 
The company's net leverage ratio at the quarter end was 5.6x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and the gross leverage was 6x pro forma EBITDA As Defined. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016, will be 4.9x, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.01. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.16. The $1.15 of adjustments that bridge GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend-equivalent payments, $0.57 from noncash stock option expense and $0.53 of acquisition-related expenses.
Now I'll hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

Today, as usual, I will start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview then of fiscal year '16, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance",1963,"Good morning, and thanks to everybody for calling in. Today, as usual, I will start with some comments on the consistency of our strategy, an overview then of fiscal year '16, both the second quarter and year-to-date performance. We'll update the guidance for the year. Kevin is then going to update you on some operating items, and Terry will run through the financials for the quarter.
To restate, we believe our model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, that is products for which we own the intellectual property. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA comes from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margin, TransDigm has year in and year out generated very strong free cash flow. This gives us lots of operating and financial flexibility. We follow a consistent long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. We have a well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value-driver concept. We maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. We acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to PE, or private equity-like, returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. 
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. We basically have 4: first, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; third is to give extra money back to the shareholders either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly is to pay off debt. Now given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice. Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the equity returns.
Now to update you on a few items from this quarter. The credit markets, at least as of today, have firmed up nicely in the last quarter. Our bonds and secured debt are trading roughly at par. We have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent with those we pay now. 
In the first 6 months of the year, we bought back about 1 million shares of TransDigm stock at an average price of $205 a share. Almost all of this occurred in the December through February time frame. We currently have an additional $340 million of repurchase authorized. This authorization does not imply anything of our buyback plans. At 4/2/16, which is the end of the quarter, based on current capital market conditions, we believe we have adequate capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing any additional equity and maintaining significant liquidity after we do that. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. 
On a very positive note, the commercial aftermarket revenues and bookings picked up substantially this quarter. Quarterly bookings ran ahead of the strong shipments. Recoveries are often not straight upwardly -- upward lines, and we could still see bumps, but it's good to see a strong quarter like this. 
As I've said before, we see a number of factors that should contribute to continuing commercial transport aftermarket growth this year. Passenger traffic remained strong, slowdown in retirements and potential end to the deferral or inventory cycle. On the other hand, though much smaller in our revenues, the business jet and freighter aftermarkets could be weakening.
Turning to Q2 fiscal year '16 and year-to-date performance and I remind you, this is the second quarter for '16, our year started October 1. As I have said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be impacted by differences in mix, inventory fluctuation, seasonality and things like that. 
Total company GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong, both for the Q2 and year-to-date. For Q2, the revenues were up 29% versus the prior Q2 and 24% versus the prior year-to-date. EBITDA As Defined was up about the same percent as the revenues. Overall, organic revenues were up in the 4% to 5% range versus the prior year. Commercial revenues were up a bit more, while defense was modestly down. Defense bookings, on the other hand, ran well ahead of the shipments. EBITDA As Defined, dollars and margin percent were both strong.
To review the revenues by market category, again this is on a pro forma or same-store kind of a basis versus the prior year, and this is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial -- or the commercial market, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were about flat for Q2 versus both the prior year-to-date and versus the prior year Q2. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up the vast majority of our commercial OEM revenues, are up 2% versus the prior year-to-date. Q2 was flat versus a difficult comp in the prior year. We saw some modest inventory adjustments in certain commercial transport OEM Tier 1 accounts. Year-to-date, commercial transport bookings are running slightly ahead of revenues. The biz jet and helicopter OEM revenues are a much smaller percent of our business and are heavily biz jet weighted. In total, revenues in these markets were about flat versus the prior year Q2 and due to the weak Q1, down about 6% year-to-date. Business jet bookings for Q2 were slightly ahead of shipments. The biz jet market in total seems a little weaker than we originally anticipated.
Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 13% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis, the commercial transport aftermarket is now up a little more than the overall average, and the business jet helicopter and freighter markets are flat to slightly down. For the quarter, total commercial aftermarket bookings were modestly above shipments. Commercial transport bookings were up 16% in Q2 versus the prior Q2. Biz jet, helicopter and other bookings were modestly down in Q2 versus the prior year Q2. But I'd remind you again, these other categories are far smaller than the commercial transport. 
The defense aftermarket makes up about 30% of our revenue. Defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q2 were down 3% versus the prior Q2 and down about 1% on a year-to-date basis. The revenues by product lines were spotty with no clear patterns. However, as I said before, year-to-date bookings are running ahead of shipments. They're running about 11% ahead of shipments with a very strong quarter of bookings in Q2. 
Moving on to profitability and on a reported basis, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q2 were noncash compensation expense and acquisition-related costs or amortizations. EBITDA As Defined of about $396 million for Q2 was up 28% versus the prior quarter -- prior Q2 and $688 million or up 23% on a year-to-date basis. The EBITDA As Defined margin was 46.5% of the revenue for Q2 and 46% year-to-date. This is about the same margin percents as last year in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions.
As we mentioned last quarter, we've reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5%. In Q1, this combined with our other value drivers contributes to the strong margins. 
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities strengthened from the last quarter, and we are seeing more activity recently. Closings are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As I've said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see increasing variability in various industry forecast, and by platform, the news is somewhat mixed. In the commercial aftermarket, air travel is holding up well. And as I mentioned, there are other factors that should positively impact demand. As I also said, the biz jet and freighter markets could be a little softer than we originally anticipated. Recoveries don't always run in a straight line, so we tend to be a little cautious. 
All in all, this is our best estimate for the full year. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond Breeze in fiscal year 2016, the guidance is as follows: the midpoint of the 2016 revenue guidance is $3.17 billion. This is the same as our prior guidance. We've tightened the range up a little. It's up 17% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is $1.46 billion, an increase of about $25 million. This is up 18% year-over-year. The increase in guidance is driven by improvements in our EBITDA margin. The base business, that is excluding the 2015 and 2016 acquisitions, is still anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up around 2 points versus 2015 for the same mix of business -- businesses. The recent acquisition margins are running a bit ahead of our private -- prior estimates. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is now anticipated to be $11.16 per share or up $0.39 a share from our last guidance. This is up 24% versus prior year. The increase in guidance is due to 2 factors, improved margins and a modestly lower share count as a result of our buybacks. Terry will run through some of the details.
On a pro forma or same-store basis, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket growth in the mid- to high-single digits. We're still somewhat cautious but obviously feel better than we did 90 days ago. In the defense military revenue, growth in the low single-digit percent were slightly down year-to-date, but the strong year-to-date bookings and the strong Q2 bookings give us some confidence here. Commercial OEM revenues, we see growth in the low to mid-single-digit percent range. We're still assuming commercial transport shipments will be slightly up, but we're concerned that the biz jet shipments for the year could be flat to modestly down. We also expect to see a modest decrease in freighter revenue for the year based on the announced 747 rate decrease.
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.1 billion in cash and over $400 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2016 -- excuse me, $500 million. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activity, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 4.9x EBITDA at the end of 2016 or down about 1 full turn.
In summary, Q2 was a good quarter. As we look to the balance of the year, the market conditions are still a little unclear, and that makes us cautious. However, we think we still may have some modest margin upside to help offset any market variations. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and a strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our shareholders.
And with that, let me turn this over to Kevin."

Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good second quarter. As we have stated previously, we believe our planning processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year. For an update on our acquisition-related value driver, let me give you an update on the last acquisitions we accomplished. 
To this point, let me once again provide some color to our acquisition strategy. As we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes an implementation of our value-creation process and metrics; restructuring the company into our business unit focus groups; focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business; and finally, we tightened up cost -- the cost structure. 
For Telair. This was a significant acquisition in early 2015 for TransDigm and focuses on the defense and commercial cargo markets. To date, the acquisition is on track on its integration path and has delivered sales and EBITDA in excess of our model. In general, the defense market has performed well for us in this business, but the freight market may be beginning to soften. We remain confident that this is a fine business for TransDigm.
Additionally, we closed on Pexco in May of 2015, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used in the galleys, lavatories, floors, ceilings and storage bins of aircraft. Today, Pexco Aerospace is performing at our expectations across all key financial and growth metrics with a strong focus on our value-generation strategy. The team successfully closed and completed the consolidation of the manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach with minimal customer disruption. While implementing a largely new management team at Pexco, we have realized better-than-expected productivity results with all of our manufacturing activities now under one roof. With performance on our value drivers ahead of plan, we currently are finding sales and EBITDA are additionally running ahead of plan. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will continue to run at expectations.
In August of 2015, we finalized the acquisition of PneuDraulics into the TransDigm family. PneuDraulics is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California, about 16 miles east of Los Angeles. PneuDraulics' highly engineered and proprietary products primarily are valves, actuators and subsystem components used in hydraulic and pneumatic applications. PneuDraulics serves all of the major markets in aerospace, including commercial, regional, business jet and defense markets. 
We were confident when we acquired PneuDraulics that it was a solid business with an excellent management team. This has proven to be the case as the management team has proven to be fast adopters of the TransDigm value-drivers culture. The integration of PneuDraulics is going according to plan. The company's performance has met or beat expectations for the 3 value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. Although we have experienced some softness in the business jet market, the commercial aerospace market is currently holding up well. And our EBITDA, driven by our value-driver concept, has exceeded our expectations. In general, we are pleased with the results and expect this business to be a solid acquisition and a good company for TransDigm in the future.
Lastly, Breeze-Eastern was acquired by TransDigm on January 4, 2016. Breeze, which is located in Whippany, New Jersey, designs and manufactures mission-critical electromechanical systems. The main products consist of rescue hoists, cargo hooks and winches, primarily for rescue helicopters and cargo aircraft. Approximately 75% of Breeze revenue comes from the defense sector, and approximately 70% of it comes from the aftermarket. 
In the first 90 days since the acquisition, we have established a new leadership team comprised of both existing Breeze-Eastern employees as well as experienced TransDigm personnel. We have also taken productivity actions to better align the size of the organization with the level of business activity which will increase overall value, including the announcement of the consolidation of the Virginia facility into the main campus by late calendar year 2016. We are also realigning the business into our usual customer-focused business unit teams to enhance operational performance and responsiveness. These changes will be completed during the second half of our fiscal year as we align the financial reports with these 2 business units and we physically co-locate the team personnel within the facility. These changes will support and accelerate new product development activities as the teams are beginning to focus on rapidly bringing advanced hoist and winch technologies to market. To date, the Breeze-Eastern acquisition has delivered value as expected for TransDigm shareholders with revenue and EBITDA as expected. 
To update on the recent progress of our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to 3 recent wins we have received in the aerospace market. AvtechTyee recently was awarded significant bookings across multiple configurations of a recently upgraded sealed audio control panel used on the Boeing 737 Next Generation. The bulk of these orders were primarily to satisfy initial provisioning of spares by airlines with upcoming deliveries from Boeing. The bookings also included upgraded sealed audio control panels with satellite communication functionality. This functionality enables the flight crew to directly dial and connect to any phone number around the world through existing satellite communication networks in areas where HF and VHF radio functions can be unreliable.
Next, at PneuDraulics, we were awarded components in 4 major hydraulic system areas by Textron Aviation for the Cessna longitude program. PneuDraulics was awarded hydraulic components for spoiler actuation, brake systems, landing gear and central hydraulic systems. Additionally, this represents the largest total ship set award for PneuDraulics to date. 24 discrete components were awarded per aircraft with a forecasted build rate of 36 aircraft per year at peak and a production launch in the next couple of years. 
Lastly, Aero Fluid Products has won an exciting new program for the A320neo. The Painesville, Ohio-based team was awarded the oil control manifold for this new program. The OCM is an aluminum block mounted on the main engine gearbox that contains multiple valves, openings and sensors that control the temperatures and pressures of the engine oil. This is a growth award as the team did not enjoy this business on the A320 legacy platform. 
Finally, I wanted to bring your attention to one of our key business planning processes. Last time, I updated all of you on our succession-planning process. Given the time in the fiscal year, I now wanted to update on our fiscal year '17 planning process, which we have just kicked off. This process gives us an excellent glimpse of the aerospace market for commercial and defense applications. This process is a bottoms-up forecast done by each of our individual product lines, rolling up to business units, then the entire company, with a focused emphasis on our TransDigm value drivers of productivity, value-based pricing and new business. This process, which is the foundation of our fiscal year guidance that we provide to the market each year, begins with a lot of hard work by each individual business unit and culminates with focused reviews of each of our 31-plus operating companies and about 80 business unit teams throughout the back end of our fourth quarter. We believe this granular bottoms-up database review is the best way we know of to compile market intelligence and provide guidance to our shareholders. It has served us well and allowed us to generally be quite accurate in our annual guidance and internal planning.
With that, now let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail. Terry?"

[Audio Gap] 
Second quarter net sales were $797 million or approximately 29% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of the acquisitions Telair, Pexco, PneuDraulics, Breeze and Franke was an increase of $150 million. Organic sales were up approximately 4.5%, driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. 
Our first quarter gross profit was $426 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 53.4% was almost 2 margin points lower than the prior year. This quarter's decline in margin was due to the dilutive impact from acquisition mix and higher acquisition-related costs, which accounted for a decrease of over 3 margin points. Excluding all acquisition activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining business versus the prior year quarter improved about 1.5 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure as well as favorable mix from strong commercial aftermarket sales. Additionally, gross profit margins improved over 0.5 point sequentially, excluding all acquisition activity. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.9% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12% in the prior year. Excluding the acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago. We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $11 million versus the prior year quarter. This was the result of an increase in -- to our outstanding borrowings of $900 million in the current quarter versus the prior year. The increase in outstanding borrowings was to fund acquisitions we did in fiscal 2015. 
Our effective tax rate was 31% in the current quarter compared to 29.2% in the prior year. The higher effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to a favorable discrete adjustment in the prior year related to finalizing IRS audits related to fiscal 2012 and 2013. Our expected full year estimated tax rate is still to be -- expected to be 31%. We now expect our cash taxes to be around $210 million for fiscal 2016. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $28 million or 25% to $139 million, which is 17.4% of sales. This compares to net income of $111 million or 17.9% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher interest expense and acquisition-related costs versus the prior period. GAAP EPS was $2.47 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.96 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $2.86 per share, an increase of 35.5% compared to $2.11 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $612 million of cash. I want to remind you that during the quarter, we paid $146 million for the Breeze acquisition, net of $31 million of cash acquired. We also spent $137 million to purchase approximately 692,000 shares in the quarter. As Nick mentioned, in total this year, we have purchased just over 1 million shares at a total cost of $208 million. We now expect our full year weighted average shares to be 56.2 million. 
The company's net leverage ratio at the quarter end was 5.6x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and the gross leverage was 6x pro forma EBITDA As Defined. We estimate our net leverage at September 30, 2016, will be 4.9x, assuming no acquisitions or capital market transactions. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.01. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.16. The $1.15 of adjustments that bridge GAAP to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend-equivalent payments, $0.57 from noncash stock option expense and $0.53 of acquisition-related expenses.
Now I'll hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

22800180,378400280,1031025,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Good morning, and thanks again, everybody, for calling in this quarter. Today, I'll start off as usual with some comments about our consistent strategy then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 gui",2424,"Good morning, and thanks again, everybody, for calling in this quarter. Today, I'll start off as usual with some comments about our consistent strategy then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 guidance. And then Terry will run through the financial activity for the quarter. 
To restate again, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. 
About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products. That is products for which we own the intellectual property, and for most of these, we are the sole-source provider. Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and financial flexibility. 
We follow a consistent, long-term strategy. One, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value driver concept. Third, we maintain our decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content, where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocations and we basically have four: invest in our existing businesses; two, make accretive acquisitions, consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; third, give the extra money to the shareholders if there are, if any, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt. Now as I've said in the past, given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice. 
Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize our equity returns.
To update you on a few items. The credit markets remain strong. After our recent financing, our bonds unsecured debt are both trading roughly at ora bit above par. We still have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent to those we now pay.
In May, we raised about $2.7 billion, of which $1.9 billion was new debt. The new debt was about 1/2 bonds and 1/2 secured debt. Roughly half of the new money was used to buy DDC. The current weighted average rate, including our hedges, is about 5.3% pretax or about 3.5% interest after-tax. About 50% of the debt is still fixed, and another 25% is hedged or capped. This is about the same average interest cost and the same hedge cap ratio as we've had for the last year or so.
At 7/2/16, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we still have adequate financial capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity and while maintaining a reasonable amount of liquidity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. 
Assuming no additional acquisitions or other capital market activity, we anticipate we will have about $1.9 billion of cash at the end of fiscal year 2016. Again, based on today's conditions, we have additional capacity under our credit agreement, plus we have the added borrowing capacity of any target acquisition.
We saw continuing improvement in the total commercial aftermarket revenues in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, our first half commercial aftermarket was up about 7% versus the prior year. Our Q3 was up 8% versus the prior year. The commercial transport aftermarket, excluding freighters, is up in the low double-digit percent on both a quarter versus prior year quarter and year-to-date basis. However, the business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket segments are weak. Though small individually, in total, they pulled the overall average increase down a bit.
As I mentioned, in addition to credit market activities, we closed the DDC acquisition at the end of the quarter for $1 billion. This is our second largest deal to date. DDC is a leading supplier of databus and power control and related products that are used primarily in military avionics, commercial aerospace and space applications. The company's core databus product line has a very large installed base of system worldwide that spans hundreds of unique military and commercial platforms. Revenues are anticipated to be over $200 million for the fiscal year ended December 2016, with approximately 75% coming from the defense market and the remainder primarily from the commercial transport market. Approximately 70% of the total revenues are from the aftermarket, with nearly all of the revenues from proprietary and sole-source products. In addition to almost all U.S. Military aircraft, including the joint strike fighter, the products were also recently selected for use on the Boeing 777x, the Airbus A380 as well as other applications. DDC's primary manufacturing facility is located in Bohemia, New York, which is Long Island, with additional facilities in Mexico, U.K. and California. The business employs about 650 employees. DDC's is highly engineered, proprietary product and significant aftermarket fit with our strategic focus and meet our usual investment return criteria. 
Turning now to our Q3 fiscal year '16 and year-to-date performance. I'll remind you again, this is the third quarter for our fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1 of 2015. 
As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in OEM and aftermarket mix, inventory movements and modest seasonality and other factors. 
Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong in the quarter, both the quarter and year-to-date. Q3 revenues were up 15% versus the prior year Q3 and 21% versus the prior year's 9-month period. EBITDA was up about 23% versus the prior year for both the quarter and year-to-date period.
Overall organic revenues were up 8% versus prior year Q3 and are up 4% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, on a GAAP basis, commercial aftermarket revenues were up more, while defense and commercial OEM were up a little less. EBITDA As Defined dollars and margin percent were both strong in the quarter. 
Now reviewing the revenues by market category. Again, this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q3 and year-to-date. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. This does not include the just acquired the DDC business.
The primary difference between the 5% pro forma growth in Q3 and the 8% GAAP reported organic growth is the 1-month lag in the financial reporting for Telair in Q3 of 2015. We reported this last year, if you recall. This will negatively impact the GAAP organic growth in Q4. To remind you, we use the pro forma for same-store growth to more clearly reflect our management view of the actual situation. 
In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues are up about 4% for Q3 versus the prior year and are now up about 1% on a year-to-date basis. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up most of our commercial OEM business, are up 6% versus the prior Q3 and about 3% on a year-to-date basis. Year-to-date bookings for commercial transport continue to run modestly ahead of revenues. Commercial transport is about on our expectations at the start of the fiscal year. 
The biz jet and helicopter revenues are a much smaller percent of our OEM revenues, but the revenues in this market continued down. Q3 revenues and bookings were both down in the third quarter. But bookings and revenues in the biz jet and helicopter markets are now both almost 7% below prior year-to-date. The biz jet and helicopter markets in total are weaker than we expected at the start of the fiscal year. 
Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 8% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis versus the prior year, as I said, commercial transport revenues, excluding freighters, are now up 10% year-over-year, with soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues pulling the average down a bit. Total year-to-date commercial aftermarket bookings are still running modestly ahead of our shipments. 
The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q3 were up 3% versus prior year Q3 and are now just about flat on a year-to-date basis. The revenue by product lines continues to be spotty. However, Q3 defense bookings were down significantly versus the prior year on a tough comparison. Bookings are now running just slightly ahead of revenues on a year-to-date basis. Most of the booking shortfall is timing on a few large OEM orders, including A400M order slowdown to adjust for inventory. Defense aftermarket orders were also a little week in Q3. These are quick return and could have some modest impact on our Q4 shipments. 
Moving to profitability. And on a reported basis now, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q3 were refinancing-related expenses, noncash compensation and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. The EBITDA As Defined of about $384 million for Q3 and $1.1 billion year-to-date both are up 23% versus the prior year periods.
The EBITDA As Defined margin was a strong 48% of revenue for Q3 and about 48% on a year-to-date basis. This is up -- pardon? 27%, excuse me, on a year-to-date basis. This is up 1% versus last year-to-date in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and '16 acquisitions. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in Q1 of this year. This, combined with our other value drivers, contributed to the strong margins. 
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is still active, more small to midsized deals than large. Closings, as I always say, are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle, though it is holding up so far and would have little impact on this year in any event. As I said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see a lot of noise in various industry forecasts, and the tone hasn't been great. Widebody's obviously softened. Narrow bodies, on the other hand, seem to be doing okay. 
In the commercial aftermarket, air travel, with a few exceptions, is holding up reasonably well. The biz jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarkets are softer than we originally anticipated and would seem likely to continue so for a bit. 
All in all, this is our best estimate for the balance of the year and includes the DDC acquisition. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond DDC in fiscal year '16, the guidance is as follows: the midpoint of our fiscal year '16 guidance is $3.18 billion. This is up $14 million from our prior guidance. We've increased to the revenue to reflect the DDC acquisition. The decline in forecast biz jet and helicopter revenues and slightly softer defense revenues offset a portion of this. We're up about 18% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. 
The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now $1.49 billion. That's an increase of $30 million from the prior guidance. This is up 21% on a full year over full year basis. The increase in guidance is driven both by the DDC acquisition and the improvements in our base EBITDA margin. The DDC acquisition is the largest dollar part of this increase.
The base business, excluding the 2015 and '16 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up 2.5 points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses. The recent acquisition margins also continue running at or a bit ahead of our original estimates. 
The midpoint of the EBITDA as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.30 per share. That's up 14% from our last guidance. This is up about 25% versus the prior year. The increase in EPS guidance is due primarily to the acquisition of DDC and the improvement in the core business results; an improvement in the overall tax rate, 2 of those things partially offset by increased interest on the new debt. On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following growth rates: commercial aftermarket revenue growth is still forecast in the mid- to high single digits. We're a bit cautious on the upside of this range, primarily due to the soft biz jet, helicopter and freighter revenues I discussed. The defense and military revenues are more likely flat to perhaps slightly down versus the prior year. The weaker Q3 bookings led us to temper the full year forecast a bit.
The commercial OEM revenue growth in the low single-digit percent. We still believe commercial transport shipments will be up mid-single digits, but it now appears the biz jet and helicopter shipments of the year will be down in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activities, we expect to have about $1.9 billion in cash and about $600 million in undrawn revolver at fiscal year-end 2016. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.4x EBITDA at the end of 2016. We'll review our capital allocations during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year or the first quarter of next year. And based on the business and capital market conditions at that time, we'll make a decision as to how to proceed. 
In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and our strong mix of businesses. We can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our equity investors. 
And with that, let me hand this over to Terry."

I will now review our financial results. .Third quarter net sales were $798 million or approximately 15% [ph] greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, [indiscernible] and",975,"Thank you, Nick. I will now review our financial results. .
Third quarter net sales were $798 million or approximately 15% [ph] greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, [indiscernible] and Breeze. Organic sales were up approximately 8.3%, driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. The organic growth also was positively impacted due to the prior period, including only 2 months of Telair and Franke due to a reporting lag. Q4 2015 included 4 months of Telair Franke to catch up on that lag. 
Our third quarter gross profit was $444 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.6% was about 3.5 margin points higher than the prior year. A decrease in acquisition-related costs versus the prior year, partially offset by the acquisition operating margin dilution, contributed about 0.5 point to the higher reported margin. 
Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margin in the business versus the prior year quarter improved 3 margin points. The operations continue to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continuing improving our cost structure.
Additionally, sequential gross profit margins improved about 0.5 point, excluding all acquisition activity. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.8% of sales for the current quarter and the same in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10% of sales a year ago. 
We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $14 million versus the prior year quarter. This was a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $8.7 billion in the current quarter versus $7.6 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the recent financing completed during the quarter that Nick previously discussed. 
As part of the financing, we bought an incremental $1.9 billion, of which proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including potential future dividends or share repurchases. As part of the financing, we received an amendment to allow for a special dividend and/or stock buyback up to $1.5 billion. At this time, no decision has been made on the use of the additional proceeds. And as Nick mentioned, investing in our existing business and making accretive acquisitions are always our first choices. 
Including the new incremental debt, we expect our full year 2016 net interest expense to be approximately $485 million.
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% in the current quarter compared to 28.6% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rates and the impact of discrete tax benefits received primarily from the R&D credit related to our filing of our fiscal 2015 return during this quarter. We will adopt the new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. The new standard is related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and now will be recognized in an income tax provision on the income statement. This change will bring our effective tax rate closer to our cash tax rate. Considering the impact of this new accounting treatment, our full year estimated tax rate is expected to be around 25%. Our estimated tax rate for adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately 30%, which excludes the accounting standard change I just discussed. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $41 million or 42% to $141 million, which is 17.6% of sales. This compares to net income of $99 million or 14.3% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in our net sales and improvements to our operating margin resulting from the strength of our proprietary products, continued productivity efforts and other items. Lower interest expense and refinancing costs as a percentage of net sales also contributed to the increase in net income as a percentage of net sales. 
GAAP EPS was $2.52 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.75 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS is $3.09 per share, an increase of 36.7% compared to two dollars and twenty six dollars [ph] per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with one point six point seven billion dollars [ph] of cash. This includes approximately $850 million of proceeds from the financing we put on the balance sheet for use for general purposes. 
The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end-was 5.7x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and our gross leverage was 6.8x pro forma EBITDA As Defined. 
Excluding any additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we now expect our cash balance to be about $1.9 billion and net leverage to be approximately 5.4x at the end of fiscal 2016. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.23. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint for our adjusted EPS to be $11.30. The $1.07 of adjustments that bridge the gap to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend equivalent payments, $0.57 from noncash stock option expense, $0.88 of acquisition-related expenses, $0.20 of refinancing costs, and these are all partially offset by $0.63 due to reducing fourth quarter income tax provision from the adoption of the new accounting standard I previously mentioned. 
Now I will hand it back over to Liza to kick off this Q&A."

With that, let me now turn the call over to Nick."
22800180,378400280,1031354,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Good morning, and thanks again, everybody, for calling in this quarter. Today, I'll start off, as usual, with some comments about our consistent strategy then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 g",1653,"Good morning, and thanks again, everybody, for calling in this quarter. Today, I'll start off, as usual, with some comments about our consistent strategy then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 guidance. And then Terry will run through the financial activity for the quarter. 
To restate again, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. 
About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products. That is products for which we own the intellectual property, and for most of these, we are the sole-source provider. Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and financial flexibility. 
We follow a consistent long-term strategy. One, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value-driver concept. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. 
As you know, we regularly look closely in our choices for capital allocations, and we basically have 4: invest in our existing businesses; two, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; third, give the extra money back to the shareholders if there are is any, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt. Now as I've said in the past, given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice. 
Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize our equity returns.
To update you on a few items. The credit markets remained strong. After our recent financing, our bonds and secured debt are both trading roughly at or a bit above par. We still have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent to those we now pay.
In May, we raised about $2.7 billion, of which $1.9 billion was new debt. The new debt was about 1/2 bonds and 1/2 secured debt. Roughly half of the new money was used to buy DDC. The current weighted average rate, including our hedges, is about 5.3% pretax or about 3.5% interest after tax. About 50% of the debt is still fixed, and another 25% is hedged or capped. This is about the same average interest cost and the same hedge cap ratio as we've had for the last year or so.
At 7/2/16, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we still have adequate financial capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity and while maintaining a reasonable amount of liquidity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds.  Assuming no additional acquisitions or other capital market activity, we anticipate we will have about $1.9 billion of cash at the end of fiscal year 2016. Again, based on today's conditions, we have additional capacity under our credit agreement, plus we have the added borrowing capacity of any target acquisition.
We saw continuing improvement in the total commercial aftermarket revenues in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, our first half commercial aftermarket was up about 7% versus the prior year. Our Q3 was up 8% versus the prior year. The commercial transport aftermarket, excluding freighters, is up in the low double-digit percent on both a quarter versus prior year quarter and year-to-date basis. However, the business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket segments are weak. Though small individually, in total, they pull the overall average increase down a bit.
As I mentioned, in addition to credit market activities, we closed the DDC acquisition at the end of the quarter for $1 billion. This is our second-largest deal to date. DDC is a leading supplier of databus and power control and related products that are used primarily in military avionics, commercial aerospace and space applications. The company's core databus product line has a very large installed base of system worldwide that spans hundreds of unique military and commercial platforms. 
Revenues are anticipated to be over $200 million for the fiscal year ended December 2016 with approximately 75% coming from the defense market and the remainder primarily from the commercial transport market. Approximately 70% of the total revenues are from the aftermarket with nearly all of the revenues from proprietary and sole-source products. In addition to almost all U.S. military aircraft, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the products were also recently selected for use on the Boeing 777x, the Airbus A380 as well as other applications. 
DDC's primary manufacturing facility is located in Bohemia, New York, which is Long Island, with additional facilities in Mexico, U.K. and California. The business employs about 650 employees. DDC's highly engineered, proprietary products and significant aftermarket fit with our strategic focus and meet our usual investment return criteria. 
Turning now to our Q3 fiscal year '16 and year-to-date performance. I'll remind you again, this is the third quarter for our fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2015.  As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in OEM and aftermarket mix, inventory movements and modest seasonality and other factors. 
Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong in the quarter, both the quarter and year-to-date. For Q3, revenues were up 15% versus the prior year Q3 and 21% versus the prior year's 9-month period. EBITDA was up about 23% versus the prior year for both the quarter and year-to-date period.
Overall organic revenues were up 8% versus prior year Q3 and are up 4% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, on a GAAP basis, commercial aftermarket revenues were up more, while defense and commercial OEM were up a little less. EBITDA As Defined dollars and margin percent were both strong in the quarter. 
Now reviewing the revenues by market category. Again, this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q3 and year-to-date. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. This does not include the just acquired DDC business. The primary difference between the 5% pro forma growth in Q3 and the 8% GAAP reported organic growth is the 1-month lag in the financial reporting for Telair in Q3 of 2015. We reported this last year, if you recall. This will negatively impact the GAAP organic growth in Q4. To remind you, we use the pro forma for same-store growth to more clearly reflect our management view of the actual situation. 
In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues are up about 4% for Q3 versus the prior year and are now up about 1% on a year-to-date basis. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up most of our commercial OEM business, are up 6% versus the prior Q3 and about 3% on a year-to-date basis. Year-to-date bookings for commercial transport continue to run modestly ahead of revenues. Commercial transport is about on our expectations as the start -- at the start of the fiscal year. 
The biz jet and helicopter revenues are a much smaller percent of our OEM revenues, but the revenues in this market continued down. Q3 revenues and bookings were both down in the third quarter, but bookings and revenues in the biz jet and helicopter markets are now both almost 7% below prior year-to-date. The biz jet and helicopter markets in total are weaker than we expected at the start of the fiscal year. 
Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 8% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis versus the prior year, as I said, commercial transport revenues, excluding freighters, are now up 10% year-over-year with soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues pulling the average down a bit. Total year-to-date commercial aftermarket bookings are still running modestly ahead of our shipments. 
The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q3 were up 3% versus prior year Q3 and are now just about flat on a year-to-date basis. The revenue by product lines continues spotty. However, Q3 defense bookings were down significantly versus the prior year on a tough comparison. Bookings are now running just slightly ahead of revenues on a year-to-date basis. Most of the booking shortfall is timing on a few large OEM orders, including A400M order slowdown to adjust for inventory. Defense aftermarket orders were also a little weak in Q3. These are quick return and could have some modest impact on our Q4 shipments. 
Moving to profitability and on a reported basis now, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q3 were refinancing-related expenses, noncash compensation and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. The EBITDA As Defined of about $384 million for Q3 and $1.1 billion year-to-date both are up 23% versus the prior year periods. The EBITDA As Defined margin was a strong 48% of revenue for Q3 and about 48% on a year-to-date basis. This is up -- pardon?"

This is up 1% versus last year-to-date in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and '16 acquisitions. As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in",780,"47%, excuse me, on a year-to-date basis. This is up 1% versus last year-to-date in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and '16 acquisitions. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in Q1 of this year. This, combined with our other value drivers, contributed to the strong margins. 
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is still active, more small to midsized deals than large. Closings, as I always say, are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle, though it is holding up so far and we have little impact on this year in any event. As I said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see a lot of noise in various industry forecasts, and the tone hasn't been great. Wide bodies have obviously softened. Narrow bodies, on the other hand, seem to be doing okay. 
In the commercial aftermarket, air travel with a few exceptions, is holding up reasonably well. The biz jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarkets are softer than we originally anticipated and would seem likely to continue so for a bit. 
All in all, this is our best estimate for the few -- for the balance of the year and includes the DDC acquisition. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond DDC in fiscal year '16, the guidance is as follows: the midpoint of our fiscal year '16 guidance is $3.18 billion. This is up $14 million from our prior guidance. We've increased the revenue to reflect the DDC acquisition. The decline in forecast biz jet and helicopter revenues and slightly softer defense revenues offset a portion of this. We're up about 18% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. 
The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now $1.49 billion. That's an increase of $30 million from the prior guidance. This is up 21% on a full year over full year basis. The increase in guidance is driven both by the DDC acquisition and the improvements in our base EBITDA margin. The DDC acquisition is the largest dollar part of this increase.
The base business, excluding the 2015 and '16 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up 2.5 points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses. The recent acquisition margins also continue running at or a bit ahead of our original estimates. 
The midpoint of the EBITDA as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.30 per share. That's up $0.14 from our last guidance. This is up about 25% versus the prior year. The increase in EPS guidance is due primarily to the acquisition of DDC and the improvement in the core business results; an improvement in the overall tax rate, 2 of those things partially offset by increased interest on the new debt. 
On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following growth rates: commercial aftermarket revenue growth is still forecast in the mid- to high single digits. We're a bit cautious on the upside of this range, primarily due to the soft biz jet, helicopter and freighter revenues I discussed. The defense and military revenues are more likely flat to perhaps slightly down versus the prior year. The weaker Q3 bookings led us to temper the full year forecast a bit. The commercial OEM revenue growth in the low single-digit percent. We still believe commercial transport shipments will be up mid-single digits, but it now appears the biz jet and helicopter shipments for the year will be down in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. 
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activities, we expect to have about $1.9 billion in cash and about $600 million in undrawn revolver at fiscal year-end 2016. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.4x EBITDA at the end of 2016. 
We will review our capital allocations during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year or the first quarter of next year. And based on the business and capital market conditions at that time, we'll make a decision as to how to proceed. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and our strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our equity investors. 
And with that, let me hand this over to Terry."
22800180,378400280,1031354,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Nick. I will now review our financial results. Third quarter net sales were $798 million or approximately 15% greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, PneuDraulics and Breeze. Org",960,"Thank you, Nick. I will now review our financial results. Third quarter net sales were $798 million or approximately 15% greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, PneuDraulics and Breeze. Organic sales were up approximately 8.3% driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. The organic growth also was positively impacted due to the prior period, including only 2 months of Telair and Franke due to a reporting lag. Q4 2015 included 4 months of Telair and Franke to catch up on that lag. 
Our third quarter gross profit was $444 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.6% was about 3.5 margin points higher than the prior year. A decrease in acquisition-related costs versus the prior year, partially offset by the acquisition operating margin dilution, contribute about 0.5 point to the higher-reported margin. 
Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margin in the business versus the prior year quarter improved 3 margin points. The operations continue to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continuing improving our cost structure. Additionally, sequential gross profit margins improved about 0.5 point, excluding all acquisition activity. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.8% of sales for the current quarter and the same in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10% of sales a year ago. 
We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $14 million versus the prior year quarter. This was a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $8.7 billion in the current quarter versus $7.6 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the recent financing completed during the quarter that Nick previously discussed. 
As part of the financing, we bought an incremental $1.9 billion, of which proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including potential future dividends or share repurchases. As part of the financing, we received an amendment to allow for a special dividend and/or stock buyback up to $1.5 billion. At this time, no decision has been made on the use of the additional proceeds. And as Nick mentioned, investing in our existing business and making accretive acquisitions are always our first choices. Including the new incremental debt, we expect our full year 2016 net interest expense to be approximately $485 million.
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% in the current quarter compared to 28.6% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rates and the impact of discrete tax benefits received primarily from the R&D credit related to our filing of our fiscal 2015 return during this quarter. 
We will adopt the new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. The new standard is related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and now will be recognized in an income tax provision on the income statement. This change will bring our effective tax rate closer to our cash tax rate. Considering the impact of this new accounting treatment, our full year estimated tax rate is expected to be around 25%. Our estimated tax rate for adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately 30%, which excludes the accounting standard change I just discussed. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $41 million or 42% to $141 million, which is 17.6% of sales. This compares to net income of $99 million or 14.3% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in our net sales and improvements to our operating margin resulting from the strength of our proprietary products, continued productivity efforts and other items. Lower interest expense and refinancing costs as a percentage of net sales also contributed to the increase in net income as a percentage of net sales. 
GAAP EPS was $2.52 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.75 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS is $3.09 per share, an increase of 36.7% compared to $2.26 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.67 billion of cash. This includes approximately $850 million of proceeds from the financing we put on the balance sheet for use for general purposes. The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.7x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and our gross leverage was 6.8x pro forma EBITDA As Defined. Excluding any additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we now expect our cash balance to be about $1.9 billion and net leverage to be approximately 5.4x at the end of fiscal 2016. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.23. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint for our adjusted EPS to be $11.30. The $1.07 of adjustments that bridge the gap to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend-equivalent payments, $0.57 from noncash stock option expense, $0.88 of acquisition-related expenses, $0.20 of refinancing costs, and these are all partially offset by $0.63 due to reducing fourth quarter income tax provision from the adoption of the new accounting standard I previously mentioned. 
Now I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

It's been -- every year, it's been going up since 2010 or 2011 and really hasn't gone up much. The aftermarket, I think, is more stable than the business jet. In the freighter business, I think you know what's going on there. Freight traffic is just slowing down some.

Today, I'll start off, as usual, with some comments about our consistent strategy then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 g",1653,"Good morning, and thanks again, everybody, for calling in this quarter. Today, I'll start off, as usual, with some comments about our consistent strategy then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 guidance. And then Terry will run through the financial activity for the quarter. 
To restate again, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. 
About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products. That is products for which we own the intellectual property, and for most of these, we are the sole-source provider. Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and financial flexibility. 
We follow a consistent long-term strategy. One, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value-driver concept. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. 
As you know, we regularly look closely in our choices for capital allocations, and we basically have 4: invest in our existing businesses; two, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; third, give the extra money back to the shareholders if there are is any, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt. Now as I've said in the past, given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice. 
Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize our equity returns.
To update you on a few items. The credit markets remained strong. After our recent financing, our bonds and secured debt are both trading roughly at or a bit above par. We still have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent to those we now pay.
In May, we raised about $2.7 billion, of which $1.9 billion was new debt. The new debt was about 1/2 bonds and 1/2 secured debt. Roughly half of the new money was used to buy DDC. The current weighted average rate, including our hedges, is about 5.3% pretax or about 3.5% interest after tax. About 50% of the debt is still fixed, and another 25% is hedged or capped. This is about the same average interest cost and the same hedge cap ratio as we've had for the last year or so.
At 7/2/16, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we still have adequate financial capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity and while maintaining a reasonable amount of liquidity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds.  Assuming no additional acquisitions or other capital market activity, we anticipate we will have about $1.9 billion of cash at the end of fiscal year 2016. Again, based on today's conditions, we have additional capacity under our credit agreement, plus we have the added borrowing capacity of any target acquisition.
We saw continuing improvement in the total commercial aftermarket revenues in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, our first half commercial aftermarket was up about 7% versus the prior year. Our Q3 was up 8% versus the prior year. The commercial transport aftermarket, excluding freighters, is up in the low double-digit percent on both a quarter versus prior year quarter and year-to-date basis. However, the business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket segments are weak. Though small individually, in total, they pull the overall average increase down a bit.
As I mentioned, in addition to credit market activities, we closed the DDC acquisition at the end of the quarter for $1 billion. This is our second-largest deal to date. DDC is a leading supplier of databus and power control and related products that are used primarily in military avionics, commercial aerospace and space applications. The company's core databus product line has a very large installed base of system worldwide that spans hundreds of unique military and commercial platforms. 
Revenues are anticipated to be over $200 million for the fiscal year ended December 2016 with approximately 75% coming from the defense market and the remainder primarily from the commercial transport market. Approximately 70% of the total revenues are from the aftermarket with nearly all of the revenues from proprietary and sole-source products. In addition to almost all U.S. military aircraft, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the products were also recently selected for use on the Boeing 777x, the Airbus A380 as well as other applications. 
DDC's primary manufacturing facility is located in Bohemia, New York, which is Long Island, with additional facilities in Mexico, U.K. and California. The business employs about 650 employees. DDC's highly engineered, proprietary products and significant aftermarket fit with our strategic focus and meet our usual investment return criteria. 
Turning now to our Q3 fiscal year '16 and year-to-date performance. I'll remind you again, this is the third quarter for our fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2015.  As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in OEM and aftermarket mix, inventory movements and modest seasonality and other factors. 
Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong in the quarter, both the quarter and year-to-date. For Q3, revenues were up 15% versus the prior year Q3 and 21% versus the prior year's 9-month period. EBITDA was up about 23% versus the prior year for both the quarter and year-to-date period.
Overall organic revenues were up 8% versus prior year Q3 and are up 4% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, on a GAAP basis, commercial aftermarket revenues were up more, while defense and commercial OEM were up a little less. EBITDA As Defined dollars and margin percent were both strong in the quarter. 
Now reviewing the revenues by market category. Again, this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q3 and year-to-date. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. This does not include the just acquired DDC business. The primary difference between the 5% pro forma growth in Q3 and the 8% GAAP reported organic growth is the 1-month lag in the financial reporting for Telair in Q3 of 2015. We reported this last year, if you recall. This will negatively impact the GAAP organic growth in Q4. To remind you, we use the pro forma for same-store growth to more clearly reflect our management view of the actual situation. 
In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues are up about 4% for Q3 versus the prior year and are now up about 1% on a year-to-date basis. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up most of our commercial OEM business, are up 6% versus the prior Q3 and about 3% on a year-to-date basis. Year-to-date bookings for commercial transport continue to run modestly ahead of revenues. Commercial transport is about on our expectations as the start -- at the start of the fiscal year. 
The biz jet and helicopter revenues are a much smaller percent of our OEM revenues, but the revenues in this market continued down. Q3 revenues and bookings were both down in the third quarter, but bookings and revenues in the biz jet and helicopter markets are now both almost 7% below prior year-to-date. The biz jet and helicopter markets in total are weaker than we expected at the start of the fiscal year. 
Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 8% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis versus the prior year, as I said, commercial transport revenues, excluding freighters, are now up 10% year-over-year with soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues pulling the average down a bit. Total year-to-date commercial aftermarket bookings are still running modestly ahead of our shipments. 
The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q3 were up 3% versus prior year Q3 and are now just about flat on a year-to-date basis. The revenue by product lines continues spotty. However, Q3 defense bookings were down significantly versus the prior year on a tough comparison. Bookings are now running just slightly ahead of revenues on a year-to-date basis. Most of the booking shortfall is timing on a few large OEM orders, including A400M order slowdown to adjust for inventory. Defense aftermarket orders were also a little weak in Q3. These are quick return and could have some modest impact on our Q4 shipments. 
Moving to profitability and on a reported basis now, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q3 were refinancing-related expenses, noncash compensation and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. The EBITDA As Defined of about $384 million for Q3 and $1.1 billion year-to-date both are up 23% versus the prior year periods. The EBITDA As Defined margin was a strong 48% of revenue for Q3 and about 48% on a year-to-date basis. This is up -- pardon?"

This is up 1% versus last year-to-date in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and '16 acquisitions. As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in",780,"47%, excuse me, on a year-to-date basis. This is up 1% versus last year-to-date in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and '16 acquisitions. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in Q1 of this year. This, combined with our other value drivers, contributed to the strong margins. 
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is still active, more small to midsized deals than large. Closings, as I always say, are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle, though it is holding up so far and we have little impact on this year in any event. As I said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see a lot of noise in various industry forecasts, and the tone hasn't been great. Wide bodies have obviously softened. Narrow bodies, on the other hand, seem to be doing okay. 
In the commercial aftermarket, air travel with a few exceptions, is holding up reasonably well. The biz jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarkets are softer than we originally anticipated and would seem likely to continue so for a bit. 
All in all, this is our best estimate for the few -- for the balance of the year and includes the DDC acquisition. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond DDC in fiscal year '16, the guidance is as follows: the midpoint of our fiscal year '16 guidance is $3.18 billion. This is up $14 million from our prior guidance. We've increased the revenue to reflect the DDC acquisition. The decline in forecast biz jet and helicopter revenues and slightly softer defense revenues offset a portion of this. We're up about 18% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. 
The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now $1.49 billion. That's an increase of $30 million from the prior guidance. This is up 21% on a full year over full year basis. The increase in guidance is driven both by the DDC acquisition and the improvements in our base EBITDA margin. The DDC acquisition is the largest dollar part of this increase.
The base business, excluding the 2015 and '16 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up 2.5 points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses. The recent acquisition margins also continue running at or a bit ahead of our original estimates. 
The midpoint of the EBITDA as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.30 per share. That's up $0.14 from our last guidance. This is up about 25% versus the prior year. The increase in EPS guidance is due primarily to the acquisition of DDC and the improvement in the core business results; an improvement in the overall tax rate, 2 of those things partially offset by increased interest on the new debt. 
On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following growth rates: commercial aftermarket revenue growth is still forecast in the mid- to high single digits. We're a bit cautious on the upside of this range, primarily due to the soft biz jet, helicopter and freighter revenues I discussed. The defense and military revenues are more likely flat to perhaps slightly down versus the prior year. The weaker Q3 bookings led us to temper the full year forecast a bit. The commercial OEM revenue growth in the low single-digit percent. We still believe commercial transport shipments will be up mid-single digits, but it now appears the biz jet and helicopter shipments for the year will be down in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. 
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activities, we expect to have about $1.9 billion in cash and about $600 million in undrawn revolver at fiscal year-end 2016. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.4x EBITDA at the end of 2016. 
We will review our capital allocations during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year or the first quarter of next year. And based on the business and capital market conditions at that time, we'll make a decision as to how to proceed. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and our strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our equity investors. 
And with that, let me hand this over to Terry."
22800180,378400280,1031686,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Nick. I will now review our financial results. Third quarter net sales were $798 million or approximately 15% greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, PneuDraulics and Breeze. Org",961,"Thank you, Nick. I will now review our financial results. Third quarter net sales were $798 million or approximately 15% greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, PneuDraulics and Breeze. Organic sales were up approximately 8.3% driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. The organic growth also was positively impacted due to the prior period including only 2 months of Telair and Franke due to a reporting lag. Q4 2015 included 4 months of Telair and Franke to catch up on that lag. 
Our third quarter gross profit was $444 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.6% was about 3.5 margin points higher than the prior year. A decrease in acquisition-related costs versus the prior year, partially offset by the acquisition operating margin dilution, contribute about 0.5 point to the higher-reported margin. 
Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margin in the business versus the prior year quarter improved 3 margin points. The operations continued to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continuing improving our cost structure. Additionally, sequential gross profit margins improved about 0.5 point, excluding all acquisition activity. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.8% of sales for the current quarter and the same in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10% of sales a year ago. 
We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $14 million versus the prior year quarter. This was a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $8.7 billion in the current quarter versus $7.6 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the recent financing completed during the quarter that Nick previously discussed. 
As part of the financing, we bought an incremental $1.9 billion, of which proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including potential future dividends or share repurchases. As part of the financing, we received an amendment to allow for a special dividend and/or stock buyback up to $1.5 billion. At this time, no decision has been made on the use of the additional proceeds. And as Nick mentioned, investing in our existing business and making accretive acquisitions are always our first choices. Including the new incremental debt, we expect our full year 2016 net interest expense to be approximately $485 million.
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% in the current quarter compared to 28.6% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rates and the impact of discrete tax benefits received primarily from the R&D credit related to our filing of our fiscal 2015 return during this quarter. 
We will adopt the new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. The new standard is related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and now will be recognized in an income tax provision on the income statement. This change will bring our effective tax rate closer to our cash tax rate. Considering the impact of this new accounting treatment, our full year estimated tax rate is expected to be around 25%. Our estimated tax rate for adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately 30%, which excludes the accounting standard change I just discussed. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $41 million or 42% to $141 million, which is 17.6% of sales. This compares to net income of $99 million or 14.3% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in our net sales and improvements to our operating margin resulting from the strength of our proprietary products, continued productivity efforts and other items. Lower interest expense and refinancing costs as a percentage of net sales also contributed to the increase in net income as a percentage of net sales. 
GAAP EPS was $2.52 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.75 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS is $3.09 per share, an increase of 36.7% compared to $2.26 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.67 billion of cash. This includes approximately $850 million of proceeds from the financing we put on the balance sheet for use for general corporate purposes. The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.7x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and our gross leverage was 6.8x pro forma EBITDA As Defined. Excluding any additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we now expect our cash balance to be about $1.9 billion and net leverage to be approximately 5.4x at the end of fiscal 2016. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.23. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint for our adjusted EPS to be $11.30. The $1.07 of adjustments that bridge the gap to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend-equivalent payments, $0.57 from noncash stock option expense, $0.88 of acquisition-related expenses, $0.20 of refinancing costs, and these are all partially offset by $0.63 due to reducing fourth quarter income tax provision from the adoption of the new accounting standard I previously mentioned. 
Now I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

Today, I'll start off, as usual, with some comments about our consistent strategy then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 g",1653,"Good morning, and thanks again, everybody, for calling in this quarter. Today, I'll start off, as usual, with some comments about our consistent strategy then give you an overview of our fiscal year Q3 and year-to-date performance, an update on our 2016 guidance. And then Terry will run through the financial activity for the quarter. 
To restate again, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. 
About 90% of our net sales are generated by proprietary products. That is products for which we own the intellectual property, and for most of these, we are the sole-source provider. Over half of our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles. Because of our uniquely high EBITDA margins, TransDigm has, year in and year out, generated strong free cash flow. This gives us a lot of operating and financial flexibility. 
We follow a consistent long-term strategy. One, we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating strategy based on our 3 value-driver concept. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that closely aligns the management with the shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our efforts to create shareholder value. 
As you know, we regularly look closely in our choices for capital allocations, and we basically have 4: invest in our existing businesses; two, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy, and these 2 are almost always our first choices; third, give the extra money back to the shareholders if there are is any, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt. Now as I've said in the past, given the current low after-tax cost of debt, this is still likely our last choice. 
Depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we'll allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize our equity returns.
To update you on a few items. The credit markets remained strong. After our recent financing, our bonds and secured debt are both trading roughly at or a bit above par. We still have adequate access to debt markets at rates roughly consistent to those we now pay.
In May, we raised about $2.7 billion, of which $1.9 billion was new debt. The new debt was about 1/2 bonds and 1/2 secured debt. Roughly half of the new money was used to buy DDC. The current weighted average rate, including our hedges, is about 5.3% pretax or about 3.5% interest after tax. About 50% of the debt is still fixed, and another 25% is hedged or capped. This is about the same average interest cost and the same hedge cap ratio as we've had for the last year or so.
At 7/2/16, based on the current capital market conditions, we believe we still have adequate financial capacity to make over $1.5 billion of acquisitions without issuing additional equity and while maintaining a reasonable amount of liquidity. This capacity grows as the year proceeds. Assuming no additional acquisitions or other capital market activity, we anticipate we will have about $1.9 billion of cash at the end of fiscal year 2016. Again, based on today's conditions, we have additional capacity under our credit agreement, plus we have the added borrowing capacity of any target acquisition.
We saw continuing improvement in the total commercial aftermarket revenues in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, our first half commercial aftermarket was up about 7% versus the prior year. Our Q3 was up 8% versus the prior year. The commercial transport aftermarket, excluding freighters, is up in the low double-digit percent on both a quarter versus prior year quarter and year-to-date basis. However, the business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket segments are weak. Though small individually, in total, they pull the overall average increase down a bit.
As I mentioned, in addition to credit market activities, we closed the DDC acquisition at the end of the quarter for $1 billion. This is our second-largest deal to date. DDC is a leading supplier of databus and power control and related products that are used primarily in military avionics, commercial aerospace and space applications. The company's core databus product line has a very large installed base of system worldwide that spans hundreds of unique military and commercial platforms. 
Revenues are anticipated to be over $200 million for the fiscal year ended December 2016 with approximately 75% coming from the defense market and the remainder primarily from the commercial transport market. Approximately 70% of the total revenues are from the aftermarket with nearly all of the revenues from proprietary and sole-source products. In addition to almost all U.S. military aircraft, including the Joint Strike Fighter, the products were also recently selected for use on the Boeing 777x, the Airbus A380 as well as other applications. 
DDC's primary manufacturing facility is located in Bohemia, New York, which is Long Island, with additional facilities in Mexico, U.K. and California. The business employs about 650 employees. DDC's highly engineered, proprietary products and significant aftermarket fit with our strategic focus and meet our usual investment return criteria. 
Turning now to our Q3 fiscal year '16 and year-to-date performance. I'll remind you again, this is the third quarter for our fiscal year 2016. Our fiscal year started October 1, 2015. As I've said in the past, quarterly comparisons can be significantly impacted by difference in OEM and aftermarket mix, inventory movements and modest seasonality and other factors. 
Total GAAP revenues and EBITDA As Defined were strong in the quarter, both the quarter and year-to-date. For Q3, revenues were up 15% versus the prior year Q3 and 21% versus the prior year's 9-month period. EBITDA was up about 23% versus the prior year for both the quarter and year-to-date period.
Overall organic revenues were up 8% versus prior year Q3 and are up 4% on a year-to-date basis. In the quarter, on a GAAP basis, commercial aftermarket revenues were up more, while defense and commercial OEM were up a little less. EBITDA As Defined dollars and margin percent were both strong in the quarter. 
Now reviewing the revenues by market category. Again, this is on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q3 and year-to-date. That is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. This does not include the just acquired DDC business. The primary difference between the 5% pro forma growth in Q3 and the 8% GAAP reported organic growth is the 1-month lag in the financial reporting for Telair in Q3 of 2015. We reported this last year, if you recall. This will negatively impact the GAAP organic growth in Q4. To remind you, we use the pro forma for same-store growth to more clearly reflect our management view of the actual situation. 
In the commercial aftermarket, which makes up about 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues are up about 4% for Q3 versus the prior year and are now up about 1% on a year-to-date basis. Commercial transport OEM revenues, which make up most of our commercial OEM business, are up 6% versus the prior Q3 and about 3% on a year-to-date basis. Year-to-date bookings for commercial transport continue to run modestly ahead of revenues. Commercial transport is about on our expectations as the start -- at the start of the fiscal year. 
The biz jet and helicopter revenues are a much smaller percent of our OEM revenues, but the revenues in this market continued down. Q3 revenues and bookings were both down in the third quarter, but bookings and revenues in the biz jet and helicopter markets are now both almost 7% below prior year-to-date. The biz jet and helicopter markets in total are weaker than we expected at the start of the fiscal year. 
Total commercial aftermarket revenues were up about 8% for this quarter versus the prior year and are now up 7% on a year-to-date basis. On a year-to-date basis versus the prior year, as I said, commercial transport revenues, excluding freighters, are now up 10% year-over-year with soft business jet, helicopter and freighter revenues pulling the average down a bit. Total year-to-date commercial aftermarket bookings are still running modestly ahead of our shipments. 
The defense market, which makes up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for fiscal year '16 Q3 were up 3% versus prior year Q3 and are now just about flat on a year-to-date basis. The revenue by product lines continues spotty. However, Q3 defense bookings were down significantly versus the prior year on a tough comparison. Bookings are now running just slightly ahead of revenues on a year-to-date basis. Most of the booking shortfall is timing on a few large OEM orders, including A400M order slowdown to adjust for inventory. Defense aftermarket orders were also a little weak in Q3. These are quick return and could have some modest impact on our Q4 shipments. 
Moving to profitability and on a reported basis now, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA As Defined. The As Defined adjustments in Q3 were refinancing-related expenses, noncash compensation and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. The EBITDA As Defined of about $384 million for Q3 and $1.1 billion year-to-date both are up 23% versus the prior year periods. The EBITDA As Defined margin was a strong 48% of revenue for Q3 and about 48% on a year-to-date basis. This is up -- pardon?"

This is up 1% versus last year-to-date in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and '16 acquisitions. As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in",780,"47%, excuse me, on a year-to-date basis. This is up 1% versus last year-to-date in spite of approximately 2% of margin dilution from the 2015 and '16 acquisitions. 
As we mentioned last quarter, we reduced our employment level in the range of 4% to 5% in Q1 of this year. This, combined with our other value drivers, contributed to the strong margins. 
With respect to acquisitions, we continue looking at opportunities. The pipeline of possibilities is still active, more small to midsized deals than large. Closings, as I always say, are difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on value-creation opportunities that meet our tight criteria.
Turning now to the 2016 guidance. We continue to have some concern about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle, though it is holding up so far and we have little impact on this year in any event. As I said before, we're cautious with our spending and are ready to react quickly if necessary. We see a lot of noise in various industry forecasts, and the tone hasn't been great. Wide bodies have obviously softened. Narrow bodies, on the other hand, seem to be doing okay. 
In the commercial aftermarket, air travel with a few exceptions, is holding up reasonably well. The biz jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarkets are softer than we originally anticipated and would seem likely to continue so for a bit. 
All in all, this is our best estimate for the few -- for the balance of the year and includes the DDC acquisition. Based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions beyond DDC in fiscal year '16, the guidance is as follows: the midpoint of our fiscal year '16 guidance is $3.18 billion. This is up $14 million from our prior guidance. We've increased the revenue to reflect the DDC acquisition. The decline in forecast biz jet and helicopter revenues and slightly softer defense revenues offset a portion of this. We're up about 18% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. 
The midpoint of the fiscal year 2016 EBITDA As Defined guidance is now $1.49 billion. That's an increase of $30 million from the prior guidance. This is up 21% on a full year over full year basis. The increase in guidance is driven both by the DDC acquisition and the improvements in our base EBITDA margin. The DDC acquisition is the largest dollar part of this increase.
The base business, excluding the 2015 and '16 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 49% or up 2.5 points versus 2015 for the same mix of businesses. The recent acquisition margins also continue running at or a bit ahead of our original estimates. 
The midpoint of the EBITDA as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.30 per share. That's up $0.14 from our last guidance. This is up about 25% versus the prior year. The increase in EPS guidance is due primarily to the acquisition of DDC and the improvement in the core business results; an improvement in the overall tax rate, 2 of those things partially offset by increased interest on the new debt. 
On a pro forma or same-store basis, the guidance is based on the following growth rates: commercial aftermarket revenue growth is still forecast in the mid- to high single digits. We're a bit cautious on the upside of this range, primarily due to the soft biz jet, helicopter and freighter revenues I discussed. The defense and military revenues are more likely flat to perhaps slightly down versus the prior year. The weaker Q3 bookings led us to temper the full year forecast a bit. The commercial OEM revenue growth in the low single-digit percent. We still believe commercial transport shipments will be up mid-single digits, but it now appears the biz jet and helicopter shipments for the year will be down in the mid- to high single-digit percent range. 
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activities, we expect to have about $1.9 billion in cash and about $600 million in undrawn revolver at fiscal year-end 2016. Assuming no acquisitions or other capital market activities, our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.4x EBITDA at the end of 2016. 
We will review our capital allocations during the fourth quarter of this fiscal year or the first quarter of next year. And based on the business and capital market conditions at that time, we'll make a decision as to how to proceed. In any event, I'm confident with our consistent value-focused strategy and our strong mix of businesses, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our equity investors. 
And with that, let me hand this over to Terry."
22800180,378400280,1032150,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 09, 2016",2016-08-09,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Nick. I will now review our financial results. Third quarter net sales were $798 million or approximately 15% greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, PneuDraulics and Breeze. Org",961,"Thank you, Nick. I will now review our financial results. Third quarter net sales were $798 million or approximately 15% greater than prior year. Almost half the growth came from the collective impact of acquisitions of Pexco, PneuDraulics and Breeze. Organic sales were up approximately 8.3% driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, partially offset by weaker commercial OEM and defense sales. The organic growth also was positively impacted due to the prior period including only 2 months of Telair and Franke due to a reporting lag. Q4 2015 included 4 months of Telair and Franke to catch up on that lag. 
Our third quarter gross profit was $444 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.6% was about 3.5 margin points higher than the prior year. A decrease in acquisition-related costs versus the prior year, partially offset by the acquisition operating margin dilution, contribute about 0.5 point to the higher-reported margin. 
Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margin in the business versus the prior year quarter improved 3 margin points. The operations continued to expand margins as a result of the strength of our proprietary products and continuing improving our cost structure. Additionally, sequential gross profit margins improved about 0.5 point, excluding all acquisition activity. 
Our selling and administrative expenses were 11.8% of sales for the current quarter and the same in the prior year. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was about 9.7% of sales compared to 10% of sales a year ago. 
We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $14 million versus the prior year quarter. This was a result of an increase in the weighted average total debt to $8.7 billion in the current quarter versus $7.6 billion in the prior year. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the recent financing completed during the quarter that Nick previously discussed. 
As part of the financing, we bought an incremental $1.9 billion, of which proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including potential future dividends or share repurchases. As part of the financing, we received an amendment to allow for a special dividend and/or stock buyback up to $1.5 billion. At this time, no decision has been made on the use of the additional proceeds. And as Nick mentioned, investing in our existing business and making accretive acquisitions are always our first choices. Including the new incremental debt, we expect our full year 2016 net interest expense to be approximately $485 million.
Our effective tax rate was 27.6% in the current quarter compared to 28.6% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the quarter was primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. statutory rates and the impact of discrete tax benefits received primarily from the R&D credit related to our filing of our fiscal 2015 return during this quarter. 
We will adopt the new accounting standard in the fourth quarter of 2016. The new standard is related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and now will be recognized in an income tax provision on the income statement. This change will bring our effective tax rate closer to our cash tax rate. Considering the impact of this new accounting treatment, our full year estimated tax rate is expected to be around 25%. Our estimated tax rate for adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately 30%, which excludes the accounting standard change I just discussed. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $41 million or 42% to $141 million, which is 17.6% of sales. This compares to net income of $99 million or 14.3% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in our net sales and improvements to our operating margin resulting from the strength of our proprietary products, continued productivity efforts and other items. Lower interest expense and refinancing costs as a percentage of net sales also contributed to the increase in net income as a percentage of net sales. 
GAAP EPS was $2.52 per share in the current quarter compared to $1.75 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS is $3.09 per share, an increase of 36.7% compared to $2.26 per share last year. Please refer to Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Now switching gears to cash and liquidity. We ended the quarter with $1.67 billion of cash. This includes approximately $850 million of proceeds from the financing we put on the balance sheet for use for general corporate purposes. The company's net debt leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.7x our pro forma EBITDA As Defined, and our gross leverage was 6.8x pro forma EBITDA As Defined. Excluding any additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we now expect our cash balance to be about $1.9 billion and net leverage to be approximately 5.4x at the end of fiscal 2016. 
With regards to our guidance, we now estimate the midpoint of our GAAP earnings per share to be $10.23. And as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint for our adjusted EPS to be $11.30. The $1.07 of adjustments that bridge the gap to adjusted EPS includes the following assumptions: $0.05 from dividend-equivalent payments, $0.57 from noncash stock option expense, $0.88 of acquisition-related expenses, $0.20 of refinancing costs, and these are all partially offset by $0.63 due to reducing fourth quarter income tax provision from the adoption of the new accounting standard I previously mentioned. 
Now I will hand it back to Liza to kick off the Q&A."

It's been -- every year, it's been going up since 2010 or 2011 and really hasn't gone up much. The aftermarket, I think, is more stable than the business jet. In the freighter business, I think you know what's going on there. Freight traffic is just slowing down some.

If you may or may not remember, when we bought Telair last year, we had a transition agreement with AAR, where they would do the accounting for a quarter, where we got things switched over. The net result of that is because of the turn times, we had to be on a 1-month lag in the previous year's third quarter. So we only had 2 months. And this year, we have 3 months.

I'll then overview a busy fiscal year '16. I'll review the initial guidance for '17. Kevin will then review some key operating items for '16 and '17, and Terry will run through the financials. 
A fair amount to cover here today. To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products. About 3/4 of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole-source provider. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet. We follow a consistent, long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology based on our 3 value driver [ph] concept. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that is closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our effort to create shareholder value.
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have 4. Our priorities are typically in the following order: one, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. To state again, these 2 are almost always our first choices. Third, give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt, but given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions. 
In the last 3 years, you've seen 3 distinct business environments and corresponding real-life examples of how we manage our capital structure to best take advantage of the current business and capital market environment. In fiscal year '14, with the acquisition opportunities not particularly compelling, we gave back about $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of a large special dividend and some modest stock buyback. In fiscal year '15, we saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates. We acquired about $1.6 billion worth of proprietary aerospace businesses that met our strategic and shareholder return requirements. In fiscal '16, we again saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates that meet our -- met our criteria. As a result, we acquired another $1.4 billion of aerospace businesses. In addition, the combination of our usual high cash flow and continuing attractive credit markets allowed us to return about $1.6 billion more to our shareholders in the form of roughly $200 million of share buyback plus a $1.4 billion special dividend paid out in early '17.
To summarize, over the last 3 years, that is, since the beginning of fiscal year '14, we have returned about $3.2 billion to our shareholders. In that same period, we made 9 acquisitions for about $3.3 billion, we fully invested in our existing business, we kept a healthy cash balance and maintained significant dry powder for additional acquisitions.
As we have done consistently in the past, depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders. 
At 9/30/16, based on the current capital market conditions and adjusting for the $1.4 billion special dividend and recent financing, we still have adequate capacity to make over $1 billion of additional acquisitions without issuing any equity. This capacity grows steadily to over $2 billion as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for fiscal year '17.
Now to summarize the fiscal year '16 year. '16 was a busy year. In '16 and early '17, we raised about $3.8 billion. The proceeds were used primarily to fund acquisitions and to pay a special dividend. We were also able to modestly decrease our average interest rate as well as to refinance and extend maturities on certain existing debt. We acquired 3 businesses, as I mentioned, for about $1.4 billion: Breeze-Eastern, DDC and Tactair Young & Franklin. [ph] Kevin will talk a little more about each of these acquisitions. We continued the integration efforts of our various '15 and '16 acquisitions. And most importantly, we continued to generate real value in our new and existing business, and we created substantial intrinsic value for our shareholders.
Now turning to the performance. To remind you, this is the fourth quarter and full year summary for fiscal year '16. Our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. 
The total GAAP revenues were up 8% versus the prior Q4 and 17% on a full year basis. Organic revenue was up about 2% on a full year basis, and Q4 organic growth was up slightly after normalizing for the 1-month reporting delay in Telair 2015 reporting timing, as we've discussed in the previous calls. 
Reviewing the revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q4 and the prior year full year, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up roughly 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were down 4% versus the prior Q4 and roughly flat on a full year basis. Commercial transport OEMs were up 2% on a full year basis and down slightly in Q4. We suspect we are seeing some system-wide inventory adjustments as wide-body rate decreases ripple through the system.
Biz jet revenues continue to drop, with revenues down 15% versus the prior year Q4 and about 10% down on a full year basis. This segment is small compared to commercial transport but has been tougher than we expected all year. For the fiscal year, total commercial OEM bookings were about even with shipments. 
Total commercial aftermarket revenues versus the prior year were up 6.5% for both fiscal year '16 and for Q4. For the full year, commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up about 9.5%. However, this was partially offset by the softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket. Sequentially, revenues were up modestly in the commercial aftermarket. For the full fiscal year, total commercial aftermarket bookings ran slightly ahead of shipments. 
The defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for the year were modestly better than we anticipated. Fiscal year Q4 revenues are up 3% versus the prior year. Full year revenues were up 2% versus the prior fiscal year. Full year defense bookings ran about $50 million behind shipments. This is almost entirely attributable to a few multiyear orders placed in 2015, specifically for the A400 cargo system, a few large international parachute orders and a large order for the APKW [ph] smart bomb system. In total, the rest of the defense bookings were roughly even with shipments. 
In total for fiscal year '16, excluding acquisitions, our revenues for commercial aftermarket were just about as we originally expected, the commercial OEM business was a little lower, and the military revenues were pretty close to our expectation at the start of the year. All in all, total revenues were close to our original expectations.
Moving now to profitability, and on a reported basis, again, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. The as-defined adjustments in Q4 were noncash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. Our EBITDA as defined of about $423 million for Q4 was up 17% versus the prior Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA as defined was roughly $1.5 billion or up 21% from the prior year. The EBITDA as-defined margin was 47% of revenue for the full year and 48.5% for Q4. The full year EBITDA margins, without dilution of the acquisitions purchased in 2015 and '16, was approximately 49% or up 2.5 margin points versus fiscal year '15 for the same mix of businesses we owned going into '15.
With respect to acquisitions, we continually -- we continue to actively look at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities is reasonably active. Once again, closings are always difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on opportunities that meet our tight criteria. 
Now moving on to 2017 guidance. As we head into 2017, we again have concerns about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As you may recall, at the start of fiscal year '16, we reduced our headcount to get ahead of any potential softening. In retrospect, given the wide-body softening and the weaker biz jet revenues, I'm glad we did this. Though we have not yet cut again for fiscal year '17, we're cautious and we're ready to move quickly if necessary.
All in all, this is our best estimate for '17. As you know, we'll update this as the year proceeds. But based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions, our guidance is as follows. The midpoint of the fiscal year '17 revenue guidance is $3.54 billion or up 12% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Organic growth is roughly 4% year-over-year. As in the past years, with roughly 10% less working days in fiscal year 2017 Q1, revenues are anticipated to be lower than the other 3 quarters of fiscal year '17, roughly in proportion to the lower working days. I'm not sure I made this point clear last year, so I'd ask you to keep it in mind as you work through your outlooks. 
The midpoint of fiscal year '17 EBITDA as defined is $1.68 billion or 47.5% of revenues. That's up 13% year-over-year. We anticipate the EBITDA margins will move up throughout the year, as we've seen in previous years. The base business, that is excluding 2 2016 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 48% or up -- or 48.5% or up 1 point versus 2016 for the same mix of businesses that we owned start of 2016. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.98 per share. That's up 4% versus the prior year. This is driven by a significant increase in core operating performance and recent acquisitions, offset in part by higher interest expense and a somewhat higher tax rate. Terry will review this in more detail.
On a pro forma or the same, same-store basis that I talked about before, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits based on worldwide RPM growth in the 5% range. We're hopeful there could be some catch-up upside here, but given the recent history, we remain cautious until we see it. 
Defense military revenue is estimated to be flat to slightly up as a percent of prior year. Given world events and the political uncertainty, there could well be variations here. Commercial OEM growth, we anticipate in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range, primarily due to the 2017 and 2018 commercial transport production rates. We are cautious of any teen [ph] production rates and how this could reflect itself in the 2017 shipments. We are assuming a modest pickup of business jet revenues off a depressed fiscal year 2016.
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in cash and almost $600 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2017. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.5x EBITDA at the end of '17 or down a little over 1 turn. [ph] 
In summary, 2016 was a good and busy year. I'm confident, with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors. 
Now let me hand this over to Kevin who will discuss some of the operating highlights of '16 and a little about '17."

Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fiscal year in 2016. I will now take you through some of the most important operational highlights of the last few quarters. As we have stated previously, we believe our bu",1779,"Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fiscal year in 2016. I will now take you through some of the most important operational highlights of the last few quarters. 
As we have stated previously, we believe our business processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year. 
First, let me provide an update on our acquisition-related value driver. For review, as we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes, but is not limited to, an implementation of our value-creation process and metrics; restructuring the company into our product line focus groups, including co-location of the team members to facilitate communication; focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business; and finally, we tighten up the cost control.
Since the beginning of fiscal year '15, TransDigm has deployed over $3 billion of capital to acquire several value-creation engines for the company. These include the businesses or product lines acquired in fiscal year '15 of Franke Aquarotter, Telair Cargo Group, Pexco Aerospace and PneuDraulics; and in fiscal year '16, the acquisition of Breeze-Eastern Corporation, Data Device Corporation and, most recently, Young & Franklin and its subsidiary, Tactair Fluid Controls. 
Now to quickly update on our fiscal year '15 activity. Franke Aquarotter, a product line acquisition, has now been relocated to our Adams Rite Aerospace facility in Fullerton, [ph] California. After some initial startup issues, the product line and the manufacturing equipment have been successfully transferred. This business is similar to current Adams Rite faucet [ph] businesses and allows them to provide fluid control and accessories across all major large commercial aerospace OEM manufacturers and all major commercial transport platforms. Finally, this business should approach TransDigm margins. 
The Telair Cargo Group was split into 3 businesses along the similar lines as they had been divided under previous ownership. The cargo container company, Nordisk Aviation Products, is led by an internal promotion of Neal McKeever as the President and is located in Norway.
Telair U.S. Cargo Systems, led by the incumbent President at Acquisition, Tim Dumbauld, is based in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and is largely responsible for the design and manufacturing of military cargo handling equipment for the Airbus A400M. 
Finally, the largest segment, Telair International, headquartered in Miesbach, Germany, is led by Marko Enderlein, a recent hire from the Satair Group, a division of Airbus, and is responsible for the design and manufacturing of large commercial cargo handling systems. 
All of these businesses have been fully integrated into our culture and value-generation strategy. Headcount reductions have been performed, where warranted, by business demand an opportunity. Value pricing opportunities have been slightly muted due to long-term agreements, and our new product portfolio has limited aftermarket demand at this stage in the product life cycle. 
As stated previously, we believe this combination of businesses will deliver on the expectations of our acquisition model for TransDigm, a solid business, but one that will be short of company average margins.
Pexco, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used around the aircraft. This business is led by Joe Glover, who was recently placed after the integration with TransDigm was completed. 
To date, we have been able to close the Huntington Beach manufacturing facility and combine all operations into Yakima. We reduced headcount in Yakima to align with our productivity targets, evaluated value-based pricing opportunities and exited noncore production. We believe that this team will continue to perform at expectations and that significant value-generation opportunities exist for the future. This business should run at or above the average EBITDA margins of TransDigm.
PneuDraulics, a manufacturer of precision hydraulic components for the aerospace industry, is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California. At acquisition, PneuDraulics had a strong management team, and this allowed us to place Dain Miller, a long-time PneuDraulics employee, into the role as President. The integration of PneuDraulics has gone to plan, and the group has been an active participant in our culture, management and business process training. The company's performance has delivered on expectations for the 3 value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. We expect this business to deliver at the margin average of TransDigm.
Next, acquired on January 4, 2016, Breeze-Eastern, which is a leading global designer and manufacturer of high-performance lifting and pulling devices for military and civilian aircraft, has been integrated into the TransDigm culture, successfully implementing our value drivers and product line organization strategy. We have established an appropriate pricing structure by streamlining price lists and providing more value-added services to our aftermarket offerings. To help our productivity initiatives, we closed the stand-alone Virginia facility in September and centralized all engineering and product development at the main New Jersey location. This rationalization across the business has allowed a 23% headcount reduction at Breeze-Eastern since acquisition. The business has been reorganized around 2 main product lines, hoists and winches, and our usual customer support team structure has been put in place, with leaders established and team members physically relocated into dedicated work areas. This has allowed for an increased focus on new product development with a number of innovative new products under accelerated development, which we expect to begin contributing to the growth of the business in 2017. The overall results have met our expectations, with revenue and EBITDA at or above our acquisition plan. With some existing LTAs and a few government TINA-covered contracts, this business probably doesn't quite get up to our average EBITDA margins.
Next, we have Data Device Corporation, DDC, located in Bohemia, New York, on Long Island, which was acquired by TransDigm on June 23 of this year. DDC is the world leader in the design, manufacture of high reliability data bus motion control and solid state power controller products for aerospace and defense vehicles. This capability allows them to deliver the smallest, lightest and highest-performing products in the most cost-effective packaging for these applications in the aerospace market. DDC consists of 5 global manufacturing locations and approximately 650 employees. To date, we have aligned the DDC structure with TransDigm's operating strategy around the product line-focused organization. Our product line structure has allowed us to quickly implement 2 product lines of data bus and power, a 10% headcount reduction to better align organizations size and cost structure, review pricing and contractual opportunities and new product initiatives. Although only 4 months under TransDigm, the DDC team and business has delivered value, as expected, for TransDigm shareholders with revenue and EBITDA slightly ahead of expectations. We anticipate this business will be able to deliver EBITDA margins at or in excess of TransDigm averages.
Now, acquired on September 16, the Liver Pool, New York-based Young & Franklin and the subsidiary, Tactair Fluid Controls, are the latest additions to the TransDigm team. They manufacture highly engineered valves and actuators and/or almost all of their products are proprietary. With about 70% of revenues coming from the aerospace industry, the remaining 30% comes from the industrial gas turbine markets. Given the recent nature of the acquisition, and it's too early to comment on the outcome of all of our value-driven initiatives, productivity and enhanced new business initiatives are all being actively investigated, and we will update on these as they come into focus. Additionally, a thorough top-to-bottom review of all contracts, purchase orders and forecasts has been done to evaluate any value based-pricing reset opportunities. However, product line teams have been formed around the IGT and aerospace market segments, and these teams have now been trailed in our culture, methods and expectations. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will live up to model expectations. Although numerous margin expansion opportunities have been identified, we expect this business to achieve margins just under the average for TransDigm.
To update the recent progress on our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to several recent developments in our aerospace market. Our Telair U.S. Cargo Group business was able to overcome a difficult engineering challenge on the Airbus A400M cargo loading system. Telair recently upgraded the design of their highly engineered cargo lockdown mechanism, which holds containers in place during flight. The retrofit program is a one-time upgrade to this restraint system that will allow the containers to be held in place in flight and is also certified to release during an air drop. Going forward, this new design will become part of the OEM package sold to Airbus, and we anticipate normal defense aftermarket demand for maintenance of this critical cargo handling system.
The [indiscernible] Williams Group, which has pioneered technology and lighting protection for over 20 years in design, testing and manufacturing of dielectric fuel and hydraulic lightning isolators for the aerospace market, was awarded the Fuel and Hydraulic System Lightning Isolators for the Boeing 777x and the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 program. This safety-oriented product is put in place to protect the fuel tank in case of a lightning strike. 
For Airbus and their A320 platform, a few key design wins have been recently occurred. Hartwell Corporation recently designed and upgraded engine nasal latch for the A320 CEO or current engine option. This retrofit program is covered by an ESA airworthiness directive requiring airlines to make this upgrade. This new patent pending locking mechanism is designed to prevent a nasal [ph] from being in an unlocked condition after maintenance. 
And for the A320neo, or the latest new engine option, Marathon Norco was just awarded a newly designed fan call hold open device for this platform. These awards added a considerable number of design wins that we have already received for the latest new platforms of A350, A320neo, 737 MAX and 777 AXA across all our business segments. 
Innovation is clearly a focus of our shareholder value-generation culture and value driver strategy. We continue to invest fully in our businesses from legacy to recent acquisitions in the TransDigm family to allow the development of new products and technologies for both the OEM and aftermarket segments. This has allowed TransDigm to, once again, be named to the Forbe's Most Innovative Companies list in the world. This award identifies TransDigm as one of the top 100 global companies in the innovation and the only European or American aerospace company so recognized. 
Now let me hand it over to our CFO, Nick Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail."
22800180,408645074,1085475,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2016",2016-11-14,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year-end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal '1",1281,"Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year-end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal '17.
Fourth quarter net sales were $875 million, up $65 million or approximately 8% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions, PneuDraulics, Breeze-Eastern and DDC contributed $89 million of additional sales for the period, offset by a slight decrease in organic sales. The decrease in organic sales was primarily driven by declines in commercial OEM and defense markets offset by slight growth in commercial aftermarket sales. The organic growth was also negatively impacted due to the prior period, including 4 months of Telair due to a reporting lag as we've previously discussed. 
Our fourth quarter growth profit was $484 million or 55.3% of sales. Our reported gross margin of 55.3% was 2.5 margin points higher than the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved about 3 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure and favorable product mix.
Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12.1% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was 10.3% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago.
We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $27 million versus the prior year quarter due to the increase to outstanding borrowings. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the financing completed during our fiscal third quarter. As part of the financing, we bought an incremental $1.9 billion, of which the proceeds were used to primarily fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including to partially fund the $24 per share special dividend paid on November 1.
Our GAAP effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter compared to 29.1% in the prior year. During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and are now recognized in the income tax provision on the income statement. As a result, our effective tax rate generally approximates our cash tax rate.
Our full year GAAP effective tax rate is 23.7% compared to 29.8% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the current year was primarily due to the accounting standard change. Excluding the accounting standard change, our 2016 effective tax rate is 29%, the same rate that we use for our full year adjusted EPS. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $13 million or 9% to $155 million, which is 17.7% of sales. This compares to net income of $142 million or 17.5% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales versus prior period, improvements to our operating margin and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
GAAP EPS was $2.70 per share in the current quarter compared to $2.50 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $3.29 per share, an increase of 16% compared to the $2.83 per share last year. Please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Since this is our fiscal year-end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some significant items. Net sales increased $464 million or by 17% to end our the year at almost $3.2 billion in revenues. Acquisitions contributed $409 million of the increase in sales. Organic sales were 2% above the prior year. Reported gross profit increased 19% to $1.73 billion and was 54.5% of sales compared to 53.6% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition activity and stock compensation expense, our full year margin versus prior year improved over 2 margin points.
Selling and administrative expenses of 12.1% of sales in fiscal year '15 is slightly higher than the 11.9 of sales -- excuse me, in fiscal year '16, slightly ahead of 11.9% of sales in fiscal year '15. Again, excluding all acquisition-related expenses, stock compensation and nonoperating expenses, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales last year.
Net interest expense increased $65 million due to the increase in weighted average outstanding borrowings to $8.8 billion from $7.8 billion last year. Our fiscal year '16 weighted average cash interest rate was 5.3%. Adjusted EPS was $11.49 per share this year, up 28% from the $9.01 per share a year ago. 
Switching gears to cash and liquidity. The company generated $668 million of cash from operating activities, and we closed the year with $1.59 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company's gross debt leverage ratio at September 30, 2016 was approximately 6.5x of pro forma EBITDA and 5.5x pro forma EBITDA on a net basis. Adjusting for the dividend and financing that occurred subsequent to our fiscal year-end, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage would have been 6.4x on a pro forma basis.
We believe fiscal year '16 was another great year for TransDigm and our shareholders. As we look forward to fiscal year '17, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP EPS to be $8.65, and as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.98. As we disclosed on Slide 9, there's $3.33 in adjustments to bridge the GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. 
Nick provided color on fiscal year '17 sales and EBITDA as defined. As a result of the recent acquisition activity, refinancing and dividend, I'm going to walk through the cost below. EBITDA as defined explained why adjusted net income per share increase is 4% despite EBITDA as defined growing 13%. Both percentages assume the midpoint of the guidance. So depreciation and amortization, excluding backlog amortization of approximately $25 million, is expected to be $121 million compared to $102 million in fiscal year '16, an increase of 19%. Interest expense is also expected to increase about 20% to around $500 million -- $580 million in fiscal year '17. This estimate reflects the latest financing just completed in October and includes both cash and interest and approximately $20 million of amortization of debt issuance cost. Also, the forecast assumes average LIBOR increase of 1% for the full year.
We also expect $33 million in refinancing fees. Our effective tax rate for both GAAP and adjusted EPS in fiscal year '17 is expected to be around 31%. The benefit from fiscal year '17's stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments will be recorded as discrete adjustments throughout the quarters and will reduce our GAAP tax rate along with our cash taxes.
We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will increase slightly and be approximately $56.5 million of shares. As a result of these items, our adjusted EPS of $11.98 is approximately 4% greater than fiscal year '16. 
Finally, with regards to our liquidity and leverage, after paying a special dividend and assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of cash on hand at the end of fiscal year '17. This includes an estimate of CapEx of $85 million or approximately 2.4% of sales. Again, as Nick mentioned, assuming no other acquisition activity, our net leverage will be around 5.5x our EBITDA as defined at September 30, 2017 or delevering almost 1 full turn. 
I will hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A session at this time."

I'll then overview a busy fiscal year '16. I'll review the initial guidance for '17. Kevin will then review some key operating items for '16 and '17, and Terry will run through the financials. 
A fair amount to cover here today. To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this, about 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products. About 3/4 of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole-source provider. Over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet. We follow a consistent, long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology based on our 3 value driver concepts. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that is closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our effort to create shareholder value.
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have 4. Our priorities are typically in the following order: one, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. To state again, these 2 are almost always our first choices. Third, give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt, but given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions. 
In the last 3 years, you've seen 3 distinct business environments and corresponding real-life examples of how we manage our capital structure to best take advantage of the current business and capital market environment. In fiscal year '14, with the acquisition opportunities not particularly compelling, we gave back about $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of a large special dividend and some modest stock buyback. In fiscal year '15, we saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates. We acquired about $1.6 billion worth of proprietary aerospace businesses that met our strategic and shareholder return requirements. In fiscal '16, we again saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates that meet our -- met our criteria. As a result, we acquired another $1.4 billion of aerospace businesses. In addition, the combination of our usual high cash flow and continuing attractive credit markets allowed us to return about $1.6 billion more to our shareholders in the form of roughly $200 million of share buyback plus a $1.4 billion special dividend paid out in early '17.
To summarize, over the last 3 years, that is, since the beginning of fiscal year '14, we have returned about $3.2 billion to our shareholders. In that same period, we made 9 acquisitions for about $3.3 billion, we fully invested in our existing business, we kept a healthy cash balance and maintained significant dry powder for additional acquisitions.
As we have done consistently in the past, depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders. 
At 9/30/16, based on the current capital market conditions and adjusting for the $1.4 billion special dividend and recent financing, we still have adequate capacity to make over $1 billion of additional acquisitions without issuing any equity. This capacity grows steadily to over $2 billion as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for fiscal year '17.
Now to summarize the fiscal year '16 year. '16 was a busy year. In '16 and early '17, we raised about $3.8 billion. The proceeds were used primarily to fund acquisitions and to pay a special dividend. We were also able to modestly decrease our average interest rate as well as to refinance and extend maturities on certain existing debt. We acquired 3 businesses, as I mentioned, for about $1.4 billion: Breeze-Eastern, DDC and Tactair Young & Franklin. Kevin will talk a little more about each of these acquisitions. We continued the integration efforts of our various '15 and '16 acquisitions. And most importantly, we continued to generate real value in our new and existing business, and we created substantial intrinsic value for our shareholders.
Now turning to the performance. To remind you, this is the fourth quarter and full year summary for fiscal year '16. Our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. 
The total GAAP revenues were up 8% versus the prior Q4 and 17% on a full year basis. Organic revenue was up about 2% on a full year basis, and Q4 organic growth was up slightly after normalizing for the 1-month reporting delay in Telair 2015 reporting timing, as we've discussed in the previous calls. 
Reviewing the revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q4 and the prior year full year, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up roughly 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were down 4% versus the prior Q4 and roughly flat on a full year basis. Commercial transport OEMs were up 2% on a full year basis and down slightly in Q4. We suspect we are seeing some system-wide inventory adjustments as wide-body rate decreases ripple through the system.
Biz jet revenues continue to drop, with revenues down 15% versus the prior year Q4 and about 10% down on a full year basis. This segment is small compared to commercial transport but has been tougher than we expected all year. For the fiscal year, total commercial OEM bookings were about even with shipments. 
Total commercial aftermarket revenues versus the prior year were up 6.5% for both fiscal year '16 and for Q4. For the full year, commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up about 9.5%. However, this was partially offset by the softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket. Sequentially, revenues were up modestly in the commercial aftermarket. For the full fiscal year, total commercial aftermarket bookings ran slightly ahead of shipments. 
The defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for the year were modestly better than we anticipated. Fiscal year Q4 revenues are up 3% versus the prior year. Full year revenues were up 2% versus the prior fiscal year. Full year defense bookings ran about $50 million behind shipments. This is almost entirely attributable to a few multiyear orders placed in 2015, specifically for the A400 cargo system, a few large international parachute orders and a large order for the APKW smart bomb system. In total, the rest of the defense bookings were roughly even with shipments. 
In total for fiscal year '16, excluding acquisitions, our revenues for commercial aftermarket were just about as we originally expected, the commercial OEM business was a little lower, and the military revenues were pretty close to our expectation at the start of the year. All in all, total revenues were close to our original expectations.
Moving now to profitability, and on a reported basis, again, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. The as-defined adjustments in Q4 were noncash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. Our EBITDA as defined of about $423 million for Q4 was up 17% versus the prior Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA as defined was roughly $1.5 billion or up 21% from the prior year. The EBITDA as-defined margin was 47% of revenue for the full year and 48.5% for Q4. The full year EBITDA margins, without dilution of the acquisitions purchased in 2015 and '16, was approximately 49% or up 2.5 margin points versus fiscal year '15 for the same mix of businesses we owned going into '15.
With respect to acquisitions, we continually -- we continue to actively look at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities is reasonably active. Once again, closings are always difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on opportunities that meet our tight criteria. 
Now moving on to 2017 guidance. As we head into 2017, we again have concerns about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As you may recall, at the start of fiscal year '16, we reduced our headcount to get ahead of any potential softening. In retrospect, given the wide-body softening and the weaker biz jet revenues, I'm glad we did this. Though we have not yet cut again for fiscal year '17, we're cautious and we're ready to move quickly if necessary.
All in all, this is our best estimate for '17. As you know, we'll update this as the year proceeds. But based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions, our guidance is as follows. The midpoint of the fiscal year '17 revenue guidance is $3.54 billion or up 12% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Organic growth is roughly 4% year-over-year. As in the past years, with roughly 10% less working days in fiscal year 2017 Q1, revenues are anticipated to be lower than the other 3 quarters of fiscal year '17, roughly in proportion to the lower working days. I'm not sure I made this point clear last year, so I'd ask you to keep it in mind as you work through your outlooks. 
The midpoint of fiscal year '17 EBITDA as defined is $1.68 billion or 47.5% of revenues. That's up 13% year-over-year. We anticipate the EBITDA margins will move up throughout the year, as we've seen in previous years. The base business, that is excluding 2 2016 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 48% or up -- or 48.5% or up 1 point versus 2016 for the same mix of businesses that we owned start of 2016. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.98 per share. That's up 4% versus the prior year. This is driven by a significant increase in core operating performance and recent acquisitions, offset in part by higher interest expense and a somewhat higher tax rate. Terry will review this in more detail.
On a pro forma or the same, same-store basis that I talked about before, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits based on worldwide RPM growth in the 5% range. We're hopeful there could be some catch-up upside here, but given the recent history, we remain cautious until we see it. 
Defense military revenue is estimated to be flat to slightly up as a percent of prior year. Given world events and the political uncertainty, there could well be variations here. Commercial OEM growth, we anticipate in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range, primarily due to the 2017 and 2018 commercial transport production rates. We are cautious about '18 production rates and how this could reflect itself in the 2017 shipments. We are assuming a modest pickup of business jet revenues off a depressed fiscal year 2016.
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in cash and almost $600 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2017. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.5x EBITDA at the end of '17 or down a little over 1 turn.
In summary, 2016 was a good and busy year. I'm confident, with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors. 
Now let me hand this over to Kevin who will discuss some of the operating highlights of '16 and a little about '17."
22800180,408645074,1085644,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2016",2016-11-14,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fiscal year in 2016. I will now take you through some of the most important operational highlights of the last few quarters. As we have stated previously, we believe our bu",1770,"Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fiscal year in 2016. I will now take you through some of the most important operational highlights of the last few quarters. 
As we have stated previously, we believe our business processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year. 
First, let me provide an update on our acquisition-related value driver. For review, as we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes, but is not limited to, an implementation of our value-creation process and metrics; restructuring the company into our product line focus groups, including co-location of the team members to facilitate communication; focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business; and finally, we tighten up the cost control.
Since the beginning of fiscal year '15, TransDigm has deployed over $3 billion of capital to acquire several value-creation engines for the company. These include the businesses or product lines acquired in fiscal year '15 of Franke Aquarotter, Telair Cargo Group, Pexco Aerospace and PneuDraulics; and in fiscal year '16, the acquisition of Breeze-Eastern Corporation, Data Device Corporation and, most recently, Young & Franklin and its subsidiary, Tactair Fluid Controls. 
Now to quickly update on our fiscal year '15 activity. Franke Aquarotter, a product line acquisition, has now been relocated to our Adams Rite Aerospace facility in Fullerton, California. After some initial startup issues, the product line and the manufacturing equipment have been successfully transferred. This business is similar to current Adams Rite faucet businesses and allows them to provide fluid control and accessories across all major large commercial aerospace OEM manufacturers and all major commercial transport platforms. Finally, this business should approach TransDigm margins. 
The Telair Cargo Group was split into 3 businesses along the similar lines as they had been divided under previous ownership. The cargo container company, Nordisk Aviation Products, is led by an internal promotion of Neal McKeever as the President and is located in Norway.
Telair U.S. Cargo Systems, led by the incumbent President at Acquisition, Tim Dumbauld, is based in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and is largely responsible for the design and manufacturing of military cargo handling equipment for the Airbus A400M. 
Finally, the largest segment, Telair International, headquartered in Miesbach, Germany, is led by Marko Enderlein, a recent hire from the Satair Group, a division of Airbus, and is responsible for the design and manufacturing of large commercial cargo handling systems. 
All of these businesses have been fully integrated into our culture and value-generation strategy. Headcount reductions have been performed, where warranted, by business demand an opportunity. Value pricing opportunities have been slightly muted due to long-term agreements, and our new product portfolio has limited aftermarket demand at this stage in the product life cycle. 
As stated previously, we believe this combination of businesses will deliver on the expectations of our acquisition model for TransDigm, a solid business, but one that will be short of company average margins.
Pexco, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used around the aircraft. This business is led by Joe Glover, who was recently placed after the integration with TransDigm was completed. 
To date, we have been able to close the Huntington Beach manufacturing facility and combine all operations into Yakima. We reduced headcount in Yakima to align with our productivity targets, evaluated value-based pricing opportunities and exited noncore production. We believe that this team will continue to perform at expectations and that significant value-generation opportunities exist for the future. This business should run at or above the average EBITDA margins of TransDigm.
PneuDraulics, a manufacturer of precision hydraulic components for the aerospace industry, is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California. At acquisition, PneuDraulics had a strong management team, and this allowed us to place Dain Miller, a long-time PneuDraulics employee, into the role as President. The integration of PneuDraulics has gone to plan, and the group has been an active participant in our culture, management and business process training. The company's performance has delivered on expectations for the 3 value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. We expect this business to deliver at the margin average of TransDigm.
Next, acquired on January 4, 2016, Breeze-Eastern, which is a leading global designer and manufacturer of high-performance lifting and pulling devices for military and civilian aircraft, has been integrated into the TransDigm culture, successfully implementing our value drivers and product line organization strategy. We have established an appropriate pricing structure by streamlining price lists and providing more value-added services to our aftermarket offerings. To help our productivity initiatives, we closed the stand-alone Virginia facility in September and centralized all engineering and product development at the main New Jersey location. This rationalization across the business has allowed a 23% headcount reduction at Breeze-Eastern since acquisition. The business has been reorganized around 2 main product lines, hoists and winches, and our usual customer support team structure has been put in place, with leaders established and team members physically relocated into dedicated work areas. This has allowed for an increased focus on new product development with a number of innovative new products under accelerated development, which we expect to begin contributing to the growth of the business in 2017. The overall results have met our expectations, with revenue and EBITDA at or above our acquisition plan. With some existing LTAs and a few government TINA-covered contracts, this business probably doesn't quite get up to our average EBITDA margins.
Next, we have Data Device Corporation, DDC, located in Bohemia, New York, on Long Island, which was acquired by TransDigm on June 23 of this year. DDC is the world leader in the design, manufacture of high-reliability data bus motion control and solid-state power controller products for aerospace and defense vehicles. This capability allows them to deliver the smallest, lightest and highest-performing products in the most cost-effective packaging for these applications in the aerospace market. DDC consists of 5 global manufacturing locations and approximately 650 employees. To date, we have aligned the DDC structure with TransDigm's operating strategy around a product line-focused organization. Our product line structure has allowed us to quickly implement 2 product lines of data bus and power, a 10% headcount reduction to better align organization size and cost structure, review of pricing and contractual opportunities and new product initiatives. Although only 4 months under TransDigm, the DDC team and business has delivered value, as expected, for TransDigm shareholders, with revenue and EBITDA slightly ahead of expectations. We anticipate this business will be able to deliver EBITDA margins at or in excess of TransDigm averages.
Now acquired on September 16, the Liverpool, New York-based Young & Franklin and the subsidiary, Tactair Fluid Controls, are the latest additions to the TransDigm team. They manufacture highly engineered valves and actuators and are -- almost all of their products are proprietary. With about 70% of revenues coming from the aerospace industry, the remaining 30% comes from the industrial gas turbine markets. Given the recent nature of the acquisition, it is too early to comment on the outcome of all of our value-driven initiatives. Productivity and enhanced new business initiatives are all being actively investigated, and we will update on these as they come into focus. Additionally, a thorough top-to-bottom review of all contracts, purchase orders and forecasts has been done to evaluate any value-based pricing reset opportunities. However, product line teams have been formed around the IGT [ph] and aerospace market segments, and these teams have now been trained in our culture, methods and expectations. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will live up to model expectations. Although numerous margin expansion opportunities have been identified, we expect this business to achieve margins just under the average for TransDigm.
To update the recent progress on our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to several recent developments in our aerospace market. Our Telair U.S. Cargo Group business was able to overcome a difficult engineering challenge on the Airbus A400M cargo loading system. Telair recently upgraded the design of their highly engineered cargo lockdown mechanism, which holds containers in place during flight. The retrofit program is a onetime upgrade to this restraint system that will allow the containers to be held in place in flight and is also certified to release during an air drop. Going forward, this new design will become part of the OEM package sold to Airbus, and we anticipate normal defense aftermarket demand for maintenance of this critical cargo handling system.
The AdelWiggins Group, which has pioneered technology in lighting protection for over 20 years and design, testing and manufacturing of dielectric fuel and hydraulic lightning isolators for the aerospace market, was awarded the fuel and hydraulic system lightning isolators for the Boeing 777X and the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 program. This safety-oriented product is put in place to protect the fuel tank in case of a lightning strike. 
For Airbus and their A320 platform, a few key design wins have recently occurred. Hartwell Corporation recently designed an upgraded engine nacelle latch for the A320ceo, or current engine option. This retrofit program is covered by an ESA airworthiness directive requiring airlines to make this upgrade. This new patent-pending locking mechanism is designed to prevent a nacelle from being in an unlocked condition after maintenance. 
And for the A320neo, or the latest new engine option, MarathonNorco was just awarded a newly designed fan cowl hold open device for this platform. These awards added a considerable number of design wins that we have already received for the latest new platforms of A350, A320neo, 737 MAX and 777X across all our business segments. 
Innovation is clearly a focus of our shareholder value-generation culture and value-driver strategy. We continue to invest fully in our businesses, from legacy to recent acquisitions of the TransDigm family, to allow the development of new products and technologies for both the OEM and aftermarket segments. This has allowed TransDigm to once again be named to the Forbe's Most Innovative Companies list in the world. This award identifies TransDigm as one of the top 100 global companies in the innovation and the only European or American aerospace company so recognized. 
Now let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail."
22800180,408645074,1085644,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2016",2016-11-14,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year-end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal '1",1285,"Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year-end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal '17.
Fourth quarter net sales were $875 million, up $65 million or approximately 8% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions, PneuDraulics, Breeze-Eastern and DDC, contributed $89 million of additional sales for the period, offset by a slight decrease in organic sales. The decrease in organic sales was primarily driven by declines in commercial OEM and defense markets offset by slight growth in commercial aftermarket sales. The organic growth was also negatively impacted due to the prior period, including 4 months of Telair due to a reporting lag, as we've previously discussed. 
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $484 million or 55.3% of sales. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.3% was 2.5 margin points higher than the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved about 3 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure and favorable product mix.
Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12.1% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was 10.3% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago.
We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $27 million versus the prior year quarter due to the increase in -- to outstanding borrowings. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the financing completed during our fiscal third quarter. As part of the financing, we borrowed an incremental $1.9 billion, of which the proceeds were used to primarily fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including to partially fund the $24 per share special dividend paid on November 1.
Our GAAP effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter compared to 29.1% in the prior year. During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and are now recognized in the income tax provision on the income statement. As a result, our effective tax rate generally approximates our cash tax rate.
Our full year GAAP effective tax rate is 23.7% compared to 29.8% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the current year was primarily due to the accounting standard change. Excluding the accounting standard change, our 2016 effective tax rate is 29%, the same rate that we use for our full year adjusted EPS. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $13 million or 9% to $155 million, which is 17.7% of sales. This compares to net income of $142 million or 17.5% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales versus prior period, improvements to our operating margin and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
GAAP EPS was $2.70 per share in the current quarter compared to $2.50 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $3.29 per share, an increase of 16% compared to the $2.83 per share last year. Please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Since this is our fiscal year-end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some significant items. Net sales increased $464 million or by 17% to end our year at almost $3.2 billion in revenues. Acquisitions contributed $409 million of the increase in sales. Organic sales were 2% above the prior year. Reported gross profit increased 19% to $1.73 billion and was 54.5% of sales compared to 53.6% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition activity and stock compensation expense, our full year margin versus prior year improved over 2 margin points.
Selling and administrative expenses of 12.1% of sales in fiscal year '15 is slightly higher than the 11.9% of sales -- excuse me, in fiscal year '16 is slightly ahead of 11.9% of sales in fiscal year '15. Again, excluding all acquisition-related expenses, stock compensation and nonoperating expenses, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales last year.
Net interest expense increased $65 million due to the increase in weighted average outstanding borrowings to $8.8 billion from $7.8 billion last year. Our fiscal year '16 weighted average cash interest rate was 5.3%. Adjusted EPS was $11.49 per share this year, up 28% from the $9.01 per share a year ago. 
Switching gears to cash and liquidity. The company generated $668 million of cash from operating activities, and we closed the year with $1.59 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company's gross debt leverage ratio at September 30, 2016, was approximately 6.5x of pro forma EBITDA and 5.5x pro forma EBITDA on a net basis. Adjusting for the dividend and financing that occurred subsequent to our fiscal year-end, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage would have been 6.4x on a pro forma basis.
We believe fiscal year '16 was another great year for TransDigm and our shareholders. As we look forward to fiscal year '17, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP EPS to be $8.65, and as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.98. As we disclose on Slide 9, there's $3.33 in adjustments to bridge the GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. 
Nick provided color on fiscal year '17 sales and EBITDA as defined. As a result of the recent acquisition activity, refinancing and dividend, I'm going to walk through the costs below EBITDA as defined and explain why adjusted net income per share increases 4% despite EBITDA as defined growing 13%. Both percentages assume the midpoint of the guidance. So depreciation and amortization, excluding backlog amortization of approximately $25 million, is expected to be $121 million compared to $102 million in fiscal year '16, an increase of 19%. Interest expense is also expected to increase about 20% to around $500 million -- $580 million in fiscal year '17. This estimate reflects the latest financing just completed in October and includes both cash and interest and approximately $20 million of amortization of debt issuance cost. Also in the forecast assumes average LIBOR increase to [ph] 1% for the full year.
We also expect $33 million in refinancing fees. Our effective tax rate for both GAAP and adjusted EPS in fiscal year '17 is expected to be around 31%. The benefit from fiscal year '17's stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments will be recorded as discrete adjustments throughout the quarters and will reduce our GAAP tax rate along with our cash taxes.
We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will increase slightly and be approximately 56.5 million shares. As a result of these items, our adjusted EPS of $11.98 is approximately 4% greater than fiscal year '16. 
Finally, with regards to our liquidity and leverage, after paying a special dividend and assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of cash on hand at the end of fiscal year '17. This includes an estimate of CapEx of $85 million or approximately 2.4% of sales. Again, as Nick mentioned, assuming no other acquisition activity, our net leverage will be around 5.5x our EBITDA as defined at September 30, 2017, or delevering almost 1 full turn. 
I will hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A session at this time."

I'll then overview a busy fiscal year '16. I'll review the initial guidance for '17. Kevin will then review some key operating items for '16 and '17, and Terry will run through the financials. 
A fair amount to cover here today. To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this: About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, about 3/4 of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole-source provider, over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet. We follow a consistent, long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology based on our 3 value driver concepts. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that is closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our effort to create shareholder value.
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have 4. Our priorities are typically in the following order: one, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. To state again, these 2 are almost always our first choices. Third, give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt, but given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions. 
In the last 3 years, you've seen 3 distinct business environments and corresponding real-life examples of how we manage our capital structure to best take advantage of the current business and capital market environment. In fiscal year '14, with the acquisition opportunities not particularly compelling, we gave back about $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of a large special dividend and some modest stock buyback. In fiscal year '15, we saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates. We acquired about $1.6 billion worth of proprietary aerospace businesses that met our strategic and shareholder return requirements. In fiscal '16, we again saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates that meet our -- met our criteria. As a result, we acquired another $1.4 billion of aerospace businesses. In addition, the combination of our usual high cash flow and continuing attractive credit markets allowed us to return about $1.6 billion more to our shareholders in the form of roughly $200 million of share buyback plus a $1.4 billion special dividend paid out in early '17.
To summarize, over the last 3 years, that is, since the beginning of fiscal year '14, we have returned about $3.2 billion to our shareholders. In that same period, we made 9 acquisitions for about $3.3 billion, we fully invested in our existing business, we kept a healthy cash balance and maintained significant dry powder for additional acquisitions.
As we have done consistently in the past, depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders. 
At 9/30/16, based on the current capital market conditions and adjusting for the $1.4 billion special dividend and recent financing, we still have adequate capacity to make over $1 billion of additional acquisitions without issuing any equity. This capacity grows steadily to over $2 billion as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for fiscal year '17.
Now to summarize the fiscal year '16 year. '16 was a busy year. In '16 and early '17, we raised about $3.8 billion. The proceeds were used primarily to fund acquisitions and to pay a special dividend. We were also able to modestly decrease our average interest rate as well as to refinance and extend maturities on certain existing debt. We acquired 3 businesses, as I mentioned, for about $1.4 billion: Breeze-Eastern, DDC and Tactair Young & Franklin. Kevin will talk a little more about each of these acquisitions. We continued the integration efforts of our various '15 and '16 acquisitions. And most importantly, we continued to generate real value in our new and existing business, and we created substantial intrinsic value for our shareholders.
Now turning to the performance. To remind you, this is the fourth quarter and full year summary for fiscal year '16. Our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. 
The total GAAP revenues were up 8% versus the prior Q4 and 17% on a full year basis. Organic revenue was up about 2% on a full year basis, and Q4 organic growth was up slightly after normalizing for the 1-month reporting delay in Telair 2015 reporting timing, as we've discussed in the previous calls. 
Reviewing the revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q4 and the prior year full year, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up roughly 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were down 4% versus the prior Q4 and roughly flat on a full year basis. Commercial transport OEMs were up 2% on a full year basis and down slightly in Q4. We suspect we are seeing some system-wide inventory adjustments as wide-body rate decreases ripple through the system.
Biz jet revenues continue to drop, with revenues down 15% versus the prior year Q4 and about 10% down on a full year basis. This segment is small compared to commercial transport but has been tougher than we expected all year. For the fiscal year, total commercial OEM bookings were about even with shipments. 
Total commercial aftermarket revenues versus the prior year were up 6.5% for both fiscal year '16 and for Q4. For the full year, commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up about 9.5%. However, this was partially offset by the softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket. Sequentially, revenues were up modestly in the commercial aftermarket. For the full fiscal year, total commercial aftermarket bookings ran slightly ahead of shipments. 
The defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for the year were modestly better than we anticipated. Fiscal year Q4 revenues are up 3% versus the prior year. Full year revenues were up 2% versus the prior fiscal year. Full year defense bookings ran about $50 million behind shipments. This is almost entirely attributable to a few multiyear orders placed in 2015, specifically for the A400 cargo system, a few large international parachute orders and a large order for the APKW smart bomb system. In total, the rest of the defense bookings were roughly even with shipments. 
In total for fiscal year '16, excluding acquisitions, our revenues for commercial aftermarket were just about as we originally expected, the commercial OEM business was a little lower, and the military revenues were pretty close to our expectation at the start of the year. All in all, total revenues were close to our original expectations.
Moving now to profitability, and on a reported basis, again, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. The as-defined adjustments in Q4 were noncash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. Our EBITDA as defined of about $423 million for Q4 was up 17% versus the prior Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA as defined was roughly $1.5 billion or up 21% from the prior year. The EBITDA as-defined margin was 47% of revenue for the full year and 48.5% for Q4. The full year EBITDA margins, without dilution of the acquisitions purchased in 2015 and '16, was approximately 49% or up 2.5 margin points versus fiscal year '15 for the same mix of businesses we owned going into '15.
With respect to acquisitions, we continually -- we continue to actively look at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities is reasonably active. Once again, closings are always difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on opportunities that meet our tight criteria. 
Now moving on to 2017 guidance. As we head into 2017, we again have concerns about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As you may recall, at the start of fiscal year '16, we reduced our headcount to get ahead of any potential softening. In retrospect, given the wide-body softening and the weaker biz jet revenues, I'm glad we did this. Though we have not yet cut again for fiscal year '17, we're cautious and we're ready to move quickly if necessary.
All in all, this is our best estimate for '17. As you know, we'll update this as the year proceeds. But based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions, our guidance is as follows. The midpoint of the fiscal year '17 revenue guidance is $3.54 billion or up 12% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Organic growth is roughly 4% year-over-year. As in the past years, with roughly 10% less working days in fiscal year 2017 Q1, revenues are anticipated to be lower than the other 3 quarters of fiscal year '17, roughly in proportion to the lower working days. I'm not sure I made this point clear last year, so I'd ask you to keep it in mind as you work through your outlooks. 
The midpoint of fiscal year '17 EBITDA as defined is $1.68 billion or 47.5% of revenues. That's up 13% year-over-year. We anticipate the EBITDA margins will move up throughout the year, as we've seen in previous years. The base business, that is excluding 2016 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 48% or up -- or 48.5% or up 1 point versus 2016 for the same mix of businesses that we owned at the start of 2016. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.98 per share. That's up 4% versus the prior year. This is driven by a significant increase in core operating performance and recent acquisitions, offset in part by higher interest expense and a somewhat higher tax rate. Terry will review this in more detail.
On a pro forma or the same, same-store basis that I talked about before, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits based on worldwide RPM growth in the 5% range. We're hopeful there could be some catch-up upside here, but given the recent history, we remain cautious until we see it. 
Defense military revenue is estimated to be flat to slightly up as a percent of prior year. Given world events and the political uncertainty, there could well be variations here. Commercial OEM growth, we anticipate in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range, primarily due to the 2017 and 2018 commercial transport production rates. We are cautious about '18 production rates and how this could reflect itself in the 2017 shipments. We are assuming a modest pickup of business jet revenues off a depressed fiscal year 2016.
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in cash and almost $600 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2017. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.5x EBITDA at the end of '17 or down a little over 1 turn.
In summary, 2016 was a good and busy year. I'm confident, with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors. 
Now let me hand this over to Kevin, who will discuss some of the operating highlights of '16 and a little about '17."

I will now take you through some of the most important operational highlights of the last few quarters. 
As we have stated previously, we believe our business processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year. 
First, let me provide an update on our acquisition-related value driver. For review, as we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes, but is not limited to, an implementation of our value-creation process and metrics; restructuring the company into our product line focus groups, including co-location of the team members to facilitate communication; focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business; and finally, we tighten up the cost control.
Since the beginning of fiscal year '15, TransDigm has deployed over $3 billion of capital to acquire several value-creation engines for the company. These include the businesses or product lines acquired in fiscal year '15 of Franke Aquarotter, Telair Cargo Group, Pexco Aerospace and PneuDraulics; and in fiscal year '16, the acquisition of Breeze-Eastern Corporation, Data Device Corporation and, most recently, Young & Franklin and its subsidiary, Tactair Fluid Controls. 
Now to quickly update on our fiscal year '15 activity. Franke Aquarotter, a product line acquisition, has now been relocated to our Adams Rite Aerospace facility in Fullerton, California. After some initial startup issues, the product line and the manufacturing equipment have been successfully transferred. This business is similar to current Adams Rite faucet businesses and allows them to provide fluid control and accessories across all major large commercial aerospace OEM manufacturers and all major commercial transport platforms. Finally, this business should approach TransDigm margins. 
The Telair Cargo Group was split into 3 businesses along the similar lines as they had been divided under previous ownership. The cargo container company, Nordisk Aviation Products, is led by an internal promotion of Neal McKeever as the President and is located in Norway.
Telair U.S. Cargo Systems, led by the incumbent President at acquisition, Tim Dumbauld, is based in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and is largely responsible for the design and manufacturing of military cargo handling equipment for the Airbus A400M. 
Finally, the largest segment, Telair International, headquartered in Miesbach, Germany, is led by Marko Enderlein, a recent hire from the Satair Group, a division of Airbus, and is responsible for the design and manufacturing of large commercial cargo handling systems. 
All of these businesses have been fully integrated into our culture and value-generation strategy. Headcount reductions have been performed, where warranted, by business demand and opportunity. Value pricing opportunities have been slightly muted due to long-term agreements, and our new product portfolio has limited aftermarket demand at this stage in the product life cycle. 
As stated previously, we believe this combination of businesses will deliver on the expectations of our acquisition model for TransDigm, a solid business, but one that will be short of company average margins.
Pexco, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used around the aircraft. This business is led by Joe Glover, who was recently placed after the integration with TransDigm was completed. 
To date, we have been able to close the Huntington Beach manufacturing facility and combine all operations into Yakima. We reduced headcount in Yakima to align with our productivity targets, evaluated value-based pricing opportunities and exited noncore production. We believe that this team will continue to perform at expectations and that significant value-generation opportunities exist for the future. This business should run at or above the average EBITDA margins of TransDigm.
PneuDraulics, a manufacturer of precision hydraulic components for the aerospace industry, is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California. At acquisition, PneuDraulics had a strong management team, and this allowed us to place Dain Miller, a long-time PneuDraulics employee, into the role as President. The integration of PneuDraulics has gone to plan, and the group has been an active participant in our culture, management and business process training. The company's performance has delivered on expectations for the 3 value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. We expect this business to deliver at the margin average of TransDigm.
Next, acquired on January 4, 2016, Breeze-Eastern, which is a leading global designer and manufacturer of high-performance lifting and pulling devices for military and civilian aircraft, has been integrated into the TransDigm culture, successfully implementing our value drivers and product line organization strategy. We have established an appropriate pricing structure by streamlining price lists and providing more value-added services to our aftermarket offerings. To help our productivity initiatives, we closed the stand-alone Virginia facility in September and centralized all engineering and product development at the main New Jersey location. This rationalization across the business has allowed a 23% headcount reduction at Breeze-Eastern since acquisition. The business has been reorganized around 2 main product lines, hoists and winches, and our usual customer support team structure has been put in place, with leaders established and team members physically relocated into dedicated work areas. This has allowed for an increased focus on new product development with a number of innovative new products under accelerated development, which we expect to begin contributing to the growth of the business in 2017. The overall results have met our expectations, with revenue and EBITDA at or above our acquisition plan. With some existing LTAs and a few government TINA-covered contracts, this business probably doesn't quite get up to our average EBITDA margins.
Next, we have Data Device Corporation, DDC, located in Bohemia, New York, on Long Island, which was acquired by TransDigm on June 23 of this year. DDC is the world leader in the design, manufacture of high-reliability data bus motion control and solid-state power controller products for aerospace and defense vehicles. This capability allows them to deliver the smallest, lightest and highest-performing products in the most cost-effective packaging for these applications in the aerospace market. DDC consists of 5 global manufacturing locations and approximately 650 employees. To date, we have aligned the DDC structure with TransDigm's operating strategy around a product line-focused organization. Our product line structure has allowed us to quickly implement 2 product lines of data bus and power, a 10% headcount reduction to better align organization size and cost structure, review of pricing and contractual opportunities and new product initiatives. Although only 4 months under TransDigm, the DDC team and business has delivered value, as expected, for TransDigm shareholders, with revenue and EBITDA slightly ahead of expectations. We anticipate this business will be able to deliver EBITDA margins at or in excess of TransDigm averages.
Now acquired on September 16, the Liverpool, New York-based Young & Franklin and the subsidiary, Tactair Fluid Controls, are the latest additions to the TransDigm team. They manufacture highly engineered valves and actuators and are -- almost all of their products are proprietary. With about 70% of revenues coming from the aerospace industry, the remaining 30% comes from the industrial gas turbine markets. Given the recent nature of the acquisition, it is too early to comment on the outcome of all of our value-driven initiatives. Productivity and enhanced new business initiatives are all being actively investigated, and we will update on these as they come into focus. Additionally, a thorough top-to-bottom review of all contracts, purchase orders and forecasts has been done to evaluate any value-based pricing reset opportunities. However, product line teams have been formed around the IGT and aerospace market segments, and these teams have now been trained in our culture, methods and expectations. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will live up to model expectations. Although numerous margin expansion opportunities have been identified, we expect this business to achieve margins just under the average for TransDigm.
To update the recent progress on our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to several recent developments in our aerospace market. Our Telair U.S. Cargo Group business was able to overcome a difficult engineering challenge on the Airbus A400M cargo loading system. Telair recently upgraded the design of their highly engineered cargo lockdown mechanism, which holds containers in place during flight. The retrofit program is a onetime upgrade to this restraint system that will allow the containers to be held in place in flight and is also certified to release during an air drop. Going forward, this new design will become part of the OEM package sold to Airbus, and we anticipate normal defense aftermarket demand for maintenance of this critical cargo handling system.
The AdelWiggins Group, which has pioneered technology in lighting protection for over 20 years in design, testing and manufacturing of dielectric fuel and hydraulic lightning isolators for the aerospace market, was awarded the fuel and hydraulic system lightning isolators for the Boeing 777X and the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 program. This safety-oriented product is put in place to protect the fuel tank in case of a lightning strike. 
For Airbus and their A320 platform, a few key design wins have recently occurred. Hartwell Corporation recently designed an upgraded engine nacelle latch for the A320ceo, or current engine option. This retrofit program is covered by an ESA airworthiness directive requiring airlines to make this upgrade. This new patent-pending locking mechanism is designed to prevent a nacelle from being in an unlocked condition after maintenance. 
And for the A320neo, or the latest new engine option, MarathonNorco was just awarded a newly designed fan cowl hold-open device for this platform. These awards added a considerable number of design wins that we have already received for the latest new platforms of A350, A320neo, 737 MAX and 777X across all our business segments. 
Innovation is clearly a focus of our shareholder value-generation culture and value-driver strategy. We continue to invest fully in our businesses, from legacy to recent acquisitions of the TransDigm family, to allow the development of new products and technologies for both the OEM and aftermarket segments. This has allowed TransDigm to once again be named to the Forbes' Most Innovative Companies list in the world.

Now let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail."
22800180,408645074,1085685,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2016",2016-11-14,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year-end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal '1",1285,"Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year-end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal '17.
Fourth quarter net sales were $875 million, up $65 million or approximately 8% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions, PneuDraulics, Breeze-Eastern and DDC, contributed $89 million of additional sales for the period, offset by a slight decrease in organic sales. The decrease in organic sales was primarily driven by declines in commercial OEM and defense markets, offset by slight growth in commercial aftermarket sales. The organic growth was also negatively impacted due to the prior period, including 4 months of Telair due to a reporting lag, as we've previously discussed. 
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $484 million or 55.3% of sales. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.3% was 2.5 margin points higher than the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved about 3 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure and favorable product mix.
Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12.1% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was 10.3% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago.
We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $27 million versus the prior year quarter due to the increase in -- to outstanding borrowings. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the financing completed during our fiscal third quarter. As part of the financing, we borrowed an incremental $1.9 billion, of which the proceeds were used to primarily fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including to partially fund the $24 per share special dividend paid on November 1.
Our GAAP effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter compared to 29.1% in the prior year. During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and are now recognized in the income tax provision on the income statement. As a result, our effective tax rate generally approximates our cash tax rate.
Our full year GAAP effective tax rate is 23.7% compared to 29.8% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the current year was primarily due to the accounting standard change. Excluding the accounting standard change, our 2016 effective tax rate is 29%, the same rate that we use for our full year adjusted EPS. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $13 million or 9% to $155 million, which is 17.7% of sales. This compares to net income of $142 million or 17.5% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales versus prior period, improvements to our operating margin and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
GAAP EPS was $2.70 per share in the current quarter compared to $2.50 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $3.29 per share, an increase of 16% compared to the $2.83 per share last year. Please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Since this is our fiscal year-end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some significant items. Net sales increased $464 million or by 17% to end our year at almost $3.2 billion in revenues. Acquisitions contributed $409 million of the increase in sales. Organic sales were 2% above the prior year. Reported gross profit increased 19% to $1.73 billion and was 54.5% of sales compared to 53.6% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition activity and stock compensation expense, our full year margin versus prior year improved over 2 margin points.
Selling and administrative expenses of 12.1% of sales in fiscal year '15 is slightly higher than the 11.9% of sales -- excuse me, in fiscal year '16 is slightly ahead of 11.9% of sales in fiscal year '15. Again, excluding all acquisition-related expenses, stock compensation and nonoperating expenses, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales last year.
Net interest expense increased $65 million due to the increase in weighted average outstanding borrowings to $8.8 billion from $7.8 billion last year. Our fiscal year '16 weighted average cash interest rate was 5.3%. Adjusted EPS was $11.49 per share this year, up 28% from the $9.01 per share a year ago. 
Switching gears to cash and liquidity. The company generated $668 million of cash from operating activities, and we closed the year with $1.59 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company's gross debt leverage ratio at September 30, 2016, was approximately 6.5x of pro forma EBITDA and 5.5x pro forma EBITDA on a net basis. Adjusting for the dividend and financing that occurred subsequent to our fiscal year-end, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage would have been 6.4x on a pro forma basis.
We believe fiscal year '16 was another great year for TransDigm and our shareholders. As we look forward to fiscal year '17, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP EPS to be $8.65, and as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.98. As we disclose on Slide 9, there's $3.33 in adjustments to bridge the GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. 
Nick provided color on fiscal year '17 sales and EBITDA as defined. As a result of the recent acquisition activity, refinancing and dividend, I'm going to walk through the costs below EBITDA as defined and explain why adjusted net income per share increases 4% despite EBITDA as defined growing 13%. Both percentages assume the midpoint of the guidance. So depreciation and amortization, excluding backlog amortization of approximately $25 million, is expected to be $121 million compared to $102 million in fiscal year '16, an increase of 19%. Interest expense is also expected to increase about 20% to around $500 million -- $580 million in fiscal year '17. This estimate reflects the latest financing just completed in October and includes both cash and interest and approximately $20 million of amortization of debt issuance cost. Also in the forecast assumes average LIBOR increase to [ph] 1% for the full year.
We also expect $33 million in refinancing fees. Our effective tax rate for both GAAP and adjusted EPS in fiscal year '17 is expected to be around 31%. The benefit from fiscal year '17's stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments will be recorded as discrete adjustments throughout the quarters and will reduce our GAAP tax rate along with our cash taxes.
We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will increase slightly and be approximately 56.5 million shares. As a result of these items, our adjusted EPS of $11.98 is approximately 4% greater than fiscal year '16. 
Finally, with regards to our liquidity and leverage, after paying a special dividend and assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of cash on hand at the end of fiscal year '17. This includes an estimate of CapEx of $85 million or approximately 2.4% of sales. Again, as Nick mentioned, assuming no other acquisition activity, our net leverage will be around 5.5x our EBITDA as defined at September 30, 2017, or delevering almost 1 full turn. 
I will hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A session at this time."

I'll then overview a busy fiscal year '16. I'll review the initial guidance for '17. Kevin will then review some key operating items for '16 and '17, and Terry will run through the financials. 
A fair amount to cover here today. To restate, we believe our business model is unique in the industry, both in its consistency and its ability to sustain and create intrinsic shareholder value through all phases of the aerospace cycle. To summarize some of the reasons why we believe this: About 90% of our sales are generated by proprietary products, about 3/4 of our sales come from products for which we believe we are the sole-source provider, over half our revenues and a much higher percent of our EBITDA come from aftermarket sales. Aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have provided relative stability through the cycles.
Our long-standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity-like returns with the liquidity of a public market. To do this, we have to stay focused on both the details of value creation as well as careful management of our balance sheet. We follow a consistent, long-term strategy. We own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content. Second, we have a simple, well-proven, value-based operating methodology based on our 3 value driver concepts. Third, we maintain a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system that is closely aligned with shareholders. Fourth, we acquire proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content where we see a clear path to private equity-like returns. And lastly, we view our capital structure and capital allocation as a key part of our effort to create shareholder value.
As you know, we regularly look closely at our choices for capital allocation. To remind you, we basically have 4. Our priorities are typically in the following order: one, invest in our existing businesses; second, make accretive acquisitions consistent with our strategy. To state again, these 2 are almost always our first choices. Third, give the extra money back to the shareholders, either through a special dividend or stock buyback; and lastly, pay off debt, but given the low cost of debt, especially after tax, this is still likely our last choice in the current capital market conditions. 
In the last 3 years, you've seen 3 distinct business environments and corresponding real-life examples of how we manage our capital structure to best take advantage of the current business and capital market environment. In fiscal year '14, with the acquisition opportunities not particularly compelling, we gave back about $1.6 billion to our shareholders in the form of a large special dividend and some modest stock buyback. In fiscal year '15, we saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates. We acquired about $1.6 billion worth of proprietary aerospace businesses that met our strategic and shareholder return requirements. In fiscal '16, we again saw a number of attractive acquisition candidates that meet our -- met our criteria. As a result, we acquired another $1.4 billion of aerospace businesses. In addition, the combination of our usual high cash flow and continuing attractive credit markets allowed us to return about $1.6 billion more to our shareholders in the form of roughly $200 million of share buyback plus a $1.4 billion special dividend paid out in early '17.
To summarize, over the last 3 years, that is, since the beginning of fiscal year '14, we have returned about $3.2 billion to our shareholders. In that same period, we made 9 acquisitions for about $3.3 billion, we fully invested in our existing business, we kept a healthy cash balance and maintained significant dry powder for additional acquisitions.
As we have done consistently in the past, depending on the specific business and capital market conditions, we allocate our capital and structure our balance sheet in a manner we think has the best chance to maximize the return to our shareholders. 
At 9/30/16, based on the current capital market conditions and adjusting for the $1.4 billion special dividend and recent financing, we still have adequate capacity to make over $1 billion of additional acquisitions without issuing any equity. This capacity grows steadily to over $2 billion as the year proceeds. This does not imply anything about acquisition opportunities or anticipated acquisition levels for fiscal year '17.
Now to summarize the fiscal year '16 year. '16 was a busy year. In '16 and early '17, we raised about $3.8 billion. The proceeds were used primarily to fund acquisitions and to pay a special dividend. We were also able to modestly decrease our average interest rate as well as to refinance and extend maturities on certain existing debt. We acquired 3 businesses, as I mentioned, for about $1.4 billion: Breeze-Eastern, DDC and Tactair Young & Franklin. Kevin will talk a little more about each of these acquisitions. We continued the integration efforts of our various '15 and '16 acquisitions. And most importantly, we continued to generate real value in our new and existing business, and we created substantial intrinsic value for our shareholders.
Now turning to the performance. To remind you, this is the fourth quarter and full year summary for fiscal year '16. Our fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. 
The total GAAP revenues were up 8% versus the prior Q4 and 17% on a full year basis. Organic revenue was up about 2% on a full year basis, and Q4 organic growth was up slightly after normalizing for the 1-month reporting delay in Telair 2015 reporting timing, as we've discussed in the previous calls. 
Reviewing the revenues by market category, again, on a pro forma basis versus the prior year Q4 and the prior year full year, that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods. In the commercial market, which makes up roughly 70% of our revenue, total commercial OEM revenues were down 4% versus the prior Q4 and roughly flat on a full year basis. Commercial transport OEMs were up 2% on a full year basis and down slightly in Q4. We suspect we are seeing some system-wide inventory adjustments as wide-body rate decreases ripple through the system.
Biz jet revenues continue to drop, with revenues down 15% versus the prior year Q4 and about 10% down on a full year basis. This segment is small compared to commercial transport but has been tougher than we expected all year. For the fiscal year, total commercial OEM bookings were about even with shipments. 
Total commercial aftermarket revenues versus the prior year were up 6.5% for both fiscal year '16 and for Q4. For the full year, commercial transport aftermarket revenues were up about 9.5%. However, this was partially offset by the softness in business jet, helicopter and freighter aftermarket. Sequentially, revenues were up modestly in the commercial aftermarket. For the full fiscal year, total commercial aftermarket bookings ran slightly ahead of shipments. 
The defense markets, which make up about 30% of our revenue, defense revenues for the year were modestly better than we anticipated. Fiscal year Q4 revenues are up 3% versus the prior year. Full year revenues were up 2% versus the prior fiscal year. Full year defense bookings ran about $50 million behind shipments. This is almost entirely attributable to a few multiyear orders placed in 2015, specifically for the A400 cargo system, a few large international parachute orders and a large order for the APKW smart bomb system. In total, the rest of the defense bookings were roughly even with shipments. 
In total for fiscal year '16, excluding acquisitions, our revenues for commercial aftermarket were just about as we originally expected, the commercial OEM business was a little lower, and the military revenues were pretty close to our expectation at the start of the year. All in all, total revenues were close to our original expectations.
Moving now to profitability, and on a reported basis, again, I'm going to talk primarily about our operating performance or EBITDA as defined. The as-defined adjustments in Q4 were noncash compensation expenses and acquisition-related costs and amortizations. Our EBITDA as defined of about $423 million for Q4 was up 17% versus the prior Q4. On a full year basis, our EBITDA as defined was roughly $1.5 billion or up 21% from the prior year. The EBITDA as-defined margin was 47% of revenue for the full year and 48.5% for Q4. The full year EBITDA margins, without dilution of the acquisitions purchased in 2015 and '16, was approximately 49% or up 2.5 margin points versus fiscal year '15 for the same mix of businesses we owned going into '15.
With respect to acquisitions, we continually -- we continue to actively look at opportunities. The pipeline of near-term possibilities is reasonably active. Once again, closings are always difficult to predict, but we remain disciplined and focused on opportunities that meet our tight criteria. 
Now moving on to 2017 guidance. As we head into 2017, we again have concerns about the duration of the commercial transport OEM cycle. As you may recall, at the start of fiscal year '16, we reduced our headcount to get ahead of any potential softening. In retrospect, given the wide-body softening and the weaker biz jet revenues, I'm glad we did this. Though we have not yet cut again for fiscal year '17, we're cautious and we're ready to move quickly if necessary.
All in all, this is our best estimate for '17. As you know, we'll update this as the year proceeds. But based on the above and assuming no additional acquisitions, our guidance is as follows. The midpoint of the fiscal year '17 revenue guidance is $3.54 billion or up 12% on a GAAP basis year-over-year. Organic growth is roughly 4% year-over-year. As in the past years, with roughly 10% less working days in fiscal year 2017 Q1, revenues are anticipated to be lower than the other 3 quarters of fiscal year '17, roughly in proportion to the lower working days. I'm not sure I made this point clear last year, so I'd ask you to keep it in mind as you work through your outlooks. 
The midpoint of fiscal year '17 EBITDA as defined is $1.68 billion or 47.5% of revenues. That's up 13% year-over-year. We anticipate the EBITDA margins will move up throughout the year, as we've seen in previous years. The base business, that is excluding 2016 acquisitions, is anticipated to achieve an EBITDA margin of about 48% or up -- or 48.5% or up 1 point versus 2016 for the same mix of businesses that we owned at the start of 2016. The midpoint of the EPS as adjusted is anticipated to be $11.98 per share. That's up 4% versus the prior year. This is driven by a significant increase in core operating performance and recent acquisitions, offset in part by higher interest expense and a somewhat higher tax rate. Terry will review this in more detail.
On a pro forma or the same, same-store basis that I talked about before, this guidance is based on the following growth rate assumptions: commercial aftermarket revenue growth in the mid- to high single digits based on worldwide RPM growth in the 5% range. We're hopeful there could be some catch-up upside here, but given the recent history, we remain cautious until we see it. 
Defense military revenue is estimated to be flat to slightly up as a percent of prior year. Given world events and the political uncertainty, there could well be variations here. Commercial OEM growth, we anticipate in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range, primarily due to the 2017 and 2018 commercial transport production rates. We are cautious about '18 production rates and how this could reflect itself in the 2017 shipments. We are assuming a modest pickup of business jet revenues off a depressed fiscal year 2016.
Without any additional acquisitions or capital structure activity, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in cash and almost $600 million in undrawn revolver at year-end 2017. We also have additional capacity under our credit agreement. Our net leverage is anticipated to be about 5.5x EBITDA at the end of '17 or down a little over 1 turn.
In summary, 2016 was a good and busy year. I'm confident, with our consistent value-focused strategy and strong mix of business, we can continue to create long-term intrinsic value for our investors. 
Now let me hand this over to Kevin, who will discuss some of the operating highlights of '16 and a little about '17."
22800180,408645074,1086286,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2016",2016-11-14,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fiscal year in 2016. I will now take you through some of the most important operational highlights of the last few quarters. As we have stated previously, we believe our bu",1767,"Thanks, Nick. Good morning, everyone. As Nick mentioned, in total, we had a good fiscal year in 2016. I will now take you through some of the most important operational highlights of the last few quarters. 
As we have stated previously, we believe our business processes, unique application of the TransDigm value drivers and our organizational focus on accretive acquisitions that meet our strategic vision are the keys to delivering shareholder value. And as you will see, we have made appreciable progress on each of these this past year. 
First, let me provide an update on our acquisition-related value driver. For review, as we do with each acquisition, we follow a detailed and scripted integration plan. This includes, but is not limited to, an implementation of our value-creation process and metrics; restructuring the company into our product line focus groups, including co-location of the team members to facilitate communication; focusing the engineering and business development efforts on winnable and profitable new business; and finally, we tighten up the cost control.
Since the beginning of fiscal year '15, TransDigm has deployed over $3 billion of capital to acquire several value-creation engines for the company. These include the businesses or product lines acquired in fiscal year '15 of Franke Aquarotter, Telair Cargo Group, Pexco Aerospace and PneuDraulics; and in fiscal year '16, the acquisition of Breeze-Eastern Corporation, Data Device Corporation and, most recently, Young & Franklin and its subsidiary, Tactair Fluid Controls. 
Now to quickly update on our fiscal year '15 activity. Franke Aquarotter, a product line acquisition, has now been relocated to our Adams Rite Aerospace facility in Fullerton, California. After some initial startup issues, the product line and the manufacturing equipment have been successfully transferred. This business is similar to current Adams Rite faucet businesses and allows them to provide fluid control and accessories across all major large commercial aerospace OEM manufacturers and all major commercial transport platforms. Finally, this business should approach TransDigm margins. 
The Telair Cargo Group was split into 3 businesses along the similar lines as they had been divided under previous ownership. The cargo container company, Nordisk Aviation Products, is led by an internal promotion of Neal McKeever as the President and is located in Norway.
Telair U.S. Cargo Systems, led by the incumbent President at acquisition, Tim Dumbauld, is based in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and is largely responsible for the design and manufacturing of military cargo handling equipment for the Airbus A400M. 
Finally, the largest segment, Telair International, headquartered in Miesbach, Germany, is led by Marko Enderlein, a recent hire from the Satair Group, a division of Airbus, and is responsible for the design and manufacturing of large commercial cargo handling systems. 
All of these businesses have been fully integrated into our culture and value-generation strategy. Headcount reductions have been performed, where warranted, by business demand and opportunity. Value pricing opportunities have been slightly muted due to long-term agreements, and our new product portfolio has limited aftermarket demand at this stage in the product life cycle. 
As stated previously, we believe this combination of businesses will deliver on the expectations of our acquisition model for TransDigm, a solid business, but one that will be short of company average margins.
Pexco, a custom plastics extrusion company located in Yakima, Washington, which specializes in proprietary commercial aerospace interior products used around the aircraft. This business is led by Joe Glover, who was recently placed after the integration with TransDigm was completed. 
To date, we have been able to close the Huntington Beach manufacturing facility and combine all operations into Yakima. We reduced headcount in Yakima to align with our productivity targets, evaluated value-based pricing opportunities and exited noncore production. We believe that this team will continue to perform at expectations and that significant value-generation opportunities exist for the future. This business should run at or above the average EBITDA margins of TransDigm.
PneuDraulics, a manufacturer of precision hydraulic components for the aerospace industry, is located in Rancho Cucamonga, California. At acquisition, PneuDraulics had a strong management team, and this allowed us to place Dain Miller, a long-time PneuDraulics employee, into the role as President. The integration of PneuDraulics has gone to plan, and the group has been an active participant in our culture, management and business process training. The company's performance has delivered on expectations for the 3 value drivers of new business, productivity and value-based pricing. We expect this business to deliver at the margin average of TransDigm.
Next, acquired on January 4, 2016, Breeze-Eastern, which is a leading global designer and manufacturer of high-performance lifting and pulling devices for military and civilian aircraft, has been integrated into the TransDigm culture, successfully implementing our value drivers and product line organization strategy. We have established an appropriate pricing structure by streamlining price lists and providing more value-added services to our aftermarket offerings. To help our productivity initiatives, we closed the stand-alone Virginia facility in September and centralized all engineering and product development at the main New Jersey location. This rationalization across the business has allowed a 23% headcount reduction at Breeze-Eastern since acquisition. The business has been reorganized around 2 main product lines, hoists and winches, and our usual customer support team structure has been put in place, with leaders established and team members physically relocated into dedicated work areas. This has allowed for an increased focus on new product development with a number of innovative new products under accelerated development, which we expect to begin contributing to the growth of the business in 2017. The overall results have met our expectations, with revenue and EBITDA at or above our acquisition plan. With some existing LTAs and a few government TINA-covered contracts, this business probably doesn't quite get up to our average EBITDA margins.
Next, we have Data Device Corporation, DDC, located in Bohemia, New York, on Long Island, which was acquired by TransDigm on June 23 of this year. DDC is the world leader in the design, manufacture of high-reliability data bus motion control and solid-state power controller products for aerospace and defense vehicles. This capability allows them to deliver the smallest, lightest and highest-performing products in the most cost-effective packaging for these applications in the aerospace market. DDC consists of 5 global manufacturing locations and approximately 650 employees. To date, we have aligned the DDC structure with TransDigm's operating strategy around a product line-focused organization. Our product line structure has allowed us to quickly implement 2 product lines of data bus and power, a 10% headcount reduction to better align organization size and cost structure, review of pricing and contractual opportunities and new product initiatives. Although only 4 months under TransDigm, the DDC team and business has delivered value, as expected, for TransDigm shareholders, with revenue and EBITDA slightly ahead of expectations. We anticipate this business will be able to deliver EBITDA margins at or in excess of TransDigm averages.
Now acquired on September 16, the Liverpool, New York-based Young & Franklin and the subsidiary, Tactair Fluid Controls, are the latest additions to the TransDigm team. They manufacture highly engineered valves and actuators and are -- almost all of their products are proprietary. With about 70% of revenues coming from the aerospace industry, the remaining 30% comes from the industrial gas turbine markets. Given the recent nature of the acquisition, it is too early to comment on the outcome of all of our value-driven initiatives. Productivity and enhanced new business initiatives are all being actively investigated, and we will update on these as they come into focus. Additionally, a thorough top-to-bottom review of all contracts, purchase orders and forecasts has been done to evaluate any value-based pricing reset opportunities. However, product line teams have been formed around the IGT and aerospace market segments, and these teams have now been trained in our culture, methods and expectations. We are pleased with the overall performance of the team and have confidence that the acquisition will live up to model expectations. Although numerous margin expansion opportunities have been identified, we expect this business to achieve margins just under the average for TransDigm.
To update the recent progress on our new business value driver, let me bring your attention to several recent developments in our aerospace market. Our Telair U.S. Cargo Group business was able to overcome a difficult engineering challenge on the Airbus A400M cargo loading system. Telair recently upgraded the design of their highly engineered cargo lockdown mechanism, which holds containers in place during flight. The retrofit program is a onetime upgrade to this restraint system that will allow the containers to be held in place in flight and is also certified to release during an air drop. Going forward, this new design will become part of the OEM package sold to Airbus, and we anticipate normal defense aftermarket demand for maintenance of this critical cargo handling system.
The AdelWiggins Group, which has pioneered technology in lighting protection for over 20 years in design, testing and manufacturing of dielectric fuel and hydraulic lightning isolators for the aerospace market, was awarded the fuel and hydraulic system lightning isolators for the Boeing 777X and the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 program. This safety-oriented product is put in place to protect the fuel tank in case of a lightning strike. 
For Airbus and their A320 platform, a few key design wins have recently occurred. Hartwell Corporation recently designed an upgraded engine nacelle latch for the A320ceo, or current engine option. This retrofit program is covered by an ESA airworthiness directive requiring airlines to make this upgrade. This new patent-pending locking mechanism is designed to prevent a nacelle from being in an unlocked condition after maintenance. 
And for the A320neo, or the latest new engine option, MarathonNorco was just awarded a newly designed fan cowl hold-open device for this platform. These awards added a considerable number of design wins that we have already received for the latest new platforms of A350, A320neo, 737 MAX and 777X across all our business segments. 
Innovation is clearly a focus of our shareholder value-generation culture and value-driver strategy. We continue to invest fully in our businesses, from legacy to recent acquisitions of the TransDigm family, to allow the development of new products and technologies for both the OEM and aftermarket segments. This has allowed TransDigm to once again be named to the Forbes' Most Innovative Companies list in the world. This award identifies TransDigm as one of the top 100 global companies in innovation and the only European or American aerospace company so recognized. 
Now let me hand it over to our CFO, Terry Paradie, who will review our financial results in more detail."
22800180,408645074,1086286,"TransDigm Group Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 14, 2016",2016-11-14,"Earnings Calls","TransDigm Group Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year-end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal '1",1285,"Thank you, Kevin. Nick already summarized the key elements that occurred in fiscal year 2016, so I will now review the consolidated financial results for our fourth quarter, give a brief fiscal year-end summary and review certain assumptions for fiscal '17.
Fourth quarter net sales were $875 million, up $65 million or approximately 8% greater than the prior year. The collective impact of acquisitions, PneuDraulics, Breeze-Eastern and DDC, contributed $89 million of additional sales for the period, offset by a slight decrease in organic sales. The decrease in organic sales was primarily driven by declines in commercial OEM and defense markets, offset by slight growth in commercial aftermarket sales. The organic growth was also negatively impacted due to the prior period, including 4 months of Telair due to a reporting lag, as we've previously discussed. 
Our fourth quarter gross profit was $484 million or 55.3% of sales. Our reported gross profit margin of 55.3% was 2.5 margin points higher than the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related accounting adjustments and operating activity, our gross profit margins in the remaining businesses versus the prior year quarter improved about 3 margin points due to the strength of our proprietary products, continually improving our cost structure and favorable product mix.
Our selling and administrative expenses were 12.7% of sales for the current quarter compared to 12.1% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition-related expenses and noncash stock compensation, SG&A was 10.3% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales a year ago.
We had an increase in interest expense of approximately $27 million versus the prior year quarter due to the increase in -- to outstanding borrowings. The higher average debt year-over-year was primarily due to the financing completed during our fiscal third quarter. As part of the financing, we borrowed an incremental $1.9 billion, of which the proceeds were used to primarily fund the acquisition of DDC and for general corporate purposes, including to partially fund the $24 per share special dividend paid on November 1.
Our GAAP effective tax rate was 26% in the quarter compared to 29.1% in the prior year. During the quarter, we adopted a new accounting standard related to the accounting for excess tax benefits for stock option exercises that were previously recorded as a direct credit to equity and are now recognized in the income tax provision on the income statement. As a result, our effective tax rate generally approximates our cash tax rate.
Our full year GAAP effective tax rate is 23.7% compared to 29.8% in the prior year. The lower effective rate in the current year was primarily due to the accounting standard change. Excluding the accounting standard change, our 2016 effective tax rate is 29%, the same rate that we use for our full year adjusted EPS. 
Our net income for the quarter increased $13 million or 9% to $155 million, which is 17.7% of sales. This compares to net income of $142 million or 17.5% of net sales in the prior year. The increase in net income primarily reflects the increase in net sales versus prior period, improvements to our operating margin and lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher interest expense. 
GAAP EPS was $2.70 per share in the current quarter compared to $2.50 per share last year. Our adjusted EPS was $3.29 per share, an increase of 16% compared to the $2.83 per share last year. Please reference Table 3 in this morning's press release, which compares and reconciles GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.
Since this is our fiscal year-end, let me take a minute to quickly summarize some significant items. Net sales increased $464 million or by 17% to end our year at almost $3.2 billion in revenues. Acquisitions contributed $409 million of the increase in sales. Organic sales were 2% above the prior year. Reported gross profit increased 19% to $1.73 billion and was 54.5% of sales compared to 53.6% in the prior year. Excluding all acquisition activity and stock compensation expense, our full year margin versus prior year improved over 2 margin points.
Selling and administrative expenses of 12.1% of sales in fiscal year '15 is slightly higher than the 11.9% of sales -- excuse me, in fiscal year '16 is slightly ahead of 11.9% of sales in fiscal year '15. Again, excluding all acquisition-related expenses, stock compensation and nonoperating expenses, SG&A was about 9.9% of sales compared to 10.2% of sales last year.
Net interest expense increased $65 million due to the increase in weighted average outstanding borrowings to $8.8 billion from $7.8 billion last year. Our fiscal year '16 weighted average cash interest rate was 5.3%. Adjusted EPS was $11.49 per share this year, up 28% from the $9.01 per share a year ago. 
Switching gears to cash and liquidity. The company generated $668 million of cash from operating activities, and we closed the year with $1.59 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The company's gross debt leverage ratio at September 30, 2016, was approximately 6.5x of pro forma EBITDA and 5.5x pro forma EBITDA on a net basis. Adjusting for the dividend and financing that occurred subsequent to our fiscal year-end, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage would have been 6.4x on a pro forma basis.
We believe fiscal year '16 was another great year for TransDigm and our shareholders. As we look forward to fiscal year '17, we estimate the midpoint of our GAAP EPS to be $8.65, and as Nick previously mentioned, we estimate the midpoint of our adjusted EPS to be $11.98. As we disclose on Slide 9, there's $3.33 in adjustments to bridge the GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS. 
Nick provided color on fiscal year '17 sales and EBITDA as defined. As a result of the recent acquisition activity, refinancing and dividend, I'm going to walk through the costs below EBITDA as defined and explain why adjusted net income per share increases 4% despite EBITDA as defined growing 13%. Both percentages assume the midpoint of the guidance. So depreciation and amortization, excluding backlog amortization of approximately $25 million, is expected to be $121 million compared to $102 million in fiscal year '16, an increase of 19%. Interest expense is also expected to increase about 20% to around $500 million -- $580 million in fiscal year '17. This estimate reflects the latest financing just completed in October and includes both cash and interest and approximately $20 million of amortization of debt issuance cost. Also in the forecast assumes average LIBOR increase to [ph] 1% for the full year.
We also expect $33 million in refinancing fees. Our effective tax rate for both GAAP and adjusted EPS in fiscal year '17 is expected to be around 31%. The benefit from fiscal year '17's stock option exercises and dividend equivalent payments will be recorded as discrete adjustments throughout the quarters and will reduce our GAAP tax rate along with our cash taxes.
We expect our weighted average shares outstanding will increase slightly and be approximately 56.5 million shares. As a result of these items, our adjusted EPS of $11.98 is approximately 4% greater than fiscal year '16. 
Finally, with regards to our liquidity and leverage, after paying a special dividend and assuming no additional acquisitions or capital market transactions, we expect to have around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of cash on hand at the end of fiscal year '17. This includes an estimate of CapEx of $85 million or approximately 2.4% of sales. Again, as Nick mentioned, assuming no other acquisition activity, our net leverage will be around 5.5x our EBITDA as defined at September 30, 2017, or delevering almost 1 full turn. 
I will hand it over to Liza to kick off the Q&A session at this time."
