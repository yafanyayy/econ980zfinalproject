Today, I'll begin with our fourth quarter results and then turn to our improved earnings outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We closed out a",1702,"Thanks Paul. You've all had the opportunity to read today's earnings release and the related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our fourth quarter results and then turn to our improved earnings outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. 
We closed out a solid 2010 with a very strong fourth quarter results. Our net income per diluted share grew 41% on sales growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported year-over-year sales growth that. Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 10%. Our regional business and general aviation original equipment market sales increased by about 52%, which included organic growth of about 20%. Commercial aftermarket sales were 12% higher than the fourth quarter last year. Our defense and space sales continued their positive growth trends in the fourth quarter of 2010, increasing by 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 7% of this growth, while organic sales growth was about 2%. 
In the fourth quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 15.8% compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009, which helped us increase our net income per diluted share from $0.82 in the fourth quarter 2009 to $1.16 in the fourth quarter 2010. The overall improvement was due to strong sales growth, excellent operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement, a lower tax rate and increased favorable changes and estimates for certain long-term contracts, partially offset by costs associated with the early retirement of debt. 
Specifically, as we discussed with you last October, the fourth quarter 2010 results included debt redemption costs of approximately $0.17 per diluted share. We reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% for the fourth quarter 2010 compared to an effective tax rate of 29.5% during the fourth quarter 2009.
Fourth quarter 2010 tax rate included previously announced tax benefit of approximately $0.18 per diluted share related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board concerning issues related to Goodrich and Rohr for all tax years through 2001 and approximately $0.11 per diluted share for the full year 2010 benefit of the R&D tax credit, which was renewed by the U.S. Congress in late 2010.
Our fourth quarter 2010 results included higher pretax income of $8 million, $5 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share related to changes in estimates for certain long-term contracts, primarily in our Aerostructures and Aircraft Wheels and Brakes businesses compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. 
changes and estimates for the fourth quarter 2010 were $27 million pretax. The fourth quarter 2010 included a total pretax restructuring charges of $7 million, $4 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted share. These actions were not included in our prior outlook for the 2010 earnings.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures or free cash flow for the fourth quarter 2010 was a use of cash of $114 million. As we discussed during our last conference call, we made $300 million of incremental contribution to our pension plans in October. Excluding this incremental contribution, our free cash flow conversion of net income would have easily exceeded 100%.
Since last October, we have announced significant progress on existing programs and several new business wins. We have begun environmental testing of the first operational response of satellite. We signed a 10-year service agreement with Air Arabia for the support of thruster in the airlines' fleet more than 50 A320 aircraft. 
We were selected by Airbus to provide the main landing gear for the aircraft. This contract is expected to generate more than $2 billion in original equipment and aftermath that revenue for us over the life of the program. And we received a production contract from Lockheed Martin to supply a 160 pylons to the U.S. Air Force C5 enhancement and reengining program.
For our full year 2010, we reported a 4% increase in sales to $7 billion, and our income from continuing operations increased from $560 million in 2009 to $577 million in 2010. On a per share basis, we reported income from continuing operations per diluted share over $4.50 in 2010.
For the full year 2010, our large commercial airplane original equipment sales increased by 4%. Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales grew by 2%, including sales associated with DeCrane acquisition. Organically, sales in this market channel decreased by about 5%. 
Large commercial regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales were flat compared to 2009. Defense and space sales grew by about 11%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition. Organic growth in this market channel was 3%.
For 2010, our free cash flow was approximately 50% of income from continuing operations, including the incremental $300 million pension contribution made in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, free cash flow was approximately 102% of income from continuing operations. 
Now I'll turn to 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in late 2010 will continue in 2011, and we expect significant sales growth in each of our market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 11%, which would provide us with record sales of $7.7 billion to $7.8 million in 2011. 
Based on the recent improvements in airline capacity trends, improving airline profitability and increasing demand trends for our commercial aftermarket products, we are raising our sales growth expectations for commercial aftermarket sales to a range of 7% to 9%. This strong sales growth should result in an even better growth in net income per diluted share. Largely driven by increased expectations for commercial aftermarket sales and lower pension expense, we now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.45, an increase of 18% to 21% compared to 2010.
As I noted, we expect sales growth in 2011 in every market channel, including large commercial airplane original equipment sales growth of about 15%. We are assuming that all announced production rate increases are implemented. And Boeing 787 and 747-8 deliveries are consistent with the latest agile announced by Boeing. Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 30%, including incremental sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Organically, we expect sales to increase by about 6%.
Large commercial regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 7% to 9%.  And defense and space sales of both original equipment and aftermarket products and services are expected to increase by about 7% to 9%. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of about 16.5%. This reflects growth in aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs, offset by a very rapid growth in lower-margin commercial original equipment and cost-plus military contracts.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $74 million or $0.37 per diluted share. The estimate for 2011 pension expense is based on the 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 14% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of 5.67%. 
In addition, we have reduced our long-term rate of return assumption on U.S. plan assets to 8.25% as of January 1, 2011, compared to our prior assumption of 8.75%. 
For 2011, we expect total worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $88 million compared to $162 million in 2010.
We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2010. 
We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
We read a lot of questions about our defense programs and our ability to continue to show significant growth in this market 2010. Our defense programs are characterized by diversity and criticality. We are in almost every platform in the defense industry today, both OE and aftermarket. A significant portion of our sales are to international customers, either directly or through foreign military sales contracts. We expect that trend to continue. 
In many cases, we have content on multiple platforms competing for an award, such as the Air Force U.S. tanker competition, where we'll positioned in both the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A330. We have strong positions in a number of large defense programs, which will grow over the next several like the C5 reengining, the F-35 and the C-130. As we have previously discussed in our presentations, we are well positioned in growth markets like helicopters and ISR. We have substantial ships helicopters like the Black Hawk, the Apache and the CH-47. Another area of strength for Goodrich is our ISR sensors. The U2 with our multi-spectral imaging sensor is being test more than ever, and the Goodrich TV110 or seven great success with numerous international customers and has received new international contract awards.
Finally, we also play a big part in the rpecision weapons program of the U.S. and foreign militaries with our actuation and inertial guidance systems. So overall, we feel we are well positioned to the U.S. and allied troops with vital and cost-effective equipment that will result in continued good growth in our defenses-based sales. 
Overall, our performance during the fourth quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint, and we are looking forward to a strong 2011. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales. 
Our financial position remains excellent, with about $800 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you during 2011. We have a great team, and we're all very excited about continuing to grow the company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. 
With that, let's open it up to questions."

And we were starting January in many of our businesses with a much larger backlog than we had in January of last year. So orders are coming in. And particularly in our Aerostructures business, the orders a were majors have turned up in the fourth quarter. That's a very good sign that airlines are having to do some restocking on parts that they've avoided buying in the past because they've had a lot of spare engines out there. So it's not any one thing, we're just kind of seeing a lot of our aftermarket businesses see a much better level of activity, which gave us the confidence to raise that forecast."

But the absolute dollars for 2011 are pretty similar to what we would have expected back in October. So we had a little bit softer sales level in the fourth quarter of 2010. But if you look at the dollars sell value in 2011, it's fairly advantage. So the only other market segment of that we changed a bit was regional business, general aviation, where we took those sales down by around $50 million from our prior guidance. That's mostly on the business jet market. And just to give you a little bit of color there, first of all, it's a relatively small part of our total sales, 4%, 5% when you look at OE and aftermarket. So it's not a huge part of our business. But we're seeing good underlying trends that would suggest momentum in that marketplace is starting to develop. So things that we'd look for are the used aircraft prices began to stabilize, we see better activity levels across the current business jet fleet. in the seeing good growth and good aftermarket relate to the business jets. And what we're seeing in the OE said there is decent expectations for growth in OE sales rates, production rates on the larger aircraft. But the smaller, small and midsize aircrafts have not yet seen of those kinds of increases. So our general view is the small and medium growth rates are pushed out to 2012 from where we were thinking they could occur in the second half of '11, previously. So that's the major change in our sales guidance there. And On commercial OE, we took those down from a range of 15% to 20% growth in October, down 15% to 20% and that's all related to changed expectations on 787."

The R&D tax credit is obviously helpful, and that's more of a permanent benefit. Some of the accelerated depreciation, bonus depreciation, helps you on the cash flow side, not on the earnings side because it's a deferral not a mechanism. When we think about where to put on investment on the margin that does make a difference, for us, it's more important to look at where long-term tax policy is and making those decisions rather than kind of short-term move to how low are those things going to be in place. So if we had more confidence on what the outlook would be two, three, four, five years from now, it would be much more beneficial to our investment philosophy as it relates to U.S. versus elsewhere. And I think a lot of other companies around the industry would look at that as well.

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our fourth quarter results and then turn to our improved earnings outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. 
We closed out a solid 2010 with a very strong fourth quarter results. Our net income per diluted share grew 41% on sales growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported year-over-year sales growth. Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 2%. Our regional, business and general aviation original equipment market, sales increased by about 52%, which included organic growth of about 20%. Commercial aftermarket sales were 12% higher than the fourth quarter last year. Our defense and space sales continued their positive growth trend in the fourth quarter of 2010, increasing by 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 7% of this growth, while organic sales growth was about 2%. 
In the fourth quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 15.8% compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009, which helped us increase our net income per diluted share from $0.82 in the fourth quarter 2009 to $1.16 in the fourth quarter 2010. The overall improvement was due to strong sales growth, excellent operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement, a lower tax rate and increased favorable changes and estimates for certain long-term contracts, partially offset by costs associated with the early retirement of debt. 
Specifically, as we discussed with you last October, the fourth quarter 2010 results included debt redemption costs of approximately $0.17 per diluted share. We reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% for the fourth quarter 2010 compared to an effective tax rate of 29.5% during the fourth quarter 2009.
Fourth quarter 2010 tax rate included previously announced tax benefit of approximately $0.18 per diluted share related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board concerning issues related to Goodrich and Rohr for all tax years through 2001 and approximately $0.11 per diluted share for the full year 2010 benefit of the R&D tax credit, which was renewed by the U.S. Congress in late 2010.
Our fourth quarter 2010 results included higher pretax income of $8 million, $5 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share related to changes in estimates for certain long-term contracts, primarily in our Aerostructures and Aircraft Wheels and Brakes businesses compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Total changes in estimates for the fourth quarter 2010 were $27 million pretax. The fourth quarter 2010 included total pretax restructuring charges of $7 million, $4 million after tax or $0.03 per diluted share. These actions were not included in our prior outlook for the 2010 earnings.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, or free cash flow for the fourth quarter 2010, was a use of cash of $114 million. As we discussed during our last conference call, we made $300 million of incremental contribution to our pension plans in October. Excluding this incremental contribution, our free cash flow conversion of net income would have easily exceeded 100%.
Since last October, we have announced significant progress on existing programs and several new business wins. We have begun environmental testing of the first operationally responsive satellite. We signed a 10-year in a sales service agreement with Air Arabia for the support of missiles and thrust reversers in the airlines' fleet of more than 50 A320 aircraft. 
We were selected by Airbus to provide the main landing gear for the -1000 variant of the A350 XWB aircraft. This contract is expected to generate more than $2 billion in original equipment and aftermath revenue for us over the life of the program. And we received a production contract from Lockheed Martin to supply 160 pylons to the U.S. Air Force C-5  Galaxy strategic airlifter, reliability enhancement and reengining program.
For our full year 2010, we reported a 4% increase in sales to $7 billion, and our income from continuing operations increased from $560 million in 2009 to $577 million in 2010. On a per share basis, we reported income from continuing operations per diluted share of $4.50 in 2010.
For the full year 2010, our large commercial airplane original equipment sales increased by 4%. Regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales grew by 2%, including sales associated with DeCrane acquisition. Organically, sales in this market channel decreased by about 5%. 
Large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales were flat compared to 2009. Defense and space sales grew by about 11%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition. Organic growth in this market channel was 3%.
For 2010, our free cash flow was approximately 50% of income from continuing operations, including the incremental $300 million pension contribution made in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, free cash flow is approximately 102% of income from continuing operations. 
Now I'll turn to 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in late 2010 will continue in 2011, and we expect significant sales growth in each of our market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 11%, which would provide us with record sales of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion in 2011. 
Based on the recent improvements in airline capacity trends, improving airline profitability and increasing demand trends for our commercial aftermarket products, we are raising our sales growth expectations for commercial aftermarket sales to a range of 7% to 9%. This strong sales growth should result in an even better growth than net income per diluted share. Largely driven by increased expectations for commercial aftermarket sales and lower pension expense, we now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.45, an increase of 18% to 21% compared to 2010.
As I noted, we expect sales growth in 2011 in every market channel, including large commercial airplane original equipment sales growth of about 15%. We are assuming that all announced production rate increases are implemented. And Boeing 787 and 747-8 deliveries are consistent with the latest schedule announced by Boeing. Regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 30%, including incremental sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Organically, we expect sales to increase by about 6%.
Large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 7% to 9%. And defense and space sales of both original equipment and aftermarket products and services are expected to increase by about 7% to 9%. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of about 16.5%. This reflects growth in aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs, offset by very rapid growth in lower-margin commercial original equipment and cost-plus military contracts.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $74 million or $0.37 per diluted share. The estimate for 2011 pension expense is based on the 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 14% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of 5.67%. In addition, we have reduced our long-term rate of return assumption on U.S. plan assets to 8.25% as of January 1, 2011 compared to our prior assumption of 8.75%. 
For 2011, we expect total worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $88 million compared to $162 million in 2010. We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2010. 
We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
We get a lot of questions about our defense programs and our ability to continue to show significant growth in this market channel. Our defense programs are characterized by diversity and criticality. We are in almost every platform in the defense industry today, both OE and aftermarket. A significant portion of our sales are to international customers, either directly or through foreign military sales contracts. We expect that trend to continue. 
In many cases, we have content on multiple platforms competing for an award, such as the Air Force U.S. tanker competition where we are well positioned on both the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A330. We have strong positions in a number of large defense programs, which will grow over the next several years like the C-5 reengining, the F-35 and the C-130. 
As we have previously discussed in our presentations, we are well positioned in growth markets like helicopters and ISR. We have substantial shipset content on helicopters like the Black Hawk, the Apache and the CH-47. Another area of strength for Goodrich is our ISR sensors. The U2 with our SYERS multi-spectral imaging sensor is being test more than ever, and the Goodrich DB-110 sensor is having great success with numerous international customers and has received new international contract awards.
Finally, we also play a big part in the precision weapons programs of the U.S. and foreign militaries with our actuation and inertial guidance systems. So overall, we feel we are well positioned to help the U.S. and allied troops with vital and cost-effective equipment that will result in continued good growth in our defense and space sales. 
Overall, our performance during the fourth quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint, and we are looking forward to a strong 2011. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales. 
Our financial position remains excellent, with about $800 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you during 2011. We have a great team, and we're all very excited about continuing to grow the company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And we were starting off January in many of our businesses with a much larger backlog than we had in January of last year. So orders are coming in. And particularly in our Aerostructures business, the orders from majors have turned up in the fourth quarter. That's a very good sign that airlines are having to do some restocking on parts that they have avoided buying in the past because they've had a lot of spare engines out there. So it's not any one thing, we're just kind of seeing a lot of our aftermarket businesses see a much better level of activity, which gave us the confidence to raise that forecast."

So my colleague is here and always prepared. Yes, and in terms of the military side, we changed the guidance in terms of growth rates, but the absolute dollars for 2011 are pretty similar to what we would have expected back in October. So we had a little bit softer sales level in the fourth quarter of 2010. But if you look at the dollar sales value in 2011, that's fairly unchanged. So the only other market segment that we changed a bit was regional, business, general aviation, where we took those sales down by around $50 million from our prior guidance. That's mostly in the business jet market. And just to give you a little bit of color there, first of all, it's a relatively small part of our total sales, 4%, 5% when you look at OE and aftermarket. So it's not a huge part of our business. But we're seeing good underlying trends that would suggest momentum in that marketplace is starting to develop. So the things that we look for are the used aircraft prices beginning to stabilize. We're seeing better activity levels across the current business jet fleet, and we're seeing good growth in Goodrich's aftermarket related to the business jets. And what we're seeing on the OE side there is decent expectations for growth in OE sales rates, production rates on the larger aircraft. But the smaller, small and midsized aircraft have not yet seen those kinds of increases. So our general view is the small and medium growth rates are pushed out to 2012 from where we were thinking they could occur in the second half of '11, previously. So that's the major change in our sales guidance there. And on commercial OE, we took those down from a range of 15% to 20% growth in October down to 15%, and that's all related to changed expectations on 787."

Aftermarket sales, we took our guidance up by two percentage points, and we've said about $0.06 per share per percentage point and growth. So that's about $0.12 of increase there. And then the offset would be the slight reduction in sales in RBG&A OE, so the business jet OE market that we spoke of a moment ago. And then we do have expectation for a little bit higher corp cost in 2011 than we did earlier, and that's frankly all due to the higher stock price that we're enjoying.

So we'll continue to drive margin enhancement as long as the mix of sales growth between OE and aftermarket stays reasonably aligned. That tends to be the biggest difficulty that we have. And obviously, with the pension cost reduction, that's going to be helpful in terms of margins going forward as well. So that's kind of how we see the margin story. Again, to focus on the ALS, ES' margin story in the fourth quarter, a lot of that was unusual costs. And in terms of restructuring, higher compensation cost that we incurred during the quarter and just timing of some of the higher margin military and aftermarket sales.

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our fourth quarter results and then turn to our improved earnings outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. 
We closed out a solid 2010 with a very strong fourth quarter results. Our net income per diluted share grew 41% on sales growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported year-over-year sales growth. Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 2%. Our regional, business and general aviation original equipment market, sales increased by about 52%, which included organic growth of about 20%. Commercial aftermarket sales were 12% higher than the fourth quarter last year. Our defense and space sales continued their positive growth trend in the fourth quarter of 2010, increasing by 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 7% of this growth, while organic sales growth was about 2%. 
In the fourth quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 15.8% compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009, which helped us increase our net income per diluted share from $0.82 in the fourth quarter 2009 to $1.16 in the fourth quarter 2010. The overall improvement was due to strong sales growth, excellent operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement, a lower tax rate and increased favorable changes and estimates for certain long-term contracts, partially offset by costs associated with the early retirement of debt. 
Specifically, as we discussed with you last October, the fourth quarter 2010 results included debt redemption costs of approximately $0.17 per diluted share. We reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% for the fourth quarter 2010 compared to an effective tax rate of 29.5% during the fourth quarter 2009.
Fourth quarter 2010 tax rate included previously announced tax benefit of approximately $0.18 per diluted share related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board concerning issues related to Goodrich and Rohr for all tax years through 2001 and approximately $0.11 per diluted share for the full year 2010 benefit of the R&D tax credit, which was renewed by the U.S. Congress in late 2010.
Our fourth quarter 2010 results included higher pretax income of $8 million, $5 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share related to changes in estimates for certain long-term contracts, primarily in our Aerostructures and Aircraft Wheels and Brakes businesses compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Total changes in estimates for the fourth quarter 2010 were $27 million pretax. The fourth quarter 2010 included total pretax restructuring charges of $7 million, $4 million after tax or $0.03 per diluted share. These actions were not included in our prior outlook for the 2010 earnings.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, or free cash flow for the fourth quarter 2010, was a use of cash of $114 million. As we discussed during our last conference call, we made $300 million of incremental contribution to our pension plans in October. Excluding this incremental contribution, our free cash flow conversion of net income would have easily exceeded 100%.
Since last October, we have announced significant progress on existing programs and several new business wins. We have begun environmental testing of the first operationally responsive satellite. We signed a 10-year in a sales service agreement with Air Arabia for the support of missiles and thrust reversers in the airlines' fleet of more than 50 A320 aircraft. 
We were selected by Airbus to provide the main landing gear for the -1000 variant of the A350 XWB aircraft. This contract is expected to generate more than $2 billion in original equipment and aftermarket revenue for us over the life of the program. And we received a production contract from Lockheed Martin to supply 160 pylons to the U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy strategic airlifter, reliability enhancement and reengining program.
For our full year 2010, we reported a 4% increase in sales to $7 billion, and our income from continuing operations increased from $560 million in 2009 to $577 million in 2010. On a per share basis, we reported income from continuing operations per diluted share of $4.50 in 2010.
For the full year 2010, our large commercial airplane original equipment sales increased by 4%. Regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales grew by 2%, including sales associated with DeCrane acquisition. Organically, sales in this market channel decreased by about 5%. 
Large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales were flat compared to 2009. Defense and space sales grew by about 11%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition. Organic growth in this market channel was 3%.
For 2010, our free cash flow was approximately 50% of income from continuing operations, including the incremental $300 million pension contribution made in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, free cash flow is approximately 102% of income from continuing operations. 
Now I'll turn to 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in late 2010 will continue in 2011, and we expect significant sales growth in each of our market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 11%, which would provide us with record sales of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion in 2011. 
Based on the recent improvements in airline capacity trends, improving airline profitability and increasing demand trends for our commercial aftermarket products, we are raising our sales growth expectations for commercial aftermarket sales to a range of 7% to 9%. This strong sales growth should result in an even better growth than net income per diluted share. Largely driven by increased expectations for commercial aftermarket sales and lower pension expense, we now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.45, an increase of 18% to 21% compared to 2010.
As I noted, we expect sales growth in 2011 in every market channel, including large commercial airplane original equipment sales growth of about 15%. We are assuming that all announced production rate increases are implemented. And Boeing 787 and 747-8 deliveries are consistent with the latest schedule announced by Boeing. Regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 30%, including incremental sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Organically, we expect sales to increase by about 6%.
Large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 7% to 9%. And defense and space sales of both original equipment and aftermarket products and services are expected to increase by about 7% to 9%. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of about 16.5%. This reflects growth in aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs, offset by very rapid growth in lower-margin commercial original equipment and cost-plus military contracts.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $74 million or $0.37 per diluted share. The estimate for 2011 pension expense is based on the 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 14% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of 5.67%. In addition, we have reduced our long-term rate of return assumption on U.S. plan assets to 8.25% as of January 1, 2011 compared to our prior assumption of 8.75%. 
For 2011, we expect total worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $88 million compared to $162 million in 2010. We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2010. 
We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
We get a lot of questions about our defense programs and our ability to continue to show significant growth in this market channel. Our defense programs are characterized by diversity and criticality. We are in almost every platform in the defense industry today, both OE and aftermarket. A significant portion of our sales are to international customers, either directly or through foreign military sales contracts. We expect that trend to continue. 
In many cases, we have content on multiple platforms competing for an award, such as the Air Force U.S. tanker competition where we are well positioned on both the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A330. We have strong positions in a number of large defense programs, which will grow over the next several years like the C-5 reengining, the F-35 and the C-130. 
As we have previously discussed in our presentations, we are well positioned in growth markets like helicopters and ISR. We have substantial shipset content on helicopters like the Black Hawk, the Apache and the CH-47. Another area of strength for Goodrich is our ISR sensors. The U2 with our SYERS multi-spectral imaging sensor is being tasked more than ever, and the Goodrich DB-110 sensor is having great success with numerous international customers and has received new international contract awards.
Finally, we also play a big part in the precision weapons programs of the U.S. and foreign militaries with our actuation and inertial guidance systems. So overall, we feel we are well positioned to help the U.S. and allied troops with vital and cost-effective equipment that will result in continued good growth in our defense and space sales. 
Overall, our performance during the fourth quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint, and we are looking forward to a strong 2011. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales. 
Our financial position remains excellent, with about $800 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you during 2011. We have a great team, and we're all very excited about continuing to grow the company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And we’re starting off January in many of our businesses with a much larger backlog than we had in January of last year. So orders are coming in. And particularly in our Aerostructures business, the orders from majors have turned up in the fourth quarter. That's a very good sign that airlines are having to do some restocking on parts that they have avoided buying in the past because they've had a lot of spare engines out there. So it's not any one thing, we're just kind of seeing a lot of our aftermarket businesses see a much better level of activity, which gave us the confidence to raise that forecast."

So my colleague is here and always prepared. Yes, and in terms of the military side, we changed the guidance in terms of growth rates, but the absolute dollars for 2011 are pretty similar to what we would have expected back in October. So we had a little bit softer sales level in the fourth quarter of 2010. But if you look at the dollar sales value in 2011, that's fairly unchanged. So the only other market segment that we changed a bit was regional business, general aviation, where we took those sales down by around $50 million from our prior guidance. That's mostly in the business jet market. And just to give you a little bit of color there, first of all, it's a relatively small part of our total sales, 4%, 5% when you look at OE and aftermarket. So it's not a huge part of our business. But we're seeing good underlying trends that would suggest momentum in that marketplace is starting to develop. So the things that we look for are the used aircraft prices beginning to stabilize. We're seeing better activity levels across the current business jet fleet, and we're seeing good growth in Goodrich's aftermarket related to the business jets. And what we're seeing on the OE side there is decent expectations for growth in OE sales rates, production rates on the larger aircraft. But the smaller, small and midsized aircraft have not yet seen those kinds of increases. So our general view is the small and medium growth rates are pushed out to 2012 from where we were thinking they could occur in the second half of '11, previously. So that's the major change in our sales guidance there. And on commercial OE, we took those down from a range of 15% to 20% growth in October down to 15%, and that's all related to changed expectations on 787."

I mean, that's really been a disciplined approach that were centered around Lean and CI. And as that culture spreads around the company, the cost that leave because of productivity focus, those are not coming back. I mean we didn't take the easy things like easy actions, like salary reductions and the 401(k) freezes and things like that across the enterprise. So we don't have a headwind of cost that have to come back into the system. So we're really not seeing those kinds of pressures. So we'll continue to drive margin enhancement as long as the mix of sales growth between OE and aftermarket stays reasonably aligned. That tends to be the biggest difficulty that we have. And obviously, with the pension cost reduction, that's going to be helpful in terms of margins going forward as well. So that's kind of how we see the margin story. Again, to focus on the ALS, ES' margin story in the fourth quarter, a lot of that was unusual costs. And in terms of restructuring, higher compensation cost that we incurred during the quarter and just timing of some of the higher margin military and aftermarket sales. So you bridge those couple of three things, the margin performance in the quarter was in line with what we're thinking going into 2011 and with prior quarters."

One is that the changes going forward -- the R&D tax credit is obviously helpful, and that's more of a permanent benefit. Some of the accelerated depreciation, bonus depreciation, helps you on the cash flow side, not on the earnings side because it's a deferral mechanism. When we think about where to put our investment at the margin, that does make a difference, for us, it's more important to look at where long-term tax policy is and making those decisions rather than kind of short-term moves, how long are those things going to be in place. So if we had more confidence on what the outlook would be two, three, four, five years from now, it would be much more beneficial to our investment philosophy as it relates to U.S. versus elsewhere.

Today, I'll begin with our fourth quarter results and then turn to our improved earnings outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We closed ou",1726,"Thanks, Paul. You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our fourth quarter results and then turn to our improved earnings outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. 
We closed out a solid 2010 with a very strong fourth quarter results. Our net income per diluted share grew 41% on sales growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported year-over-year sales growth. Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 2%. Our regional, business and general aviation original equipment market, sales increased by about 52%, which included organic growth of about 20%. Commercial aftermarket sales were 12% higher than the fourth quarter last year. Our defense and space sales continued their positive growth trend in the fourth quarter of 2010, increasing by 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 7% of this growth, while organic sales growth was about 2%. 
In the fourth quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 15.8% compared to 14.2% in the fourth quarter of 2009, which helped us increase our net income per diluted share from $0.82 in the fourth quarter 2009 to $1.16 in the fourth quarter 2010. The overall improvement was due to strong sales growth, excellent operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement, a lower tax rate and increased favorable changes and estimates for certain long-term contracts, partially offset by costs associated with the early retirement of debt. 
Specifically, as we discussed with you last October, the fourth quarter 2010 results included debt redemption costs of approximately $0.17 per diluted share. We reported an effective tax rate of 8.5% for the fourth quarter 2010 compared to an effective tax rate of 29.5% during the fourth quarter 2009.
Fourth quarter 2010 tax rate included previously announced tax benefit of approximately $0.18 per diluted share related to a settlement with the California Franchise Tax Board concerning issues related to Goodrich and Rohr for all tax years through 2001 and approximately $0.11 per diluted share for the full year 2010 benefit of the R&D tax credit, which was renewed by the U.S. Congress in late 2010.
Our fourth quarter 2010 results included higher pretax income of $8 million, $5 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share related to changes in estimates for certain long-term contracts, primarily in our Aerostructures and Aircraft Wheels and Brakes businesses compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. 
Total changes in estimates for the fourth quarter 2010 were $27 million pretax. The fourth quarter 2010 included total pretax restructuring charges of $7 million, $4 million after tax or $0.03 per diluted share. These actions were not included in our prior outlook for the 2010 earnings.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, or free cash flow for the fourth quarter 2010, was a use of cash of $114 million. As we discussed during our last conference call, we made $300 million of incremental contribution to our pension plans in October. Excluding this incremental contribution, our free cash flow conversion of net income would have easily exceeded 100%.
Since last October, we have announced significant progress on existing programs and several new business wins. We have begun environmental testing of the first operationally responsive satellite. We signed a 10-year in a sales service agreement with Air Arabia for the support of missiles and thrust reversers in the airlines' fleet of more than 50 A320 aircraft. 
We were selected by Airbus to provide the main landing gear for the -1000 variant of the A350 XWB aircraft. This contract is expected to generate more than $2 billion in original equipment and aftermarket revenue for us over the life of the program. And we received a production contract from Lockheed Martin to supply 160 pylons to the U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy strategic airlifter, reliability enhancement and re-engining program.
For our full year 2010, we reported a 4% increase in sales to $7 billion, and our income from continuing operations increased from $560 million in 2009 to $577 million in 2010. On a per share basis, we reported income from continuing operations per diluted share of $4.50 in 2010.
For the full year 2010, our large commercial airplane original equipment sales increased by 4%. Regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales grew by 2%, including sales associated with DeCrane acquisition. Organically, sales in this market channel decreased by about 5%. 
Large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales were flat compared to 2009. Defense and space sales grew by about 11%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition. Organic growth in this market channel was 3%.
For 2010, our free cash flow was approximately 50% of income from continuing operations, including the incremental $300 million pension contribution made in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, free cash flow is approximately 102% of income from continuing operations. 
Now I'll turn to 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in late 2010 will continue in 2011, and we expect significant sales growth in each of our market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 11%, which would provide us with record sales of $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion in 2011. 
Based on the recent improvements in airline capacity trends, improving airline profitability and increasing demand trends for our commercial aftermarket products, we are raising our sales growth expectations for commercial aftermarket sales to a range of 7% to 9%. This strong sales growth should result in an even better growth than net income per diluted share. Largely driven by increased expectations for commercial aftermarket sales and lower pension expense, we now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.45, an increase of 18% to 21% compared to 2010.
As I noted, we expect sales growth in 2011 in every market channel, including large commercial airplane original equipment sales growth of about 15%. We are assuming that all announced production rate increases are implemented. And Boeing 787 and 747-8 deliveries are consistent with the latest schedule announced by Boeing. Regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 30%, including incremental sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Organically, we expect sales to increase by about 6%.
Large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 7% to 9%. And defense and space sales of both original equipment and aftermarket products and services are expected to increase by about 7% to 9%. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of about 16.5%. This reflects growth in aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs, offset by very rapid growth in lower-margin commercial original equipment and cost-plus military contracts.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $74 million or $0.37 per diluted share. The estimate for 2011 pension expense is based on the 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 14% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of 5.67%. In addition, we have reduced our long-term rate of return assumption on U.S. plan assets to 8.25% as of January 1, 2011 compared to our prior assumption of 8.75%. 
For 2011, we expect total worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $88 million compared to $162 million in 2010. We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2010. 
We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
We get a lot of questions about our defense programs and our ability to continue to show significant growth in this market channel. Our defense programs are characterized by diversity and criticality. We are in almost every platform in the defense industry today, both OE and aftermarket. A significant portion of our sales are to international customers, either directly or through foreign military sales contracts. We expect that trend to continue. 
In many cases, we have content on multiple platforms competing for an award, such as the Air Force U.S. tanker competition where we are well positioned on both the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A330. We have strong positions in a number of large defense programs, which will grow over the next several years like the C-5 re-engining, the F-35 and the C-130. 
As we have previously discussed in our presentations, we are well positioned in growth markets like helicopters and ISR. We have substantial shipset content on helicopters like the Black Hawk, the Apache and the CH-47. Another area of strength for Goodrich is our ISR sensors. The U2 with our SYERS multi-spectral imaging sensor is being tasked more than ever, and the Goodrich DB-110 sensor is having great success with numerous international customers and has received new international contract awards.
Finally, we also play a big part in the precision weapons programs of the U.S. and foreign militaries with our actuation and inertial guidance systems. So overall, we feel we are well positioned to help the U.S. and allied troops with vital and cost-effective equipment that will result in continued good growth in our defense and space sales. 
Overall, our performance during the fourth quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint, and we are looking forward to a strong 2011. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales. 
Our financial position remains excellent, with about $800 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you during 2011. We have a great team, and we're all very excited about continuing to grow the company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

And we’re starting off January in many of our businesses with a much larger backlog than we had in January of last year. So orders are coming in. And particularly in our Aerostructures business, the orders from majors have turned up in the fourth quarter. That's a very good sign that airlines are having to do some restocking on parts that they have avoided buying in the past because they've had a lot of spare engines out there. So it's not any one thing, we're just kind of seeing a lot of our aftermarket businesses see a much better level of activity, which gave us the confidence to raise that forecast."

So my colleague is here and always prepared. Yes, and in terms of the military side, we changed the guidance in terms of growth rates, but the absolute dollars for 2011 are pretty similar to what we would have expected back in October. So we had a little bit softer sales level in the fourth quarter of 2010. But if you look at the dollar sales value in 2011, that's fairly unchanged. So the only other market segment that we changed a bit was regional business, general aviation, where we took those sales down by around $50 million from our prior guidance. That's mostly in the business jet market. And just to give you a little bit of color there, first of all, it's a relatively small part of our total sales, 4%, 5% when you look at OE and aftermarket. So it's not a huge part of our business. But we're seeing good underlying trends that would suggest momentum in that marketplace is starting to develop. So the things that we look for are the used aircraft prices beginning to stabilize. We're seeing better activity levels across the current business jet fleet, and we're seeing good growth in Goodrich's aftermarket related to the business jets. And what we're seeing on the OE side there is decent expectations for growth in OE sales rates, production rates on the larger aircraft. But the smaller, small and midsized aircraft have not yet seen those kinds of increases. So our general view is the small and medium growth rates are pushed out to 2012 from where we were thinking they could occur in the second half of '11, previously. So that's the major change in our sales guidance there. And on commercial OE, we took those down from a range of 15% to 20% growth in October down to 15%, and that's all related to changed expectations on 787."

We booked about $3 million or so of restructuring costs in the quarter in compensation cost. Generally, we're higher at the corp G&A than our normal levels, and that was probably $6 million, $7 million. And each segment had higher comp cost as well in the $2 million, $3 million range per segment. So between those two, there's $5 million to $6 million of cost in the fourth quarter that aren't there on a normal basis, so that's almost the point of margin right there. And then as Marshall said, we ended the quarter with a decent backlog in the Wheel and Brake business. So there was timing of shipments that moved from fourth quarter to first quarter of 2011 that changed that margin picture in the fourth quarter just a little bit. So those three factors are mostly the gap between our normal margin levels of a little over 11% to where they were in the fourth quarter of about 10%."

Aftermarket sales, we took our guidance up by two percentage points, and we've said about $0.06 per share per percentage point and growth. So that's about $0.12 of increase there. And then the offset would be the slight reduction in sales in RBG&A OE, so the business jet OE market that we spoke of a moment ago.

And nothing was sacred. I mean, we moved monuments. We did everything. We moved all the electrical connections, all the air connections, everything. And as Scott said earlier, this is really becoming a culture across this company. We improved our linearity of cash flow this last year instead of everything towards the end of reporting periods based on continuous improvement events that our segment president started at the early part of the year. And we have about close to 10% of our employee equivalents in low-cost country now. We measure that. We measure the throughput and improved quality and improved on-time delivery that comes through this in terms of operational then a lot of cost metrics also. And that's what allowed us to keep the margins reasonably high even in the financial downturn and why we think we can continue to move margins positively."

We found that in some of our low-cost facilities, we can actually produce it ourselves for a lower cost than we can buy it. And we can continue to lean the systems in those low-cost countries.

So we haven't put out a specific number that's reflected in our earnings, our margin guidance each year, and it reflects our expectation that over time we can continue to grow those margins."

One is that the changes going forward -- the R&D tax credit is obviously helpful, and that's more of a permanent benefit. Some of the accelerated depreciation, bonus depreciation, helps you on the cash flow side, not on the earnings side because it's a deferral mechanism. When we think about where to put our investment at the margin, that does make a difference, for us, it's more important to look at where long-term tax policy is and making those decisions rather than kind of short-term moves, how long are those things going to be in place. So if we had more confidence on what the outlook would be two, three, four, five years from now, it would be much more beneficial to our investment philosophy as it relates to U.S. versus elsewhere. And I think a lot of other companies around the industry would look at that as well.

Today, I'll begin with our first quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We started out 2011 with ex",1339,"Thanks, Paul. You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and a related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our first quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We started out 2011 with excellent first quarter results. Our net income per diluted share grew 75% on sales growth of 12%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported year-over-year and sequential sales growth. On a year-over-year basis, our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 6%. Our original business and General Aviation original equipment sales increased by about 55%, which included sales associated with last year's DeCrane acquisition. Our commercial aftermarket sales growth of 12% was significantly greater than the growth in the airline capacity and slightly higher than our expectations and helped solidify our view that 2011 will be a strong growth year for this channel. The first quarter 2011 sales were 9% higher than fourth quarter 2010. Our defense and space sales grew organically at a double-digit rate. We believe that our presence in attractive, high-growth markets such as ISR, helicopters and precision munitions will enable Goodrich to grow our defense and space sales faster than the global defense budgets over the next several years. In the first quarter 2011, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.7% compared to 15.3% in the first quarter 2010, which helped us increase our net income per diluted share to $1.52 in the first quarter 2011 from $0.87 in the first quarter 2010. The overall margin improvement was primarily due to strong growth in aftermarket defense and regional business and general aviation sales, excellent operational performance, relentless pursuit of continued improvement and lower pension expense. EPS also benefited from a lower tax rate. Regarding taxes, we reported an effective tax rate of 24.4% for the first quarter 2011 compared to an effective tax rate of 37.9% during the first quarter 2010. The first quarter 2011 tax rate includes a previously announced benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.16 per diluted share related to a tax settlement. There were no similar benefits during the first quarter 2010. Last year, in the first quarter, we had an additional tax expense of $10 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the U.S. healthcare reform legislation, which was not repeated this year. We continue to expect the full tax year to be about 30%. The benefit in the first quarter versus the average rate of 30% was about $0.11 per share. Compared to last year, we had a lower pretax pension expense of about $21 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the first quarter 2011. Total changes and estimates for the first quarter 2011 were $21 million pretax, slightly better than the $16 million we reported in the first quarter 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures or free cash flow for the first quarter 2011 was $61 million, a $52 million improvement over the results for the first quarter 2011. During the quarter, we completed most of our planned pension contributions for the year. Since last February, we have now several business highlights. We announced an agreement to acquire Microtecnica, a leading provider of flight control actuation systems for helicopters, regional business, aircraft and missile actuation. The business also provides thermal and environmental control systems for commercial and military aircraft. We expect this acquisition to close during the second quarter 2011. We were selected by Airbus to provide the nacelle system for the Pratt & Whitney PurePower 1100G engine, one of the engine options on the Airbus A320neo, new engine option airplane. We were awarded the contract to deliver two upgraded Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance Sensors, SYERS, to the United States Air Force for use on the U-2 platform. We completed the certification process for the Boeing 787 electric braking system and we received a follow-on contract from the Defense Logistics Agency to supply over 1,600 carbon brakes and over 1,400 boltless wheels for the U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft fleet. 
Now, I'll turn to our expectations for the full year 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in the first quarter 2011 will continue throughout 2011 and we expect significant sales growth in each of our major market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 12%, which will provide us with sales of approximately $7.8 billion in 2011, at the top end of our prior outlook. Our new outlook does not include sales associated with the Microtecnica acquisition. We will update our sales outlook when we report our quarterly results for the quarter in which the acquisition closes. While aftermarket sales in the first quarter were a little stronger than we expected, airline capacity growth remains consistent with our forecast, so we are maintaining our 7% to 9% sales growth expectations for the commercial aftermarket sales for 2011. Our expectations for growth in defense and space market channel increased to 8% to 10% based on our strong first quarter sales and based on business we already have in hand and expectations for future awards, especially in our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business. This strong sales growth should result in even better growth in net income per diluted share. We now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.55, an increase of 20% to 23% compared to 2010. As usual, our outlook does not include restructuring charges for actions that have not yet been approved or announced. On March 14, 2011, our Landing Gear business began discussions with one of its local employee units regarding a new contract. The contract expires in May 2011. Our discussions included the fact that we are considering the potential closure of our Landing Gear business in Cleveland, Ohio and negotiations with the union are ongoing. Should we decide to close the facility, we would likely need to recognize personnel-related and facility closure costs at that time. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of about 16.5% to 17%. This reflects growth in the aftermarket, the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs and lower pension expense, partially offset by very rapid growth in lower margin, commercial original equipment and cost plus military contracts, lower worldwide prepension expense of approximately $74 million or $0.37 per diluted share. This is unchanged from our prior outlook. 
We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2011. The remaining three quarters of 2011, our quarterly effective tax rate should average around 32%. We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and pretax worldwide pension expense -- pardon me, worldwide pension planned contributions of about $100 million. Overall, our performance during the first quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint and is a building block towards a very strong 2011. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by strong market conditions in commercial original equipment and aftermarket, our significant market share gains on new commercial military aircraft currently in development and our position in growth areas of military budgets, helicopters, precision-guided munitions, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and fixed wing aircraft retrofit programs. 
Our financial position remains excellent, with about $800 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value. I'm looking forward to talking to all of you during the remainder of 2011. We have a great team and we are all very excited about continuing growth in our company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth.

The supply chain continues to deliver favorable results et cetera. So good operational performance that continues to be reflected in those numbers. Also, good on the overhead side where we continue to benefit from rising rates throughout the commercial sector and that helps us with overhead absorption. So good trends, nothing dramatically different. Some of the wheel and brakes performance improvements in the first quarter were expected for the full year. So there's a little bit of a phasing there.

We were projecting 16.5% to 17% margins for the full year and we started off the first quarter at 17.7%. What we're going to in see the next three quarters is a pretty significant ramp up on OE sales, which as you know, are somewhat dilutive to margins. We would expect the last three quarters to operate at about 10% higher than the run rate in the first quarter from an OE sales standpoint. So that will be a little bit dilutive to margins. And also, some of the cost plus military programs continue to ramp throughout the year. So both of those things put a little bit of downward pressure on margins. And in addition, our wheel and brake business puts out more low charge hardware as rates ramp up on the OE side. So those two things will put a little bit of downward pressure on margins. Relative to Electronic Systems, some of that was just a comparable point a year ago. They had some unusual one-time costs in the year-ago period first quarter 2010 that are no longer part of the process. They finished up -- and if you look sequentially as well, they had some unusual charges in the fourth quarter of last year as well, including finishing up some of the R&D work on 787 in the fuels area, which will relieve some of that cost going forward as well. So the run rate for that business, our expectations for full year '11 are in the 16% to 17% range. So the first quarter at 16.4% is very consistent with what we expect for the full year."

So I'm not too worried about that. The second question on our supply chain broadly, that's something we spend a lot of time with. As we've gone through the continuous improvement journey at Goodrich, you end up not just trying to lean at your natural facilities but you go into your key suppliers to do the same things. A lot of times, that means small suppliers that don't have the staff to do that kind of thing. And so we'll send people in and help them improve their on-time deliveries and quality.

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and a related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our first quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We started out 2011 with ex",1342,"Thanks, Paul. You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and a related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our first quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We started out 2011 with excellent first quarter results. Our net income per diluted share grew 75% on sales growth of 12%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported year-over-year and sequential sales growth. On a year-over-year basis, our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 6%. Our regional, business and general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 55%, which included sales associated with last year's DeCrane acquisition. Our commercial aftermarket sales growth of 12% was significantly greater than the growth in the airline capacity and slightly higher than our expectations and helped solidify our view that 2011 will be a strong growth year for this channel. The first quarter 2011 sales were 9% higher than fourth quarter 2010. Our defense and space sales grew organically at a double-digit rate. We believe that our presence in attractive, high-growth markets such as ISR, helicopters and precision munitions will enable Goodrich to grow our defense and space sales faster than the global defense budgets over the next several years. 
In the first quarter 2011, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.7% compared to 15.3% in the first quarter 2010, which helped us increase our net income per diluted share to $1.52 in the first quarter 2011 from $0.87 in the first quarter 2010. The overall margin improvement was primarily due to strong growth in aftermarket defense and regional, business and general aviation sales, excellent operational performance, relentless pursuit of continued improvement and lower pension expense. EPS also benefited from a lower tax rate. Regarding taxes, we reported an effective tax rate of 24.4% for the first quarter 2011 compared to an effective tax rate of 37.9% during the first quarter 2010. The first quarter 2011 tax rate includes a previously announced benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.16 per diluted share related to a tax settlement. There were no similar benefits during the first quarter 2010. Last year, in the first quarter, we had an additional tax expense of $10 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the U.S. health care reform legislation, which was not repeated this year. We continue to expect the full tax year to be about 30%. The benefit in the first quarter versus the average rate of 30% was about $0.11 per share. Compared to last year, we had a lower pretax pension expense of about $21 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the first quarter 2011. Total changes and estimates for the first quarter 2011 were $21 million pretax, slightly better than the $16 million we reported in the first quarter 2010. 
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, or free cash flow, for the first quarter 2011 was $61 million, a $52 million improvement over the results for the first quarter 2011 (sic) [2010]. During the quarter, we completed most of our planned pension contributions for the year. 
Since last February, we have now several business highlights. We announced an agreement to acquire Microtecnica, a leading provider of flight control actuation systems for helicopters, regional, business, aircraft and missile actuation. The business also provides thermal and environmental control systems for commercial and military aircraft. We expect this acquisition to close during the second quarter 2011.  
We were selected by Airbus to provide the nacelle system for the Pratt & Whitney PurePower 1100G engine, one of the engine options on the Airbus A320neo new engine option airplane. We were awarded a contract to deliver two upgraded Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance Sensors, SYERS, to the United States Air Force for use on the U-2 platform. We completed the certification process for the Boeing 787 electric braking system, and we received a follow-on contract from the Defense Logistics Agency to supply over 1,600 carbon brakes and over 1,400 boltless wheels for the U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft fleet. 
Now I'll turn to our expectations for the full year 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in the first quarter 2011 will continue throughout 2011, and we expect significant sales growth in each of our major market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 12%, which will provide us with sales of approximately $7.8 billion in 2011, at the top end of our prior outlook. Our new outlook does not include sales associated with the Microtecnica acquisition. We will update our sales outlook when we report our quarterly results for the quarter in which the acquisition closes. While aftermarket sales in the first quarter were a little stronger than we expected, airline capacity growth remains consistent with our forecast, so we are maintaining our 7% to 9% sales growth expectations for the commercial aftermarket sales for 2011. Our expectations for growth in the defense and space market channel increased to 8% to 10% based on our strong first quarter sales and based on business we already have in hand and expectations for future awards, especially in our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business. This strong sales growth should result in even better growth in net income per diluted share. We now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.55, an increase of 20% to 23% compared to 2010. As usual, our outlook does not include restructuring charges for actions that have not yet been approved or announced. On March 14, 2011, our Landing Gear business began discussions with one of its local employee units regarding a new contract. The contract expires in May 2011. Our discussions included the fact that we are considering the potential closure of our Landing Gear facility in Cleveland, Ohio, and negotiations with the union are ongoing. Should we decide to close the facility, we would likely need to recognize personnel-related and facility closure costs at that time. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of about 16.5% to 17%. This reflects growth in the aftermarket, the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs and lower pension expense, partially offset by very rapid growth in lower-margin commercial original equipment and cost-plus military contracts, lower worldwide prepension [pretax pension] expense of approximately $74 million or $0.37 per diluted share. This is unchanged from our prior outlook. 
We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2011. For remaining three quarters of 2011, our quarterly effective tax rate should average around 32%. We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million, and pretax worldwide pension expense -- pardon me, worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
Overall, our performance during the first quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint and is a building block towards a very strong 2011. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by strong market conditions in commercial original equipment and aftermarket, our significant market share gains on new commercial military aircraft currently in development and our position in growth areas of military budgets, helicopters, precision-guided munitions, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and fixed-wing aircraft retrofit programs. 
Our financial position remains excellent, with about $800 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value. I'm looking forward to talking to all of you during the remainder of 2011. We have a great team, and we are all very excited about continuing growth in our company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. Let's now open the call to questions."

The performance in the first quarter was driven by the same things that we've seen over the last several years, largely on the cost side, where we continue to drive improvements in productivity. The supply chain continues to deliver favorable results, et cetera, so good operational performance that continues to be reflected in those numbers. Also, good on the overhead side, where we continue to benefit from rising rates throughout the commercial sector, and that helps us with overhead absorption. So good trends, nothing dramatically different. Some of the wheel and brakes performance improvements in the first quarter were expected for the full year, so there's a little bit of a phasing there. So not all of the delta between the average rate for the full year versus what we saw in the first quarter is all incremental upside. Some of it is just timing."

Sam, just kind of on the general question regarding where margins are likely to go in the second or the last three quarters of the year, we're projecting 16.5% to 17% margins for the full year, and we started off the first quarter at 17.7%. What we're going to in see the next three quarters is a pretty significant ramp-up on OE sales, which, as you know, are somewhat dilutive to margins. We would expect the last three quarters to operate at about 10% higher than the run rate in the first quarter from an OE sales standpoint. So that will be a little bit dilutive to margins. And also, some of the cost-plus military programs continue to ramp throughout the year. So both of those things put a little bit of downward pressure on margins. And in addition, our wheel and brake business puts out more low-charge hardware as rates ramp up on the OE side. So those two things will put a little bit of downward pressure on margins. Relative to Electronic Systems, some of that was just a comparable point a year ago. They had some unusual onetime costs in the year-ago period first quarter 2010 that are no longer part of the process. They finished up -- and if you look sequentially as well, they had some unusual charges in the fourth quarter of last year as well, including finishing up some of the R&D work on 787 in the fuels area, which will relieve some of that costs going forward as well. So the run rate for that business, our expectations for full year '11 are in the 16% to 17% range. So the first quarter at 16.4% is very consistent with what we expect for the full year."

The biggest issue is whether power or transportation shortages continue. We've had no issues right now with it, a little concerned about air shipping capacity as more products flow in and out of Japan. But right now, our rates are holding up with this. So bottom line, we've got no detrimental impact to date. But the situation based on the power, at least, remains a little bit dynamic. But we've got enough inventory at critical parts of our business to sustain us for the next few months, so I'm not too worried about that. The second question on our supply chain broadly, that's something we spend a lot of time with. As we've gone through the continuous improvement journey at Goodrich, you end up not just trying to lean out your own facilities, but you go into your key suppliers and do the same thing. And a lot of times, that means small suppliers that don't have the staff to do that kind of thing, and so we'll send people in and help them improve their on-time deliveries and quality. We get a benefit by that, and many times, we can actually get a lower price. So I think we're sitting pretty well for the ramp-up from our supply base."

So that mix dynamic does make a difference when you're looking quarter-to-quarter.

Today, I'll begin with our first quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We started out 2011 with ex",1341,"Thanks, Paul. You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and a related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our first quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We started out 2011 with excellent first quarter results. Our net income per diluted share grew 75% on sales growth of 12%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported year-over-year and sequential sales growth. On a year-over-year basis, our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 6%. Our regional, business and general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 55%, which included sales associated with last year's DeCrane acquisition. Our commercial aftermarket sales growth of 12% was significantly greater than the growth in the airline capacity and slightly higher than our expectations and helped solidify our view that 2011 will be a strong growth year for this channel. The first quarter 2011 sales were 9% higher than fourth quarter 2010. Our defense and space sales grew organically at a double-digit rate. We believe that our presence in attractive, high-growth markets such as ISR, helicopters and precision munitions will enable Goodrich to grow our defense and space sales faster than the global defense budgets over the next several years. 
In the first quarter 2011, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.7% compared to 15.3% in the first quarter 2010, which helped us increase our net income per diluted share to $1.52 in the first quarter 2011 from $0.87 in the first quarter 2010. The overall margin improvement was primarily due to strong growth in aftermarket defense and regional, business and general aviation sales, excellent operational performance, relentless pursuit of continued improvement and lower pension expense. EPS also benefited from a lower tax rate. Regarding taxes, we reported an effective tax rate of 24.4% for the first quarter 2011 compared to an effective tax rate of 37.9% during the first quarter 2010. The first quarter 2011 tax rate includes a previously announced benefit of approximately $20 million or $0.16 per diluted share related to a tax settlement. There were no similar benefits during the first quarter 2010. Last year, in the first quarter, we had an additional tax expense of $10 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the U.S. health care reform legislation, which was not repeated this year. We continue to expect the full tax year to be about 30%. The benefit in the first quarter versus the average rate of 30% was about $0.11 per share. Compared to last year, we had a lower pretax pension expense of about $21 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the first quarter 2011. Total changes and estimates for the first quarter 2011 were $21 million pretax, slightly better than the $16 million we reported in the first quarter 2010. 
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, or free cash flow, for the first quarter 2011 was $61 million, a $52 million improvement over the results for the first quarter 2011 (sic). During the quarter, we completed most of our planned pension contributions for the year. 
Since last February, we have now several business highlights. We announced an agreement to acquire Microtecnica, a leading provider of flight control actuation systems for helicopters, regional business, aircraft and missile actuation. The business also provides thermal and environmental control systems for commercial and military aircraft. We expect this acquisition to close during the second quarter 2011.  
We were selected by Airbus to provide the nacelle system for the Pratt & Whitney PurePower 1100G engine, one of the engine options on the Airbus A320neo new engine option airplane. We were awarded a contract to deliver two upgraded Senior Year Electro-Optical Reconnaissance Sensors, SYERS, to the United States Air Force for use on the U-2 platform. We completed the certification process for the Boeing 787 electric braking system, and we received a follow-on contract from the Defense Logistics Agency to supply over 1,600 carbon brakes and over 1,400 boltless wheels for the U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft fleet. 
Now I'll turn to our expectations for the full year 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in the first quarter 2011 will continue throughout 2011, and we expect significant sales growth in each of our major market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 12%, which will provide us with sales of approximately $7.8 billion in 2011, at the top end of our prior outlook. Our new outlook does not include sales associated with the Microtecnica acquisition. We will update our sales outlook when we report our quarterly results for the quarter in which the acquisition closes. While aftermarket sales in the first quarter were a little stronger than we expected, airline capacity growth remains consistent with our forecast, so we are maintaining our 7% to 9% sales growth expectations for the commercial aftermarket sales for 2011. Our expectations for growth in the defense and space market channel increased to 8% to 10% based on our strong first quarter sales and based on business we already have in hand and expectations for future awards, especially in our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business. This strong sales growth should result in even better growth in net income per diluted share. We now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.55, an increase of 20% to 23% compared to 2010. As usual, our outlook does not include restructuring charges for actions that have not yet been approved or announced. On March 14, 2011, our Landing Gear business began discussions with one of its local employee units regarding a new contract. The contract expires in May 2011. Our discussions included the fact that we are considering the potential closure of our Landing Gear facility in Cleveland, Ohio, and negotiations with the union are ongoing. Should we decide to close the facility, we would likely need to recognize personnel-related and facility closure costs at that time. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of about 16.5% to 17%. This reflects growth in the aftermarket, the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs and lower pension expense, partially offset by very rapid growth in lower-margin commercial original equipment and cost-plus military contracts, lower worldwide prepension [pretax pension] expense of approximately $74 million or $0.37 per diluted share. This is unchanged from our prior outlook. 
We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2011. For remaining three quarters of 2011, our quarterly effective tax rate should average around 32%. We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million, and pretax worldwide pension expense -- pardon me, worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
Overall, our performance during the first quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint and is a building block towards a very strong 2011. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by strong market conditions in commercial original equipment and aftermarket, our significant market share gains on new commercial military aircraft currently in development and our position in growth areas of military budgets, helicopters, precision-guided munitions, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and fixed-wing aircraft retrofit programs. 
Our financial position remains excellent, with about $800 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value. I'm looking forward to talking to all of you during the remainder of 2011. We have a great team, and we are all very excited about continuing growth in our company and our profits, as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. Let's now open the call to questions."

We said $25 million to $35 million when we came into the year. I think based on what we saw in the first quarter, we take that up about $10 million to the $35 million to $45 million range. The performance in the first quarter was driven by the same things that we've seen over the last several years, largely on the cost side, where we continue to drive improvements in productivity. The supply chain continues to deliver favorable results, et cetera, so good operational performance that continues to be reflected in those numbers. Also, good on the overhead side, where we continue to benefit from rising rates throughout the commercial sector, and that helps us with overhead absorption. So good trends, nothing dramatically different. Some of the wheel and brakes performance improvements in the first quarter were expected for the full year, so there's a little bit of a phasing there.

Sam, just kind of on the general question regarding where margins are likely to go in the second or the last three quarters of the year, we're projecting 16.5% to 17% margins for the full year, and we started off the first quarter at 17.7%. What we're going to in see the next three quarters is a pretty significant ramp-up on OE sales, which, as you know, are somewhat dilutive to margins. We would expect the last three quarters to operate at about 10% higher than the run rate in the first quarter from an OE sales standpoint. So that will be a little bit dilutive to margins. And also, some of the cost-plus military programs continue to ramp throughout the year. So both of those things put a little bit of downward pressure on margins. And in addition, our wheel and brake business puts out more low-charge hardware as rates ramp up on the OE side. So those two things will put a little bit of downward pressure on margins. Relative to Electronic Systems, some of that was just a comparable point a year ago. They had some unusual onetime costs in the year-ago period first quarter 2010 that are no longer part of the process. They finished up -- and if you look sequentially as well, they had some unusual charges in the fourth quarter of last year as well, including finishing up some of the R&D work on 787 in the fuels area, which will relieve some of that costs going forward as well. So the run rate for that business, our expectations for full year '11 are in the 16% to 17% range. So the first quarter at 16.4% is very consistent with what we expect for the full year."

But we've got enough inventory at critical parts of our business to sustain us for the next few months, so I'm not too worried about that. The second question on our supply chain broadly, that's something we spend a lot of time with. As we've gone through the continuous improvement journey at Goodrich, you end up not just trying to lean out your own facilities, but you go into your key suppliers and do the same thing. And a lot of times, that means small suppliers that don't have the staff to do that kind of thing, and so we'll send people in and help them improve their on-time deliveries and quality. We get a benefit by that, and many times, we can actually get a lower price. So I think we're sitting pretty well for the ramp-up from our supply base."

So there's good activity in the aftermarket retrofit, even in that side of the equation as well. But I would characterize both as growing."

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our second quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. Today, we reported excellent second quarter 2011 results for sales and earnings and announced a very significant increase to our sales and earnings expectations for 2011. During the second quarter, our sales grew 17%, including organic growth of 12%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported strong, year-over-year and sequential sales growth. On a year-over-year basis, sales in our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 17%. Our regional Business and General Aviation original equipment sales increased by about 58%, with organic growth of 23%. Our commercial aftermarket sales growth of 16% was significantly greater than the growth in airline capacity. This growth rate, which showed significant acceleration from our first quarter growth, was one of the primary reasons we raised our full year's expectations for this market channel to growth of about 13%. The second quarter 2011 sales were 6% higher than first quarter 2011. 
Our defense and space sales grew at a rate of 10%, with 6% organic growth. We continue to believe that our presence in attractive high-growth markets, such as ISR, helicopters and precision munitions will enable us to grow our defense and space sales at a midsingle-digit growth rate for the next several years despite the difficult global defense budget environment. 
In the second quarter 2011, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.2%, compared to 17.9% in the second quarter 2010. Our second quarter results included $23 million of costs related to a plant closure decision and the acquisition of Microtecnica. Excluding these costs, segment operating income margins would have been 18.4%. Our net income per diluted share increased to $1.38 in the second quarter 2011 and included costs of $0.14 per diluted share for plant closure and Microtecnica acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, EPS was up 23% from the second quarter 2010. Our strong earnings growth was primarily due to excellent growth in all of our market channels, particularly the commercial aftermarket, a relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and lower pension expense. 
Some of the specific items that affected earnings during the second quarter 2011 were as follows: as we announced in June, we recorded pretax cost related to a plant closure of $16 million or $0.08 per diluted share during the second quarter 2011. Our second quarter 2011 results also included pretax and after-tax cost of $7 million or $0.06 per diluted share associated with the Microtecnica acquisition. The plant closure and acquisition-related costs are reflected in the segment operating income for Actuation and Landing Systems. Total changes in estimates for the second quarter 2011 were a favorable $21 million pretax, somewhat lower than the; favorable $33 million we reported in the second quarter 2010. Compared to last year, we had lower pretax pension expense of about $19 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter 2011. The effective tax rate in the second quarter 2011 was 32.6%, in line with our expectations as compared to 32.1% in the second quarter 2010. Our second quarter 2011 results included higher pretax expenses of $14 million or $0.07 per diluted share related to share-based compensation compared to the second quarter of 2010. 
Net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures or free cash flow for the second quarter 2011 was $179 million, a little over 100% of reported net income. Since April, we've announced several significant events. Our ORS-1 satellite was successfully launched. ORS-1 is the first satellite in the Operational Responsive Space program designed to support combatant command operations and will provide a battle space awareness capability supporting the U.S. Central Command's mission needs. Goodrich is the prime contractor on this program. We completed the acquisition of Microtecnica, a leading provider of flight control actuation systems for helicopter, regional and business aircraft, missile actuation and aircraft thermal and environmental control systems. Integration's going very well and results are in line with our expectations. We announced the closure of the Marble Avenue landing gear facility in Cleveland, Ohio by the end of 2012. We expect to record pretax charges totaling $37 million, of which 40% are noncash. Approximately $20 million, $0.10 per diluted share, is expected to be recorded in 2011 and approximately $15 million, $0.07 per diluted share, is expected to be recorded in 2012. 
We expect cost benefits of about $0.13 to $0.15 per share beginning in 2013. 
I'll now turn to our expectations for the full year 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in the second quarter 2011 will continue throughout the year and we expect significant sales growth in each of our market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 16% in 2011, with about 13% organic growth, which would provide us with sales of approximately $8.1 billion in 2011. Due to our first half growth rate of 14% for commercial aftermarket sales and our expectations that worldwide airline capacity will continue to show good growth, we have increased our full year outlook for growth in this market channel to approximately 13%, compared to our prior outlook of 7% to 9%. We expect growth of about 16% organically in our regional Business and General Aviation OE channel. Including sales from acquisitions made in 2010 and 2011, reported sales growth is expected to be about 40% in this channel. 
Our expectations for growth in the defense and space market channel increased to 15%, including about 10% organic growth, at the top end of our prior outlook. This includes organic growth greater than 15% for our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance business. This strong sales growth should result in even better growth in our net income per diluted share. We now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6, including costs of $0.16 per diluted share associated with the plant closure and the Microtecnica acquisition. The prior outlook was for net income per diluted share of $5.40 to $5.55, which did not include the costs noted above. Excluding these costs, earnings guidance for 2011 is increased by more than 10%. Compared to the full year 2010, we are expecting earnings per share to grow by more than 30%. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of over 17%, including the plant closure and Microtecnica acquisition-related cost of $23 million pretax. This reflects growth in the aftermarket, the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs and lower pension expense than 2010. Lower worldwide pretax pension expense is expected to provide a benefit of approximately $78 million or $0.39 per diluted share, which is slightly better than our prior outlook. Excluding the plant closure and acquisition-related cost, 2011 segment margins are expected to be about 17.5% and EBITDA margins are expected to be about 19.5%. We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2010. This is unchanged from our prior outlook. We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
Overall, our excellent performance during the second quarter further strengthened our view that 2011 will be a very good year for Goodrich. We continue to expect excellent growth in sales and earnings over the next 5 years, fueled by strong market conditions in commercial, original equipment and aftermarket. Our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development and our position in the growth areas of the military budgets, helicopters, precision-guided munitions, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and fixed-wing aircraft electric retrofit programs. 
Our financial position remains excellent, with more than $500 million of cash in our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value. I'm looking forward to talking to each of you during the second half of 2011. We've got a great team and we're all very excited about continuing to grow our company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. Now, let's open it up for questions."

And as we look at businesses like wheels and brakes, they have done extremely well, with much improved sales in the second quarter over the last year and they've seen a continuing trend over the last 6 months of increases in that business. Landings are up about 10% in June -- over June last year, which is a very good indicator. But if you look at our Interiors business, which had well over a 20% increase in aftermarket, that reflected A380 initial provisioning but also a fairly widespread number of discretionary products that airlines are buying. And that is a bullish sign because they don't have to refurbish some of the flight attendant seats or evacuation slides but that is happening. And so that's a very good sign. All in all, as we look at ASM capacity, it looks like it's going to be up in the 6% to 8% range for the full year, which is good. We generally grow faster than that ASM capacity increase. So all of those indicators have caused us to reassess our aftermarket growth rate up to 13% for 2011."

So it's unwinding the way we would've expected given that the activity base businesses, particularly wheel and brake have come on very strong this year. And that's a reflection of the overall size of the fleet, the positions that we have and the earlier turn on of aftermarket there for newer aircraft, the newer in production aircraft. That will roll out to the other aircraft and the other businesses beyond 2011. So our view is we kind of stay at these levels as the growth in aftermarket shifts from wheel and brake on an activity basis into the rest of our businesses. So we think we'll sustain at a very high level for several years. Maybe not at 13%, 14% going into next year. But it's a start of a very good upmarket."

So back half of the year, we would expect to be over 17%, with a slight decline coming on an adjusted basis just because we're going to see more OE growth in the second half of the year than what we saw in the first half. With that comes higher load charge, hardware shipments coming in our wheel and brake business as an example. Our Microtecnica acquisition in the first couple of quarters after you complete an acquisition, those sales come at basically no or very low margins. So we don't get the accretion from that acquisition until 2012. So that's the reason we'll see a little bit lower margin in the second half of the year than what we ran on an adjusted basis in Q2.

You do some writeup of the intangible assets and then you amortize those over multiple years. So that reduces some of that EBITDA in terms of how much carries through into booked earnings. That's over a longer period of time. But then the other thing you have to do is write up the current level of inventory to full fair value. So you get zero margin as you turn that inventory the first time. And that happens during the course of 2011. So essentially, the first couple of quarters after an acquisition, you don't make any book profit on those sales. And then of course, you absorb some of the transaction cost as well in the current year. So that's why there's really no creation in the current year on a book basis. There clearly would be good accretion on an EBITDA basis this year and then also into next year. And just to touch on the closing costs that we highlighted there, $6 million of that just related to foreign exchange. So in other words, we bought this business, it's a European-based business. We bought it in euros. So we bought the euros a couple of days ahead of the closing of the acquisition and during that time period, the dollar strengthened and we got hit with about a $6 million charge through the P&L purely related to FX prepositioning of cash. So it's not a classic transactional type cost in terms of fees and expenses. We can absorb those. We could have absorbed those and still maintained about a break even for this year for Microtecnica and then get good contribution next year."

The acquisition sales that we get in the first 3 to 6 months don't come with margins. And then the HUM, correct, we would expect those to be lower in the second half of the year than what we ran in the first half and the second quarter. Then again, as we increase the preproduction rates in the second half of the year, the wheel and brake business sources into that uptick with load charge hardware. So it's hardware that goes in at a price that's lower than our cost, so by a significant margin. So that's negative in terms of operating income as those rates go up within that particular business.

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our second quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. 
Today, we reported excellent second quarter 2011 results for sales and earnings and announced a very significant increase to our sales and earnings expectations for 2011. 
During the second quarter, our sales grew 17%, including organic growth of 12%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported strong year-over-year and sequential sales growth. On a year-over-year basis, sales in our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 17%. Our regional business and general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 58%, with organic growth of 23%. 
Our commercial aftermarket sales growth of 16% was significantly greater than the growth in airline capacity. This growth rate, which showed significant acceleration from our first quarter growth, was one of the primary reasons we raised our full year's expectations for this market channel to growth of about 13%. The second quarter 2011 sales were 6% higher than first quarter 2011. 
Our defense and space sales grew at a rate of 10%, with 6% organic growth. We continue to believe that our presence in attractive high-growth markets, such as ISR, helicopters and precision munitions will enable us to grow our defense and space sales at a mid-single-digit growth rate for the next several years despite the difficult global defense budget environment. 
In the second quarter 2011, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.2% compared to 17.9% in the second quarter 2010. Our second quarter results included $23 million of cost related to a plant closure decision and the acquisition of Microtecnica. Excluding these costs, segment operating income margins would have been 18.4%. 
Our net income per diluted share increased to $1.38 in the second quarter 2011 and included cost of $0.14 per diluted share for plant closure and Microtecnica acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, EPS was up 23% from the second quarter 2010. 
Our strong earnings growth was primarily due to excellent growth in all of our market channels, particularly the commercial aftermarket, our relentless pursuit of Continuous Improvement and lower pension expense. 
Some of the specific items that affected earnings during the second quarter 2011 were as follows. We announced in June -- as we announced in June, we recorded pre-tax cost related to a plant closure of $16 million or $0.08 per diluted share during the second quarter 2011. Our second quarter 2011 results also included pre-tax and after-tax cost of $7 million or $0.06 per diluted share associated with the Microtecnica acquisition. The plant closure and acquisition-related costs are reflected in the segment operating income for Actuation and Landing Systems. 
Total changes in estimates for the second quarter of 2011 were a favorable $21 million pre-tax, somewhat lower than the favorable $33 million we reported in the second quarter 2010. Compared to last year, we had lower pre-tax pension expense of about $19 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter 2011. 
The effective tax rate in the second quarter 2011 was 32.6%, in line with our expectations as compared to 32.1% in the second quarter 2010. Our second quarter 2011 results included higher pre-tax expenses of $14 million or $0.07 per diluted share related to share-based compensation compared to the second quarter of 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures or free cash flow for the second quarter 2011 was $179 million, a little over 100% of reported net income. 
Since April, we have announced several significant events. Our ORS-1 satellite was successfully launched. ORS-1 is the first satellite in the Operational Responsive Space program designed to support combatant command operations and will provide a battle space awareness capability supporting the U.S. Central Command's mission needs. Goodrich is the prime contractor on this program. 
We completed the acquisition of Microtecnica, a leading provider of flight control actuation systems for helicopter, regional and business aircraft, missile actuation and aircraft thermal and environmental control systems. The integration is going very well and results are in line with our expectations. 
We announced the closure of the Marble Avenue landing gear facility in Cleveland, Ohio by the end of 2012. We expect to record pre-tax charges totaling $37 million of which 40% are non-cash. Approximately $20 million, $0.10 per diluted share, is expected to be recorded in 2011. And approximately $15 million, $0.07 per diluted share, is expected to be recorded in 2012. We expect cost benefits of about $0.13 to $0.15 per share beginning in 2013. 
I'll now turn to our expectations for the full year 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in the second quarter 2011 will continue throughout the year, and we expect significant sales growth in each of our market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 16% in 2011 with about 13% organic growth, which would provide us with sales of approximately $8.1 billion in 2011. 
Due to our first half growth rate of 14% for commercial aftermarket sales and our expectation that worldwide airline capacity will continue to show good growth, we have increased our full year outlook for growth in this market channel to approximately 13% compared to our prior outlook of 7% to 9%. We expect growth of about 16% organically in our regional business and general aviation OE channel. Including sales from acquisitions made in 2010 and 2011, reported sales growth is expected to be about 40% in this channel. 
Our expectations for growth in the defense and space market channel increased to 15%, including about 10% organic growth at the top end of our prior outlook. This includes organic growth greater than 15% for our Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance business. This strong sales growth should result in an even better growth in our net income per diluted share. 
We now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6, including costs of $0.16 per diluted share associated with the plant closure and the Microtecnica acquisition. The prior outlook was for net income per diluted share of $5.40 to $5.55, which did not include the costs noted above. Excluding these costs, earnings guidance for 2011 has increased by more than 10%. Compared to the full year 2010, we are expecting earnings per share to grow by more than 30%. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of over 17%, including the plant closure and Microtecnica acquisition-related cost of $23 million pre-tax. This reflects growth in the aftermarket, the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs and lower pension expense than 2010. Lower worldwide pre-tax pension expense is expected to provide a benefit of approximately $78 million or $0.39 per diluted share, which is slightly better than our prior outlook. 
Excluding the plant closure and acquisition-related cost, 2011 segment margins are expected to be about 17.5%, and EBITDA margins are expected to be about 19.5%. We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2010. This is unchanged from our prior outlook. 
We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and pre-tax worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
Overall, our excellent performance during the second quarter further strengthened our view that 2011 will be a very good year for Goodrich. We continue to expect excellent growth in sales and earnings over the next 5 years, fueled by strong market conditions in commercial, original equipment and aftermarket. Our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development and our position in the growth areas of the military budgets, helicopters, precision-guided munitions, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and fixed-wing aircraft retrofit programs. 
Our financial position remains excellent with more than $500 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value. 
I'm looking forward to talking to each of you during the second half of 2011. We've got a great team, and we're all very excited about continuing to grow our company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

And as we looked at businesses like wheels and brakes, they have done extremely well, with much improved sales in the second quarter over the last year, and they've seen a continuing trend about the last 6 months of increases in that business. Landings are up about 10% in June -- over June last year, which is a very good indicator. But if you look at our interiors business, which had well over a 20% increase in aftermarket, that reflected A380 initial provisioning but also a fairly widespread number of discretionary products that airlines are buying. And that is a bullish sign, because they don't have to refurbish some of the flight attendant seats or evacuation slides, but that is happening. And so that is a very good sign. All in all, as we look at ASM capacity, it looks like it's going to be up in the 6% to 8% range for the full year, which is good. We generally grow faster than that ASM capacity increase. So all of those indicators have caused us to reassess our aftermarket growth rate up to 13% for 2011."

And we think this is a multiyear catch-up from the dip that we saw in '09 and '10. So it's unwinding the way we would have expected given that the activity base businesses, particularly wheel and brake, have come on very strong this year. And that's a reflection of the overall size of the fleet, the positions that we have in the earlier turn-on of aftermarket there for newer aircraft -- the newer in-production aircraft. That will roll out to the other aircraft in the other businesses beyond 2011. So our view is we kind of stay at these levels as the growth in aftermarket shifts from wheel and brake on an activity basis into the rest of our businesses.

I'll take you through a few those, and you can see if there's anything that I missed, glad to try to comment on them. In terms of foreign exchange, in 2012, we would expect that to be about plus $25 million versus this year. So we're expecting about $14 million pre-tax year-over-year in '11 versus '10. That's actually down slightly from where we had guided last. And 2012 will be an additional $25 million favorable. Pension expense, I would expect to be fairly flat in 2012 versus 2011 and very much in line with our total level of contribution. Tax rate's probably similar in 2012 to what we're seeing in 2011, so I wouldn't expect any major changes there. Some of the nonoperating items that we're seeing in 2011, we've got the landing gear plant closure cost this year. Those are going to be about -- and with Microtecnica as well, it's about $0.16 negative in the quarter, $0.20 for the year. We'll see another $0.07 continue into 2012 as we complete that -- the closure activities there and then we'll get the benefit in 2013 after we complete that closure.

We did -- as Marshall said, we've got a significant focus on driving Lean/CI into our businesses. We did a major event with -- in one of the plants in that particular segment. We call it -- they're called kaikaku events, where essentially, you shut the plant down for a week, reorganize the flow and linkage in the plant, start back up. So there's some significant incremental cost associated with that as you do that, and we'll get the benefits of that in future quarters. So Q2 was around 15.6%. Year-to-date, we're at 16%.

On -- if you're looking at EBITDA, it clearly provides some good benefit to us, but as you know, you do 2 things when you make an acquisition. You do some writeup of the intangible assets and then you amortize those over multiple years. So that's a -- that reduces some of that EBITDA in terms of how much carries through into booked earnings, and that's over a longer period of time. But then the other thing you have to do is write up the current level of inventory to full fair value. So you get 0 margin as you turn that inventory the first time, and that happens during the course of 2011. So essentially, the first couple of quarters after an acquisition, you don't make any book profit on those sales, and then of course, you absorb some of the transaction cost as well in the current year. So that's why there's really no accretion in the current year on a book basis. There clearly would be good accretion on an EBITDA basis this year and then also into next year. And just to touch on the closing cost that we highlighted there, $6 million of that just related to foreign exchange. So in other words, we bought this business. It's a European-based business. We bought it in euros. So we bought the euros a couple of days ahead of the closing of the acquisition. And during that time period, the dollar strengthened, and we got hit with a -- about a $6 million charge through the P&L purely related to FX prepositioning of cash. So it's not a classic transactional type cost in terms of fees and expenses. We can absorb those. We could have absorbed those and still maintained about breakeven for this year for Microtecnica and then get good contribution next year."

That's the whole premise on American. But what that says is if you have A320s and 737MGs in your fleet, you're going to be utilizing those to a greater extent because of that fuel efficiency. And that's why, as I've said earlier, we're seeing probably ASM growth on A320s almost 10% for 2011 and mid-teens change for 737MGs. So there's -- it's still -- the aftermarket is still growing nicely with those aircraft in particular but also A330s and 777s.

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. Today, I'll begin with our second quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. 
Today, we reported excellent second quarter 2011 results for sales and earnings and announced a very significant increase to our sales and earnings expectations for 2011. 
During the second quarter, our sales grew 17%, including organic growth of 12%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket, reported strong year-over-year and sequential sales growth. On a year-over-year basis, sales in our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 17%. Our regional business and general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 58%, with organic growth of 23%. 
Our commercial aftermarket sales growth of 16% was significantly greater than the growth in airline capacity. This growth rate, which showed significant acceleration from our first quarter growth, was one of the primary reasons we raised our full year's expectations for this market channel to growth of about 13%. The second quarter 2011 sales were 6% higher than first quarter 2011. 
Our defense and space sales grew at a rate of 10%, with 6% organic growth. We continue to believe that our presence in attractive high-growth markets, such as ISR, helicopters and precision munitions will enable us to grow our defense and space sales at a mid-single-digit growth rate for the next several years despite the difficult global defense budget environment. 
In the second quarter 2011, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.2% compared to 17.9% in the second quarter 2010. Our second quarter results included $23 million of cost related to a plant closure decision and the acquisition of Microtecnica. Excluding these costs, segment operating income margins would have been 18.4%. 
Our net income per diluted share increased to $1.38 in the second quarter 2011 and included cost of $0.14 per diluted share for plant closure and Microtecnica acquisition-related costs. Excluding these costs, EPS was up 23% from the second quarter 2010. 
Our strong earnings growth was primarily due to excellent growth in all of our market channels, particularly the commercial aftermarket, our relentless pursuit of Continuous Improvement and lower pension expense. 
Some of the specific items that affected earnings during the second quarter 2011 were as follows. We announced in June -- as we announced in June, we recorded pre-tax costs related to a plant closure of $16 million or $0.08 per diluted share during the second quarter 2011. Our second quarter 2011 results also included pre-tax and after-tax costs of $7 million or $0.06 per diluted share associated with the Microtecnica acquisition. The plant closure and acquisition-related costs are reflected in the segment operating income for Actuation and Landing Systems. 
Total changes in estimates for the second quarter of 2011 were a favorable $21 million pre-tax, somewhat lower than the favorable $33 million we reported in the second quarter 2010. Compared to last year, we had lower pre-tax pension expense of about $19 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the second quarter 2011. 
The effective tax rate in the second quarter 2011 was 32.6%, in line with our expectations as compared to 32.1% in the second quarter 2010. Our second quarter 2011 results included higher pre-tax expenses of $14 million or $0.07 per diluted share related to share-based compensation compared to the second quarter of 2010. Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures or free cash flow for the second quarter 2011 was $179 million, a little over 100% of reported net income. 
Since April, we have announced several significant events. Our ORS-1 satellite was successfully launched. ORS-1 is the first satellite in the Operational Responsive Space program designed to support combatant command operations and will provide a battle space awareness capability supporting the U.S. Central Command's mission needs. Goodrich is the prime contractor on this program. 
We completed the acquisition of Microtecnica, a leading provider of flight control actuation systems for helicopter, regional and business aircraft, missile actuation and aircraft thermal and environmental control systems. The integration is going very well and results are in line with our expectations. 
We announced the closure of the Marble Avenue landing gear facility in Cleveland, Ohio by the end of 2012. We expect to record pre-tax charges totaling $37 million of which 40% are non-cash. Approximately $20 million, $0.10 per diluted share, is expected to be recorded in 2011. And approximately $15 million, $0.07 per diluted share, is expected to be recorded in 2012. We expect cost benefits of about $0.13 to $0.15 per share beginning in 2013. 
I'll now turn to our expectations for the full year 2011. We believe the strong growth trends we experienced in the second quarter 2011 will continue throughout the year, and we expect significant sales growth in each of our market channels. Overall, we expect sales to grow about 16% in 2011 with about 13% organic growth, which would provide us with sales of approximately $8.1 billion in 2011. 
Due to our first half growth rate of 14% for commercial aftermarket sales and our expectation that worldwide airline capacity will continue to show good growth, we have increased our full year outlook for growth in this market channel to approximately 13% compared to our prior outlook of 7% to 9%. We expect growth of about 16% organically in our regional business and general aviation OE channel. Including sales from acquisitions made in 2010 and 2011, reported sales growth is expected to be about 40% in this channel. 
Our expectations for growth in the defense and space market channel increased to 15%, including about 10% organic growth at the top end of our prior outlook. This includes organic growth greater than 15% for our Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance business. This strong sales growth should result in an even better growth in our net income per diluted share. 
We now expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5.85 to $6, including costs of $0.16 per diluted share associated with the plant closure and the Microtecnica acquisition. The prior outlook was for net income per diluted share of $5.40 to $5.55, which did not include the costs noted above. Excluding these costs, earnings guidance for 2011 has increased by more than 10%. Compared to the full year 2010, we are expecting earnings per share to grow by more than 30%. 
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of over 17%, including the plant closure and Microtecnica acquisition-related cost of $23 million pre-tax. This reflects growth in the aftermarket, the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs and lower pension expense than 2010. Lower worldwide pre-tax pension expense is expected to provide a benefit of approximately $78 million or $0.39 per diluted share, which is slightly better than our prior outlook. 
Excluding the plant closure and acquisition-related costs, 2011 segment margins are expected to be about 17.5%, and EBITDA margins are expected to be about 19.5%. We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate for approximately 30%, somewhat higher than the rate we experienced in 2010. This is unchanged from our prior outlook. 
We continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and pre-tax worldwide pension plan contributions of about $100 million. 
Overall, our excellent performance during the second quarter further strengthened our view that 2011 will be a very good year for Goodrich. We continue to expect excellent growth in sales and earnings over the next 5 years, fueled by strong market conditions in commercial, original equipment and aftermarket. Our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development and our position in the growth areas of the military budgets, helicopters, precision-guided munitions, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and fixed-wing aircraft retrofit programs. 
Our financial position remains excellent with more than $500 million of cash on our balance sheet, significant cash flow expectations for 2011 and no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value. 
I'm looking forward to talking to each of you during the second half of 2011. We've got a great team, and we're all very excited about continuing to grow our company and our profits as we enter a period of strong commercial aerospace growth. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

And as we looked at businesses like wheels and brakes, they have done extremely well, with much improved sales in the second quarter over the last year, and they've seen a continuing trend about the last 6 months of increases in that business. Landings are up about 10% in June -- over June last year, which is a very good indicator. But if you look at our interiors business, which had well over a 20% increase in aftermarket, that reflected A380 initial provisioning but also a fairly widespread number of discretionary products that airlines are buying. And that is a bullish sign, because they don't have to refurbish some of the flight attendant seats or evacuation slides, but that is happening. And so that is a very good sign. All in all, as we look at ASM capacity, it looks like it's going to be up in the 6% to 8% range for the full year, which is good. We generally grow faster than that ASM capacity increase. So all of those indicators have caused us to reassess our aftermarket growth rate up to 13% for 2011."

And we think this is a multiyear catch-up from the dip that we saw in '09 and '10. So it's unwinding the way we would have expected given that the activity-based businesses, particularly wheel and brake, have come on very strong this year. And that's a reflection of the overall size of the fleet, the positions that we have in the earlier turn-on of aftermarket there for newer aircraft -- the newer in-production aircraft. That will roll out to the other aircraft in the other businesses beyond 2011. So our view is we kind of stay at these levels as the growth in aftermarket shifts from wheel and brake on an activity basis into the rest of our businesses. So we think we sustain at a very high level for several years. Maybe not at 13%, 14% going into next year, but it's the start of a very good upmarket."

So back half of the year, we would expect to be over 17% with a slight decline coming on an adjusted basis, just because we're going to see more OE growth in the second half of the year than what we saw in the first half. With that comes higher load charge, hardware shipments coming in our wheel and brake business as an example. Our Microtecnica acquisition -- in the first couple of quarters after you complete an acquisition, those sales come at basically no or very low margins. So we don't get the accretion from that acquisition until 2012. So that's the reason we'll see a little bit lower margin in the second half of the year than what we ran on an adjusted basis in Q2.

On -- if you're looking at EBITDA, it clearly provides some good benefit to us, but as you know, you do 2 things when you make an acquisition. You do some write-up of the intangible assets and then you amortize those over multiple years. So that's a -- that reduces some of that EBITDA in terms of how much carries through into booked earnings, and that's over a longer period of time. But then the other thing you have to do is write up the current level of inventory to full fair value. So you get 0 margin as you turn that inventory the first time, and that happens during the course of 2011. So essentially, the first couple of quarters after an acquisition, you don't make any book profit on those sales, and then of course, you absorb some of the transaction costs as well in the current year. So that's why there's really no accretion in the current year on a book basis. There clearly would be good accretion on an EBITDA basis this year and then also into next year. And just to touch on the closing costs that we highlighted there, $6 million of that just related to foreign exchange. So in other words, we bought this business. It's a European-based business. We bought it in Euros. So we bought the Euros a couple of days ahead of the closing of the acquisition. And during that time period, the dollar strengthened, and we got hit with a -- about a $6 million charge through the P&L purely related to FX prepositioning of cash. So it's not a classic transactional type cost in terms of fees and expenses. We can absorb those. We could have absorbed those and still maintained about breakeven for this year for Microtecnica and then get good contribution next year."

Regional business, military are good margins, accretive margins for us as we get new business there. But the things that don't give us margin are brand new airplanes entering into service, so 787s, as we start to deliver more on that. That's coming with sales but not much margin. The acquisition sales that we get in the first 3 to 6 months don't come with margins. And then the cum corrects, we would expect those to be lower in the second half of the year than what we ran in the first quarter and in the second quarter. And then again, as you increase a lead production rate in the second half of the year, the wheel and brake business sources into that uptick with low-charge hardware. So it's hardware that goes in at a price that's lower than our cost so by a significant margin. So that's negative in terms of operating income as those rates go up within that particular business. So those are the 3 things that would push the margin, the incremental the other way. So you have to look at where those sales growth is coming from by market channel and then make those other adjustments to get to the incremental that's based on the actual sales mix that we'll have."
