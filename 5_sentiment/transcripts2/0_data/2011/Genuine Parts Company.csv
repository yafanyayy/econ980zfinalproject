As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I will split the duties on this call, and once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year-end 2010 results, and hopefully, you've had enough opportunity to review than. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $2.808 billion, which was up 14%. Net income was $118.7 million, which was up 20%, and earnings per share was $0.75 this year compared to $0.62 in the fourth quarter of 2010, and EPS increase was 21%.
For the full year, sales were $11.208 billion, which was up 11%. Net income was $475.5 million, which was up 19%, and earnings per share were $3 per share compared to $2.50 last year, and that's an EPS increase of 20%. So we feel that 2010 turned out to be a good year for us, and we were pleased with the way that the year developed sequentially. On the revenue side, we were up 6% in the first quarter, followed by a 12% increase in the second quarter, 13% in Q3 and 14% in Q4. On the EPS side, we're up 13% in the first quarter, 20% in the second, 24% in the third, and 21% in the fourth. So fairly steady and consistent picture all year long. And looking at the revenue results by business segment, as has been the case all year, our two industrial-related businesses, Motion Industries and EIS, generated the strongest increases for us. Motion was up 24% in the quarter, and EIS was up 40%. Acquisitions completed during 2010 helped augment the numbers in each case, but the underlying business remains strong. Motion was plus 18% without acquisition impact, and EIS was plus 17%, and both of these show the good progress being made in growing the core business. For the full year, Motion was up 22%, and EIS was up 30%, and organic growth or growth without acquisitions for both motion and EIS was plus 16%. And looking a bit deeper into the motion results for the full year, it's interesting to note that we had double-digit increases in every one of our top 12 product categories. Additionally, our top 10 industry groups were up 20% in total with automotive, equipment and machinery and iron and steel having the biggest increases, and then a construction-related industries having the smallest increases. And then our top 25 customers were up 25% as a group. So the good results were broad-based from a product, customer and geographic perspective as well, and we were pleased with the overall sales strength and the balance in our industrial business. And the comments on the electrical business are very much the same. Our top 25 customers were up 20% in total for the year, and this drove a similar increase for us with our top 20 suppliers. Additionally, we saw a consistent results across our product categories and geographically as well. So both Motion and EIS turned in strong and well-balanced performances for us. And based upon the encouraging external indices, like industrial production, manufacturing capacity utilization and the ISM Purchasing Managers Index combined with the solid internal growth initiative, we look for continued good results from each of these businesses in the quarters ahead.
Now before leaving the industrial-related businesses, we do want to mention that Motion did complete two smaller complementary type acquisitions as of January 31 of this year. Eight in supply and two a company as a distributor of industrial supplies with three locations in Ohio and DB Brown is a bearing, and power transmission distributor with three locations in Michigan and one in Ohio. Both of these companies fit nicely in the Motion's existing business platform, and combined revenues are just over $60 million per year.
Turning to automotive. The end of the year up 7%. And it's interesting to look at the Automotive results for the course of the year. Revenues in the first quarter were up 6%, followed by 7% increases in the second and third quarters, and then a 9% increase in the fourth quarter. So the results continue to strengthen as the year progressed, and the 9% increase in the fourth quarter was our best quarterly performance in quite some time. Additionally, the 9% increase as a comp store number, which shows good progress in sales productivity from our ongoing store base.
Company owned and independently owned stores grew at comparable rates for the year, indicating a good balance in the results. And within the company owned store group, our cash in retail business was up 8% for the quarter and 5% for the year. The commercial business was up 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. And both of which we feel indicate a solid performance for the full year. Within the commercial segment, our fleet business continued to make a very gradual recovery. You'll recall that in this category, we have the multi-vehicle landscape and contractual business owned up to the class six, seven and eight over the road trucking operations. This business was up 2% in the first half of year followed by 5% increases in each of the third and fourth quarters, which is a bit encouraging, and we anticipate continued gradual improvement in the fleet category in 2011.
The remainder of our commercial business, which is basically our sales to installer customers, was up low double-digits for the year with our two major commercial customer categories each showing good growth. Both NAPA AutoCare and major accounts posted double-digit increases for the year, and we continue to be pleased with the progress that is being made in these two important parts of our commercial business. So when we put it all together, we feel that our automotive team did a good job for us this past year. And based upon the sequential improvement that we saw in our results as the year progressed, we feel that we've glinted 2011 well-positioned to turn in another solid performance. And finally, a few comments about Office Products. As you know, this is one segment of our business that has been the most challenged. After a number of quarters of being down slightly to even at any given quarter, we are pleased to report that Office Products was up 3% in the final quarter, and this enabled them to end the year even with 2009. A look at the Office Products detail shows that our business with the independent dealer community was up 5% in the fourth quarter and it was up 3% for the year. And encouragingly, this business actually improved a bit over the course of year. After being basically flat in the first quarter, we're up 2% in Q2, 3% in Q3, and then 5% in Q4. This is a nice progression, but the growth in the independent channel was offset by continued declines in the mega-channel, which was down high single-digits in the fourth the quarter, and was down low double-digits for the year. On the product side, our furniture, office supplies and technology segments each had single-digit increases in the quarter. The cleaning and break room supplies category was down in the quarter, but after adjusting for the one-time impact of the H1N1-related products that was sold in Q4 2009, the remaining cleaning and break room products were actually up high single-digits. So the underlying cleaning and break room supplies business is healthy. And on a go-forward basis, with the H1N1 distortions now behind us, we expect solid growth in the CBS category in 2011.
Allowing for the adjustment in the cleaning and break room, we are encouraged by the positive growth that was generated in all four of the major product categories in the final quarter. It has been a while since we could say that and it gives us a bit of optimism about our ability to generate positive low single-digit growth in the Office Products segment in 2011 despite the continued headwinds of lower office worker employment. So that's a quick overview of the operating side of the business. And at this point, we'll ask Jerry to cover the financials. Jerry?"

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items.

We'll review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, then we'll open the call up to your questions.
A view the income statement shows the following. Total sales were up 14% to $2.81 billion for the fourth quarter, and this follows increases of 6%, 12%, and 13% in the first, second and third quarter respectively. We're encouraged to show positive sales on them ion all four of our business units this quarter and for the year. For the year, sales finished at $11.2 billion, up 11% from '09. This marks 59 years of sale increases in the last 61 years. We look forward to improving this record in 2011 and beyond.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter 29.1%, which is up sequentially from 28.9% in the third quarter, but down 200 basis points from 31.1% in the fourth quarter last year. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of '09, we said our gross margin included approximately $20 million in life full benefits. This compares to $2 million to $3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2010 and accounts for approximately half of our decrease.
In evaluating the balance of the decline, we found that competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix in our automotive and office businesses contributed to the decrease. And although less material, the escalating comparable pricing in electrical was also a factor. For the year, gross margin 29.0 compared to 29.9 in 2009, and that's down 90 basis points. Improving our gross margin is a high priority for us in 2011, and our management team is well aware of the focused on this goal. We absolutely remain confident that there's opportunity for gross margin expansion. Our strategy includes an emphasis both buy and sell side initiatives, such as efforts to reduce supply chain costs and increase distribution efficiencies and maximizing pricing potential.
For the year, our price and which represents supply increases does were the positive 16% in automotive, 2.5% in industrial, positive for 4.10% in Office products and 3.6% in electrical.
Turning to SG&A, Expenses of $631 million were up 4.3% from $605 million for the same period in 2009 and at percent of sales, this mark a 200 basis points improvement to 22.5% versus 24.5% last year. For the full year, SG&A of $2.5 billion is up 5.3% from '09 and is 22.2% of sales compared to 23.5% in the prior year, reflecting a 130 basis point improvement. Decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter and for the year is largely due to the benefit of greater leverage associated with our of 14% and 11% sales growth for the quarter of the years respectively. In addition, we benefited from our cost reduction efforts in the last few years. As you may recall, in the recessionary period of 2009, we eliminated approximately $75 million in operating expenses and we feel that through that 2010, we did a pretty good job preventing these costs back into our businesses, even with our strong sales growth.
We are really said that around $55 million of these savings should be permanent and is proved to be a reasonable estimate. A big part of our cost savings came from our 12% employee headcount reduction in '08 and '09. This was significant for us as payroll and related benefits run at about 60% of our total SG&A line. We consolidated some facilities and eliminated some freight routes, thus, in 2010, we are only added back about 1% of that headcount including acquisitions. So we're pleased with our discipline and control in this expense. It certainly been meaningful to our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. We'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. Tightly manage our expenses continues to be a top priority for us.
Now let's discuss the results by segment. We'll cover the fourth quarter first, and then we'll review the full year results. Automotive had revenue in the quarter $1,376.700,000. That was up 9%, and they had operating profit of $82.1 million, up 9.5%, so that margin expanded slightly from 5.9% to 6.0%. Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter of $915.2 million. That was up 24%. It had operating profit of $73.8 million, up 23%. So their margin slipped just slightly from 8.2% to 8.1% for the quarter.
Office Products had revenue in the quarter, $395.0 million. That was up 3%. They had operating profit of $38.1 million, that was up 41%. So excellent margin expansion there from 7.0% to 9.6% in the quarter.
And Electrical Group had revenue for the fourth quarter of $125.6 million, up 40%, and operating profit of $8.8 million, up 14%. So their margin slipped to 7.0% for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now looking at the full year. Automotives had revenue for the year in $608.1 million. That was up 7%, and it represents 50% of the total. They had operating profit of $421.1 million, up 9%. So their margins expanded for the year, 7.4% in '09 to 7.5% in 2010. The Industrial Group had revenue for the year up $3,521,900,000, 22% increase representing 31% of the total. They had operating profit, $255.6 million, and that was up 57%. So strong margin expansion from the Industrial Group from 5.6% in 2009 to 7.3% in 2010.
Office Products had revenue for the full year, $1.642.0 billion. That's up 0.2% and it represents 15% of the total. It had operating profit of $131.7 million, up 4%, so their margins ended the 2010 at 8.0%, up from 7.7% in '09. The Electrical Group had revenue for the year of $449.8 million. That was up 30%. It represents 4% of the total. And they had operating profit of $30.9 million that was up 22% and their operating margin was 6.9% for the year, down from 7.3% in 2009.
Total operating profit margin for the fourth quarter improved 30 basis points to 7.2% from 6.9% in the fourth quarter of '09. For the year, operating margins of 50 basis points to 7.5% from 7.0% in 2009. Improved expense leverage associated with our sales increased, as well as our cost reduction efforts have driven the increase in operating margin for both the quarter and the year. We encouraged by about this progress was optimistic for further improvement in 2011.
We had net interest expense of $6.6 million in the quarter and $26.6 million for the year, which is down slightly from 2009. We expect our net interest to be approximately $26 million to $27 million for 2011.
The other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interest, was $9.8 million expense in the fourth quarter and 51.0% for the year. Increase on this line from the prior year, primarily due to higher expenses for incentive based compensation such as bonuses and stock options recorded in association with our improved earnings results for the year. As we look ahead to 2011, we currently project the total other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range. Now this assumes consistent levels of incentive-based compensation, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth.
For the quarter, the tax rate was approximately 36.3% compared to 39.1% for the fourth quarter in 2009. Decrease in the tax rate from last year is due to favorable foreign income taxes and a larger time client valuation adjustment relative to the same period the prior year. For the year, the tax rate 37.6% compared to 38.0% with a decrease related for favorable foreign income taxes that we just mentioned. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be within the range of 37.0% to 37.5%.
Net income for the quarter, $118.7 million, up 20%. EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.62 last year, up 21%. For the year, net income, $476 million, up 19%. EPS of $3 compared to $2.50 in '09, which is up 20%. We're very proud of all of our associates at Genuine Parts Company for helping us achieve record our EPS numbers in 2010.
Let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at December 31 $530 million is up $191 million from $337 million at December 31, '09. We continue to be our cash position from increased earnings and an improved working capital position. and we use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail later. We also funded our pension plan as required from time to time with contributions of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter and a total of $91 million for the year. Accounts receivable is $1.4 billion increased 15% from 2009, only 14% sales increase in the fourth quarter, which is not up to our standards. We do have or remain satisfied with the bulk of our receivables and we remain diligent monitoring our exposure to writeoffs and ensuring the adequacy of our reserve from bad debt. At December 31, 2010. we're confident that the company's properly reserved. Our goal at BBC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, which we felt achieved in the fourth quarter. Our January compassion for trade receivables have already shown some improvement. However, we would expect to achieve this goal each quarter in 2011.
Inventory at year-end was $2.2 billion, up less than 1% or approximately $11 million from December 31, 2009. Considering our sales growth for the year as well as inventory from acquisitions, we believe our management team managed this key investment very well in 2010, and we'll remain focused on further improving our inventory levels in 2011. Our accounts payable balance at December 31, $1.4 billion, is up 26% from December 31 in the prior year. Primarily, our privacy trade payables reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume this year, as well as extended payment terms and other payable and initiatives with our vendors.
With the improvement in our cash payable position, our DPO continued to improve and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital category. With our progress in the key areas of kowtows receivable, inventory and payables, working capital of $2.7 billion at December 31 after adding back to $250 million current portion of debt is up approximately 3% from 2009. We're encouraged with our profit as we managed working capital 2010 and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition as we move forward into 2010. After a record year for cash flow's in 2009, we had another strong year in 2010 cash with cash from operations totaling approximately $679 million and free cash flow after deducting CapEx and dividends of approximately $335 million. We're encouraged by the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for use of our cash. These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we pay every year since going public in 1948, and we've raised it now for 55 consecutive years effective with yesterday's Board approval of a 10% increase in the company's annual dividend for 2001 to $1.80 per share to $1.64 in 2010. The new dividend represents approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share and currently yields about 3% to 3.5%. Our other priorities for cash included the ongoing reinvestment in each of the four businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases
Capital expenditure of $26 million for the fourth quarter, up from $20 million invested in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, CapEx at $85 million compared to $69 million in '09. We had planned for an increased level of CapEx spending in 2010 relative to '09. And turning to 2011, we expect our CapEx spending to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year. Vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity enhancing projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization $22 million i the quarter and $89 million for the year in line with the same periods in '09. We expect DNA to be approximately $90 million again in 2011.
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the community. After closing on six acquisitions in 2009, we completed another three in 2010, and we continue to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities as they present themselves. Thus far, in 2011, we've made two additional acquisitions, which Tom mentioned earlier, and we anticipate additional opportunities to fire through the balance of year. We remain disciplined in our approach of this element of our growth strategy and generally target those both on tax acquisitions with annual revenues in at $25 million to $125 million range, although there are certain exceptions to this rule.
Fourth quarter of 2010, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 120,000 shares of our stock on a company share repurchase program. For the year, we've purchased approximately 1.85 million of shares and to date, we have approximately 16 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. With no set pattern for these repurchases, we expect to remain active in the program and we continue to believe that our stocks and attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.
Total debt at December 31, 2010, remains unchanged at $500 million, although the $250 million credit facility maturing in November 2011 reclassified from long-term debt to current liabilities. The second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. At the point, we made no final decision regarding our plans for the debt as it comes due. Total capitalization at December 31, 15.1%, and we are comfortable with our capital structure at the current time. Due to the hard work of our DTC team members, we make great strides in 2010 and we're optimistic that we can build on this ship performance and show more progress in 2011 and beyond. Steady and consistent growth as defined Genuine Parts Company for much of our rich history and we remain committed to these fine qualities. We'll continue to support this growth with a strong and healthy balance sheet and sound cash flows, further maximizing our return to shareholders. And that concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our appreciation to all of our dedicated DPC associates. We are truly proud of this group, and their efforts to achieve a strong year in 2010 were tremendous. We also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support. We look forward to building on these results in 2011. And Tom, I will turn it back to you."

From our perspective, we came through the year in good shape and we're proud of the job that was done by the entire DPC team. Thanks to their efforts, we were able to report record sales and earnings per share in 2010, and we entered 2011 with a bit of momentum and a sense that it should be another good year for our company. As we look toward 2011, the primary emphasis across each of our businesses fall in the four main categories. The first is generating an acceptable level of revenue growth and our estimate at this time for 2011 are automotive to be up 6% to 8%, Industrial and Electrical to each be up 8% to 10%, and Office Products to be up 2% to 4%. That would give us a combined 6% to 8% increase for GPC. Now with that said, our expectation is that the first quarter revenue results will probably be at the high end to perhaps just a bit above this range based upon what we have seen through the first six weeks of quarter. Also keeping in mind that the first quarter 2010 gives us our easiest comparison. We were up 6% in Q1 last year, but then quarters two through four get a bit more challenging with 2010 increases of 12%, 13% and 14%, respectively. So the comps get a bit more difficult as the year progresses, but full year revenue growth of 6% to 8% will enable us to second objective, which is to show continued operating margin improvement. And our full year guidance currently would be for an earnings per share range of $3.22 to $3.33, which would be up 7% to 11%. The third corporate-wide focus is in the areas of asset management and Working Capital efficiency. We feel that our team has been done a good job in these two areas over the past few years and building on that in 2011 will enable us to continue to generate solid cash flow.
And the final area of focus for each of our businesses is to maintain and enhance our strong balance sheet. Doing so enables us to continue to invest for the future and to further increase shareholder value.
So that completes our comments this morning. And at this point, we'd like to take questions. So we'll turn the call over to Christa. Christa?"

As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I, will split the duties on this call. And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year end 2010 results and hopefully, you've had an enough opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $2,808,000,000, which was up 14%. Net income was $118.7 million, which was up 20%, and earnings per share was $0.75 this year compared to $0.62 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and EPS increase was 21%.
For the full year, sales were $11,208,000,000, which was up 11%. Net income was $475.5 million, which was up 19%, and earnings per share were $3 per share compared to $2.50 last year, and that's an EPS increase of 20%. So we feel that 2010 turned out to be a good year for us, and we were pleased with the way that the year developed sequentially. On the revenue side, we were up 6% in the first quarter, followed by a 12% increase in the second quarter, 13% in Q3 and 14% in Q4. On the EPS side, we're up 13% in the first quarter, 20% in the second, 24% in the third, and 21% in the fourth. So a fairly steady and consistent picture all year long. And looking at the revenue results by business segment, as has been the case all year, our two industrial-related businesses, Motion Industries and EIS, generated the strongest increases for us. Motion was up 24% in the quarter and EIS was up 40%. Acquisitions completed during 2010 helped augment the numbers in each case, but the underlying business remains strong. Motion was plus 18% without acquisition impact and EIS was plus 17%, and both of these show the good progress being made in growing the core business. For the full year, Motion was up 22% and EIS was up 30%, and organic growth or growth without acquisitions for both motion and EIS, was plus 16%. And looking a bit deeper into the Motion results for the full year, it's interesting to note that we had double-digit increases in every one of our top 12 product categories. Additionally, our top 10 industry groups were up 20% in total with automotive, equipment and machinery and iron and steel having the biggest increases, and then the construction-related industries having the smallest increases. And then our top 25 customers were up 25% as a group. So the good results were broad-based from a product, customer and geographic perspective as well, and we were pleased with the overall sales strength and the balance in our industrial business. 
And the comments on the Electrical business are very much the same. Our top 25 customers were up 20% in total for the year, and this drove a similar increase for us with our top 20 suppliers. Additionally, we saw a consistent results across our product categories and geographically as well. So both Motion and EIS turned in strong and well-balanced performances for us, and based upon the encouraging external indices like industrial production, manufacture capacity utilization and the ISM Purchasing Managers Index combined with the solid internal growth initiatives, we look for continued good results from each of these businesses in the quarters ahead.
Now before leaving the industrial-related businesses, we do want to mention that Motion did complete two smaller complementary type acquisitions as of January 31 of this year: Dayton Supply & Tool Company as a distributor of industrial supplies with three locations in Ohio, and D.P. Brown as a bearing, belting, and power transmission distributor with three locations in Michigan and one in Ohio. Both of these companies fit nicely into Motion's existing business platform and combined revenues are just over $60 million per year.
Turning to Automotive. They ended the year up 7%. And it's interesting to look at the Automotive results over the course of the year. Revenues in the first quarter were up 6%, followed by 7% increases in the second and third quarters, and then a 9% increase in the fourth quarter. So the results continue to strengthen as the year progressed, and the 9% increase in the fourth quarter was our best quarterly performance in quite some time. Additionally, the 9% increase as a comp store number, which shows good progress and sales productivity from our ongoing store base.
Company-owned and independently-owned stores grew at comparable rates for the year, indicating a good balance in the results. And within the company-owned store group, our cash for Retail business was up 8% in the quarter and 5% for the year. The Commercial business was up 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. And both of which we feel indicate a solid performance for the full year. Within the Commercial segment, our Fleet business continued to make a very gradual recovery. You will recall that in this category, we have the Multi-Vehicle Landscape and Contractor business on up to the class six, seven and eight over the road trucking operations. This business was up 2% in the first half of the year followed by 5% increases in each of the third and fourth quarters, which is a bit encouraging, and we anticipate continual gradual improvement in the Fleet category in 2011.
The remainder of our Commercial business, which is basically our sales to installer customers, was up low double-digits for the year, with our two major commercial customer categories each showing good growth. Both NAPA AutoCare and major accounts posted double-digit increases for the year, and we continue to be pleased with the progress that is being made in these two important parts of our Commercial business. 
So when we put it all together, we feel that our automotive team did a good job for us this past year. And based upon the sequential improvement that we saw in our results as the year progressed, we feel that we'll go into 2011 well positioned to turn in another solid performance. 
And finally, a few comments about Office Products. As you know, this is one segment of our business that has been the most challenged. After a number of quarters of being down slightly to even in any given quarter, we are pleased to report that Office Products was up 3% in the final quarter, and this enabled them to end the year even with 2009. A look at the Office Products detail shows that our business with the independent dealer community was up 5% in the fourth quarter, and it was up 3% for the year. And encouragingly, this business actually improved a bit over the course of the year. After being basically flat in the first quarter, we're up 2% in Q2, 3% in Q3, and then 5% in Q4. This is a nice progression, but the growth in the independent channel was offset by continued declines in the mega channel, which was down high single-digits in the fourth quarter, and was down low double-digits for the year. On the product side, our Furniture, Office Supplies and Technology segments, each had single-digit increases in the quarter. The cleaning and break room supplies category was down in the quarter, but after adjusting for the one-time impact of the H1N1-related products that were sold in Q4 2009, the remaining cleaning and break room products were actually up high single-digits. So the underlying cleaning and break room supply business is healthy. And on a go-forward basis, with the H1N1 distortions now behind us, we expect solid growth in the CBS category in 2011.
Allowing for the adjustment in the cleaning and break room, we are encouraged by the positive growth that was generated in all four of the major product categories in the final quarter. It has been a while since we could say that, and it gives us a bit of optimism about our ability to generate positive low single-digit growth in the Office Products segment in 2011 despite the continued headwinds of lower office worker employment. So that's a quick overview of the operating side of the business. And at this point, we'll ask Jerry to cover the financials. Jerry?"

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items.

We'll first review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, then we'll open the call up to your questions.
A view of the income statement shows the following: Total sales are up 14% to $2.81 billion for the fourth quarter, and this follows increases of 6%, 12%, and 13% in the first, second and third quarter, respectively. We were encouraged to show positive sales on them in all four of our business units this quarter and for the year. For the year, sales finished at $11.2 billion, up 11% from '09. This marks 59 years of sales increases in the last 61 years. We look forward to improving this record in 2011 and beyond.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter, 29.1%, which is up sequentially from 28.9% in the third quarter, but down 200 basis points from 31.1% in the fourth quarter last year. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of '09, we said our gross margin included approximately $20 million in LIFO benefits. This compares to $2 million to $3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2010 and accounts for approximately half of our decrease.
In evaluating the balance of the decline, we found that competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix in our Automotive and Office businesses contributed to the decrease. And although less material, the escalating copper pricing in electrical was also a factor. For the year, gross margin, 29.0% compared to 29.9% in 2009, and that's down 90 basis points. Improving our gross margin is a high priority for us in 2011, and our management teams are well aware of the focus on this goal. We absolutely remain confident there's opportunity for gross margin expansion. Our strategy includes an emphasis in both buy and sell side initiatives, such as efforts to reduce supply chain costs and increase distribution efficiencies and maximizing pricing potential.
For the year, our cumulative price, in which represents supply increases to us, were the positive 16% in Automotive, 2.5% in Industrial, positive 4.10% in Office Products and 3.6% in Electrical.
Turning to SG&A. Expenses of $631 million were up 4.3% from $605 million for the same period in 2009, and at percent-to-sales, this marks a 200 basis points improvement to 22.5% versus 24.5% last year. For the full year, SG&A of $2.5 billion is up 5.3% from '09, and is 22.2% of sales compared to 23.5% in the prior year, reflecting 130 basis point improvement. Decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter and for the year is largely due to the benefit of greater leverage associated with our 14% and 11% sales growth for the quarter and the year, respectively. In addition, we benefited from our cost reduction efforts in the last few years. As you may recall, in the recessionary period of 2009, we eliminated approximately $75 million in operating expenses, and we feel that throughout 2010, we did a pretty good job preventing these costs from creeping back into our businesses, even with our strong sales growth.
We already said that around $55 million of these savings should be permanent and that's proved to be a reasonable estimate. A big part of our cost savings came from our 12% employee headcount reduction in '08 and '09. This was significant for us as payroll and related benefits run at about 60% of our total SG&A line. We consolidated some facilities and eliminated some freight routes, thus, in 2010, we had only added back about 1% of that headcount including acquisitions. So we're pleased with our discipline on control on this expense. It certainly has been meaningful to our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. We'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. Tightly managing our expenses continues to be a top priority for us.
Now let's discuss the results by segment. We'll cover the fourth quarter first and then we'll review the full year results. Automotive had revenue in the quarter $1,376,700,000. That was up 9%. And they had operating profit, $82.1 million, up 9.5%, so their margin expanded slightly from 5.9% to 6.0%. Industrial group had revenue in the quarter of $915.2 million. That was up 24%. It had operating profit of $73.8 million, up 23%. So their margin slipped just slightly from 8.2% to 8.1% for the quarter.
Office Products had revenue in the quarter, $395.0 million. That was up 3%. They had operating profit of $38.1 million, that was up 41%. So excellent margin expansion there from 7.0% to 9.6% in the quarter.
Electrical Group had revenue for the fourth quarter of $125.6 million, up 40%, and operating profit of $8.8 million, up 14%. So their margin slipped to 7.0% for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now looking at the full year. Automotive had revenue for the year of $5,608,100,000. That was up 7%, and it represents 50% of the total. They had operating profit of $421.1 million, up 9%. So their margins expanded for the year 7.4% in '09 to 7.5% in 2010. The Industrial Group had revenue for the year of $3,521,900,000, 22% increase representing 31% of the total. They had operating profit, $255.6 million, and that was up 57%. So strong margin expansion from the Industrial Group from 5.6% in 2009 to 7.3% in 2010.
Office Products had revenue for the full year, $1.642 billion. That's up 0.02% and it represents 15% of the total. It had operating profit of $131.7 million, up 4%, so their margins ended the 2010 at 8.0%, up from 7.7% in '09. The Electrical Group had revenue for the year, $449.8 million. That was up 30%. It represents 4% of the total. And they had operating profit of $30.9 million that was up 22%, and their operating margin was 6.9% for the year, down from 7.3% in 2009.
Total operating profit margin for the fourth quarter improved 30 basis points to 7.2% from 6.9% in the fourth quarter of '09. For the year, operating margins of 50 basis points to 7.5% from 7.0% in 2009. Improved expense leverage associated with our sales increased, as well as our cost reduction efforts have driven the increase in operating margin for both the quarter and the year. We're encouraged about this progress and we're optimistic for further improvement in 2011.
We had net interest expense of $6.6 million in the quarter and $26.6 million for the year, which is down slightly from 2009. We expect our net interest to be approximately $26 million to $27 million for 2011.
The other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interest, was $9.8 million expense in the fourth quarter and $51.0 million for the year. Increase on this line from the prior year is primarily due to higher expenses for incentive-based compensation such as bonuses and stock options recorded in association with our improved earning results for the year. As we look ahead to 2011, we currently project the total other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range. Now this assumes consistent levels of incentive-based compensation, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth.
For the quarter, the tax rate was approximately 36.3% compared to 39.1% for the fourth quarter in 2009. Decrease in the tax rate from last year is due to favorable foreign income taxes and a larger time of client valuation adjustment relative to the same period the prior year. For the year, the tax rate, 37.6% compared to 38.0%, with a decrease related to favorable foreign income taxes that we just mentioned. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be within the range of 37.0% to 37.5%.
Net income for the quarter, $118.7 million, up 20%. EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.62 last year, up 21%. For the year, net income, $476 million, that was up 19%. EPS of $3 compared to $2.50 in '09, which is up 20%. We're very proud of all of our associates at Genuine Parts Company for helping us achieve record our EPS numbers in 2010.
Let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at December 31 of $530 million is up $191 million from $337 million at December 31, '09. We continue to be at our cash position from increased earnings and an improved working capital position. And we use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail later. We also funded our pension plan as required from time to time with contributions of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter and a total of $91 million for the year. Accounts receivable of $1.4 billion increased 15% from 2009, only 14% sales increase in the fourth quarter, which is not up to our standards. We do have or remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables, and we remain diligent monitoring our exposure to writeoffs and ensuring the adequacy of our reserve for bad debt. At December 31, 2010, we're confident that the company's properly reserved. Our goal at GPC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, which we felt achieved in the fourth quarter. Our January compression for trade receivables have already shown some improvement, however, and we would expect to achieve this goal each quarter in 2011.
Inventory at year end was $2.2 billion, up less than 1% or approximately $11 million from December 31, 2009. Considering our sales growth for the year as well as inventory from acquisitions, we believe our management team managed this key investment very well in 2010, and we'll remain focused on further improving our inventory levels in 2011. Our accounts payable balance at December 31, $1.4 billion, is up 26% from December 31 in the prior year. Primarily, our privacy and trade payables reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume this year, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors.
With the improvement in our cash payable position, our DPO continue to improve and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital category. With our progress in the key areas of cash receivable, inventory and payables, working capital of $2.7 billion at December 31 after adding back the $250 million current portion of debt, is up approximately 3% from 2009. We're encouraged with our progress in managing working capital in 2010, and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition as we move forward into 2011. After a record year for cash flows in 2009, we had another strong year in 2010 with cash from operations totaling approximately $679 million and free cash flow after deducting CapEx and dividends of approximately $335 million. We're encouraged by the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for use of our cash. These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we pay every year since going public in 1948, and we've raised it now for 55 consecutive years, effective with yesterday's board approval of a 10% increase in the company's annual dividend for 2011 to $1.80 per share from $1.64 per share in 2010. The new dividend represents approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share and currently yields about 3% to 3.5%. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the four businesses, strategic acquisitions, where appropriate, and share repurchases.
Capital expenditures were $26 million for the fourth quarter, up from $20 million invested in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, CapEx at $85 million compared to $69 million in '09. We had planned for an increased level of CapEx spending in 2010 relative to '09 and turning to 2011, we expect our CapEx spending to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year. Vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization, $22 million, in the quarter and $89 million for the year, in line with the same periods in '09. We expect D&A to be approximately $90 million again in 2011.
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. After closing on six acquisitions in 2009, we've completed another three in 2010, and we continue to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities as they present themselves. Thus far, in 2011, we've made two additional acquisitions, which Tom mentioned earlier, and we anticipate additional opportunities to find acquisitions over the balance of the year. We remain disciplined in our approach of this element of our growth strategy, and generally target those both on tax and acquisitions with annual revenues in at $25 million to $125 million range, although there are certain exceptions to this rule.
Fourth quarter of 2010, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 120,000 shares of our stock on a company share repurchase program. For the year, we purchased approximately 1.85 million shares and today, we have approximately 16 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases but we expect to remain active in the program, and we continue to believe that our stocks and attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.
Total debt at December 31, 2010, remains unchanged at $500 million, although the $250 million credit facility maturing in November 2011 reclassified from long-term debt to current liabilities. The second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. At this point, we made no final decision regarding our plans for the debt as it comes due. Total capitalization at December 31, 15.1%, and we are comfortable with our capital structure at the current time. 
Due to the hard work of our GPC team members, we made great strides in 2010, and we are optimistic that we can build on this shared performance and show more progress in 2011 and beyond. Steady and consistent growth has defined Genuine Parts Company for much of our rich history, and we remain committed to these fine qualities. We'll continue to support this growth with a strong and healthy balance sheet and sound cash flows, further maximizing our return to shareholders. And that concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our appreciation to all of our dedicated GPC associates. We are truly proud of this group, and their efforts to achieve a strong year in 2010 were tremendous. We also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support. We look forward to building on these results in 2011. And Tom, I will turn it back to you."

Well, that's a recap of the fourth quarter and full year of our 2010 results. From our perspective, we came through the year in good shape and we're proud of the job that was done by the entire GPC team. Thanks to their efforts, we were able to report record sales and earnings per share in 2010, and we entered 2011 with a bit of momentum and a sense that it should be another good year for our company. As we look toward 2011, the prime areas of emphasis across each of our businesses fall into four main categories: The first is generating an acceptable level of revenue growth, and our estimates at this time for 2011 are Automotive to be up 6% to 8%, Industrial and Electrical to each be up 8% to 10%, and Office Products to be up 2% to 4%. That would give us a combined 6% to 8% increase for GPC. Now with that said, our expectation is that the first quarter revenue results will probably be at the high end to perhaps just a bit above this range based upon what we have seen through the first six weeks of the quarter. Also keeping in mind that the first quarter 2010 gives us our easiest comparison. We were up 6% in Q1 last year, but then quarters two through four get a bit more challenging with 2010 increases of 12%, 13% and 14%, respectively. So the comps get a bit more difficult as the year progresses, but full year revenue growth of 6% to 8% will enable us to meet our second objective, which is to show continued operating margin improvement. And our full year guidance currently would be for an earnings per share range of $3.22 to $3.32, which would be up 7% to 11%. The third corporate-wide focus is in the areas of asset management and working capital efficiency. We feel that our team has done a good job in these two areas over the past few years, and building on that in 2011 will enable us to continue to generate solid cash flow.
And the final area of focus for each of our businesses is to maintain and enhance our strong balance sheet. Doing so enables us to continue to invest for the future and to further increase shareholder value.
So that completes our comments this morning. And at this point, we'd like to take your questions. So we'll turn the call back over to Christa. Christa?"

And I would like to add my welcome to each of you on the call today and to say that we appreciate you taking the time to be with us this morning. As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I, will split the duties on this call. And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and year end 2010 results and hopefully, you've had an enough opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $2,808,000,000, which was up 14%. Net income was $118.7 million, which was up 20%, and earnings per share was $0.75 this year compared to $0.62 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and EPS (earnings per share) increase was 21%.
For the full year, sales were $11,208,000,000, which was up 11%. Net income was $475.5 million, which was up 19%, and earnings per share were $3 per share compared to $2.50 last year, and that's an EPS increase of 20%. So we feel that 2010 turned out to be a good year for us, and we were pleased with the way that the year developed sequentially. On the revenue side, we were up 6% in the first quarter, followed by a 12% increase in the second quarter, 13% in Q3 and 14% in Q4. On the EPS side, we're up 13% in the first quarter, 20% in the second, 24% in the third, and 21% in the fourth. So a fairly steady and consistent picture all year long. And looking at the revenue results by business segment, as has been the case all year, our two industrial-related businesses, Motion Industries and EIS, generated the strongest increases for us. Motion was up 24% in the quarter and EIS was up 40%. Acquisitions completed during 2010 helped augment the numbers in each case, but the underlying business remains strong. Motion was plus 18% without acquisition impact and EIS was plus 17%, and both of these show the good progress being made in growing the core business. For the full year, Motion was up 22% and EIS was up 30%, and organic growth or growth without acquisitions for both motion and EIS, was plus 16%. And looking a bit deeper into the Motion results for the full year, it's interesting to note that we had double-digit increases in every one of our top 12 product categories. Additionally, our top 10 industry groups were up 20% in total with automotive, equipment and machinery and iron and steel having the biggest increases, and then the construction-related industries having the smallest increases. And then our top 25 customers were up 25% as a group. So the good results were broad-based from a product, customer and geographic perspective as well, and we were pleased with the overall sales strength and the balance in our industrial business. 
And the comments on the Electrical business are very much the same. Our top 25 customers were up 20% in total for the year, and this drove a similar increase for us with our top 20 suppliers. Additionally, we saw a consistent results across our product categories and geographically as well. So both Motion and EIS turned in strong and well-balanced performances for us, and based upon the encouraging external indices like industrial production, manufacture capacity utilization and the ISM Purchasing Managers Index combined with the solid internal growth initiatives, we look for continued good results from each of these businesses in the quarters ahead.
Now before leaving the industrial-related businesses, we do want to mention that Motion did complete two smaller complementary type acquisitions as of January 31 of this year: Dayton Supply & Tool Company as a distributor of industrial supplies with three locations in Ohio, and D.P. Brown as a bearing, belting, and power transmission distributor with three locations in Michigan and one in Ohio. Both of these companies fit nicely into Motion's existing business platform and combined revenues are just over $60 million per year.
Turning to Automotive. They ended the year up 7%. And it's interesting to look at the Automotive results over the course of the year. Revenues in the first quarter were up 6%, followed by 7% increases in the second and third quarters, and then a 9% increase in the fourth quarter. So the results continued to strengthen as the year progressed, and the 9% increase in the fourth quarter was our best quarterly performance in quite some time. Additionally, the 9% increase as a comp store number, which shows good progress and sales productivity from our ongoing store base.
Company-owned and independently-owned stores grew at comparable rates for the year, indicating a good balance in the results. And within the company-owned store group, our cash or retail business was up 8% in the quarter and 5% for the year. The commercial business was up 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. And both of which we feel indicate a solid performance for the full year. Within the Commercial segment, our fleet business continued to make a very gradual recovery. You will recall that in this category, we have the multi-vehicle, landscape and contractor business on up to the class six, seven and eight over the road trucking operations. This business was up 2% in the first half of the year followed by 5% increases in each of the third and fourth quarters, which is a bit encouraging, and we anticipate continual gradual improvement in the fleet category in 2011.
The remainder of our commercial business, which is basically our sales to installer customers, was up low double-digits for the year, with our two major commercial customer categories each showing good growth. Both NAPA AutoCare and major accounts posted double-digit increases for the year, and we continue to be pleased with the progress that is being made in these two important parts of our commercial business. 
So when we put it all together, we feel that our automotive team did a good job for us this past year. And based upon the sequential improvement that we saw in our results as the year progressed, we feel that we go into 2011 well positioned to turn in another solid performance. 
And finally, a few comments about Office Products. As you know, this is one segment of our business that has been the most challenged. After a number of quarters of being down slightly to even in any given quarter, we are pleased to report that Office Products was up 3% in the final quarter, and this enabled them to end the year even with 2009. A look at the Office Products detail shows that our business with the independent dealer community was up 5% in the fourth quarter, and it was up 3% for the year. And encouragingly, this business actually improved a bit over the course of the year. After being basically flat in the first quarter, we're up 2% in Q2, 3% in Q3, and then 5% in Q4. This is a nice progression, but the growth in the independent channel was offset by continued declines in the Mega Channel, which was down high single-digits in the fourth quarter, and was down low double-digits for the year. On the product side, our furniture, office supplies and technology segments, each had single-digit increases in the quarter. The cleaning and break room supplies category was down in the quarter, but after adjusting for the one-time impact of the H1N1-related products that were sold in Q4 2009, the remaining cleaning and break room products were actually up high single-digits. So the underlying cleaning and break room supply business is healthy. And on a go-forward basis, with the H1N1 distortions now behind us, we expect solid growth in the CBS category in 2011.
Allowing for the adjustment in the cleaning and break room, we are encouraged by the positive growth that was generated in all four of the major product categories in the final quarter. It has been a while since we could say that, and it gives us a bit of optimism about our ability to generate positive low single-digit growth in the Office Products segment in 2011 despite the continued headwinds of lower office worker employment. So that's a quick overview of the operating side of the business. And at this point, we'll ask Jerry to cover the financials. Jerry?"

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items.

We'll first review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, then we'll open the call up to your questions.
A view of the income statement shows the following: total sales were up 14% to $2.81 billion for the fourth quarter, and this follows increases of 6%, 12%, and 13% in the first, second and third quarter, respectively. We were encouraged to show positive sales momentum in all four of our business units this quarter and for the year. For the year, sales finished at $11.2 billion, up 11% from '09. This marks 59 years of sales increases in the last 61 years. We look forward to improving this record in 2011 and beyond.
Gross profit in the fourth quarter, 29.1%, which is up sequentially from 28.9% in the third quarter, but down 200 basis points from 31.1% in the fourth quarter last year. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of '09, we said our gross margin included approximately $20 million in LIFO (last in, first out) benefits. This compares to $2 million to $3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2010 and accounts for approximately half of our decrease.
In evaluating the balance of the decline, we found that competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix in our Automotive and Office businesses contributed to the decrease. And although less material, the escalating copper pricing in electrical was also a factor. For the year, gross margin, 29.0% compared to 29.9% in 2009, and that's down 90 basis points. Improving our gross margin is a high priority for us in 2011, and our management teams are well aware of and focused on this goal. We absolutely remain confident there's opportunity for gross margin expansion. Our strategy includes an emphasis in both buy and sell side initiatives, such as efforts to reduce supply chain costs and increase distribution efficiencies and maximizing pricing potential.
For the year, our cumulative price, in which represents supply increases to us, was a positive 0.6% in Automotive, 2.5% in Industrial, positive 0.4% in Office Products and 3.6% in Electrical.
Turning to SG&A. Expenses of $631 million were up 4.3% from $605 million for the same period in 2009, and at percent-to-sales, this marks a 200 basis points improvement to 22.5% versus 24.5% last year. For the full year, SG&A of $2.5 billion is up 5.3% from '09, and is 22.2% of sales compared to 23.5% in the prior year, reflecting 130 basis point improvement. Decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter and for the year is largely due to the benefit of greater leverage associated with our 14% and 11% sales growth for the quarter and the year, respectively. In addition, we benefited from our cost reduction efforts in the last few years. As you may recall, in the recessionary period of 2009, we eliminated approximately $75 million in operating expenses, and we feel that throughout 2010, we did a pretty good job preventing these costs from creeping back into our businesses, even with our strong sales growth.
We already said that around $55 million of these savings should be permanent and that's proved to be a reasonable estimate. A big part of our cost savings came from our 12% employee headcount reduction in '08 and '09. This was significant for us as payroll and related benefits run at about 60% of our total SG&A line. We consolidated some facilities and eliminated some freight routes, thus, in 2010, we only added back about 1% of that headcount including acquisitions. So we're pleased with our discipline on controlling this expense. It's certainly been meaningful to our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. We'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. Tightly managing our expenses continues to be a top priority for us.
Now let's discuss the results by segment. We'll cover the fourth quarter first and then we'll review the full year results. Automotive had revenue in the quarter $1,376,700,000. That was up 9%. And they had operating profit, $82.1 million, up 9.5%, so their margin expanded slightly from 5.9% to 6.0%. The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter of $915.2 million. That was up 24%. It had operating profit of $73.8 million, up 23%. So their margin slipped just slightly from 8.2% to 8.1% for the quarter.
Office Products had revenue in the quarter, $395.0 million. That was up 3%. They had operating profit of $38.1 million, that was up 41%. So, excellent margin expansion there from 7.0% to 9.6% in the quarter.
The Electrical Group had revenue for the fourth quarter of $125.6 million, up 40%, and operating profit of $8.8 million, up 14%. So their margin slipped to 7.0% for the fourth quarter of 2010.
Now looking at the full year. Automotive had revenue for the year of $5,608,100,000. That was up 7%, and it represents 50% of the total. They had operating profit of $421.1 million, up 9%. So their margins expanded for the year 7.4% in '09 to 7.5% in 2010. The Industrial Group had revenue for the year of $3,521,900,000, 22% increase representing 31% of the total. They had operating profit, $255.6 million, and that was up 57%. So strong margin expansion from the Industrial Group from 5.6% in 2009 to 7.3% in 2010.
Office Products had revenue for the full year, $1.642 billion. That's up 0.02% and it represents 15% of the total. They had operating profit of $131.7 million, up 4%, so their margins ended the 2010 at 8.0%, up from 7.7% in '09. The Electrical Group had revenue for the year, $449.8 million. That was up 30%. It represents 4% of the total. And they had operating profit of $30.9 million that was up 22%, and their operating margin was 6.9% for the year, down from 7.3% in 2009.
Total operating profit margin for the fourth quarter improved 30 basis points to 7.2% from 6.9% in the fourth quarter of '09. For the year, operating margins up 50 basis points to 7.5% from 7.0% in 2009. Improved expense leverage associated with our sales increased, as well as our cost reduction efforts have driven the increase in operating margin for both the quarter and the year. We're encouraged by this progress and we're optimistic for further improvement in 2011.
We had net interest expense of $6.6 million in the quarter and $26.6 million for the year, which is down slightly from 2009. We expect our net interest to be approximately $26 million to $27 million for 2011.
The Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and non-controlling interest, was $9.8 million expense in the fourth quarter and $51.0 million for the year. Increase on this line from the prior year is primarily due to higher expenses for incentive-based compensation such as bonuses and stock options recorded in association with our improved earning results for the year. As we look ahead to 2011, we currently project the total other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range. Now this assumes consistent levels of incentive-based compensation, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth.
For the quarter, the tax rate was approximately 36.3% compared to 39.1% for the fourth quarter in 2009. Decrease in the tax rate from last year is due to favorable foreign income taxes and a larger a time or plan valuation adjustment relative to the same period the prior year. For the year, the tax rate, 37.6% compared to 38.0%, with a decrease related to favorable foreign income taxes that we just mentioned. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be within the range of 37.0% to 37.5%.
Net income for the quarter, $118.7 million, up 20%. EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.62 last year, up 21%. For the year, net income, $476 million, up 19%. EPS of $3 compared to $2.50 in '09, which is up 20%. We're very proud of all of our associates at Genuine Parts Company for helping us achieve record or EPS numbers in 2010.
Let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at December 31 of $530 million is up $191 million from $337 million at December 31, '09. We continue to build our cash position from increased earnings and an improved working capital position. And we use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail later. We also funded our pension plan as required from time to time with contributions of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter and a total of $91 million for the year. Accounts receivable of $1.4 billion increased 15% from 2009, only 14% sales increase in the fourth quarter, which is not up to our standards. We do have or remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables, and we remain diligent in monitoring our exposure to write-offs and ensuring the adequacy of our reserve for bad debt. At December 31, 2010, we're confident that the company is properly reserved. Our goal at GPC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, which we failed to achieve in the fourth quarter. Our January comparison for trade receivables have already shown some improvement, however, and we would expect to achieve this goal each quarter in 2011.
Inventory at year end was $2.2 billion, up less than 1% or approximately $11 million from December 31, 2009. Considering our sales growth for the year as well as inventory from acquisitions, we believe our management team managed this key investment very well in 2010, and we'll remain focused on further improving our inventory levels in 2011. Our accounts payable balance at December 31, $1.4 billion, is up 26% from December 31 in the prior year. Primarily, our privacy and trade payables reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume this year, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors.
With improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continued to improve and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital category. With our progress in the key areas of cash receivable, inventory and payables, working capital of $2.7 billion at December 31 after adding back the $250 million current portion of debt, is up approximately 3% from 2009. We're encouraged with our progress in managing working capital in 2010, and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition as we move forward into 2011. After a record year for cash flows in 2009, we had another strong year in 2010 with cash from operations totaling approximately $679 million and free cash flow after deducting CapEx and dividends of approximately $335 million. We're encouraged by the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for use of our cash. These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we pay every year since going public in 1948, and we've raised it now for 55 consecutive years, effective with yesterday's board approval of a 10% increase in the company's annual dividend for 2011 to $1.80 per share from $1.64 per share in 2010. The new dividend represents approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share and currently yields about 3% to 3.5%. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the four businesses, strategic acquisitions, where appropriate, and share repurchases.
Capital expenditures were $26 million for the fourth quarter, up from $20 million invested in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, CapEx at $85 million compared to $69 million in '09. We had planned for an increased level of CapEx spending in 2010 relative to '09 and turning to 2011, we expect our CapEx spending to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year. Vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization, $22 million, in the quarter and $89 million for the year, in line with the same periods in '09. We expect D&A to be approximately $90 million again in 2011.
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. After closing on six acquisitions in 2009, we completed another three in 2010, and we continue to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities as they present themselves. Thus far, in 2011, we've made two additional acquisitions, which Tom mentioned earlier, and we anticipate additional opportunities to buy acquisitions over the balance of the year. We remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy, and generally target those both on tax and acquisitions with annual revenues in at $25 million to $125 million range, although there are certain exceptions to this rule.
Fourth quarter of 2010, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 120,000 shares of our stock on a company share repurchase program. For the year, we purchased approximately 1.85 million shares and today, we have approximately 16 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases but we expect to remain active in the program, and we continue to believe that our stocks and attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.
Total debt at December 31, 2010, remains unchanged at $500 million; although the $250 million credit facility maturing in November 2011 was reclassified from long-term debt to current liabilities. The second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. At this point, we made no final decision regarding our plans for the debt as it comes due. Total capitalization at December 31, 15.1%, and we are comfortable with our capital structure at the current time. 
Due to the hard work of our GPC team members, we made great strides in 2010, and we are optimistic that we can build on this shared performance and show more progress in 2011 and beyond. Steady and consistent growth has defined Genuine Parts Company for much of our rich history, and we remain committed to these fine qualities. We'll continue to support this growth with a strong and healthy balance sheet and sound cash flows, further maximizing our return to shareholders. And that concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our appreciation to all of our dedicated GPC associates. We are truly proud of this group, and their efforts to achieve a strong year in 2010 were tremendous. We also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support. We look forward to building on these results in 2011. And Tom, I will turn it back to you."

Well, that's a recap of the fourth quarter and full year of our 2010 results. From our perspective, we came through the year in good shape and we're proud of the job that was done by the entire GPC team. Thanks to their efforts, we were able to report record sales and earnings per share in 2010, and we entered 2011 with a bit of momentum and a sense that it should be another good year for our company. As we look toward 2011, the prime areas of emphasis across each of our businesses fall into four main categories. The first is generating an acceptable level of revenue growth, and our estimates at this time for 2011 are Automotive to be up 6% to 8%, Industrial and Electrical to each be up 8% to 10%, and Office Products to be up 2% to 4%. That would give us a combined 6% to 8% increase for GPC. Now with that said, our expectation is that the first quarter revenue results will probably be at the high end to perhaps just a bit above this range based upon what we have seen for the first six weeks of the quarter. Also keeping in mind that the first quarter 2010 gives us our easiest comparison. We were up 6% in Q1 last year, but then quarters two through four get a bit more challenging with 2010 increases of 12%, 13% and 14%, respectively. So the comps get a bit more difficult as the year progresses, but full year revenue growth of 6% to 8% will enable us to meet our second objective, which is to show continued operating margin improvement. And our full year guidance currently would be for an earnings per share range of $3.22 to $3.32, which would be up 7% to 11%. The third corporate-wide focus is in the areas of asset management and working capital efficiency. We feel that our team has done a good job in these two areas over the past few years, and building on that in 2011 will enable us to continue to generate solid cash flow.
And the final area of focus for each of our businesses is to maintain and enhance our strong balance sheet. Doing so enables us to continue to invest for the future and to further increase shareholder value.
So that completes our comments this morning. And at this point, we'd like to take your questions. So we'll turn the call back over to Christa. Christa?"

Net income was $118.7 million, which was up 20%, and earnings per share was $0.75 this year compared to $0.62 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and EPS (earnings per share) increase was 21%. 
For the full year, sales were $11,208,000,000, which was up 11%. Net income was $475.5 million, which was up 19%, and earnings per share were $3 per share compared to $2.50 last year, and that's an EPS increase of 20%. So we feel that 2010 turned out to be a good year for us, and we were pleased with the way that the year developed sequentially. On the revenue side, we were up 6% in the first quarter, followed by a 12% increase in the second quarter, 13% in Q3 and 14% in Q4. On the EPS side, we're up 13% in the first quarter, 20% in the second, 24% in the third, and 21% in the fourth. So a fairly steady and consistent picture all year long. 
And looking at the revenue results by business segment, as has been the case all year, our two industrial-related businesses, Motion Industries and EIS, generated the strongest increases for us. Motion was up 24% in the quarter and EIS was up 40%. Acquisitions completed during 2010 helped augment the numbers in each case, but the underlying business remains strong. Motion was plus 18% without acquisition impact and EIS was plus 17%, and both of these show the good progress being made in growing the core business. For the full year, Motion was up 22% and EIS was up 30%, and organic growth or growth without acquisitions for both motion and EIS, was plus 16%. 
And looking a bit deeper into the Motion results for the full year, it's interesting to note that we had double-digit increases in every one of our top 12 product categories. Additionally, our top 10 industry groups were up 20% in total with automotive, equipment and machinery and iron and steel having the biggest increases, and then the construction-related industries having the smallest increases. And then our top 25 customers were up 25% as a group. So the good results were broad-based from a product, customer and geographic perspective as well, and we were pleased with the overall sales strength and the balance in our industrial business. 
And the comments on the Electrical business are very much the same. Our top 25 customers were up 20% in total for the year, and this drove a similar increase for us with our top 20 suppliers. Additionally, we saw consistent results across our product categories and geographically as well. So both Motion and EIS turned in strong and well-balanced performances for us, and based upon the encouraging external indices like industrial production, manufacture capacity utilization and the ISM Purchasing Managers Index combined with the solid internal growth initiatives, we look for continued good results from each of these businesses in the quarters ahead. 
Now before leaving the industrial-related businesses, we do want to mention that Motion did complete two smaller complementary type acquisitions as of January 31 of this year: Dayton Supply & Tool Company is a distributor of industrial supplies with three locations in Ohio, and D.P. Brown is a bearing, belting, and power transmission distributor with three locations in Michigan and one in Ohio. Both of these companies fit nicely into Motion's existing business platform and combined revenues are just over $60 million per year. 
Turning to Automotive. They ended the year up 7%. And it's interesting to look at the Automotive results over the course of the year. Revenues in the first quarter were up 6%, followed by 7% increases in the second and third quarters, and then a 9% increase in the fourth quarter. So the results continued to strengthen as the year progressed, and the 9% increase in the fourth quarter was our best quarterly performance in quite some time. Additionally, the 9% increase is a comp store number, which shows good progress and sales productivity from our ongoing store base. 
Company-owned and independently-owned stores grew at comparable rates for the year, indicating a good balance in the results. And within the company-owned store group, our cash or retail business was up 8% in the quarter and 5% for the year. The commercial business was up 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. And both of which we feel indicate a solid performance for the full year. 
Within the Commercial segment, our fleet business continued to make a very gradual recovery. You will recall that in this category, we have the multi-vehicle, landscape and contractor business on up to the class six, seven and eight over the road trucking operations. This business was up 2% in the first half of the year followed by 5% increases in each of the third and fourth quarters, which is a bit encouraging, and we anticipate continual gradual improvement in the fleet category in 2011. 
The remainder of our commercial business, which is basically our sales to installer customers, was up low double-digits for the year, with our two major commercial customer categories each showing good growth. Both NAPA AutoCare and major accounts posted double-digit increases for the year, and we continue to be pleased with the progress that is being made in these two important parts of our commercial business. 
So when we put it all together, we feel that our automotive team did a good job for us this past year. And based upon the sequential improvement that we saw in our results as the year progressed, we feel that we go into 2011 well positioned to turn in another solid performance. 
And finally, a few comments about Office Products. As you know, this is one segment of our business that has been the most challenged. After a number of quarters of being down slightly to even in any given quarter, we are pleased to report that Office Products was up 3% in the final quarter, and this enabled them to end the year even with 2009. A look at the Office Products detail shows that our business with the independent dealer community was up 5% in the fourth quarter, and it was up 3% for the year. And encouragingly, this business actually improved a bit over the course of the year. After being basically flat in the first quarter, we're up 2% in Q2, 3% in Q3, and then 5% in Q4. This is a nice progression, but the growth in the independent channel was offset by continued declines in the Mega Channel, which was down high single-digits in the fourth quarter, and was down low double-digits for the year. 
On the product side, our furniture, office supplies and technology segments, each had single-digit increases in the quarter. The cleaning and break room supplies category was down in the quarter, but after adjusting for the one-time impact of the H1N1-related products that were sold in Q4 2009, the remaining cleaning and break room products were actually up high single-digits. So the underlying cleaning and break room supply business is healthy. And on a go-forward basis, with the H1N1 distortions now behind us, we expect solid growth in the CBS category in 2011. 
Allowing for the adjustment in the cleaning and break room, we are encouraged by the positive growth that was generated in all four of the major product categories in the final quarter. It has been a while since we could say that, and it gives us a bit of optimism about our ability to generate positive low single-digit growth in the Office Products segment in 2011 despite the continued headwinds of lower office worker employment. So that's a quick overview of the operating side of the business. And at this point, we'll ask Jerry to cover the financials. Jerry?"
275034,119028953,111814,"Genuine Parts Company, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 22, 2011",2011-02-22,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items.

We'll first review the income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, then we'll open the call up to your questions. A view of the income statement shows the following: total sales were up 14% to $2.81 billion for the fourth quarter, and this follows increases of 6%, 12%, and 13% in the first, second and third quarter, respectively. We were encouraged to show positive sales momentum in all four of our business units this quarter and for the year. 
For the year, sales finished at $11.2 billion, up 11% from '09. This marks 59 years of sales increases in the last 61 years. We look forward to improving this record in 2011 and beyond. Gross profit in the fourth quarter, 29.1%, which is up sequentially from 28.9% in the third quarter, but down 200 basis points from 31.1% in the fourth quarter last year. You may recall that in the fourth quarter of '09, we said our gross margin included approximately $20 million in LIFO (last in, first out) benefits. This compares to $2 million to $3 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2010 and accounts for approximately half of our decrease. In evaluating the balance of the decline, we found that competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix in our Automotive and Office businesses contributed to the decrease. And although less material, the escalating copper pricing in electrical was also a factor. 
For the year, gross margin, 29.0% compared to 29.9% in 2009, and that's down 90 basis points. Improving our gross margin is a high priority for us in 2011, and our management teams are well aware of and focused on this goal. We absolutely remain confident there's opportunity for gross margin expansion. Our strategy includes an emphasis in both buy and sell side initiatives, such as efforts to reduce supply chain costs and increase distribution efficiencies and maximizing pricing potential. 
For the year, our cumulative price, in which represents supply increases to us, was a positive 0.6% in Automotive, 2.5% in Industrial, positive 0.4% in Office Products and 3.6% in Electrical. Turning to SG&A. Expenses of $631 million were up 4.3% from $605 million for the same period in 2009, and at percent-to-sales, this marks a 200 basis points improvement to 22.5% versus 24.5% last year. 
For the full year, SG&A of $2.5 billion is up 5.3% from '09, and is 22.2% of sales compared to 23.5% in the prior year, reflecting 130 basis point improvement. Decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales for the quarter and for the year is largely due to the benefit of greater leverage associated with our 14% and 11% sales growth for the quarter and the year, respectively. 
In addition, we benefited from our cost reduction efforts in the last few years. As you may recall, in the recessionary period of 2009, we eliminated approximately $75 million in operating expenses, and we feel that throughout 2010, we did a pretty good job preventing these costs from creeping back into our businesses, even with our strong sales growth. We already said that around $55 million of these savings should be permanent and that's proved to be a reasonable estimate. A big part of our cost savings came from our 12% employee headcount reduction in '08 and '09. This was significant for us as payroll and related benefits run at about 60% of our total SG&A line. We consolidated some facilities and eliminated some freight routes, thus, in 2010, we only added back about 1% of that headcount including acquisitions. 
So we're pleased with our discipline on controlling this expense. It's certainly been meaningful to our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. We'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. Tightly managing our expenses continues to be a top priority for us. Now let's discuss the results by segment. We'll cover the fourth quarter first and then we'll review the full year results. Automotive had revenue in the quarter $1,376,700,000. That was up 9%. And they had operating profit, $82.1 million, up 9.5%, so their margin expanded slightly from 5.9% to 6.0%. 
The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter of $915.2 million. That was up 24%. It had operating profit of $73.8 million, up 23%. So their margin slipped just slightly from 8.2% to 8.1% for the quarter. 
Office Products had revenue in the quarter, $395.0 million. That was up 3%. They had operating profit of $38.1 million, that was up 41%. So excellent margin expansion there from 7.0% to 9.6% in the quarter. 
The Electrical Group had revenue for the fourth quarter of $125.6 million, up 40%, and operating profit of $8.8 million, up 14%. So their margin slipped to 7.0% for the fourth quarter of 2010. 
Now looking at the full year. Automotive had revenue for the year of $5,608,100,000. That was up 7%, and it represents 50% of the total. They had operating profit of $421.1 million, up 9%. So their margins expanded for the year 7.4% in '09 to 7.5% in 2010. 
The Industrial Group had revenue for the year of $3,521,900,000, 22% increase representing 31% of the total. They had operating profit, $255.6 million, and that was up 57%. So strong margin expansion from the Industrial Group from 5.6% in 2009 to 7.3% in 2010. Office Products had revenue for the full year, $1,642,000,000. That's up 0.2% and it represents 15% of the total. They had operating profit of $131.7 million, up 4%, so their margins ended the 2010 at 8.0%, up from 7.7% in '09. 
The Electrical Group had revenue for the year, $449.8 million. That was up 30%. It represents 4% of the total. And they had operating profit of $30.9 million that was up 22%, and their operating margin was 6.9% for the year, down from 7.3% in 2009. 
Total operating profit margin for the fourth quarter improved 30 basis points to 7.2% from 6.9% in the fourth quarter of '09. For the year, operating margin's up 50 basis points to 7 1/2% from 7.0% in 2009. Improved expense leverage associated with our sales increased, as well as our cost reduction efforts have driven the increase in operating margin for both the quarter and the year. We're encouraged by this progress and we're optimistic for further improvement in 2011. 
We had net interest expense of $6.6 million in the quarter and $26.6 million for the year, which is down slightly from 2009. We expect our net interest to be approximately $26 million to $27 million for 2011. The Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and non-controlling interest, was $9.8 million expense in the fourth quarter and $51.0 million for the year. Increase on this line from the prior year is primarily due to higher expenses for incentive-based compensation such as bonuses and stock options recorded in association with our improved earning results for the year. 
As we look ahead to 2011, we currently project the total Other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range. Now this assumes consistent levels of incentive-based compensation, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth. 
For the quarter, the tax rate was approximately 36.3% compared to 39.1% for the fourth quarter in 2009. Decrease in the tax rate from last year is due to favorable foreign income taxes and a larger a time or plan valuation adjustment relative to the same period the prior year. For the year, the tax rate, 37.6% compared to 38.0%, with a decrease related to favorable foreign income taxes that we just mentioned. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be within the range of 37.0% to 37.5%. 
Net income for the quarter, $118.7 million, up 20%. EPS was $0.75 compared to $0.62 last year, up 21%. For the year, net income, $476 million, up 19%. EPS of $3 compared to $2.50 in '09, which is up 20%. We're very proud of all of our associates at Genuine Parts Company for helping us achieve record or EPS numbers in 2010. 
Let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at December 31 of $530 million is up $191 million from $337 million at December 31, '09. We continue to build our cash position from increased earnings and an improved working capital position. And we use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail later. We also funded our pension plan as required from time to time with contributions of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter and a total of $91 million for the year. 
Accounts receivable of $1.4 billion increased 15% from 2009, only 14% sales increase in the fourth quarter, which is not up to our standards. We do have or remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables, and we remain diligent in monitoring our exposure to write-offs and ensuring the adequacy of our reserve for bad debt. At December 31, 2010, we're confident that the company is properly reserved. Our goal at GPC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth, which we failed to achieve in the fourth quarter. Our January comparison for trade receivables have already shown some improvement, however, and we would expect to achieve this goal each quarter in 2011. 
Inventory at year end was $2.2 billion, up less than 1% or approximately $11 million from December 31, 2009. Considering our sales growth for the year as well as inventory from acquisitions, we believe our management team managed this key investment very well in 2010, and we'll remain focused on further improving our inventory levels in 2011. 
Our accounts payable balance at December 31, $1.4 billion, is up 26% from December 31 in the prior year. Primarily, our privacy and trade payables reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume this year, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continued to improve and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital category. 
With our progress in the key areas of cash receivable, inventory and payables, working capital of $2.7 billion at December 31 after adding back the $250 million current portion of debt, is up approximately 3% from 2009. We're encouraged with our progress in managing working capital in 2010, and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition as we move forward into 2011. After a record year for cash flows in 2009, we had another strong year in 2010 with cash from operations totaling approximately $679 million and free cash flow after deducting CapEx and dividends of approximately $335 million. 
We're encouraged by the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for use of our cash. These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we pay every year since going public in 1948, and we've raised it now for 55 consecutive years, effective with yesterday's board approval of a 10% increase in the company's annual dividend for 2011 to $1.80 per share from $1.64 per share in 2010. The new dividend represents approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share and currently yields about 3% to 3.5%. Our other priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the four businesses, strategic acquisitions, where appropriate, and share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures were $26 million for the fourth quarter, up from $20 million invested in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year, CapEx at $85 million compared to $69 million in '09. We had planned for an increased level of CapEx spending in 2010 relative to '09 and turning to 2011, we expect our CapEx spending to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year. Vast majority of these investments will continue to be weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. 
Depreciation and amortization, $22 million, in the quarter and $89 million for the year, in line with the same periods in '09. We expect D&A to be approximately $90 million again in 2011. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. After closing on six acquisitions in 2009, we completed another three in 2010, and we continue to evaluate additional acquisition opportunities as they present themselves. 
Thus far, in 2011, we've made two additional acquisitions, which Tom mentioned earlier, and we anticipate additional opportunities to buy acquisitions over the balance of the year. We remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy, and generally target those both on tax and acquisitions with annual revenues in at $25 million to $125 million range, although there are certain exceptions to this rule. 
Fourth quarter of 2010, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 120,000 shares of our stock on a company share repurchase program. For the year, we purchased approximately 1.85 million shares and today, we have approximately 16 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases but we expect to remain active in the program, and we continue to believe that our stock's an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
Total debt at December 31, 2010, remains unchanged at $500 million, although the $250 million credit facility maturing in November 2011 was reclassified from long-term debt to current liabilities. The second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. At this point, we made no final decision regarding our plans for the debt as it comes due. Total debt to total capitalization at December 31, 15.1%, and we are comfortable with our capital structure at the current time. 
Due to the hard work of our GPC team members, we made great strides in 2010, and we are optimistic that we can build on this year's performance and show more progress in 2011 and beyond. Steady and consistent growth has defined Genuine Parts Company for much of our rich history, and we remain committed to these fine qualities. We'll continue to support this growth with a strong and healthy balance sheet and sound cash flows, further maximizing our return to shareholders.
And that concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our appreciation to all of our dedicated GPC associates. We are truly proud of this group and their efforts to achieve a strong year in 2010 were tremendous. We also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support. We look forward to building on these results in 2011. 
And Tom, I will turn it back to you."

Well, that's a recap of the fourth quarter and full year of our 2010 results. From our perspective, we came through the year in good shape and we're proud of the job that was done by the entire GPC team. Thanks to their efforts, we were able to report record sales and earnings per share in 2010, and we entered 2011 with a bit of momentum and a sense that it should be another good year for our company. 
As we look toward 2011, the prime areas of emphasis across each of our businesses fall into four main categories. The first is generating an acceptable level of revenue growth, and our estimates at this time for 2011 are Automotive to be up 6% to 8%, Industrial and Electrical to each be up 8% to 10%, and Office Products to be up 2% to 4%. That would give us a combined 6% to 8% increase for GPC. 
Now with that said, our expectation is that the first quarter revenue results will probably be at the high end to perhaps just a bit above this range based upon what we have seen for the first six weeks of the quarter. Also keeping in mind that the first quarter 2010 gives us our easiest comparison, we were up 6% in Q1 last year, but then quarters two through four get a bit more challenging with 2010 increases of 12%, 13% and 14%, respectively. So the comps get a bit more difficult as the year progresses, but full year revenue growth of 6% to 8% will enable us to meet our second objective, which is to show continued operating margin improvement. And our full year guidance currently would be for an earnings per share range of $3.22 to $3.32, which would be up 7% to 11%. 
The third corporate-wide focus is in the areas of asset management and working capital efficiency. We feel that our team has done a good job in these two areas over the past few years, and building on that in 2011 will enable us to continue to generate solid cash flow. 
And the final area of focus for each of our businesses is to maintain and enhance our strong balance sheet. Doing so enables us to continue to invest for the future and to further increase shareholder value. 
So that completes our comments this morning. And at this point, we'd like to take your questions. So we'll turn the call back over to Christa. Christa?"

And once we have concluded our remarks, we look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2011 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those that may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $2.974,000,000, which was up 14%. Net income was $126.5 million, which was up 26%, and earnings per share were at $0.80 this year compared to $0.63 in the first quarter of 2010, and the EPS increase was 27%.
So we are pleased that the sales and earnings momentum that we saw throughout 2010 continued on into the first quarter of this year. As a result, we feel that we're off to a good start, and we look forward to another solid performance in 2011.
A review the results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest increases. Motion Industries, our industrial distribution business, was up 24%. This is their fourth consecutive quarter of better than 20% increases, and we are very pleased with the progress that are being made in our industrial segment. As we look at the numbers in a bit more detail, acquisitions added 5% to the increase. But importantly, we continue to see that the good results and the ongoing operations are broad-based across their business as evidenced by the fact that everyone of their top 12 product categories is running double-digit increases year-to-date. And as a group, these 12 categories are up 25%. And the same can be said about their top 10 customers segments. Double-digit increases in each case. And as a group, these top 10 customers segments are up 30% through the first quarter. And the top 20 individual customers have a collective year-to-date increase of 30% as well. And finally, all geographic areas are showing strong double-digit improvement throughout the first quarter.
So from a number of different viewpoints, the industrial business remain strong, and with the industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to remain at healthy levels. And with good execution on the growth initiatives, we're optimistic about our prospects in the Industrial segment over the next several quarters.
Moving onto the Electrical segment, EIS turned in another strong performance as well, with revenues being up 39% in the quarter. This is their fourth consecutive quarter better than 30% increases as with the industrial business, the electrical segment remains quite strong. The Seacoast Wire and Cable acquisition completed in September of last year gave us a nice boost in the quarter, as did the increase in copper pricing, but the ongoing operations still generated a strong 19% increase over the first three months of the year. So the underlying business and the Electrical Electronic segment remains quite healthy. 
And as with the industrial operations, the increases across the customer segments, as well as the product categories, are broad-based and consistent. And we're encouraged by the fact that our primary external leading demand indicator, the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index, remained well above 53 of February, reflective of continued expansion in the industry. And this bodes well for our electrical business in the months ahead.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products company, was up 5%, continuing a pattern of gradual improvement that started in the second half of 2010. You may recall that Office Products was running 1% behind through midyear last year. Then they were even in the third quarter, plus 3% in the fourth quarter, and now up 5% this past quarter, so the trend is a bit encouraging. As has been the case for some time now, our sales for the independent Office Products resellers have outpaced our performance with the Mega Channel. The independent business was up high single-digits in the quarter, and we are pleased that this segment of our business has been on a gradually improving trend for five consecutive quarters now.
But then our mega business continues to run behind prior year. And this segment at a high single-digit decrease in the quarter. On the product side, all four of our major product categories, technology, office supplies, furniture, and cleaning and break room, showed positive growth in the quarter. This follows a similar pattern in the fourth quarter of 2010, and it's another indication to us that our office supply business is on a very gradual improving trend, and we expect this to continue in the quarters ahead.
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. You will recall that this business showed good sequential progress on a quarterly basis during 2010, and we ended the year with a 9% increase in the final quarter. We were pleased to see this carry over to the first quarter of this year, with our automotive operations being up 9% once again. And this is essentially a same store sales increase, which we think shows good progress on the part of our Automotive team.
Both of our independently-owned and company-owned store groups grew at steady rates. And in looking at the detail within companies stores, our retail business was up 4% in the quarter, our fleet business was up 5%, and our installer business was up low double-digits once again. And we're especially pleased with the steady and consistent double-digit growth that we have seen in our installer business for over a year now. And this is largely attributable to the continued progress being made in our two primary installer initiatives, of NAPA AutoCare and Major accounts. You will recall that they both grew a double digit rates in 2010, and this sale through to the first quarter as well. So good progress continues to be made in each of these important areas.
When we put it all together, we feel that our Automotive team came through the first quarter in good shape, and we're optimistic about their prospect over the remainder of the year. So that's a quick overview of our first quarter sales results, and at this point, we'll ask Jerry to take a few minutes to comment on the financial performance. Jerry?"

But first, I'll review the first quarter income statement and that information, and then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, and then we'll open the call up to your questions.
We incurred a total sale to a record have $2.97 billion and are 14% for the second consecutive quarter. We're also encouraged by the positive sales momentum in all four of our business units, which is a testament to the hard work of everyone across our organization. We look forward to reporting continued growth over the balance of the year.
Gross profit for the first quarter, 28.5%, which is down 70 basis points from 29.2% in the first quarter last year. Although we see many good things happening in our businesses, this area remains a challenge for us due to several reasons. For example, competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix across our businesses continues to negatively impact our gross margin. In addition, we are seeing a growing mix of sales or national accounts and most of our businesses was generally, little margin, but higher sales volumes. We're implementing both buy and sell side initiatives to offset these factors, and they should help stabilize gross margins in the coming quarters. We're working to reduce the price chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential.
For the year, our pricing, which represents the prior increases to us, was 5/10 a percent in Automotive, 6/10 a percent in Industrial, 9/10 a percent in Office Products and 1.6% in Electrical. Turning to SG&A, expenses $657 million were up 9.8% from $598 million for the same period in 2010. And as a percent of sales, this marks a 90 basis point improvement to 22.1% versus 23.0% last year.  Decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales is largely due to benefit of greater leverage associated with our 14% sales growth for the quarter, as well as benefit of our ongoing cost control measures.
We entered 2011 with approximately $55 million in permanent cost savings from previous initiatives to significantly reduce employee headcount, consolidate facilities and more effectively manage fleet routes and transportation costs. Of our 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, we only added back 1% in 2010, including acquisitions. And we've added another 7/10 a percent with acquisitions thus far in 2011.
In addition, our ongoing cost initiatives have produced further savings of approximately $7 million to the first quarter this year. These initiatives have addressed cost scenarios such as freight, utility and warehouse management, and we expect to see additional savings coming from these initiatives over the balance of the year. These savings continue to further impact our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. We'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. Tightly managing our expenses remains a top priority.
Now let's look at the business units by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter of $1,449 billion, that represents 47% of the total and is up 9%. They had operating profit, $97.9 million, and that was up 10%. So margin expansion from 6.9% to 7.0%. The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter of $999.8 million, representing 34% of the total, up 24.5% with operating profit, $66.0 million, up 35%. So very nice expansion from 6.1% to 6.6% of sales on operating margin. Office Products ad revenue the quarter of $432.7 million, 14% of the total up 5% with operating profit $37.4 million, up 2%. So they had slight margin integration, 8.9 to 8.6, so that still a strong operating margin. The Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter of $139.8 million. 5% of the total. They were up 39%. Operating profit, $10.7 million, up 48%. So nice expansion there from 6.8% to 7.2% of sales.
Putting it all together, total operating profit margin for the first quarter improved 10 basis points to 7.1% from 7.0% in the first quarter of 2010, as our improved SG&A leverage has partially offset the gross margin compression.
We had net interest expense of $6.5 million in the first quarter, which is down slightly from 2010. And we expect our net interest to be approximately $25 million to $26 million for the full year. In another category, which includes corporate expense, amortization intangible and non-controlling interest was $12.9 million in the quarter, up slightly from $12.3 million in the first quarter last year. The increase on this line is primarily due to higher expenses for incentive-based compensation, such as bonuses and stock options. And we continue to project the total of the category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range for the full year. And this assumes consistent levels of maintaining based compensation over balance of the year, which we would expect to incur normalized levels of growth.
For the quarter, tax rate was approximately 34.1% compared to 37.9% for the first quarter in 2010, a decrease in the rate from last year due to favorable adjustment associated with the expiration of a statute of limitations related to international taxes. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be about 36.5%.
Net income for the quarter, $126.5 million, up 26%. EPS of $0.80 compared to $0.63 last year was up 27%.
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at March 31 at $466 million is up $132 million from $334 million in March 31, 2010.  We continue to build our cash position from increased earnings and improved working capital, and we've used our cash upon several ongoing properties, such as the increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail in a moment. We to expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows and expect our cash position to remain sound.
Cash receivable, $1.5 billion increased 13% for March 31, 2010, on a 14% increase in sales for the first quarter. We're pleased to have shown progress in managing this account and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables. Our goal at GPC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth.
Inventory at 331 2011, was $2.24 billion, up approximately 1% or $25 million for March 31 last year. That is including acquisitions. In consideration of our sales growth, we believe that our management team continues to manage this key investment very well and we'll remain focused on further improving our inventory levels over the balance of 2011.
We improved our cash payable position again this quarter with trade payables increasing to $1.4 billion, which is up 16% from March 31 in the prior year. Primarily, our progress in trade payables impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continues to improve, and we remain pleased with the positive direction this working capital account.
With progress in the key areas of receivable, inventory and payables, working capital is $2.5 million at March 31, is down 5% from last year. But for comparison purposes, if we add back the $250 million current portion of debt at March 31, working capital is up approximately 4% from March 31 last year.  We're encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing working capital, and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition. After several consecutive years of strong cash flows, we expect to generate strong cash flows again in 2011 and currently estimate from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should be approximately $325 million, which is in line with last year.
We're encouraged by the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for use of the cash. These priorities are: First, the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and raised for 55 consecutive years. As you may recall, in our February Board meeting, our directors authorized $1.80 annual dividend for 2011, up 10% from $1.64 in 2010. This new dividend represents a payout of approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share and currently yields about 3% to 3.5%.
Additional priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the four businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. Capital expenditures, $14.5 million for the first quarter, is up from $10 million invested in the first quarter last year. Currently, we expect our CapEx to pick up over the balance of the year and be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year with the vast majority of these investments weighted towards total activity enhancing projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization was $22.5 million in the quarter, in line with 2010. We expect DNA to remained level with last year and be approximately $90 million for the full year. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. As you may recall on January 31 of this year, we completed two acquisitions in our industrial business with combined annual revenues of approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate additional opportunities for the acquisitions over the balance of the year and remain disciplined in our approach of this element of our growth strategy. Generally, we're targeting both on tax acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million, although there's certainly exceptions to this rule.
In the first quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 177,000 shares of our company stock on the company's share repurchase program. This purchase of approximately 1.9 million shares in 2010 and today, we have right at 15.8 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program, as we continue to believe our stock's attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.
Total debt at March 31, 2011, remains unchanged at $500 million, and a $250 million credit facility maturing in November 2011 is accounted for in current liabilities. The second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. And regards to the portion of debt due this November, we can assure you that we're currently well in the process of negotiating a new debt agreement and a private placement with several insurance companies. We expect to have a signed agreement before the end of third quarter, and we'll update you on that when we have more details.
Total debt, total capitalization March 31, 14.8%. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We ended the second quarter of 2011 optimistic that we could show continued progress in growing our sales and earnings over the remainder of the year. Steady and consistent growth had defined General Parts Company for much of our history, and we remain committed to continuing this trend. We'll continue to support this growth with a strong and healthy balance sheet, sound cash flows, further maximizing our return to shareholders. 
That concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our appreciation to all our dedicated GPC associates. We're truly very proud of this group and can't say it enough. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support as well. Tom, back to you."

So that's a recap of our first quarter numbers, and we're proud of the results that were produced by the GPC team. Thanks to their efforts, we feel that we're off to a good start to 2011.
Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects in each of our four businesses. There are a few uncertainties, however, including the increase in the price of gasoline, specifically in the fragility yet in the economic recovery in general, but to this point, we seem to be weathering the situation fairly well. Additionally, we point out that our comps get even more challenging over the remaining three quarters of the year, with revenues being up 13% over the final nine months of 2010 and earnings per share being up 22%. With all of this in mind, our expectations are to grow total revenues by 9% to 11% for the full year, which implies an 8% to 10% increase over the remainder of the year, and this is up from our prior full year guidance of 6% to 8%. And this is based on Automotive being up 6% to 8%, Industrial, 15% to 17%; Office Products, 4% to 6%; and the Electrical Electronic being up 16% to 18%. And by achieving revenue increases in these ranges, we think earnings will be in the range of $3.32 to $3.42, which is up $0.10 from our prior guidance of $3.22 to $3.32, and would represent an EPS increase of 11% to 14% for the full year.

On the Office Products side, we would you say that we have been able to show some sequential improvement since midyear las year, and our expectation is that we'll be able to generate increases at least in line with what we've done over the past quarter or two. On the Automotive side, there's nothing that causes us to have any real concern other than the price of fuel. And we don't know what the impact is going to be on that. We've held up well thus far on the sales side. It has impacted our SG&A across all of the businesses. But what we have seen in terms of outbound sales is we have seen some reduction in the demand for any discretionary type items, and we saw that late February, early March and on through the month of March. But I think maybe we're just reading what the same things you guys are putting out in terms of some concern about fuel pricing and what it might do to demand. But as I said earlier, at least through out latest report in April, things are holding up pretty well for us."

Some of the oil exploration-related businesses could be another. Some of the infrastructure-related businesses that might be positively impacted as we get into the warmer weather, and see more of that work being done. So we continue to remain quite optimistic about the prospects in that business over the remainder this year, honestly."

And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2011 results and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $2,974,000,000, which was up 14%. Net income was $126.5 million, which was up 26%, and earnings per share were $0.80 this year compared to $0.63 in the first quarter of 2010 and the EPS increase was 27%.
So we're pleased that the sales and earnings momentum that we saw throughout 2010 continued on into the first quarter of this year. As a result, we feel that we're off to a good start, and we look forward to another solid performance in 2011.
A review of the results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest increases. Motion Industries, our Industrial Distribution business, was up 24%. This is their fourth consecutive quarter of better than 20% increases, and we are very pleased with the progress that is being made in our Industrial segment. As we look at the numbers in a bit more detail, acquisitions added 5% to the increase. But importantly, we continue to see that the good results and the ongoing operations are broad based across their business as evidenced by the fact that everyone of their top 12 product categories is running double-digit increases year-to-date. And as a group, these 12 categories are up 25%. And the same can be said about their top 10 customer segments. Double-digit increases in each case. And as a group, these top 10 customer segments are up 30% through the first quarter. And the top 20 individual customers have a collective year-to-date increase of 30% as well. And finally, all geographic areas are showing strong double-digit improvement throughout the first quarter.
So from a number of different viewpoints, the Industrial business remain strong and with the industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to remain at healthy levels. And with good execution on the growth initiatives, we're optimistic about our prospects in the Industrial segment over the next several quarters.
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS turned in another strong performance as well, with revenues being up 39% in the quarter. This is their fourth consecutive quarter better than 30% increases, so as with the Industrial business, the Electrical segment remains quite strong. The Seacoast Wire and Cable acquisition completed in September of last year gave us a nice boost in the quarter, as did the increase in copper pricing, but the ongoing operation still generated a strong 19% increase over the first three months of the year. So the underlying business in the Electrical/Electronic segment remains quite healthy. 
And as with the Industrial operations, the increases across the customer segments, as well as the product categories, were broad based and consistent. And we're encouraged by the fact that our primary external leading demand indicator, the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index, remained well above 50 through February, reflective of a continued expansion in the industry. And this bodes well for our Electrical business in the months ahead.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products company, was up 5%, continuing a pattern of gradual improvement that started in the second half of 2010. You may recall that Office Products was running 1% behind through midyear last year. Then they were even in the third quarter, plus 3% in the fourth quarter, and now up 5% this past quarter, so the trend is a bit encouraging. As has been the case for some time now, our sales for the independent Office Products resellers have outpaced our performance with the Mega Channel. The Independent business was up high single digits in the quarter, and we are pleased that this segment of our business has been on a gradually improving trend for five consecutive quarters now. But then our Mega business continues to run behind prior year, and this segment had a high single-digit decrease in the quarter. On the product side, all four of our major product categories, technology, office supplies, furniture, and cleaning and breakroom, showed positive growth in the quarter. This follows a similar pattern in the fourth quarter of 2010, and it's another indication to us that our Office Supply business is on a very gradual improving trend, and we expect this to continue in the quarters ahead.
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. You will recall that this business showed good sequential progress on a quarterly basis during 2010, and we ended the year with a 9% increase in the final quarter. We were pleased to see this carryover to the first quarter of this year, with our Automotive operations being up 9% once again. And this is essentially a same-store sales increase, which we think shows good progress on the part of our Automotive team.
Both our independently-owned and company-owned store groups grew at steady rates. And in looking at the detail within the company stores, our Retail business was up 4% in the quarter, our Fleet business was up 5% and our Installer business was up low double digits once again. And we're especially pleased with the steady and consistent double-digit growth that we have seen in our Installer business for over a year now. And this is largely attributable to the continued progress being made in our two primary installer initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts. You will recall that they both grew at double-digit rates in 2010 and this held through to the first quarter as well. So good progress continues to be made in each of these important areas. When we put it all together, we feel that our Automotive team came through the first quarter in good shape, and we're optimistic about their prospects over the remainder of the year. 
So that's a quick overview of our first quarter sales results. And at this point, we'll ask Jerry to take a few minutes to comment on the financial performance. Jerry?"

We incurred a total sale to a record at $2.97 billion and at 14% for the second consecutive quarter. We're also encouraged by the positive sales momentum in all four of our business units, which is a testament to the hard work by everyone across our organization. We look forward to reporting continued growth over the balance of the year.
Gross profit for the first quarter, 28.5%, which is down 70 basis points from 29.2% in the first quarter last year. Although we see many good things happening in our businesses, this area remains a challenge for us due to several reasons. For example, competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix across our businesses continues to negatively impact our gross margin. In addition, we are seeing a growing mix of sales through our national accounts and most of our businesses, which generally come with lower margins, but higher sales volumes. We're implementing both buy- and sell-side initiatives to offset these factors, and they should help stabilize gross margins in the coming quarters. We're working to reduce the supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential. For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents the prior increases to us, was 0.5% in Automotive, 0.6% in Industrial, 0.9% in Office Products and 1.6% in Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A. Expenses of $657 million were up 9.8% from $598 million for the same period in 2010. And as a percent of sales, this marks a 90 basis point improvement to 22.1% versus 23.0% last year.  Decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales is largely due to benefit of greater leverage associated with our 14% sales growth for the quarter, as well as benefit of our ongoing cost control measures. We entered 2011 with approximately $55 million in permanent cost saving from previous initiatives to significantly reduce employee headcount, consolidate facilities and more effectively manage freight routes and transportation costs. Of our 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, we only added back 1% in 2010, including acquisitions. And we've added another 0.7% with acquisitions thus far in 2011.
In addition, our ongoing cost initiative have produced further savings of approximately $7 million to the first quarter this year. These initiatives have addressed cost scenarios such as freight, utility and warehouse management, and we expect to see additional savings coming from these initiatives over the balance of the year. These savings continue to positively impact our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. We'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. Tightly managing our expenses remains a top priority.
Now let's look at the business units by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter of $1,404,900,000, that represents 47% of the total and is up 9%. They had operating profit, $97.9 million, and that was up 10%. So margin expansion from 6.9% to 7.0%. The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter of $999.8 million, representing 34% of the total, up 24.5% with operating profit, $66.0 million, up 35%. So very nice expansion from 6.1% to 6.6% of sales on operating margin. Office Products had revenue in the quarter of $432.7 million, 14% of the total, up 5% with operating profit, $37.4 million, up 2%. So they had slight margin degradation, 8.9% to 8.6%, but that's still a strong operating margin. The Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter of $139.8 million, 5% of the total. They were up 39%. Operating profit, $10.7 million (sic) [$10.07 million], up 48%. So nice expansion there from 6.8% to 7.2% of sales. Putting it all together, total operating profit margin for the first quarter improved 10 basis points to 7.1% from 7.0% in the first quarter of 2010 as our improved SG&A leverage have partially offset the gross margin compression.
We had net interest expense of $6.5 million in the first quarter, which is down slightly from 2010. And we expect our net interest to be approximately $25 million to $26 million for the full year. In other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and non-controlling interest was $12.9 million expense in the quarter, up slightly from $12.3 million in the first quarter last year. The increase on this line is primarily due to higher expenses for incentive-based compensation, such as bonuses and stock options. And we continue to project the total other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range for the full year. Now this assumes consistent levels of incentive-based compensation over the balance of the year, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth.
For the quarter, tax rate was approximately 34.1% compared to 37.9% for the first quarter in 2010, a decrease in the rate from last year is due to favorable adjustment associated with the expiration of a statute of limitations related to international taxes. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be about 36.5%.
Net income for the quarter, $126.5 million, up 26%. EPS of $0.80 compared to $0.63 last year was up 27%.
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at March 31 of $466 million is up $132 million from $334 million in March 31, 2010.  We continue to build our cash position from increased earnings and improved working capital, and we've used our cash to fund several ongoing priorities, such as the increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail in a moment. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows and expect our cash position to remain sound.
Accounts receivable, $1.5 billion, increased 13% for March 31, 2010, on a 14% increase in sales for the first quarter. We're pleased to have shown progress in managing this account and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables. Our goal at GPC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth.
Inventory at 3/31/2011 was $2.24 billion, up approximately 1% or $25 million from March 31 last year. That is including acquisitions. In consideration of our sales growth, we believe that our management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and we'll remain focused on further improving our inventory levels over the balance of 2011.
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter with trade payables increasing to $1.4 billion, which is up 16% from March 31 in the prior year. Primarily, our progress in trade payables reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With the improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continues to improve and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account.
With progress in the key areas of receivable, inventory and payables, working capital is $2.5 billion at March 31, is down 5% from last year. But for comparison purposes, if we add back the $250 million current portion of debt at March 31, working capital is up approximately 4% from March 31 last year. We're encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing working capital and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition. After several consecutive years of strong cash flows, we expect to generate strong cash flows again in 2011 and currently estimate from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should be approximately $325 million, which is in line with last year.
We're encouraged by the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for use of the cash. These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and raised for 55 consecutive years. As you may recall, in our February board meeting, our directors authorized $1.80 annual dividend for 2011, up 10% from $1.64 in 2010. This new dividend represents a payout of approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share and currently yields about 3% to 3.5%. Additional priorities for cash includes the ongoing reinvestment in each of the four businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures, $14.5 million for the first quarter, is up from $10 million invested in the first quarter last year. Currently, we expect our CapEx spend to pick up over the balance of the year and be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year with the vast majority of these investments weighted toward total productivity enhancing projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization was $22.5 million in the quarter, in line with 2010. We expect D&A to remain level with last year and be approximately $90 million for the full year. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. As you may recall on January 31 of this year, we completed two acquisitions in our Industrial business with combined annual revenues of approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate additional opportunities for acquisitions over the balance of the year and remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy. Generally, we're targeting those both on tax and acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million, although there are certain exceptions to this rule.
In the first quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 177,000 shares of our company stock on a company share repurchase program. This follows the purchase of approximately 1.9 million shares in 2010 and today, we have right at 15.8 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program, as we continue to believe our stock's an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.
Total debt at March 31, 2011, remains unchanged at $500 million, and a $250 million credit facility maturing in November 2011 is accounted for in current liabilities. The second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. And regards to the portion of the debt due this November, we can tell you that we're currently well in the process of negotiating a new debt agreement and a private placement with several insurance companies. We expect to have a signed agreement before the end of third quarter, and we'll update you on that when we have more details.
Total debt to total capitalization at March 31, 14.8%. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We ended the second quarter of 2011 optimistic that we could show continued progress in growing our sales and earnings over the remainder of the year. Steady and consistent growth has defined Genuine Parts Company for much of our history, and we remain committed to continuing this trend. We'll continue to support this growth with a strong and healthy balance sheet, sound cash flows, further maximizing our return to shareholders. 
That concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our appreciation to all our dedicated GPC associates. We're truly very proud of this group and can't say it enough. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support as well. 
Tom, back to you."

So that's a recap of our first quarter numbers, and we're proud of the results that were produced by the GPC team. Thanks to their efforts, we feel that we're off to a good start to 2011.
Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects in each of our four businesses. There are a few uncertainties, however, including the increase in the price of gasoline, specifically, and the fragility yet in the economic recovery in general. But to this point, we seem to be weathering the situation fairly well. Additionally, we point out that our comps get even more challenging over the remaining three quarters of the year, with revenues being up 13% over the final nine months of 2010 and earnings per share being up 22%. 
With all of this in mind, our expectations are to grow total revenues by 9% to 11% for the full year, which implies an 8% to 10% increase over the remainder of the year, and this is up from our prior full year guidance of 6% to 8%. And this is based on Automotive being up 6% to 8%; Industrial, 15% to 17%; Office Products, 4% to 6%; and the Electrical/Electronic being up 16% to 18%. And by achieving revenue increases in these ranges, we think earnings will be in the range of $3.32 to $3.42, which is up $0.10 from our prior guidance of $3.22 to $3.32, and would represent an EPS increase of 11% to 14% for the full year.

But it's a pricing issue, it's a purchasing issue, it's a combination of all of those. And some of the issues that we have in place, we have some pricing software that we're looking at to improve that. But if you look back, Scot, this was going on last year as well. And so it's continued and some of that is just the nature of the economic climate that we're operating in. A lot of our customers refuse to take any increases. And at this point, we push back on taking any increases, as you could tell from the price increase that had been passed through to us. But it may be some of it is commodity driven, but we don't have anything that detailed on it at this point.

On the Automotive side, there's nothing that causes us to have any real concern other than the price of fuel. And we don't know what the impact is going to be on that. We've held up well thus far on the sales side. It has impacted our SG&A across all of the businesses. But what we have seen in terms of outbound sales is we have seen some reduction in the demand for any discretionary type items, and we saw that late February, early March and on through the month of March.

As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I will split the duties on this call. And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2011 results and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $2.974 billion which was up 14%. Net income was $126.5 million, which was up 26%, and earnings per share were $0.80 this year compared to $0.63 in the first quarter of 2010 and the EPS increase was 27%.
So we're pleased that the sales and earnings momentum that we saw throughout 2010 continued on into the first quarter of this year. As a result, we feel that we're off to a good start, and we look forward to another solid performance in 2011.
A review of the results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest increases. Motion Industries, our Industrial Distribution business, was up 24%. This is their fourth consecutive quarter of better than 20% increases, and we are very pleased with the progress that is being made in our Industrial segment. As we look at the numbers in a bit more detail, acquisitions added 5% to the increase. But importantly, we continue to see that the good results and the ongoing operations are broad based across their business as evidenced by the fact that every one of their top 12 product categories is running double-digit increases year-to-date. And as a group, these 12 categories are up 25%. And the same can be said about their top 10 customer segments. Double-digit increases in each case. And as a group, these top 10 customer segments are up 30% through the first quarter. And the top 20 individual customers have a collective year-to-date increase of 30% as well. And finally, all geographic areas are showing strong double-digit improvement throughout the first quarter.
So from a number of different viewpoints, the Industrial business remain strong and with the industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to remain at healthy levels. And with good execution on the growth initiatives, we're optimistic about our prospects in the Industrial segment over the next several quarters.
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS turned in another strong performance as well, with revenues being up 39% in the quarter. This is their fourth consecutive quarter better than 30% increases, so as with the Industrial business, the Electrical segment remains quite strong. The Seacoast Wire and Cable acquisition completed in September of last year gave us a nice boost in the quarter, as did the increase in copper pricing, but the ongoing operation still generated a strong 19% increase over the first three months of the year. So the underlying business in the Electrical/Electronic segment remains quite healthy. 
And as with the Industrial operations, the increases across the customer segments, as well as the product categories, were broad based and consistent. And we're encouraged by the fact that our primary external leading demand indicator, the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index, remained well above 50 through February, reflective of a continued expansion in the industry. And this bodes well for our Electrical business in the months ahead.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products company, was up 5%, continuing a pattern of gradual improvement that started in the second half of 2010. You may recall that Office Products was running 1% behind through midyear last year. Then they were even in the third quarter, plus 3% in the fourth quarter, and now up 5% this past quarter, so the trend is a bit encouraging. As has been the case for some time now, our sales for the independent Office Products resellers have outpaced our performance with the Mega Channel. The Independent business was up high single digits in the quarter, and we are pleased that this segment of our business has been on a gradually improving trend for five consecutive quarters now. But then our Mega business continues to run behind prior year, and this segment had a high single-digit decrease in the quarter. On the product side, all four of our major product categories, technology, office supplies, furniture, and cleaning and break room, showed positive growth in the quarter. This follows a similar pattern in the fourth quarter of 2010, and it's another indication to us that our Office Supply business is on a very gradual improving trend, and we expect this to continue in the quarters ahead.
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. You will recall that this business showed good sequential progress on a quarterly basis during 2010, and we ended the year with a 9% increase in the final quarter. We were pleased to see this carryover to the first quarter of this year, with our Automotive operations being up 9% once again. And this is essentially a same-store sales increase, which we think shows good progress on the part of our Automotive team.
Both our independently-owned and company-owned store groups grew at steady rates. And in looking at the detail within the company stores, our Retail business was up 4% in the quarter, our Fleet business was up 5% and our Installer business was up low double digits once again. And we're especially pleased with the steady and consistent double-digit growth that we have seen in our Installer business for over a year now. And this is largely attributable to the continued progress being made in our two primary installer initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts. You will recall that they both grew at double-digit rates in 2010 and this held true to the first quarter as well. So good progress continues to be made in each of these important areas. When we put it all together, we feel that our Automotive team came through the first quarter in good shape, and we're optimistic about their prospects over the remainder of the year. 
So that's a quick overview of our first quarter sales results. And at this point, we'll ask Jerry to take a few minutes to comment on the financial performance. Jerry?"

We incurred a total sale to a record high at $2.97 billion and at 14% for the second consecutive quarter. We're also encouraged by the positive sales momentum in all four of our business units, which is a testament to the hard work by everyone across our organization. We look forward to reporting continued growth over the balance of the year.
Gross profit for the first quarter, 28.5% which is down 70 basis points from 29.2% in the first quarter last year. Although we see many good things happening in our businesses, this area remains a challenge for us due to several reasons. For example, competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix across our businesses continues to negatively impact our gross margin. In addition, we are seeing a growing mix of sales through our national accounts and most of our businesses, which generally come with lower margins, but higher sales volumes. We're implementing both buy- and sell-side initiatives to offset these factors, and they should help stabilize gross margins in the coming quarters. We're working to reduce supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential. For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents the prior increases to us, was 0.5% in Automotive, 0.6% in Industrial, 0.9% in Office Products and 1.6% in Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A. Expenses of $657 million were up 9.8% from $598 million for the same period in 2010. And as a percent to sales, this marks a 90 basis point improvement to 22.1% versus 23.0% last year.  Decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales is largely due to benefit of greater leverage associated with our 14% sales growth for the quarter, as well as benefit of our ongoing cost control measures. We entered 2011 with approximately $55 million in permanent cost saving from previous initiatives to significantly reduced employee headcount, consolidate facilities and more effectively manage freight routes and transportation costs. Of our 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, we only added back 1% in 2010, including acquisitions. And we've added another 0.7% with acquisitions thus far in 2011.
In addition, our ongoing cost initiative have produced further savings of approximately $7 million to the first quarter this year. These initiatives have addressed cost scenarios such as freight, utility and warehouse management, and we expect to see additional savings coming from these initiatives over the balance of the year. These savings continue to positively impact our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. We'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. Tightly managing our expenses remains a top priority.
Now let's look at the business units by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter of $1,404,900,000, that represents 47% of the total and is up 9%. They had operating profit, $97.9 million, and that was up 10%. So margin expansion from 6.9% to 7.0%. The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter of $999.8 million, representing 34% of the total, up 24.5% with operating profit, $66.0 million, up 35%. So very nice expansion from 6.1% to 6.6% of sales on operating margin. Office Products had revenue in the quarter of $432.7 million, 14% of the total, up 5% with operating profit, $37.4 million, up 2%. So they had slight margin degradation, 8.9% to 8.6%, but that's still a strong operating margin. The Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter of $139.8 million, 5% of the total. They were up 39%. Operating profit, $10.7 million (sic) [$10.07 million], up 48%. So nice expansion there from 6.8% to 7.2% of sales. Putting it all together, total operating profit margin for the first quarter improved 10 basis points to 7.1% from 7.0% in the first quarter of 2010 as our improved SG&A leverage was partially offset the gross margin compression.
We had net interest expense of $6.5 million in the first quarter, which is down slightly from 2010. And we expect our net interest to be approximately $25 million to $26 million for the full year. In other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and non-controlling interest was $12.9 million expense in the quarter, up slightly from $12.3 million in the first quarter last year. The increase on this line is primarily due to higher expenses for incentive-based compensation, such as bonuses and stock options. And we continue to project the total other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range for the full year. Now this assumes consistent levels of incentive-based compensation over the balance of the year, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth.
For the quarter, tax rate was approximately 34.1% compared to 37.9% for the first quarter in 2010, a decrease in the rate from last year is due to favorable adjustment associated with the expiration of a statute of limitations related to international taxes. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be about 36.5%.
Net income for the quarter, $126.5 million, up 26%. EPS of $0.80 compared to $0.63 last year was up 27%.
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at March 31 of $466 million is up $132 million from $334 million in March 31, 2010.  We continue to build our cash position from increased earnings and improved working capital, and we've used our cash to fund several ongoing priorities, such as the increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail in a moment. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows and expect our cash position to remain sound.
Accounts receivable, $1.5 billion, increased 13% for March 31, 2010, on a 14% increase in sales for the first quarter. We're pleased to have shown progress in managing this account and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables. Our goal at GPC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth.
Inventory at 3/31/2011 was $2.24 billion, up approximately 1% or $25 million from March 31 last year. That is including acquisitions. In consideration of our sales growth, we believe that our management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and we'll remain focused on further improving our inventory levels over the balance of 2011.
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter with trade payables increasing to $1.4 billion, which is up 16% from March 31 in the prior year. Primarily, our progress in trade payables reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With the improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continues to improve and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account.
With progress in the key areas of receivable, inventory and payables, working capital is $2.5 billion at March 31, is down 5% from last year. But for comparison purposes, if we add back the $250 million current portion of debt at March 31, working capital is up approximately 4% from March 31 last year. We're encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing working capital and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition. After several consecutive years of strong cash flows, we expect to generate strong cash flows again in 2011 and currently estimate from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should be approximately $325 million, which is in line with last year.
We're encouraged by the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for use of the cash. These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and raised for 55 consecutive years. As you may recall, in our February board meeting, our directors authorized $1.80 annual dividend for 2011, up 10% from $1.64 in 2010. This new dividend represents a payout of approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share and currently yields about 3% to 3.5%. Additional priorities for cash includes the ongoing reinvestment in each of the four businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures, $14.5 million for the first quarter, is up from $10 million invested in the first quarter last year. Currently, we expect our CapEx spend to pick up over the balance of the year and be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year with the vast majority of these investments weighted toward total productivity enhancing projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization was $22.5 million in the quarter, in line with 2010. We expect D&A to remain level with last year and be approximately $90 million for the full year. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. As you may recall on January 31 of this year, we completed two acquisitions in our Industrial business with combined annual revenues of approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate additional opportunities for acquisitions over the balance of the year and remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy. Generally, we're targeting those both on tax and acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million, although there are certain exceptions to this rule.
In the first quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 177,000 shares of our company stock on a company share repurchase program. This follows the purchase of approximately 1.9 million shares in 2010 and today, we have right at 15.8 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program, as we continue to believe our stock's an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.
Total debt at March 31, 2011, remains unchanged at $500 million, and a $250 million credit facility maturing in November 2011 is accounted for in current liabilities. The second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. And regards to the portion of the debt due this November, we can tell you that we're currently well in the process of negotiating a new debt agreement and a private placement with several insurance companies. We expect to have a signed agreement before the end of third quarter, and we'll update you on that when we have more details.
Total debt to total capitalization at March 31, 14.8%. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We ended the second quarter of 2011 optimistic that we could show continued progress in growing our sales and earnings over the remainder of the year. Steady and consistent growth has defined Genuine Parts Company for much of our history, and we remain committed to continuing this trend. We'll continue to support this growth with a strong and healthy balance sheet, sound cash flows, further maximizing our return to shareholders. 
That concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our appreciation to all our dedicated GPC associates. We're truly very proud of this group and can't say it enough. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support as well. 
Tom, back to you."

So that's a recap of our first quarter numbers, and we're proud of the results that were produced by the GPC team. Thanks to their efforts, we feel that we're off to a good start to 2011.
Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects in each of our four businesses. There are a few uncertainties, however, including the increase in the price of gasoline, specifically, and the fragility yet in the economic recovery in general. But to this point, we seem to be weathering the situation fairly well. Additionally, we point out that our comps get even more challenging over the remaining three quarters of the year, with revenues being up 13% over the final nine months of 2010 and earnings per share being up 22%. 
With all of this in mind, our expectations are to grow total revenues by 9% to 11% for the full year, which implies an 8% to 10% increase over the remainder of the year, and this is up from our prior full year guidance of 6% to 8%. And this is based on Automotive being up 6% to 8%; Industrial, 15% to 17%; Office Products, 4% to 6%; and the Electrical/Electronic being up 16% to 18%. And by achieving revenue increases in these ranges, we think earnings will be in the range of $3.32 to $3.42, which is up $0.10 from our prior guidance of $3.22 to $3.32, and would represent an EPS increase of 11% to 14% for the full year.
At this time, we'd like to take your questions, and we'll turn the call back over to Andrea."

And so it's continued and some of that is just the nature of the economic climate that we're operating in. A lot of our customers refuse to take any increases.

We've held up well thus far on the sales side. It has impacted our SG&A across all of the businesses.

So our sales patterns were more -- reflect what they're able to do on their Contract business. And if you look back to last year, you could see that, for the most part, it was a tough year on that business for them and our results reflected that. We did see one of them turn low single-digit positive on the Contract business in the fourth quarter. The other two remained low single-digit negative. We have not seen first quarter results as yet, but we think it's going to continue to be a gradual improvement there. Our business is roughly 82% with the Independents and 18% with the Megas. So right now, we're fortunate that the Independent business remains reasonably healthy for us."

As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I will split the duties on this call. And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter 2011 results and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $2,974,000 which was up 14%. Net income was $126.5 million, which was up 26%, and earnings per share were $0.80 this year compared to $0.63 in the first quarter of 2010 and the EPS increase was 27%.
So we're pleased that the sales and earnings momentum that we saw throughout 2010 continued on into the first quarter of this year. As a result, we feel that we're off to a good start, and we look forward to another solid performance in 2011.
A review of the results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest increases. Motion Industries, our Industrial Distribution business, was up 24%. This is their fourth consecutive quarter of better than 20% increases, and we are very pleased with the progress that is being made in our Industrial segment. As we look at the numbers in a bit more detail, acquisitions added 5% to the increase. But importantly, we continue to see that the good results and the ongoing operations are broad based across their business as evidenced by the fact that every one of their top 12 product categories is running double-digit increases year-to-date. And as a group, these 12 categories are up 25%. And the same can be said about their top 10 customer segments. Double-digit increases in each case. And as a group, these top 10 customer segments are up 30% through the first quarter. And the top 20 individual customers have a collective year-to-date increase of 30% as well. And finally, all geographic areas are showing strong double-digit improvement throughout the first quarter.
So from a number of different viewpoints, the Industrial business remain strong and with the industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to remain at healthy levels. And with good execution on the growth initiatives, we're optimistic about our prospects in the Industrial segment over the next several quarters.
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS turned in another strong performance as well, with revenues being up 39% in the quarter. This is their fourth consecutive quarter better than 30% increases, so as with the Industrial business, the Electrical segment remains quite strong. The Seacoast Wire and Cable acquisition completed in September of last year gave us a nice boost in the quarter, as did the increase in copper pricing, but the ongoing operation still generated a strong 19% increase over the first three months of the year. So the underlying business in the Electrical/Electronic segment remains quite healthy. 
And as with the Industrial operations, the increases across the customer segments, as well as the product categories, were broad based and consistent. And we're encouraged by the fact that our primary external leading demand indicator, the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index, remained well above 50 through February, reflective of a continued expansion in the industry. And this bodes well for our Electrical business in the months ahead.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products company, was up 5%, continuing a pattern of gradual improvement that started in the second half of 2010. You may recall that Office Products was running 1% behind through midyear last year. Then they were even in the third quarter, plus 3% in the fourth quarter, and now up 5% this past quarter, so the trend is a bit encouraging. As has been the case for some time now, our sales for the independent Office Products resellers have outpaced our performance with the Mega Channel. The Independent business was up high single digits in the quarter, and we are pleased that this segment of our business has been on a gradually improving trend for five consecutive quarters now. But then our Mega business continues to run behind prior year, and this segment had a high single-digit decrease in the quarter. On the product side, all four of our major product categories, technology, office supplies, furniture, and cleaning and break room, showed positive growth in the quarter. This follows a similar pattern in the fourth quarter of 2010, and it's another indication to us that our Office Supply business is on a very gradual improving trend, and we expect this to continue in the quarters ahead.
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. You will recall that this business showed good sequential progress on a quarterly basis during 2010, and we ended the year with a 9% increase in the final quarter. We were pleased to see this carryover to the first quarter of this year, with our Automotive operations being up 9% once again. And this is essentially a same-store sales increase, which we think shows good progress on the part of our Automotive team.
Both our independently-owned and company-owned store groups grew at steady rates. And in looking at the detail within the company stores, our Retail business was up 4% in the quarter, our Fleet business was up 5% and our Installer business was up low double digits once again. And we're especially pleased with the steady and consistent double-digit growth that we have seen in our Installer business for over a year now. And this is largely attributable to the continued progress being made in our two primary installer initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts. You will recall that they both grew at double-digit rates in 2010 and this held true to the first quarter as well. So good progress continues to be made in each of these important areas. When we put it all together, we feel that our Automotive team came through the first quarter in good shape, and we're optimistic about their prospects over the remainder of the year. 
So that's a quick overview of our first quarter sales results. And at this point, we'll ask Jerry to take a few minutes to comment on the financial performance. Jerry?"

We incurred a total sale to a record high at $2.97 billion and at 14% for the second consecutive quarter. We're also encouraged by the positive sales momentum in all four of our business units, which is a testament to the hard work by everyone across our organization. We look forward to reporting continued growth over the balance of the year.
Gross profit for the first quarter, 28.5% which is down 70 basis points from 29.2% in the first quarter last year. Although we see many good things happening in our businesses, this area remains a challenge for us due to several reasons. For example, competitive pricing pressures and changes in product mix across our businesses continues to negatively impact our gross margin. In addition, we are seeing a growing mix of sales through our national accounts and most of our businesses, which generally come with lower margins, but higher sales volumes. We're implementing both buy- and sell-side initiatives to offset these factors, and they should help stabilize gross margins in the coming quarters. We're working to reduce supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential. For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents the prior increases to us, was 0.5% in Automotive, 0.6% in Industrial, 0.9% in Office Products and 1.6% in Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A. Expenses of $657 million were up 9.8% from $598 million for the same period in 2010. And as a percent to sales, this marks a 90 basis point improvement to 22.1% versus 23.0% last year.  Decrease in expenses as a percentage of sales is largely due to benefit of greater leverage associated with our 14% sales growth for the quarter, as well as benefit of our ongoing cost control measures. We entered 2011 with approximately $55 million in permanent cost saving from previous initiatives to significantly reduced employee headcount, consolidate facilities and more effectively manage freight routes and transportation costs. Of our 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, we only added back 1% in 2010, including acquisitions. And we've added another 0.7% with acquisitions thus far in 2011.
In addition, our ongoing cost initiative have produced further savings of approximately $7 million to the first quarter this year. These initiatives have addressed cost scenarios such as freight, utility and warehouse management, and we expect to see additional savings coming from these initiatives over the balance of the year. These savings continue to positively impact our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. We'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. Tightly managing our expenses remains a top priority.
Now let's look at the business units by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter of $1,404,900,000, that represents 47% of the total and is up 9%. They had operating profit, $97.9 million, and that was up 10%. So margin expansion from 6.9% to 7.0%. The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter of $999.8 million, representing 34% of the total, up 24.5% with operating profit, $66.0 million, up 35%. So very nice expansion from 6.1% to 6.6% of sales on operating margin. Office Products had revenue in the quarter of $432.7 million, 14% of the total, up 5% with operating profit, $37.4 million, up 2%. So they had slight margin degradation, 8.9% to 8.6%, but that's still a strong operating margin. The Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter of $139.8 million, 5% of the total. They were up 39%. Operating profit, $10.7 million (sic) [$10.07 million], up 48%. So nice expansion there from 6.8% to 7.2% of sales. Putting it all together, total operating profit margin for the first quarter improved 10 basis points to 7.1% from 7.0% in the first quarter of 2010 as our improved SG&A leverage was partially offset the gross margin compression.
We had net interest expense of $6.5 million in the first quarter, which is down slightly from 2010. And we expect our net interest to be approximately $25 million to $26 million for the full year. In other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and non-controlling interest was $12.9 million expense in the quarter, up slightly from $12.3 million in the first quarter last year. The increase on this line is primarily due to higher expenses for incentive-based compensation, such as bonuses and stock options. And we continue to project the total other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range for the full year. Now this assumes consistent levels of incentive-based compensation over the balance of the year, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth.
For the quarter, tax rate was approximately 34.1% compared to 37.9% for the first quarter in 2010, a decrease in the rate from last year is due to favorable adjustment associated with the expiration of a statute of limitations related to international taxes. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be about 36.5%.
Net income for the quarter, $126.5 million, up 26%. EPS of $0.80 compared to $0.63 last year was up 27%.
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at March 31 of $466 million is up $132 million from $334 million in March 31, 2010.  We continue to build our cash position from increased earnings and improved working capital, and we've used our cash to fund several ongoing priorities, such as the increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we'll discuss in more detail in a moment. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows and expect our cash position to remain sound.
Accounts receivable, $1.5 billion, increased 13% for March 31, 2010, on a 14% increase in sales for the first quarter. We're pleased to have shown progress in managing this account and remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables. Our goal at GPC remains to grow receivables at a rate less than revenue growth.
Inventory at 3/31/2011 was $2.24 billion, up approximately 1% or $25 million from March 31 last year. That is including acquisitions. In consideration of our sales growth, we believe that our management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and we'll remain focused on further improving our inventory levels over the balance of 2011.
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter with trade payables increasing to $1.4 billion, which is up 16% from March 31 in the prior year. Primarily, our progress in trade payables reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With the improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continues to improve and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account.
With progress in the key areas of receivable, inventory and payables, working capital is $2.5 billion at March 31, is down 5% from last year. But for comparison purposes, if we add back the $250 million current portion of debt at March 31, working capital is up approximately 4% from March 31 last year. We're encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing working capital and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition. After several consecutive years of strong cash flows, we expect to generate strong cash flows again in 2011 and currently estimate from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should be approximately $325 million, which is in line with last year.
We're encouraged by the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for use of the cash. These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and raised for 55 consecutive years. As you may recall, in our February board meeting, our directors authorized $1.80 annual dividend for 2011, up 10% from $1.64 in 2010. This new dividend represents a payout of approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share and currently yields about 3% to 3.5%. Additional priorities for cash includes the ongoing reinvestment in each of the four businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures, $14.5 million for the first quarter, is up from $10 million invested in the first quarter last year. Currently, we expect our CapEx spend to pick up over the balance of the year and be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year with the vast majority of these investments weighted toward total productivity enhancing projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization was $22.5 million in the quarter, in line with 2010. We expect D&A to remain level with last year and be approximately $90 million for the full year. Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. As you may recall on January 31 of this year, we completed two acquisitions in our Industrial business with combined annual revenues of approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate additional opportunities for acquisitions over the balance of the year and remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy. Generally, we're targeting those both on tax and acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $125 million, although there are certain exceptions to this rule.
In the first quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 177,000 shares of our company stock on a company share repurchase program. This follows the purchase of approximately 1.9 million shares in 2010 and today, we have right at 15.8 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program, as we continue to believe our stock's an attractive investment and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders.
Total debt at March 31, 2011, remains unchanged at $500 million, and a $250 million credit facility maturing in November 2011 is accounted for in current liabilities. The second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. And regards to the portion of the debt due this November, we can tell you that we're currently well in the process of negotiating a new debt agreement and a private placement with several insurance companies. We expect to have a signed agreement before the end of third quarter, and we'll update you on that when we have more details.
Total debt to total capitalization at March 31, 14.8%. We're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. We ended the second quarter of 2011 optimistic that we could show continued progress in growing our sales and earnings over the remainder of the year. Steady and consistent growth has defined Genuine Parts Company for much of our history, and we remain committed to continuing this trend. We'll continue to support this growth with a strong and healthy balance sheet, sound cash flows, further maximizing our return to shareholders. 
That concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our appreciation to all our dedicated GPC associates. We're truly very proud of this group and can't say it enough. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support as well. 
Tom, back to you."

So that's a recap of our first quarter numbers, and we're proud of the results that were produced by the GPC team. Thanks to their efforts, we feel that we're off to a good start to 2011.
Now as far as the remainder of the year is concerned, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects in each of our four businesses. There are a few uncertainties, however, including the increase in the price of gasoline, specifically, and the fragility yet in the economic recovery in general. But to this point, we seem to be weathering the situation fairly well. Additionally, we point out that our comps get even more challenging over the remaining three quarters of the year, with revenues being up 13% over the final nine months of 2010 and earnings per share being up 22%. 
With all of this in mind, our expectations are to grow total revenues by 9% to 11% for the full year, which implies an 8% to 10% increase over the remainder of the year, and this is up from our prior full year guidance of 6% to 8%. And this is based on Automotive being up 6% to 8%; Industrial, 15% to 17%; Office Products, 4% to 6%; and the Electrical/Electronic being up 16% to 18%. And by achieving revenue increases in these ranges, we think earnings will be in the range of $3.32 to $3.42, which is up $0.10 from our prior guidance of $3.22 to $3.32, and would represent an EPS increase of 11% to 14% for the full year.

We have seen discretionary spending tighten up a little bit in the Automotive business, and we think that there may be some further tightening that might come. But the way we're structured, our model is that we're 25% to 30% retail and we're 70% to 75% wholesale or commercial.

Earlier this morning, we released our second quarter 2010 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3,185,000,000, was up 12%. Net income was $151.8 million, and this was up 22%, and earnings per share were $0.96 this year compared to $0.78 in the second quarter of 2010 and EPS increase was 23%. These are all record results for us so we feel we had another good quarter with solid contributions from all 4 of our business segments, and we're proud of the job that is being done by the GPC team. Through their continued efforts, we feel that we're positioned to have another good year in 2011. 
A review of the second quarter results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical Operations continue to produce the largest sales increases. Motion Industries, our industrial distribution business, was up 19% in the quarter, and they went over $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. Acquisitions added about 3% to the Industrial increase in the quarter but importantly, the ongoing operations generated a very healthy 16% increase, so the underlying Industrial business continues to perform well.  
And as we look a bit more closely at the detail of the results, we continue to be encouraged by the strong performance that we see across the broad base of the Industrial business as evidenced by the fact that 11 of the top 12 product categories were up double digits in the quarter, and as a group, they were up 19%. And in each of the top 10 industry segments had double-digit increases in the second quarter and as a group, they were up 26%. 
A review of the top 20 customers shows a combined 25% increase for this group, and one final point is that every geographic region was up double digits in the quarter. So as you can see, the industrial business remains quite strong and healthy, and they end the first half up 22%. And with the industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to look favorable, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our Industrial business over the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS had another strong performance with sales being up 28%. Acquisition revenue added 10% to the quarterly increase, copper pricing had a positive impact of 4%, which means that the ongoing operations were up 14% in the quarter, which we feel is a solid performance. 
As with our Industrial business, the increases across the EIS product categories and customer segments are broad based and consistent, which is indicative of the healthy end market, as well as a good job being done by the EIS team. They closed out the first half up 34%, and with Institute for the Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index remaining above 50 through June, we're encouraged about EIS's prospects over the second half of the year. 
Office Products was up 4% in the quarter. This follows a 5% increase in the first quarter so a fairly consistent sales pattern through the first half of the year, despite the continued moderation and demand in the Office Products industry. As has been the case for a number of quarters now, our sales to the independent Office Products channel have outpaced our sales to the Mega Channel. The Independent business was up 7% in the quarter, and this follows an 8% increase in Q1 so a steady progress is being made with this customer segment. But then, this is being offset by continued decreases with the Mega Channel, which was down 10% in the quarter. 
On the products side, we had growth in all 4 of the categories: Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture and Cleaning and Breakroom, which we are pleased to see. This is the third consecutive quarter of positive growth across all 4 product groups simultaneously, which is encouraging, and we feel it's an indication that our Office Products business is on a very slow but gradually improving trend.  
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. We're pleased to report another 9% increase for this segment. This follows 9% increases in the fourth quarter 2010 and the first quarter of this year so a very steady picture here, and we feel it's indicative of the good job that is being done by our Automotive team.  
And looking a bit more closely at the sales results within our company-owned store group, we did see additional softening in our retail sales in the quarter. After ending 2010 with a 5% increase in retail, we were up 4% in the first quarter and then up just slightly in the second quarter so we have seen some weakening in our Retail business. And the biggest impact has been felt in the discretionary categories, which we attribute largely to the higher gasoline prices and cautious consumer sentiment. 
The nondiscretionary categories continue to perform reasonably well in the quarter. On the wholesale side, our fleet business was up 5% in the quarter, similar to our first quarter results, and our Commercial and Installed business was at low double-digit was again, and this was largely attributable to the continued good progress being made in our 2 primary installer initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts. You may recall that these 2 programs combined represented about $2 billion in sales for us in 2010, which was up low double-digits over 2009, and they're up low double digits through June of this year as well. So we continue to experience good growth in these 2 important commercial programs. 
When we put it all together, we're pleased to be able to report another 9% increase for Automotive operations, and we feel good about their prospects over the remainder of the year. So that's a quick overview of the second quarter sales results, and Jerry will now take a few minutes to comment on the income statement and balance sheet. Jerry?"
275034,136829436,141392,"Genuine Parts Company, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2011",2011-07-15,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the second quarter and 6-month income statement and segment information then cut you on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back",2199,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the second quarter and 6-month income statement and segment information then cut you on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up and then we'll open the call up your questions. 
A view of the income statement shows the following: total sales reached another record high $3.2 billion for the second quarter, up 12% from last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. On the 6 months, total sales of $6.2 billion, up 13% from 2010 and as we head into the half -- last half of the year, we remain optimistic about the continued positive sales momentum in all 4 of our business units. 
Gross profit for the second quarter was 28.76%, up 22 basis points from our margin in the first quarter this year while down only 12 basis points from 28.88% in the second quarter last year. For the 6 months, gross margin now at 28.65%, which is down 40 basis points from 29.05% for the same period last year. 
This area has been a challenge for us for several periods now so we're pleased to see the sequential improvement to the overall gross margin and to also narrow the GAAP in the year-over-year comparison. We had told you last quarter we are working hard to stabilize our gross margin by the end of 2011 and expect it to be operating on a relatively even run rate with the prior year, so it's good to see us moving in that direction this quarter. 
And that said, we've more work ahead of us so we continue to address ongoing competitive pricing pressures, changes in product mix and a growing mix of sales in national causing most of our businesses, which generally come with lower margin but higher sales volumes. 
As discussed last quarter, we had both buy and sales side initiatives to reduce supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential to help us offset these factors and further stabilize gross margins in the coming quarters. 
Now in the meantime, we will continue to offset any decreases in gross margin line with cost savings in our overall improvement in operating expenses. For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents the prior increases to us, was plus 1.4% in Automotive, plus 2.6% in Industrial, plus 1.5% in Office Products and plus 3.6% in Electrical. 
Now turning to SG&A. Expenses of $675 million were up 8.5% from $622 million for the same period in 2010, and as a percent to sales, improved by 65 basis points to 21.18% versus 21.83% last year. 
For the 6 months in 2011, SG&A stands at $1.3 billion, a 9% increase from the same period in 2010 and at 21.62% of sales, which is a 77 basis point improvement from last year. When expenses continue to improve as a percentage of sales, and we attribute this progress to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control costs. 
As a reminder, we carried over approximately $55 million in permanent cost savings from initiatives in '08 and '09 to significantly reduce employee headcount, consolidate facilities and more effectively manage freight and transportation costs. 
In addition, since our $0.12 headcount reduction in '08 and '09, we added back 1% in 2010 including acquisitions and have only added another 2% with acquisitions thus far in 2011. Furthermore, our ongoing cost initiative reduced savings of approximately $20 million through the second quarter of this year. These initiatives continue to help us address costs in areas such as freight, utility and warehouse management. We expect to see additional savings from these initiatives over the balance of the year. 
Our cost savings continue to positively impact our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. Tightly managing our expense remain the top priority, and we'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. 
Now let's discuss the results by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter $1,585.1 million, up 9% and that represents 50% of the total. They had operating profit of $138.8 million, up 10% so nice margin expansion from 8.6% to 8.8%. The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter $1,051.3 million, that's up 19%, representing 33% of the total. They had operating profit of $85.3 million, up 42% so very strong margin improvement from 6.8% to 8.1%. 
Office Products had revenue in the quarter of $418.0 million, that's up 4%. That represents 13% of the total operating profit, $31.4 million or 3%, with margins at 7.5% compared to 7.6% the prior year. Electrical had revenue in the quarter of $136.8 million, up 28%, representing 4% of the total operating profit of $9.2 million, up 32%, with margins at 6.7% compared to 6.5% for the second quarter of 2010. 
Now putting it all together, total operating profit margin for the second quarter improved 40 basis points to 8.3% from 7.9% in the second quarter of 2010. For the 6 months, total operating margin of 7.7% is up 30 basis points from last year. The improved expense leverage associated with our sales growth and our cost management efforts noted earlier have given the increase in operating margin for both the quarter and the year. 
We had net interest expense of $6.2 million and $12.7 million for the second quarter and 6 months, respectively, which is down slightly from 2010. We continue to expect our net interest for the full year to be approximately $25 million to $26 million. 
Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interests was a $16.8 million expense in the quarter and is $29.7 million for the 6 months through June. Slight increase on this line for the quarter and the year reflects higher expenses for incentive-based compensation such as bonuses and stock options. We continue to project the other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range for the full year, and that assumes steady leverage of incentive-based comp over the second half of the year, which we would expect in turn to normalize levels of growth. 
Tax rate for the quarter was approximately 37.2% compared to 38.0% for the second quarter in 2010. For the 6 months, our 35.8% effective rate compared to 38.0% for the same period last year with a decrease in rate due to favorable adjustment in the first quarter associated with the expiration of the statute of limitation related international taxes. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be about 36.5%. 
Net income for the quarter, $151.8 million, is up 22%, EPS of $0.96 compared to $0.78 last year, up 23%. For the year, net income, $278.3 million, up 24%, EPS $1.76 compared to $1.42 last year is also up 24%. 
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at June 30 of $517 million is up $105 million from $412 million at June 30 last year. We built our cash position from increased earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions, and we continue to use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as increasing the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we will discuss in more detail later. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows through the balance of the year. 
Accounts receivable, $1.6 billion, increased 16% from June 30, 2010, on a 12% increase in sales for the second quarter. This is a higher growth rate and we'd like to see as our goal at GPC is to grow to see where rate less than the revenue growth. Fortunately, we remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables but we have work to do in this area to get our trade receivables more in line with sales. 
Inventory at 6/30 was $2.25 billion, that's up approximately 4% from June last year. In consideration of our sales growth, we believe that our management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and remain focused on further improving our inventory levels over the balance of 2011. 
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter, with trade payables increasing to $1.49 billion, up 16% from June 30 in the prior year. Our progress in trade payables primarily reflect the impact of increase inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. 
With the improvement in our accounts payable, our days payable continue to improve as well, and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account. 
Working capital of $2.5 billion at June 30 is down 4% from last year, and for comparison purposes, only add back to $250 million current portion of the debt at June 30,2011, working capital is up approximately 5% from June 30 last year. With our ongoing progress in managing working capital and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition. 
Total debt at June 30, 2011, remains unchanged at $500 million. The first $200 million -- $50 million credit facility matures in November of this year and is accounted for in current liabilities. We have a new signed agreement extending this debt at 3.35% interest rate for another 5 years and will reclassify the debt to long term up on the funding in the fourth quarter. Second $250 million in debt is due in November of 2013. Total debt -- total capitalization June 30, 14.6%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. 
The fund was second consecutive year with a strong cash flow, we expect to generate a strong cash flow again in 2011 and currently estimate cash from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should exceed $300 million, which is in line with last year. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for the use of the cash. 
These priorities are: first, the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 55 consecutive years; our 2011 annual dividend went down per share represents a 10% decrease from $1.64 in 2010 and represents a payout ratio of 60% of our 2010 earnings. 
Currently, the dividend is yielding approximately 3.2% and historically yields 3% to 4%. 
Additional priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures, $27.2 million for the second quarter, up from $18.1 million invested in the second quarter last year. For the 6 months, capital spending totaled $41.7 million for 2011 compared to $27.9 million in 2010. We expect our CapEx spend to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year, with the vast majority of these investments weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. 
Depreciation and amortization, $22.9 million in the quarter, $45.5 million for the 6 months, which is in line with the same periods in 2010. We expect D&A to hold relatively constant with last year at approximately $90 million for the full year. 
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. Our Industrial business completed 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, with combined annual revenues of approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate additional opportunities through these acquisitions over the balance of the year and remain disciplined in our approach to the settlement of our growth strategy, generally targeting bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range although there are certainly exceptions to this rule. 
In the second quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares of our company stock under the company's stock repurchase program. Year-to-date, we purchased approximately 1.1 million shares and have another 14.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
We remain optimistic in our outlook for the second half of 2011 and look forward to reporting continued progress in growing our sales and earnings. We're committed to producing steady and consistent growth for the company, and we believe we have the right people and the right strategy to do so. 
As always, we'll continue to support our growth plans with strong cash flows, healthy balance sheet, further maximizing our return to shareholders. This concludes our financial review and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our sincere appreciation to all of our dedicated GPC associates. We're extremely proud of this group and can't say it enough. We also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support as well. Tom, I'll turn it back over to you."

Well, that concludes our review of the second quarter and first half results, and as mentioned earlier, we're proud of the job that has been done by the GPC team thus far in 2011. 
Now as far as the rest of the year is concerned, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects in each of our 4 businesses over the remainder of the year. End market conditions are generally favorable in each case, and the growth initiatives for each of the businesses are well defined. Our current expectations are for full year revenue growth of 9% to 11%, which is in line with our prior guidance, and this implies revenue growth of 6% to 9% over the remainder of the year, with Automotive being up 6% to 8% of the remainder of the year, Industrial 8% to 10%; Office Products, 3% to 5%; and Electrical/Electronic, up 10% to 12%.  
And we recognize that our second half growth expectations are tempered down from where we are through June but some uncertainties remain which are beyond our control, including the ongoing impact of the higher gasoline prices by miles driven and consumer spending, the high levels of unemployment and suboptimal job creation and the general fragility yet of the economic recovery. 
Additionally, our comparisons get even more challenging in the second half of the year, with last year's revenues being up 13.5% over the final 6 months and earnings per share up 22%. 
On the earnings side, we feel that a range of $3.40 to $3.50 is appropriate at this time, and this is up from our prior guidance of $3.32 to $3.42. At the $3.40 to $3.50 range, this would represent an EPS increase of 13% to 17% for the full year. And with revenues up 9% to 11% for the year and EPS up 13% to 17% following the 11% revenue and 20% EPS increases in 2010, we would consider that a solid performance by the Genuine Parts team.

And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have. 
Earlier this morning, we released our second quarter 2010 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3,185,000,000, which was up 12%. Net income was $151.8 million, and this was up 22%. And earnings per share were $0.96 this year, compared to $0.78 in the second quarter of 2010 and EPS increase was 23%. These are all record results for us, so we feel that we had another good quarter with solid contributions from all 4 of our business segments, and we're proud of the job that is being done by the GPC team. Through their continued efforts, we feel that we're positioned to have another good year in 2011. 
A review of the second quarter results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest sales increases. Motion Industries, our Industrial distribution business, was up 19% in the quarter, and they went over $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. Acquisitions added about 3% to the Industrial increase in the quarter, but importantly, the ongoing operations generated a very healthy 16% increase, so the underlying Industrial business continues to perform well.  
And as we look a bit more closely at the detail of the results, we continue to be encouraged by the strong performance that we see across the broad base of the Industrial business, as evidenced by the fact that 11 of the top 12 product categories were up double-digits in the quarter, and as a group, they were up 19%. And then each of the top 10 industry segments had double-digit increases in the second quarter, and as a group, they were up 26%. 
A review of the top 20 customers shows a combined 25% increase for this group. And one final point is that every geographic region was up double-digits in the quarter. So as you can see, the Industrial business remains quite strong and healthy, and they end the first half up 22%. And with the Industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to look favorable, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our Industrial business over the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS had another strong performance with sales being up 28%. Acquisition revenue added 10% to the quarterly increase. Copper pricing had a positive impact of 4%, which means that the ongoing operations were up 14% in the quarter, which we feel is a solid performance. As with our Industrial business, the increases across the EIS product categories and customer segments are broad-based and consistent, which is indicative of a healthy end market, as well as a good job being done by the EIS team. They closed out the first half up 34%, and with Institute for the Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index remaining above 50 through June, we're encouraged about EIS's prospects over the second half of the year. 
Office Products was up 4% in the quarter. This follows a 5% increase in the first quarter, so a fairly consistent sales pattern through the first half of the year, despite the continued moderation and demand in the Office Products industry. As has been the case for a number of quarters now, our sales to the independent Office Products channel have outpaced our sales to the Mega Channel. The independent business was up 7% in the quarter, and this follows an 8% increase in Q1, so a steady progress is being made with this customer segment. But then, this is being offset by continued decreases with the Mega Channel, which was down 10% in the quarter. 
On the products side, we had growth in all 4 of the categories: technology, office supplies, furniture and cleaning & breakroom, which we are pleased to see. This is the third consecutive quarter of positive growth across all 4 product groups simultaneously, which is encouraging, and we feel it's an indication that our Office Products business is on a very slow but gradually improving trend.  
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. We're pleased to report another 9% increase for this segment. This follows 9% increases in the fourth quarter 2010 and the first quarter of this year, so a very steady picture here. And we feel it's an indicative of the good job that is being done by our Automotive team.  
And looking a bit more closely at the sales results within our company-owned store group, we did see additional softening in our retail sales in the quarter. After ending 2010 with a 5% increase in retail, we were up 4% in the first quarter and then up just slightly in the second quarter, so we have seen some weakening in our retail business. And the biggest impact has been felt in the discretionary categories, which we attribute largely to the higher gasoline prices and cautious consumer sentiment. The nondiscretionary categories continue to perform reasonably well in the quarter. 
On the wholesale side, our fleet business was up 5% in the quarter, similar to our first quarter results, and our commercial and installer business was up low double-digit was again. And this is largely attributable to the continued good progress being made in our 2 primary installer initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts. You may recall that these 2 programs combined represented about $2 billion in sales for us in 2010, which was up low double-digits over 2009, and they're up low double-digits through June of this year as well. So we continue to experience good growth in these 2 important commercial programs. 
When we put it all together, we're pleased to be able to report another 9% increase for Automotive operations, and we feel good about their prospects over the remainder of the year. So that's a quick overview of the second quarter sales results. And Jerry will now take a few minutes to comment on the income statement and balance sheet. Jerry?"
275034,136829436,141476,"Genuine Parts Company, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2011",2011-07-15,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the second quarter and 6-month income statement and segment information, then cut you on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back",2204,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the second quarter and 6-month income statement and segment information, then cut you on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up and then we'll open the call up to your questions. 
A review of the income statement shows the following. Total sales reached another record high $3.2 billion for the second quarter, up 12% from last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. For the 6 months, total sales of $6.2 billion, up 13% from 2010, and as we head into the half, last half of the year, we remain optimistic about the continued positive sales momentum in all 4 of our business units. 
Gross profit for the second quarter was 28.76%, up 22 basis points from our margin in the first quarter this year while down only 12 basis points from 28.88% in the second quarter last year. For the 6 months, gross margin is now at 28.65%, which is down 40 basis points from 29.05% for the same period last year. 
This area has been a challenge for us for several periods now, so we're pleased to see the sequential improvement to the overall gross margin and to also narrow the gap in the year-over-year comparison. We had told you last quarter, we're working hard to stabilize our gross margin by the end of 2011 and expect it to be operating on a relatively even run rate with the prior year, so it's good to see us move in that direction this quarter. 
As that said, we have more work ahead of us, so we continue to address ongoing competitive pricing pressures, changes in product mix and a growing mix of sales to national accounts in most of our businesses, which generally come with lower margin but higher sales volumes. As discussed last quarter, we had both buy and sell side initiatives to reduce supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential to help us offset these factors and further stabilize gross margins in the coming quarters. Now in the meantime, we will continue to offset any decreases in gross margin line with cost savings in our overall improvement in operating expenses. For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents the prior increases to us, was plus 1.4% in Automotive, plus 2.6% in Industrial, plus 1.5% in Office Products and plus 3.6% in Electrical. 
Now turning to SG&A. Expenses of $675 million were up 8.5% from $622 million for the same period in 2010, and as a percent to sales, improved by 65 basis points to 21.18% versus 21.83% last year. 
For the 6 months in 2011, SG&A stands at $1.3 billion, a 9% increase from the same period in 2010 and at 21.62% of sales, which is a 77 basis point improvement from last year. We're encouraged that our expenses continue to improve as a percentage of sales, and we attribute this progress to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control costs. 
As a reminder, we carried over approximately $55 million in permanent cost savings from initiatives in '08 and '09 to significantly reduce employee headcount, consolidate facilities and more effectively manage freight and transportation costs. In addition, since our 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, we added back 1% in 2010, including acquisitions, and have only added another 2% with acquisitions thus far in 2011. Furthermore, our ongoing cost initiative reduced further savings of approximately $20 million through the second quarter of this year. These initiatives continue to help us address costs in areas such as freight, utility and warehouse management. We expect to see additional savings from these initiatives over the balance of the year. Our cost savings continue to positively impact our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. Tightly managing our expenses remain the top priority, and we'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. 
Now let's discuss the results by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter, $1,585.1 million, up 9%, and that represents 50% of the total. They had operating profit of $138.8 million, up 10%, so nice margin expansion from 8.6% to 8.8%. The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter, $1,051.3 million, that's up 19%, representing 33% of the total. They had operating profit of $85.3 million, up 42%, so very strong margin improvement from 6.8% to 8.1%. Office Products had revenue in the quarter of $418.0 million, that's up 4%. That represents 13% of the total operating profit, $31.4 million, up 3%, with margins at 7.5% compared to 7.6% the prior year. Electrical had revenue in the quarter of $136.8 million, up 28%, representing 4% of the total operating profit of $9.2 million, up 32%, with margins at 6.7% compared to 6.5% for the second quarter of 2010. 
Now putting it all together, total operating profit margin for the second quarter improved 40 basis points to 8.3% from 7.9% in the second quarter of 2010. For the 6 months, total operating margin of 7.7% is up 30 basis points from last year. The improved expense leverage associated with our sales growth and our cost management efforts noted earlier have driven the increase in operating margin for both the quarter and the year. We had net interest expense of $6.2 million and $12.7 million for the second quarter and 6 months, respectively, which is down slightly from 2010. We continue to expect our net interest for the full year to be approximately $25 million to $26 million. 
Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interests, was a $16.8 million expense in the quarter and is $29.7 million for the 6 months through June. Slight increase on this line for the quarter and the year reflects higher expenses for incentive-based compensation, such as bonuses and stock options. We continue to project the other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range for the full year, and that assumes steady levels of incentive-based comp over second half of the year, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth. 
Tax rate for the quarter was approximately 37.2% compared to 38.0% for the second quarter in 2010. For the 6 months, our 35.8% effective rate compares to 38.0% for the same period last year, with the decrease in rate due to favorable adjustment in the first quarter associated with the expiration of the statute of limitation-related international taxes. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be about 36.5%. Net income for the quarter, $151.8 million, is up 22%. EPS of $0.96 compared to $0.78 last year, up 23%. For the year, net income, $278.3 million, up 24%. EPS, $1.76 compared to $1.42 last year, is also up 24%. 
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at June 30 of $517 million is up $105 million from $412 million at June 30 last year. We've built our cash position from increased earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions, and we continue to use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as increasing the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we will discuss in more detail later. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows through the balance of the year. 
Accounts receivable, $1.6 billion, increased 16% from June 30, 2010, on a 12% increase in sales for the second quarter. This is a higher growth rate than we'd like to see, as our goal at GPC is to grow receivables at rate less than revenue growth. Fortunately, we remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables, but we have work to do in this area to get our trade receivables more in line with sales. Inventory at 6/30 was $2.25 billion. That's up approximately 4% from June of last year. In consideration of our sales growth, we believe that our management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and we remain focused on further improving our inventory levels over the balance of 2011. 
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter, with trade payables increasing to $1.49 billion, up 16% from June 30 in the prior year. Our progress in trade payables primarily reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volumes, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With the improvement in our accounts payable, our days payable continue to improve as well, and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account. 
Working capital of $2.5 billion at June 30 is down 4% from last year. And for comparison purposes, when we add back the $250 million current portion of the debt at June 30, 2011, working capital is up approximately 5% from June 30 last year. We're encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing working capital and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition. 
Total debt at June 30, 2011, remains unchanged at $500 million. The first $200 million -- $250 million credit facility matures in November of this year and is accounted for in current liabilities. We have a new signed agreement extending this debt at a 3.35% interest rate for another 5 years and we'll reclassify the debt to long-term upon the funding in the fourth quarter. The second $250 million in debt is due in November of 2013. Total debt -- total capitalization at June 30, 14.6%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. 
Following several consecutive years of strong cash flows, we expect to generate a strong cash flow again in 2011 and currently estimate cash from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow, after deducting capital expenditures and dividends, should exceed $300 million, which is in line with last year. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for the use of the cash. 
These priorities are, first, the dividend, which we've paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 55 consecutive years. Our 2011 annual dividend of $1.80 per share represents a 10% decrease from $1.64 in 2010 and represents a payout ratio of 60% of our 2010 earnings. Currently, the dividend is yielding approximately 3.2% and historically yields 3% to 4%. Additional priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures, $27.2 million for the second quarter, up from $18.1 million invested in the second quarter last year. For the 6 months, capital spending totaled $41.7 million for 2011 compared to $27.9 million in 2010. We expect our CapEx spend to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year, with the vast majority of these investments weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. Depreciation and amortization, $22.9 million in the quarter, $45.5 million for the 6 months, which is in line with the same periods in 2010. We expect D&A to hold relatively constant with last year at approximately $90 million for the full year. 
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. Our Industrial business completed 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, with combined annual revenues of approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate additional opportunities for acquisitions over the balance of the year and remain disciplined in our approach to this settlement of our growth strategy, generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, although there are certainly exceptions to this rule. 
In the second quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares of our company stock under the company's share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we purchased approximately 1.1 million shares and have another 14.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the programs as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
We remain optimistic in our outlook for the second half of 2011 and look forward to reporting continued progress in growing our sales and earnings. We're committed to producing steady and consistent growth for the company, and we believe we have the right people and the right strategy to do so. As always, we'll continue to support our growth plans with strong cash flows, healthy balance sheet, further maximizing our return to shareholders. 
This concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our sincere appreciation to all of our dedicated GPC associates. We're extremely proud of this group and can't say it enough. We also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support as well. Tom, I'll turn it back to you."

And as mentioned earlier, we're proud of the job that has been done by the GPC team thus far in 2011. 
Now as far as the rest of the year is concerned, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects in each of our 4 businesses over the remainder of the year. End market conditions are generally favorable in each case, and the growth initiatives for each of the businesses are well-defined. Our current expectations are for the full year revenue growth of 9% to 11%, which is in line with our prior guidance, and this implies revenue growth of 6% to 9% over the remainder of the year, with Automotive being up 6% to 8% over the remainder of the year, Industrial, 8% to 10%; Office Products, 3% to 5%; and Electrical/Electronic, up 10% to 12%. And we recognize that our second half growth expectations are tempered down from where we are through June, but some uncertainties remain which are beyond our control, including the ongoing impact of the higher gasoline prices on miles driven and consumer spending, the high level of unemployment and suboptimal job creation and the general fragility yet of the economic recovery. Additionally, our comparisons get even more challenging in the second half of the year, with last year's revenues being up 13.5% over the final 6 months and earnings per share up 22%. 
On the earnings side, we feel that a range of $3.40 to $3.50 is appropriate at this time. And this is up from our prior guidance of $3.32 to $3.42. At the $3.40 to $3.50 range, this would represent an EPS increase of 13% to 17% for the full year. And with revenues up 9% to 11% for the year and EPS up 13% to 17% following the 11% revenue and 20% EPS increases in 2010, we would consider that a solid performance by the Genuine Parts team.

And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have. 
Earlier this morning, we released our second quarter 2010 results, and hopefully you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows that sales for the quarter were $3,185,000,000, which was up 12%. Net income was $151.8 million, and this was up 22%. And earnings per share were $0.96 this year, compared to $0.78 in the second quarter of 2010 and EPS increase was 23%. These are all record results for us, so we feel that we had another good quarter with solid contributions from all 4 of our business segments, and we're proud of the job that is being done by the GPC team. Through their continued efforts, we feel that we're positioned to have another good year in 2011. 
A review of the second quarter results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest sales increases. Motion Industries, our Industrial distribution business, was up 19% in the quarter, and they went over $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. Acquisitions added about 3% to the Industrial increase in the quarter, but importantly, the ongoing operations generated a very healthy 16% increase, so the underlying Industrial business continues to perform well.  
And as we look a bit more closely at the detail of the results, we continue to be encouraged by the strong performance that we see across the broad base of the Industrial business, as evidenced by the fact that 11 of the top 12 product categories were up double-digits in the quarter, and as a group, they were up 19%. And then each of the top 10 industry segments had double-digit increases in the second quarter, and as a group, they were up 26%. 
A review of the top 20 customers shows a combined 25% increase for this group. And one final point is that every geographic region was up double-digits in the quarter. So as you can see, the Industrial business remains quite strong and healthy, and they end the first half up 22%. And with the Industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to look favorable, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our Industrial business over the remainder of the year. 
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS had another strong performance with sales being up 28%. Acquisition revenue added 10% to the quarterly increase. Copper pricing had a positive impact of 4%, which means that the ongoing operations were up 14% in the quarter, which we feel is a solid performance. As with our Industrial business, the increases across the EIS product categories and customer segments are broad-based and consistent, which is indicative of a healthy end market, as well as a good job being done by the EIS team. They closed out the first half up 34%, and with Institute for the Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index remaining above 50 through June, we're encouraged about EIS's prospects over the second half of the year. 
Office Products was up 4% in the quarter. This follows a 5% increase in the first quarter, so a fairly consistent sales pattern through the first half of the year, despite the continued moderation and demand in the Office Products industry. As has been the case for a number of quarters now, our sales to the independent Office Products channel have outpaced our sales to the Mega Channel. The independent business was up 7% in the quarter, and this follows an 8% increase in Q1, so a steady progress is being made with this customer segment. But then, this is being offset by continued decreases with the Mega Channel, which was down 10% in the quarter. 
On the products side, we had growth in all 4 of the categories: technology, office supplies, furniture and cleaning & breakroom, which we are pleased to see. This is the third consecutive quarter of positive growth across all 4 product groups simultaneously, which is encouraging, and we feel it's an indication that our Office Products business is on a very slow but gradually improving trend.  And finally, a few comments about Automotive. We're pleased to report another 9% increase for this segment. This follows 9% increases in the fourth quarter 2010 and the first quarter of this year, so a very steady picture here. And we feel it's an indicative of the good job that is being done by our Automotive team.  
And looking a bit more closely at the sales results within our company-owned store group, we did see additional softening in our retail sales in the quarter. After ending 2010 with a 5% increase in retail, we were up 4% in the first quarter and then up just slightly in the second quarter, so we have seen some weakening in our retail business. And the biggest impact has been felt in the discretionary categories, which we attribute largely to the higher gasoline prices and cautious consumer sentiment. The nondiscretionary categories continue to perform reasonably well in the quarter. 
On the wholesale side, our fleet business was up 5% in the quarter, similar to our first quarter results, and our commercial and installer business was up low double-digit was again. And this is largely attributable to the continued good progress being made in our 2 primary installer initiatives, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts. You may recall that these 2 programs combined represented about $2 billion in sales for us in 2010, which was up low double-digits over 2009, and they're up low double-digits through June of this year as well. So we continue to experience good growth in these 2 important commercial programs. 
When we put it all together, we're pleased to be able to report another 9% increase for Automotive operations, and we feel good about their prospects over the remainder of the year. So that's a quick overview of the second quarter sales results. And Jerry will now take a few minutes to comment on the income statement and balance sheet. Jerry?"
275034,136829436,141637,"Genuine Parts Company, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 15, 2011",2011-07-15,"Earnings Calls","Genuine Parts Company","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the second quarter and 6-month income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back t",2203,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the second quarter and 6-month income statement and segment information, then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up and then we'll open the call up to your questions. 
A review of the income statement shows the following. Total sales reached another record high $3.2 billion for the second quarter, up 12% from last year and our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. For the 6 months, total sales of $6.2 billion, up 13% from 2010, and as we head into the half, last half of the year, we remain optimistic about the continued positive sales momentum in all 4 of our business units. 
Gross profit for the second quarter was 28.76%, up 22 basis points from our margin in the first quarter this year while down only 12 basis points from 28.88% in the second quarter last year. For the 6 months, gross margin is now at 28.65%, which is down 40 basis points from 29.05% for the same period last year. 
This area has been a challenge for us for several periods now, so we're pleased to see the sequential improvement to the overall gross margin and to also narrow the gap in the year-over-year comparison. We had told you last quarter, we're working hard to stabilize our gross margin by the end of 2011 and expect it to be operating on a relatively even run rate with the prior year, so it's good to see us move in that direction this quarter. 
As that said, we have more work ahead of us, so we continue to address ongoing competitive pricing pressures, changes in product mix and a growing mix of sales to national accounts in most of our businesses, which generally come with lower margin but higher sales volumes. As discussed last quarter, we had both buy and sell side initiatives to reduce supply chain costs, increase distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential to help us offset these factors and further stabilize gross margins in the coming quarters. Now in the meantime, we will continue to offset any decreases in gross margin line with cost savings in our overall improvement in operating expenses. For the year, our cumulative pricing, which represents the prior increases to us, was plus 1.4% in Automotive, plus 2.6% in Industrial, plus 1.5% in Office Products and plus 3.6% in Electrical. 
Now turning to SG&A. Expenses of $675 million were up 8.5% from $622 million for the same period in 2010, and as a percent to sales, improved by 65 basis points to 21.18% versus 21.83% last year. 
For the 6 months in 2011, SG&A stands at $1.3 billion, a 9% increase from the same period in 2010 and at 21.62% of sales, which is a 77 basis point improvement from last year. We're encouraged that our expenses continue to improve as a percentage of sales, and we attribute this progress to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control costs. 
As a reminder, we carried over approximately $55 million in permanent cost savings from initiatives in '08 and '09 to significantly reduce employee headcount, consolidate facilities and more effectively manage freight and transportation costs. In addition, since our 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, we added back 1% in 2010, including acquisitions, and have only added another 2% with acquisitions thus far in 2011. Furthermore, our ongoing cost initiative reduced further savings of approximately $20 million through the second quarter of this year. These initiatives continue to help us address costs in areas such as freight, utility and warehouse management. We expect to see additional savings from these initiatives over the balance of the year. Our cost savings continue to positively impact our overall results, and our management team understands we must remain focused in this area. Tightly managing our expenses remain the top priority, and we'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. 
Now let's discuss the results by segment. Automotive had revenue in the quarter, $1,585.1 million, up 9%, and that represents 50% of the total. They had operating profit of $138.8 million, up 10%, so nice margin expansion from 8.6% to 8.8%. The Industrial Group had revenue in the quarter, $1,051.3 million, that's up 19%, representing 33% of the total. They had operating profit of $85.3 million, up 42%, so very strong margin improvement from 6.8% to 8.1%. Office Products had revenue in the quarter of $418.0 million, that's up 4%. That represents 13% of the total operating profit, $31.4 million, up 3%, with margins at 7.5% compared to 7.6% the prior year. Electrical had revenue in the quarter of $136.8 million, up 28%, representing 4% of the total operating profit of $9.2 million, up 32%, with margins at 6.7% compared to 6.5% for the second quarter of 2010. 
Now putting it all together, total operating profit margin for the second quarter improved 40 basis points to 8.3% from 7.9% in the second quarter of 2010. For the 6 months, total operating margin of 7.7% is up 30 basis points from last year. The improved expense leverage associated with our sales growth and our cost management efforts noted earlier have driven the increase in operating margin for both the quarter and the year. We had net interest expense of $6.2 million and $12.7 million for the second quarter and 6 months, respectively, which is down slightly from 2010. We continue to expect our net interest for the full year to be approximately $25 million to $26 million. 
Other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interests, was a $16.8 million expense in the quarter and is $29.7 million for the 6 months through June. Slight increase on this line for the quarter and the year reflects higher expenses for incentive-based compensation, such as bonuses and stock options. We continue to project the other category to be in the $45 million to $55 million range for the full year, and that assumes steady levels of incentive-based comp over second half of the year, which we would expect to incur with normalized levels of growth. 
Tax rate for the quarter was approximately 37.2% compared to 38.0% for the second quarter in 2010. For the 6 months, our 35.8% effective rate compares to 38.0% for the same period last year, with the decrease in rate due to favorable adjustment in the first quarter associated with the expiration of the statute of limitation-related international taxes. Currently, we expect the tax rate for 2011 to be about 36.5%. Net income for the quarter, $151.8 million, is up 22%. EPS of $0.96 compared to $0.78 last year, up 23%. For the year, net income, $278.3 million, up 24%. EPS, $1.76 compared to $1.42 last year, is also up 24%. 
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at June 30 of $517 million is up $105 million from $412 million at June 30 last year. We've built our cash position from increased earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions, and we continue to use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as increasing the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, which we will discuss in more detail later. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows through the balance of the year. 
Accounts receivable, $1.6 billion, increased 16% from June 30, 2010, on a 12% increase in sales for the second quarter. This is a higher growth rate than we'd like to see, as our goal at GPC is to grow receivables at rate less than revenue growth. Fortunately, we remain satisfied with the quality of our receivables, but we have work to do in this area to get our trade receivables more in line with sales. Inventory at 6/30 was $2.25 billion. That's up approximately 4% from June of last year. In consideration of our sales growth, we believe that our management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and we remain focused on further improving our inventory levels over the balance of 2011. 
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter, with trade payables increasing to $1.49 billion, up 16% from June 30 in the prior year. Our progress in trade payables primarily reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volumes, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With the improvement in our accounts payable, our days payable continue to improve as well, and we remain pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account. 
Working capital of $2.5 billion at June 30 is down 4% from last year. And for comparison purposes, when we add back the $250 million current portion of the debt at June 30, 2011, working capital is up approximately 5% from June 30 last year. We're encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing working capital and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition. 
Total debt at June 30, 2011, remains unchanged at $500 million. The first $200 million -- $250 million credit facility matures in November of this year and is accounted for in current liabilities. We have a new signed agreement extending this debt at a 3.35% interest rate for another 5 years and we'll reclassify the debt to long-term upon the funding in the fourth quarter. The second $250 million in debt is due in November of 2013. Total debt -- total capitalization at June 30, 14.6%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time. 
Following several consecutive years of strong cash flows, we expect to generate a strong cash flow again in 2011 and currently estimate cash from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow, after deducting capital expenditures and dividends, should exceed $300 million, which is in line with last year. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for the use of the cash. 
These priorities are, first, the dividend, which we've paid every year since going public in 1948 and have increased for 55 consecutive years. Our 2011 annual dividend of $1.80 per share represents a 10% decrease from $1.64 in 2010 and represents a payout ratio of 60% of our 2010 earnings. Currently, the dividend is yielding approximately 3.2% and historically yields 3% to 4%. Additional priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases. 
Capital expenditures, $27.2 million for the second quarter, up from $18.1 million invested in the second quarter last year. For the 6 months, capital spending totaled $41.7 million for 2011 compared to $27.9 million in 2010. We expect our CapEx spend to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year, with the vast majority of these investments weighted towards productivity-enhancing projects, primarily in technology. Depreciation and amortization, $22.9 million in the quarter, $45.5 million for the 6 months, which is in line with the same periods in 2010. We expect D&A to hold relatively constant with last year at approximately $90 million for the full year. 
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. Our Industrial business completed 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, with combined annual revenues of approximately $60 million. We continue to anticipate additional opportunities for acquisitions over the balance of the year and remain disciplined in our approach to this settlement of our growth strategy, generally targeting those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range, although there are certainly exceptions to this rule. 
In the second quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 900,000 shares of our company stock under the company's share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we purchased approximately 1.1 million shares and have another 14.9 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the programs as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment, and combined with the dividend, provides the best return to our shareholders. 
We remain optimistic in our outlook for the second half of 2011 and look forward to reporting continued progress in growing our sales and earnings. We're committed to producing steady and consistent growth for the company, and we believe we have the right people and the right strategy to do so. As always, we'll continue to support our growth plans with strong cash flows, healthy balance sheet, further maximizing our return to shareholders. 
This concludes our financial review, and I'll conclude my comments by expressing our sincere appreciation to all of our dedicated GPC associates. We're extremely proud of this group and can't say it enough. We also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We appreciate their continued support as well. Tom, I'll turn it back to you."

And as mentioned earlier, we're proud of the job that has been done by the GPC team thus far in 2011. 
Now as far as the rest of the year is concerned, we continue to be optimistic about our prospects in each of our 4 businesses over the remainder of the year. End market conditions are generally favorable in each case, and the growth initiatives for each of the businesses are well-defined. Our current expectations are for the full year revenue growth of 9% to 11%, which is in line with our prior guidance, and this implies revenue growth of 6% to 9% over the remainder of the year, with Automotive being up 6% to 8% over the remainder of the year, Industrial, 8% to 10%; Office Products, 3% to 5%; and Electrical/Electronic, up 10% to 12%. And we recognize that our second half growth expectations are tempered down from where we are through June, but some uncertainties remain which are beyond our control, including the ongoing impact of the higher gasoline prices on miles driven and consumer spending, the high level of unemployment and suboptimal job creation and the general fragility yet of the economic recovery. Additionally, our comparisons get even more challenging in the second half of the year, with last year's revenues being up 13.5% over the final 6 months and earnings per share up 22%. 
On the earnings side, we feel that a range of $3.40 to $3.50 is appropriate at this time. And this is up from our prior guidance of $3.32 to $3.42. At the $3.40 to $3.50 range, this would represent an EPS increase of 13% to 17% for the full year. And with revenues up 9% to 11% for the year and EPS up 13% to 17% following the 11% revenue and 20% EPS increases in 2010, we would consider that a solid performance by the Genuine Parts team.

But we don't see any material changes on the horizon, up or down. Our expectation is that it will continue to be as competitive as it has been."

As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I will split the duties on this call. And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2011 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3.286 billion, which was up 11%. Operating profit was $276.8 million, and that represents a 19% increase. Net income was $151.8 million, which was up 15%, and earnings per share were $0.97 this year compared to $0.83 in the third quarter of 2010, and the EPS increase was 17%. 
These were all record results for us. So we feel we had another good quarter. It was solid contributions from all 4 of our business segments, and we're proud of the job that is being done by the GPC team. Through their continued efforts, we feel that we are positioned to have another good year in 2011.
A review of the third quarter results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest sales increases. Motion Industries, our Industrial Distribution business, was up 18% in the quarter on top of a 29% increase in the third quarter of last year and then went over $1 billion in quarterly sales for the second consecutive quarter. So our Industrial operations continue to perform well. 
Acquisitions added about 3% to the Industrial increase in the quarter, but importantly, the ongoing operations generated a very healthy 15% increase. So the underlying Industrial business continues to generate strong results. 
And as we look a bit more closely at the sales detail, we continue to be encouraged by the solid performance that we see across a broad base of the Industrial business as evidenced by the fact that all 10 of the top product categories were up double digit in the quarter, and as a group, they were up over 20%. And then 9 of the top 10 industry segments had double-digit increases in the third quarter, and as a group, they were up over 20% also. A review of the top 20 customers shows a combined purchase increase of over 20% for this group, and one final point is that every geographic region was up double digits in the quarter. 
These are consistent results and as you can see, the Industrial business remains quite strong and healthy, and they're running up just over 20% year-to-date. And with the Industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to look favorable, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our Industrial business over the final quarter of the year and on into the early part of 2012. 
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS had another strong performance with sales being up 22%, which is on top of a 31% increase in the third quarter of 2010. Acquisition revenue added 11 points to the quarterly increase and represents sales from Seacoast Electric acquired in August of 2010 and Corporate Wire and Cable, which we acquired on September 1 of this year. We expect Corporate to generate annual revenues of approximately $43 million, and we are pleased with this strategic addition to the EIS business.
In addition to the acquisition boost that we've got on revenue, copper pricing had a positive sales impact of 3%, which means that the ongoing EIS operations were up 8% in the quarter, which we feel is a solid performance. As with our Industrial business, the increases across the EIS product categories and customer segments were broad-based and consistent, which is indicative of a healthy end market, as well as a good job being done by the EIS team. Through 3 quarters, they're up 30% and with the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index remaining above 50 through September, we're encouraged about EIS prospects in the months ahead. 
Office Products was up 3% in the quarter. This follows a 5% increase in the first quarter and a 4% increase in the second quarter. So we have seen a modest deceleration in our growth rates as the year has progressed. As has been the case for a number of quarters now, our sales to the independent Office Products channel have outpaced our sales to the Mega Channel. The independent business was up 6% in the quarter, and they're up 7% year-to-date, so steady progress is being made with this customer segment. But then this is being offset by continued decreases with the Mega Channel, which was down 12% in the quarter and is down 11% for the year. 
On the product side, we had positive results in 3 of the 4 main product categories office supplies, technology products and cleaning and break room and then we were down just slightly in the furniture category in the quarter. On the year-to-date basis, each of the 4 product categories was positive and our Office Products company is up 4%. While not up to our historical results, we do feel that S.P. Richards is performing in line or perhaps just a bit above the overall Office Products industry, and we feel that it will take a more robust overall jobs recovery for demand in the industry to show material improvement. 
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. We're pleased to report another 9% increase for this segment. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 9% increases, and we feel that it is indicative of the good job that our Automotive team has been doing. Within our company-owned store group, our same-store sales were up 6.9%, and this was driven by continued solid results on the commercial side of the business where we were up 8% in the quarter. We did see a little improvement on the retail side ending the quarter at 2% after being essentially flat in the second quarter. 
Within the Commercial segment, we saw continued good growth in our NAPA AutoCare and major account initiatives. They combined for a 10% increase in the quarter, and they were up 10% on a year-to-date basis as well. So the results from these 2 important programs remain strong. 
Our fleet business was up 5% in the quarter following 5% increases in each of the first 2 quarters, so a steady and consistent performance in this category. And then our non-fleet Commercial business, which includes AutoCare and major accounts, was up low double digits in the quarter, as well as year-to-date again showing a steady and consistent picture. 
When we put it all together, we're pleased to be able to report another 9% increase for our Automotive operations, and we feel good about their prospects over the remainder of the year. Now before turning the call over to Jerry, it is perhaps appropriate to make a few comments about our recently announced plans to take a 30% ownership position in group, the leading automotive distributor in Australia and New Zealand. Has annual revenues of just over $1 billion, and they go-to-market through 430 company-owned locations in Australia and New Zealand. This investment represents an important strategic initiative on our part, which we believe positions the company for significant long-term growth opportunities in Australia and New Zealand, as well as the potential for targeted growth in Asia. The regulatory approvals required in Australia and New Zealand are well underway and should be completed within another 45 days or so. We don't anticipate any issues and expect to close on the agreement on or about December 1. As a result, we do not expect this investment to have any real impact on our business in the current year. 
leading market position and long and successful history serving both the DIFM and the DIY markets makes them a valuable partner to us. In addition, we've had the opportunity to study each other's businesses over the years, and our fundamental values and commitment to the automotive aftermarket align very well. We're also fortunate that the structure of the investment allows us to enter these new markets in a disciplined manner. 
Genuine Parts Company has the option to acquire the remaining shares of once it has met certain earnings thresholds, which we anticipate to be several years away. While a minority owner, we intend to fully support growth strategies and learn even more about the future growth opportunities in Australia and New Zealand and the surrounding markets. As a 30% stakeholder, the return on our investment will be accounted for as minority interest income in our income statement. 
For 2012, we estimate an earnings contribution of approximately $0.04 to $0.05. We think this is a conservative expectation, and we expect it to grow in each subsequent year. So that's our update for today. We're excited about this growth opportunity for our Automotive business, and we will be happy to answer additional questions in the Q&A portion of the call. 
But first, we'd like to ask Jerry to give you an update on our third quarter and 9-month financial performance. Jerry?"

We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the third quarter 9-month income statement and segment information then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap",2483,"Thank you, Tom. Good morning. We appreciate you joining us on the call today. We'll first review the third quarter 9-month income statement and segment information then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, and then we'll open the call up to your questions. 
A review of the income statement shows the following. Total sales reached another record high of $3.3 billion for the third quarter, up 11% from last year and our sixth conservative quarter of double-digit sales growth. For the 9 months, total sales are $9.4 billion, up 12% from 2010. And if you look ahead to the fourth quarter, we remain encouraged by the continued positive sales momentum across our businesses. Gross profit for the third quarter was 28.87%, up slightly from our margin in the second quarter this year and in line with the 28.91% achieved in the third quarter last year.
This is significant as it shows that we met our objective of improving gross margin to an even run rate with the prior year quarter earlier than we expected. As for the 9 months, gross margin at 28.7% compared to 29.0% last year, down 30 basis points. We're encouraged by the steady progress on this line, and on the past few periods, we expect our fourth quarter gross margin holding no less than our rate for the fourth quarter last year.
Going forward, we would expect to show gradual improvement in our gross margins in 2012. To accomplish this goal, we'll continue execute our ongoing buy and sell side initiatives to reduce supply chain costs, increased distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential. These initiatives are necessary to account the impact of factors such as competitive pricing pressures, changes in product mix and a growing mix of sales to national accounts in most of our businesses, which generally come lower margin but higher sales volumes. As we work towards further improving our gross margin, we'll also continue to focus on our cost-saving initiatives and overall improvement in operating expenses.
For the year, our pricing through 9 months, which represents supply increases to us was plus 2.4% in Automotive, 3.3% increase in Industrial, plus 1.6% in Office Products and plus 4.8% in Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A. Expenses are $701 million were up 9.5% from $641 million for the same period in 2010, and as a percent of sales improved by 40 basis points to 21.4% versus 21.7% last year. For the 9 months in 2011, SG&A stands at $2.0 billion, a 9.3% increase from the same period in 2010 and 21.5% of sales, which is a 60 basis point improvement from 22.1% of sales last year. We're encouraged by the continued improvement in our expenses as a percentage of sales, and we attribute this progress to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control costs.
In addition to the favorable impact of prior year expense reduction initiatives, which included a 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, our ongoing cost initiatives have produced further savings of approximately $30 million through September this year. We've also added back just 3% of our labor force, including acquisitions since the beginning of 2010. These initiatives continue to positively impact our cost in several areas including freight, utilities, warehouse and infrastructure costs. And the current period serve to partially offset a $6 million expense associated with our third quarter retirement plan valuation adjustment, which we had not anticipated at the time of our last earnings call. We're pleased with our progress in effectively controlling costs thus far in 2011, and our management team remains focused in this area. Tightly managing our expenses remains a top priority, and we'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. 
Now as discussed the segment results. For the quarter, Automotive had revenue in the third quarter of $1,611,300,000 that was up 9%. And operating profit $141.2 million, up 14%. So nice operating profit margin expansion from 8.4% to 8.8%. The Industrial Group for the quarter had revenue of $1,089,800,000, up 18% and operating profit is $97.2 million, up 33% so very strong margin expansion from 7.9% to 8.9%. Office Products had revenue in the quarter $447.3 million, that's up 3%. Operating profits of $27.2 million, up 2% with margin staying flat at 6.1%. The Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter $143.3 million, up 22%. Operating profit of $11.1 million, up 33%. So nice margin expansion from 7.2% in the third quarter last year to 7.8% third quarter this year. 
Looking at sales by segment. For the full 9 months, automotive had revenue of $4,461,300,000. That represents 49% of the total. That's up 9%, and it had operating profit of $377.9 million, up 11.5%. So margins expanded 20 basis points to 8.2%. Industrial Group had revenue for the 9 months $3,140,900,000 representing 33% of the total and that's up 20.5%. Operating profit $248.5 million, up 37%. So again, strong margin expansion for the 9 months, as well as the third quarter going from 7.0% to 7.9%. Office Products had revenue for the 9 months $1.298 billion. That represents 14% of the total, up 4% with operating profit of $96.0 million, up 2.5%. So margins down slightly from 7.5% to 7.4%. The Electrical Group had revenue for the 9 months of $420.0 million. That's 4% of the total, up 29.5% with operating profit $30.4 million, up 37%. Again, nice margin expansion from 6.8% to 7.2% of revenue. So on a consolidated basis, total operating profit increased by 19% in the third quarter. Operating profit margin improved 50 basis points to 8.4% from 7.9% in the third quarter 2010.
For the 9 months, total operating profit increased 18%, and operating margin of 8.8% is up 40 basis points from last year. Now this is solid progress for both the quarter and the year, driven by the improved expense leverage associated with our sales growth and our cost management efforts noted earlier. 
We had net interest expense of $6.2 million and $19.0 million for the third quarter and 9 months, respectively, which is down slightly from 2010. We will continue to expect our net interest for the full year to be approximately $25 million to $26 million.
The other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interest was a $23.4 million expense in the quarter and is $53.2 million for the 9 months through September. This quarter's expenses up approximately $10.5 million from the third quarter last year and primarily reflects the difference in a $3 million favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment recorded in 2010 and a $6 million expense recorded in the third quarter this year as mentioned earlier.
With the exception of this line item, the expenses relatively in line with last year subject to slight increases in expenses like incentive-based comps such as bonuses and stock options. We currently project the total other category to be approximately $60 million for the full year. 
Tax rate for the quarter was approximately 38.6% compared to 38.0% for the third quarter in 2010. Increase in the rate was due to the non-deductible status of the retirement plan adjustment just discussed.
For the 9 months, our 36.8% effective tax rate compares favorably to the 38.0% for the same period last year with the decrease in the rate due to the favorable adjustment in the first quarter this year associated with the expiration of the statute of limitation related to international taxes. We expect the tax rate for the full year 2011 to be in a range of 36.5% to 37%.
Net income for the quarter, $151.8 million, was up 15%. EPS, a record $0.97 compared to $0.83 last year, up 17%. For the year, net income is $430.2 million, up 21%. EPS $2.72 compared to $2.25 in the prior year, which is also up 21%. 
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at September 30 of $535 million is up slightly from September 30 last year and remains strong. We built our cash position from increased earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions, and we continue to use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as the increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. We'll discuss each of these areas in more detail later. 
We also added in the third quarter we used $43 million in cash to fund our pension plan, which is required from time to time. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows through the balance of the year.
Accounts receivable, $1.53 billion, increased 10% from September 30, 2010, on an 11% increase in sales for the third quarter. This is an improvement from where we were last quarter and is in line with our company goal of receivables at a rate less than revenue growth. So good to see some progress in this area, and we also remain very satisfied with the quality of our receivables. 
Inventory at 9/30 was $2.25 billion, up 1% from December 31, 2010, and up 3% or $68 million from September 30 last year. In consideration of our double-digit sales growth, we believe that management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and we remain focused on further improving our inventory results over the balance of 2011.
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter with trade payables increased in the $1.59 billion, up 16% from September 30 in the prior year. Our progress in trade payables primarily reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With the improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continues to improve as well, and we remain very pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account.
Working capital of $2.4 billion at September 30 is down 10% from last year and for comparison purposes, when we add back the $250 million current portion of debt at September 30, 2011, working capital is basically unchanged from September 30 last year. We're encouraged with our ongoing progress we made in working capital, and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition.
Total debt at September 30 remains unchanged at $500 million. The first $250 million credit facility matures in November this year and is accounted for in current liabilities. We have a new signed agreement extending this debt at 3.35% interest rate for another 5 years, and we'll reclassify the debt long term upon funding in the fourth quarter. Second $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. Total debt to total capitalization at September 30 were 14.7%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time.
While there are several consecutive years of strong cash flow, we expect to generate strong cash flows for the full year and continue to estimate cash from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should be more than $300 million, which is in line with last year. We're pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for the use of the cash.
As noted before, these priorities are first, the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and raised for 55 consecutive years. Our 2011 annual dividend of $1.80 per share represents a 10% increase from $1.64 in 2010 and represents a payout of approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share. Currently, the dividend is yielding approximately 3.3% and historically, had range from 3% to 4%. Additional priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases.
Our investment in capital expenditures was $22.2 million for the third quarter, down from $31.0 million invested in the third quarter last year. For the 9 months, CapEx is up slightly to $63.9 million for 2011 compared to $59.0 million in 2010. We continue to expect our CapEx spending to be in a range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year with the vast majority of these investments weighted toward productivity enhancement projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization $21.5 million in the quarter and is $66.9 million for the 9 months, which is in line with the same periods in 2010. We expect D&A to hold relatively constant with last year at approximately $90 million for the full year.
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. In the third quarter, our Electrical business completed the Wire and Cable acquisition on September 1 and our Industrial unit made a small acquisition in July. Combined with the Industrial's 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, annual revenues for the acquired companies add to approximately $125 million, and as Tom covered earlier, we also recently announced our investment in, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. So we continue to find opportunities for acquisition and remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy. We're excited about the growth potential of the large investments such as, but we will continue to primarily target bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range.
In the third quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.2 million shares of our company's stock on the company's share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we purchased approximately 2.4 million shares and have another 13.5 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best returns our shareholders.
We're very pleased with our third quarter operating results and must thank all of our dedicated GPC associates for doing such a great job. We achieved our goals through their hard work, and we just can't say enough about their commitment to the success of Genuine Parts Company. As always, we also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We sincerely appreciate their continued support. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic in our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2011 and look forward to reporting continued progress in growing our sales and earnings and further improving our margins and working capital position. We remain committed to producing steady and consistent growth for the company, and we believe we have the right people and the right strategies to do this. As always, we'll continue to support our growth plans with strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet further maximizing our return to shareholders. Tom?"

Well, that pretty much concludes our review of the third quarter and 9-month results. And with sales up 12% year-to-date and earnings per share up 21%, we think that our folks have done a good job thus far in 2011. 
Now as far as the outlook for the final quarter of the year, we continue to feel good about our overall prospects. The underlying fundamentals in the Automotive aftermarket remain generally favorable, and gasoline prices have moderated somewhat over the past few weeks.
Industrial production, capacity utilization and the purchasing managers index are each at healthy levels, creating a favorable end market climate for our Industrial and Electrical, Electronic businesses. The outlier for us is the Office Product segment where we anticipate continued sluggish demand across the industry for a while. So the external conditions remain favorable in 3 of our 4 business segments currently. However, at the same time, we are aware of the overall uncertainty in the outlook for the general economic climate and its potential impact on end market demand. 
With all of that said, our fourth quarter expectations are for our Automotive operations to be up 7% to 9% and Industrial and Electrical to be up 10% to 12% each, Office Products to be up 2% to 4%. And this would combine for a 7% to 9% increase for GPC for the fourth quarter and will put us up 11% to 12% for the year. And with revenue increases in this range, we would expect earnings per share to be $3.51 to $3.55 for the full year, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $3.40 to $3.50, and it would put us up 17% to 18% for the year. 
From our perspective, an 11% to 12% revenue increase this year on top of last year's 11% increase and an EPS increase of 17% to 18% this year following last year's 20% improvement would represent another good performance from the GPC team. And as said earlier, we're proud of the job that they're doing.

And then as far as the DIFM versus the retail again, our expectation would be that, that will continue to grow at a rate a bit in excess of the overall Retail business because of the complexity of vehicles and whatnot. So we continue to be optimistic about the aftermarket for the foreseeable future."

We've known the people at and its predecessor company for over 20 years. About 2.5 years ago, the CEO of that company was going to be in the U.S. visiting with automotive companies, and they asked if he could come by and visit with Genuine Parts Company. We said certainly, and we had a chance to kind of reconnect with the company. Even though we've known them for over 20 years, we've not had much contact prior to about 2.5 years ago maybe the 3 or 4 years prior. Since that initial visit, we've had several additional visits with the CEO, and then as things really started to look like there might be something that could be good for their shareholders and our shareholders, we've had teams of people meeting here and there, looking at opportunities and looking at what it could mean. So we see a lot of commonality in the 2 businesses. We see some growth opportunities in their home markets, and the projected growth rates for Australia and New Zealand are a bit stronger than the projected growth rates for North America. And then we also see the larger growth rates potentially in some of the Southeast Asian markets that probably would be the right platform to use for expansion into those markets. This does not at all signal any less confidence than what we've had in our North American business, and we'll continue to I think do the kind of job that we have been doing. In fact, it's a vote of confidence for our Automotive management team that we feel that we can make this move and at the same time, count on our North American team to continue to do the good job they've been doing. Did that explain it, Mike?"

We don't see anything that would indicate that type of drop off is out there, and in fact, we don't see a drop-off at this point. So our sense is that we should be performing at reasonable levels at least through the end of this year and on into the early part of next year, and then we'll just have to moderate what's going on and see how we react to whatever may happen, but there's no indication of a slowdown at this point."

So they're going to be looking for the lowest viable cost for any of the product that they might buy from our Automotive business, for sure, the heavy duty side of it as well with some of the fleets that they run. So we can see some downward pressure there. At the same time, there's some significant reductions in headcount that are being forced upon those customer sets, some of which may come in areas that we deal with that might, in fact, moderate some of the downward pressure and maybe we can provide more service or better value for them rather than them doing it themselves. The offset is that they're reducing headcount across their offices as well, and that has an impact on our customer base. We don't sell to any of these people directly, but our customer set does, and demands for them would be off some. So I think it will be perhaps neutral for us on the Automotive side but somewhat negative on the Office Products side."

As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I will split the duties on this call. And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2011 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,286,000, which was up 11%. Operating profit was $276.8 million, and that represents a 19% increase. Net income was $151.8 million, which was up 15%, and earnings per share were $0.97 this year compared to $0.83 in the third quarter of 2010, and the EPS increase was 17%. 
These were all record results for us. So we feel we had another good quarter. It was solid contributions from all 4 of our business segments, and we're proud of the job that is being done by the GPC team. Through their continued efforts, we feel that we are positioned to have another good year in 2011.
A review of the third quarter results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest sales increases. Motion Industries, our Industrial Distribution business, was up 18% in the quarter on top of the 29% increase in the third quarter of last year and then went over $1 billion in quarterly sales for the second consecutive quarter. So our Industrial operations continue to perform well. 
Acquisitions added about 3% to the Industrial increase in the quarter, but importantly, the ongoing operations generated a very healthy 15% increase. So the underlying Industrial business continues to generate strong results. 
And as we look a bit more closely at the sales detail, we continue to be encouraged by the solid performance that we see across a broad base of the Industrial business as evidenced by the fact that all 10 of the top product categories were up double digit in the quarter, and as a group, they were up over 20%. And then 9 of the top 10 industry segments had double-digit increases in the third quarter, and as a group, they were up over 20% also. A review of the top 20 customers shows a combined purchase increase of over 20% for this group, and one final point is that every geographic region was up double digits in the quarter. 
These are consistent results and as you can see, the Industrial business remains quite strong and healthy, and they're running up just over 20% year-to-date. And with the Industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to look favorable, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our Industrial business over the final quarter of the year and on into the early part of 2012. 
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS had another strong performance with sales being up 22%, which is on top of a 31% increase in the third quarter of 2010. Acquisition revenue added 11 points to the quarterly increase and represents sales from Seacoast Electric acquired in August of 2010 and Cobra Wire & Cable, which we acquired on September 1 of this year. We expect Corporate to generate annual revenues of approximately $43 million, and we are pleased with this strategic addition to the EIS business.
In addition to the acquisition boost that we got on revenue, copper pricing had a positive sales impact of 3%, which means that the ongoing EIS operations were up 8% in the quarter, which we feel has a solid performance. As with our Industrial business, the increases across the EIS product categories and customer segments were broad-based and consistent, which is indicative of a healthy end market, as well as a good job being done by the EIS team. Through 3 quarters, they're up 30% and with the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index remaining above 50 through September, we're encouraged about EIS' prospects in the months ahead. 
Office Products was up 3% in the quarter. This follows a 5% increase in the first quarter and a 4% increase in the second quarter. So we have seen a modest deceleration in our growth rates as the year has progressed. As has been the case for a number of quarters now, our sales to the independent Office Products channel have outpaced our sales to the Mega Channel. The independent business was up 6% in the quarter, and they're up 7% year-to-date, so steady progress is being made with this customer segment. But then this is being offset by continued decreases with the Mega Channel, which was down 12% in the quarter and is down 11% for the year. 
On the product side, we had positive results in 3 of the 4 main product categories: office supplies; technology products; and cleaning and break room; and then we were down just slightly in the furniture category in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, each of the 4 product categories was positive and our Office Products company is up 4%. While not up to our historical results, we do feel that S.P. Richards is performing in line or perhaps just a bit above the overall Office Products industry, and we feel that it will take a more robust overall jobs recovery for demand in the industry to show material improvement. 
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. We're pleased to report another 9% increase for this segment. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 9% increases, and we feel that it is indicative of the good job that our Automotive team has been doing. Within our company-owned store group, our same-store sales were up 6.9%, and this was driven by continued solid results on the commercial side of the business where we're up 8% in the quarter. We did see a little improvement on the retail side ending the quarter at 2% after being essentially flat in the second quarter. 
Within the Commercial segment, we saw continued good growth in our NAPA AutoCare and major account initiatives. They combined for a 10% increase in the quarter, and they're up 10% on a year-to-date basis as well. So the results from these 2 important programs remain strong. 
Our fleet business was up 5% in the quarter, following 5% increases in each of the first 2 quarters, so a steady and consistent performance in this category. And then our non-fleet Commercial business, which includes AutoCare and major accounts, was up low double digits in the quarter, as well as year-to-date, again, showing a steady and consistent picture. When we put it all together, we're pleased to be able to report another 9% increase for our Automotive operations, and we feel good about their prospects over the remainder of the year. 
Now before turning the call over to Jerry, it is perhaps appropriate to make a few comments about our recently announced plans to take a 30% ownership position in Exego group, the leading automotive distributor in Australia and New Zealand. Exego has annual revenues of just over $1 billion, and they go to market through 430 company-owned locations in Australia and New Zealand. This investment represents an important strategic initiative on our part, which we believe positions the company for significant long-term growth opportunities in Australia and New Zealand, as well as the potential for targeted growth in Asia. The regulatory approvals required in Australia and New Zealand are well underway and should be completed within another 45 days or so. We don't anticipate any issues and expect to close on the agreement on or about December 1. As a result, we do not expect this investment to have any real impact on our business in the current year. 
Exego's leading market position and long and successful history, serving both the DIFM and the DIY markets, makes them a valuable partner to us. In addition, we've had the opportunity to study each other's businesses over the years, and our fundamental values and commitment to the automotive aftermarket align very well. We're also fortunate that the structure of the investment allows us to enter these new markets in a disciplined manner. 
Genuine Parts Company has the option to acquire the remaining shares of Exego once it has met certain earnings thresholds, which we anticipate to be several years away. While a minority owner, we intend to fully support Exego's growth strategies and learn even more about the future growth opportunities in Australia and New Zealand and the surrounding markets. As a 30% stakeholder, the return on our investment will be accounted for as minority interest income on our income statement. 
For 2012, we estimate an earnings contribution of approximately $0.04 to $0.05. We think this is a conservative expectation, and we expect it to grow in each subsequent year. So that's our update for today. We're excited about this growth opportunity for our Automotive business, and we will be happy to answer additional questions in the Q&A portion of the call. 
But first, we'd like to ask Jerry to give you an update on our third quarter and 9-month financial performance. Jerry?"

For the 9 months, total sales are $9.4 billion, up 12% from 2010. And if you look ahead to the fourth quarter, we remain encouraged by the continued positive sales momentum across our businesses. Gross profit for the third quarter was 28.87%, up slightly from our margin in the second quarter this year and in line with the 28.91% achieved in the third quarter last year.
This is significant as it shows that we met our objective of improving gross margin to an even run rate with the prior year quarter earlier than we expected. As for the 9 months, gross margin at 28.7% compared to 29.0% last year, down 30 basis points. We're encouraged by the steady progress on this line, and over the past few periods, we expect and we expect our fourth quarter gross margin holding no less than our rate for the fourth quarter last year.
Going forward, we would expect to show gradual improvement in our gross margins in 2012. To accomplish this goal, we'll continue execute our ongoing buy and sell side initiatives to reduce supply chain costs, increased distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential. These initiatives are necessary to account the impact of factors such as competitive pricing pressures, changes in product mix and a growing mix of sales to national accounts in most of our businesses, which generally come to lower margin, but higher sales volumes. As we work towards further improving our gross margin, we'll also continue to focus on our cost-saving initiatives and overall improvement in operating expenses.
For the year, our cumulative pricing through 9 months, which represents supply increases to us was plus 2.4% in Automotive, 3.3% increase in Industrial, plus 1.6% in Office Products and plus 4.8% in Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A. Expenses are $701 million were up 9.5% from $641 million for the same period in 2010, and as a percent of sales improved by 40 basis points to 21.4% versus 21.7% last year. For the 9 months in 2011, SG&A stands at $2.0 billion, a 9.3% increase from the same period in 2010 and a 21.5% of sales, which is a 60 basis point improvement from 22.1% of sales last year. We're encouraged by the continued improvement in our expenses as a percentage of sales, and we attribute this progress to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control costs.
In addition to the favorable impact of prior year expense reduction initiatives, which included a 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, our ongoing cost initiatives have produced further savings of approximately $30 million through September this year. We've also added back just 3% of our labor force, including acquisitions since the beginning of 2010. These initiatives continue to positively impact our cost in several areas including freight, utilities, warehouse and infrastructure cost. And in the current period serve to partially offset a $6 million expense associated with our third quarter retirement plan valuation adjustment, which we had not anticipated at the time of our last earnings call. We're pleased with our progress in effectively controlling costs thus far in 2011, and our management team remains focused in this area. Tightly managing our expenses remains a top priority, and we'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. 
Now I'll discussed the segment results. For the quarter, Automotive had revenue in the third quarter of $1,611,300,000 that was up 9%. It had operating profit $141.2 million, up 14%. So nice operating profit margin expansion from 8.4% to 8.8%. The Industrial Group for the quarter had revenue of $1,089,800,000, up 18% and our operating profit is $97.2 million, up 33% so very strong margin expansion from 7.9% to 8.9%. Office Products had revenue in the quarter $447.3 million, that's up 3%. Operating profit of $27.2 million, up 2% with margin staying flat at 6.1%. The Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter $143.3 million, up 22%. Operating profit $11.1 million, up 33%. So nice margin expansion from 7.2% in the third quarter last year to 7.8% third quarter this year. 
Looking at sales by segment. For the full 9 months, automotive had revenue of $4,601,300,000, that represents 49% of the total. That's up 9%, and it had operating profit of $377.9 million, up 11.5%. So margins expanded 20 basis points to 8.2%. Industrial Group had revenue for the 9 months $3,140,900,000 representing 33% of the total and that's up 20.5%. With our operating profit $248.5 million, up 37%. So again, strong margin expansion for the 9 months, as well as the third quarter going from 7.0% to 7.9%. 
Office Products had revenue for the 9 months $1,298,000,000. That represents 14% of the total, up 4% with operating profit of $96.0 million, up 2.5%. So margins down slightly from 7.5% to 7.4%. The Electrical Group had revenue for the 9 months of $420.0 million. That's 4% of the total, up 29.5% with operating profit $30.4 million, up 37%. Again, nice margin expansion from 6.8% to 7.2% of revenue. 
So on a consolidated basis, total operating profit increased by 19% in the third quarter. Operating profit margin improved 50 basis points to 8.4% from 7.9% in the third quarter 2010.
For the 9 months, total operating profit increased 18%, and operating margin of 8.8% is up 40 basis points from last year. Now this is solid progress for both the quarter and the year, driven by the improved expense leverage associated with our sales growth and our cost management efforts noted earlier. 
We had net interest expense of $6.2 million and $19.0 million for the third quarter and 9 months, respectively, which is down slightly from 2010. We continue to expect our net interest for the full year to be approximately $25 million to $26 million.
The other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interest was a $23.4 million expense in the quarter and is $53.2 million for the 9 months through September. This quarter's expenses up approximately $10.5 million from the third quarter last year and primarily reflects the difference in a $3 million favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment recorded in 2010 and a $6 million expense recorded in the third quarter this year as mentioned earlier.
With the exception of this line item, the expenses in other relatively in line with last year subject to slight increases in expenses like incentive-based comps, such as bonuses and stock options. We currently project the total other category to be approximately $60 million for the full year. 
Tax rate for the quarter was approximately 38.6% compared to 38.0% for the third quarter in 2010. Increase in the rate was due to the nondeductible status of the retirement plan adjustment just discussed.
For the 9 months, our 36.8% effective tax rate compares favorably to the 38.0% for the same period last year, with the decrease in the rate due to the favorable adjustment in the first quarter of this year associated with the expiration of the stature of limitation related to international taxes. We expect the tax rate for the full year in 2011 to be in the range of 36.5% to 37%.
Net income for the quarter, $151.8 million, was up 15%. EPS, a record $0.97 compared to $0.83 last year, up 17%. For the year, net income is $430.2 million, up 21%. EPS $2.72 compared to $2.25 in the prior year, which is also up 21%. 
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at September 30 of $535 million is up slightly from September 30 last year and remains strong. We built our cash position from increased earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions, and we continue to use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as the increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. We'll discuss each of these areas in more detail later. 
We'd also add that in the third quarter, we used $43 million in cash to fund our pension plan, which is required from time to time. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows through the balance of the year.
Accounts receivable, $1.53 billion, increased 10% from September 30, 2010, on an 11% increase in sales for the third quarter. This is an improvement from where we were last quarter and is in line with our company goal of growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth. So good to see some progress in this area, and we also remain very satisfied with the quality of our receivables. 
Inventory at 9/30 was $2.25 billion, up 1% from December 31, 2010, and up 3% or $68 million from September 30 last year. In consideration of our double-digit sales growth, we believe that management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and we remain focused on further improving our inventory results over the balance of 2011.
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter with trade payables increase in the $1.59 billion, up 16% from September 30 in the prior year. Our progress in trade payables primarily reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With the improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continues to improve as well, and we remain very pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account.
Working capital of $2.4 billion at September 30 is down 10% from last year and for comparison purposes, when we add back the $250 million current portion of debt at September 30, 2011, working capital is basically unchanged from September 30 of last year. We're encouraged with our ongoing progress and managing working capital and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition.
Total debt at September 30 remains unchanged at $500 million. The first $250 million credit facility matures in November this year and is accounted for in current liabilities. We have a new signed agreement extending this debt at 3.35% interest rate for another 5 years, and we'll reclassify the debt to long term upon funding in the fourth quarter. Second, $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. Total debt to total capitalization at September 30 were 14.7%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time.
While our several consecutive years of strong cash flow, we expect to generate strong cash flows for the full year and continue to estimate cash from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should be more than $300 million, which is in line with last year. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for the use of the cash.
As noted before, these priorities are first, the dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and raised for 55 consecutive years. Our 2011 annual dividend of $1.80 per share represents a 10% increase from $1.64 in 2010 and represents a payout of approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share. Currently, the dividend is yielding approximately 3.3% and historically, had ranged from 3% to 4%. Additional priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases.
Our investment and capital expenditures was $22.2 million for the third quarter, down from $31.0 million invested in the third quarter last year. For the 9 months, CapEx is up slightly to $63.9 million for 2011 compared to $59.0 million in 2010. We continue to expect our CapEx spending to be in a range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year with the vast majority of these investments weighted toward productivity enhancement projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization $21.5 million in the quarter and is $66.9 million for the 9 months, which is in line with the same periods in 2010. We expect D&A to hold relatively constant with last year at approximately $90 million for the full year.
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. In the third quarter, our Electrical business completed the Cobra Wire & Cable acquisition on September 1 and our Industrial unit made a small acquisition in July. Combined with the Industrial's 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, annual revenues for the acquired companies add to approximately $125 million, and as Tom covered earlier, we also recently announced our investment in Exego, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. So we continue to find opportunities to these acquisition and remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy. We're excited about the growth potential of a large investments such as Exego, but we will continue to primarily target those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range.
In the third quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.2 million shares of our company's stock on the company's share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we purchased approximately 2.4 million shares and have another 13.5 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program, as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.
We're very pleased with our third quarter operating results and must thank all of our dedicated GPC associates for doing such a great job. We achieved our goals through their hard work, and we just can't say enough about their commitment to the success of Genuine Parts Company. As always, we also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We sincerely appreciate their continued support. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic in our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2011 and look forward to reporting continued progress in growing our sales and earnings and further improving our margins and working capital position. We remain committed to producing steady and consistent growth for the company, and we believe we have the right people and the right strategy to do this. 
As always, we'll continue to support our growth plans with strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet further maximizing our return to shareholders. Tom?"

Well, that pretty much concludes our review of the third quarter and 9-month results. And with sales up 12% year-to-date and earnings per share up 21%, we think that our folks have done a good job, thus far in 2011. 
Now as far as the outlook for the final quarter of the year, we continue to feel good about our overall prospects. The underlying fundamentals in the Automotive aftermarket remain generally favorable, and gasoline prices have moderated somewhat over the past few weeks.
Industrial production, capacity utilization and the purchasing managers index are each at healthy levels, creating a favorable end market climate for our Industrial and Electrical, Electronic businesses. The outlier for us is the Office Product segment, where we anticipate continued sluggish demand across the industry for a while yet. So the external conditions remain favorable in 3 of our 4 business segments currently. However, at the same time, we are aware of the overall uncertainty in the outlook for the general economic climate and its potential impact on end market demand. 
With all of that said, our fourth quarter expectations are for our Automotive operations to be up 7% to 9%, Industrial and Electrical to be up 10% to 12% each, Office Products to be up 2% to 4%. And this would combine for a 7% to 9% increase for GPC for the fourth quarter and will put us up 11% to 12% for the year. And with revenue increases in this range, we would expect earnings per share to be $3.51 to $3.55 for the full year, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $3.40 to $3.50, and it would put us up 17% to 18% for the year. 
From our perspective, an 11% to 12% revenue increase this year on top of last year's 11% increase and an EPS increase of 17% to 18% this year following last year's 20% improvement would represent another good performance from the GPC team. And as said earlier, we're proud of the job that they're doing. 
At this point, we'd like to try to answer any questions that you may have, and we'll turn the call back over to Brooke."

And then we also see the larger growth rates potentially in some of the Southeast Asian markets that Exego probably would be the right platform to use for expansion into those markets. This does not at all signal any less confidence than what we've had in our North American business, and we'll continue to, I think, do the kind of job that we have been doing. In fact, it's a vote of confidence for our Automotive management team that we feel that we can make this move and at the same time, count on our North American team to continue to do the good job they've been doing."

So they're going to be looking for the lowest viable cost for any of the product that they might buy from our Automotive business for sure, the heavy duty side of it as well with some of the fleets that they run. So we can see some downward pressure there. At the same time, there's some significant reductions in headcount that are being forced upon those customer sets, some of which may come in areas that we deal with, that might, in fact, moderate some of the downward pressure and maybe we can provide more service or better value for them rather than them doing it themselves. The offset is that they're reducing headcount across their offices as well, and that has an impact on our customer base. We don't sell to any of these people directly, but our customer set does, and demands for them would be off some. So I think it will be perhaps neutral for us on the Automotive side, but somewhat negative on the Office Products side."

As we customarily do, Jerry Nix, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and I will split the duties on this call. And once we have concluded our remarks, we will look forward to answering any questions that you may have.
Earlier this morning, we released our third quarter 2011 results, and hopefully, you've had an opportunity to review them. But for those who may not have seen the numbers as yet, a quick recap shows sales for the quarter were $3,286,000,000 which was up 11%. Operating profit was $276.8 million, and that represents a 19% increase. Net income was $151.8 million, which was up 15%, and earnings per share were $0.97 this year compared to $0.83 in the third quarter of 2010, and the EPS increase was 17%. 
These were all record results for us. So we feel we had another good quarter. It was solid contributions from all 4 of our business segments, and we're proud of the job that is being done by the GPC team. Through their continued efforts, we feel that we are positioned to have another good year in 2011.
A review of the third quarter results by business segment shows that our Industrial and Electrical operations continue to produce the largest sales increases. Motion Industries, our Industrial Distribution business, was up 18% in the quarter on top of the 29% increase in the third quarter of last year and then went over $1 billion in quarterly sales for the second consecutive quarter. So our Industrial operations continue to perform well. 
Acquisitions added about 3% to the Industrial increase in the quarter, but importantly, the ongoing operations generated a very healthy 15% increase. So the underlying Industrial business continues to generate strong results. 
And as we look a bit more closely at the sales detail, we continue to be encouraged by the solid performance that we see across a broad base of the Industrial business as evidenced by the fact that all 10 of the top product categories were up double digit in the quarter, and as a group, they were up over 20%. And then 9 of the top 10 industry segments had double-digit increases in the third quarter, and as a group, they were up over 20% also. A review of the top 20 customers shows a combined purchase increase of over 20% for this group, and one final point is that every geographic region was up double digits in the quarter. 
These are consistent results and as you can see, the Industrial business remains quite strong and healthy, and they're running up just over 20% year-to-date. And with the Industrial production and capacity utilization indices each continuing to look favorable, we remain optimistic about the prospects for our Industrial business over the final quarter of the year and on into the early part of 2012. 
Moving on to the Electrical segment. EIS had another strong performance with sales being up 22%, which is on top of a 31% increase in the third quarter of 2010. Acquisition revenue added 11 points to the quarterly increase and represents sales from Seacoast Electric acquired in August of 2010 and Cobra Wire & Cable, which we acquired on September 1 of this year. We expect Cobra to generate annual revenues of approximately $43 million, and we are pleased with this strategic addition to the EIS business.
In addition to the acquisition boost that we got on revenue, copper pricing had a positive sales impact of 3%, which means that the ongoing EIS operations were up 8% in the quarter, which we feel is a solid performance. As with our Industrial business, the increases across the EIS product categories and customer segments were broad-based and consistent, which is indicative of a healthy end market, as well as a good job being done by the EIS team. Through 3 quarters, they're up 30% and with the Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers Index remaining above 50 through September, we're encouraged about EIS' prospects in the months ahead. 
Office Products was up 3% in the quarter. This follows a 5% increase in the first quarter and a 4% increase in the second quarter. So we have seen a modest deceleration in our growth rates as the year has progressed. As has been the case for a number of quarters now, our sales to the independent Office Products channel have outpaced our sales to the Mega Channel. The independent business was up 6% in the quarter, and they're up 7% year-to-date, so steady progress is being made with this customer segment. But then this is being offset by continued decreases with the Mega Channel, which was down 12% in the quarter and is down 11% for the year. 
On the product side, we had positive results in 3 of the 4 main product categories: office supplies; technology products; and cleaning and break room; and then we were down just slightly in the furniture category in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, each of the 4 product categories is positive and our Office Products company is up 4%. While not up to our historical results, we do feel that S.P. Richards is performing in line or perhaps just a bit above the overall Office Products industry, and we feel that it will take a more robust overall jobs recovery for demand in the industry to show material improvement. 
And finally, a few comments about Automotive. We're pleased to report another 9% increase for this segment. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 9% increases, and we feel that it is indicative of the good job that our Automotive team has been doing. Within our company-owned store group, our same-store sales were up 6.9%, and this was driven by continued solid results on the commercial side of the business where we're up 8% in the quarter. We did see a little improvement on the retail side ending the quarter at 2% after being essentially flat in the second quarter. 
Within the Commercial segment, we saw continued good growth in our NAPA AutoCare and major account initiatives. They combined for a 10% increase in the quarter, and they're up 10% on a year-to-date basis as well. So the results from these 2 important programs remain strong. 
Our fleet business was up 5% in the quarter, following 5% increases in each of the first 2 quarters, so a steady and consistent performance in this category. And then our non-fleet Commercial business, which includes AutoCare and major accounts, was up low double digits in the quarter, as well as year-to-date, again, showing a steady and consistent picture. When we put it all together, we're pleased to be able to report another 9% increase for our Automotive operations, and we feel good about their prospects over the remainder of the year. 
Now before turning the call over to Jerry, it is perhaps appropriate to make a few comments about our recently announced plans to take a 30% ownership position in Exego group, the leading automotive distributor in Australia and New Zealand. Exego has annual revenues of just over $1 billion, and they go to market through 430 company-owned locations in Australia and New Zealand. This investment represents an important strategic initiative on our part, which we believe positions the company for significant long-term growth opportunities in Australia and New Zealand, as well as the potential for targeted growth in Asia. The regulatory approvals required in Australia and New Zealand are well underway and should be completed within another 45 days or so. We don't anticipate any issues and expect to close on the agreement on or about December 1. As a result, we do not expect this investment to have any real impact on our business in the current year. 
Exego's leading market position and long and successful history, serving both the DIFM and the DIY markets, makes them a valuable partner to us. In addition, we've had the opportunity to study each other's businesses over the years, and our fundamental values and commitment to the automotive aftermarket align very well. We're also fortunate that the structure of the investment allows us to enter these new markets in a disciplined manner. 
Genuine Parts Company has the option to acquire the remaining shares of Exego once it has met certain earnings thresholds, which we anticipate to be several years away. While a minority owner, we intend to fully support Exego's growth strategies and learn even more about the future growth opportunities in Australia and New Zealand and the surrounding markets. As a 30% stakeholder, the return on our investment will be accounted for as minority interest income on our income statement. 
For 2012, we estimate an earnings contribution of approximately $0.04 to $0.05. We think this is a conservative expectation, and we expect it to grow in each subsequent year. So that's our update for today. We're excited about this growth opportunity for our Automotive business, and we will be happy to answer additional questions in the Q&A portion of the call. 
But first, we'd like to ask Jerry to give you an update on our third quarter and 9-month financial performance. Jerry?"

We'll first review the third quarter 9-month income statements and segment information then touch on a few key balance sheet and other financial items. Tom will come back to wrap it up, and then we'll open the call up to your questions. 
A review of the income statement shows the following. Total sales reached another record high of $3.3 billion for the third quarter, up 11% from last year and our sixth conservative quarter of double-digit sales growth. For the 9 months, total sales are $9.4 billion, up 12% from 2010. And if you look ahead to the fourth quarter, we remain encouraged by the continued positive sales momentum across our businesses. Gross profit for the third quarter was 28.87%, up slightly from our margin in the second quarter this year and in line with the 28.91% achieved in the third quarter last year.
This is significant as it shows that we met our objective of improving gross margin to an even run rate with the prior year a quarter earlier than we expected. As for the 9 months, gross margin at 28.7% compared to 29.0% last year, down 30 basis points. We're encouraged by the steady progress on this line, and over the past few periods, we expect and we expect our fourth quarter gross margin to hold at no less than our rate for the fourth quarter last year.
Going forward, we would expect to show gradual improvement in our gross margins in 2012. To accomplish this goal, we'll continue to execute our ongoing buy and sell side initiatives to reduce supply chain costs, increased distribution efficiencies and maximize pricing potential. These initiatives are necessary to account the impact of factors such as competitive pricing pressures, changes in product mix and a growing mix of sales to national accounts in most of our businesses, which generally come to lower margin, but higher sales volumes. As we work towards further improving our gross margin, we'll also continue to focus on our cost-saving initiatives and overall improvement in operating expenses.
For the year, our cumulative pricing through 9 months, which represents supply increases to us was plus 2.4% in Automotive, 3.3% increase in Industrial, plus 1.6% in Office Products and plus 4.8% in Electrical. 
Turning to SG&A. Expenses are $701 million were up 9.5% from $641 million for the same period in 2010, and as a percent of sales improved by 40 basis points to 21.4% versus 21.7% last year. For the 9 months in 2011, SG&A stands at $2.0 billion, a 9.3% increase from the same period in 2010 and at 21.5% of sales, which is a 60 basis point improvement from 22.1% of sales last year. We're encouraged by the continued improvement in our expenses as a percentage of sales, and we attribute this progress to the combined benefits of greater leverage associated with our sales growth and ongoing measures to control costs.
In addition to the favorable impact of prior year expense reduction initiatives, which included a 12% headcount reduction in '08 and '09, our ongoing cost initiatives have produced further savings of approximately $30 million through September this year. We've also added back just 3% of our labor force, including acquisitions since the beginning of 2010. These initiatives continue to positively impact our costs in several areas including freight, utilities, warehouse and infrastructure cost. And in the current period serve to partially offset a $6 million expense associated with our third quarter retirement plan valuation adjustment, which we had not anticipated at the time of our last earnings call. We're pleased with our progress in effectively controlling costs thus far in 2011, and our management team remains focused in this area. Tightly managing our expenses remains a top priority, and we'll continue to assess the proper cost structure of our businesses as revenue growth continues. 
Now I'll discussed the segment results. For the quarter, Automotive had revenue in the third quarter of $1,611,300,000 that was up 9%. It had operating profit $141.2 million, up 14%. So nice operating profit margin expansion from 8.4% to 8.8%. The Industrial Group for the quarter had revenue of $1,089,800,000, up 18% and our operating profit is $97.2 million, up 33% so very strong margin expansion from 7.9% to 8.9%. Office Products had revenue in the quarter $447.3 million, that's up 3%. Operating profit of $27.2 million, up 2% with margin staying flat at 6.1%. The Electrical Group had revenue in the quarter $143.3 million, up 22%. Operating profit $11.1 million, up 33%. So nice margin expansion from 7.2% in the third quarter last year to 7.8% third quarter this year. 
Looking at sales by segment. For the full 9 months, automotive had revenue of $4,601,300,000, that represents 49% of the total. That's up 9%, and it had operating profit of $377.9 million, up 11.5%. So margins expanded 20 basis points to 8.2%. Industrial Group had revenue for the 9 months $3,140,900,000 representing 33% of the total and that's up 20.5%. With the operating profit $248.5 million, up 37%. So again, strong margin expansion for the 9 months, as well as the third quarter going from 7.0% to 7.9%. 
Office Products had revenue for the 9 months $1,298,000,000. That represents 14% of the total, up 4% with operating profit of $96.0 million, up 2.5%. So margins down slightly from 7.5% to 7.4%. The Electrical Group had revenue for the 9 months of $420.0 million. That's 4% of the total, up 29.5% with operating profit $30.4 million, up 37%. Again, nice margin expansion from 6.8% to 7.2% of revenue. 
So on a consolidated basis, total operating profit increased by 19% in the third quarter. Operating profit margin improved 50 basis points to 8.4% from 7.9% in the third quarter 2010.
For the 9 months, total operating profit increased 18%, and operating margin of 8.8% is up 40 basis points from last year. Now this is solid progress for both the quarter and the year, driven by the improved expense leverage associated with our sales growth and our cost management efforts noted earlier. 
We had net interest expense of $6.2 million and $19.0 million for the third quarter and 9 months, respectively, which is down slightly from 2010. We continue to expect our net interest for the full year to be approximately $25 million to $26 million.
The other category, which includes corporate expense, amortization of intangibles and noncontrolling interest was a $23.4 million expense in the quarter and is $53.2 million for the 9 months through September. This quarter's expenses up approximately $10.5 million from the third quarter last year and primarily reflects the difference in a $3 million favorable retirement plan valuation adjustment recorded in 2010 and a $6 million expense recorded in the third quarter this year as mentioned earlier.
With the exception of this line item, the expenses in other are relatively in line with last year subject to slight increases in expenses like incentive-based comps, such as bonuses and stock options. We currently project the total other category to be approximately $60 million for the full year. 
Tax rate for the quarter was approximately 38.6% compared to 38.0% for the third quarter in 2010. Increase in the rate was due to the nondeductible status of the retirement plan adjustment just discussed.
For the 9 months, our 36.8% effective tax rate compares favorably to the 38.0% for the same period last year, with the decrease in the rate due to the favorable adjustment in the first quarter of this year associated with the expiration of the stature of limitation related to international taxes. We expect the tax rate for the full year in 2011 to be in the range of 36.5% to 37%.
Net income for the quarter, $151.8 million, was up 15%. EPS, a record $0.97 compared to $0.83 last year, up 17%. For the year, net income is $430.2 million, up 21%. EPS $2.72 compared to $2.25 in the prior year, which is also up 21%. 
Now let's touch base on a few key balance sheet items. Cash at September 30 of $535 million is up slightly from September 30 last year and remains strong. We built our cash position from increased earnings, effective asset management and cost reductions, and we continue to use our cash to fund several ongoing priorities such as the increase in the dividend, capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. We'll discuss each of these areas in more detail later. 
We'd also add that in the third quarter, we used $43 million in cash to fund our pension plan, which is required from time to time. We expect to continue to generate consistently strong cash flows through the balance of the year.
Accounts receivable, $1.53 billion, increased 10% from September 30, 2010, on an 11% increase in sales for the third quarter. This is an improvement from where we were last quarter and is in line with our company goal of growing receivables at a rate less than revenue growth. So good to see some progress in this area, and we also remain very satisfied with the quality of our receivables. 
Inventory at 9/30 was $2.25 billion, up 1% from December 31, 2010, and up 3% or $68 million from September 30 last year. In consideration of our double-digit sales growth, we believe the management team continues to manage this key investment very well, and we remain focused on further improving our inventory results over the balance of 2011.
We improved our accounts payable position again this quarter with trade payables increase in the $1.59 billion, up 16% from September 30 in the prior year. Our progress in trade payables primarily reflects the impact of increased inventory purchases associated with our higher sales volume, as well as extended payment terms and other payable initiatives with our vendors. With the improvement in our accounts payable position, our DPO continues to improve as well, and we remain very pleased with the positive direction of this working capital account.
Working capital of $2.4 billion at September 30 is down 10% from last year and for comparison purposes, when we add back the $250 million current portion of debt at September 30, 2011, working capital is basically unchanged from September 30 of last year. We're encouraged with our ongoing progress in managing working capital and our balance sheet remains in excellent condition.
Total debt at September 30 remains unchanged at $500 million. The first $250 million credit facility matures in November this year and is accounted for in current liabilities. We have a new signed agreement extending this debt at 3.35% interest rate for another 5 years, and we'll reclassify the debt to long term upon funding in the fourth quarter. Second, $250 million in debt is due in November 2013. Total debt to total capitalization at September 30 were 14.7%, and we're comfortable with our capital structure at this time.
While our several consecutive years of strong cash flow, we expect to generate strong cash flows for the full year and continue to estimate cash from operations of approximately $700 million for the year. At this level, free cash flow after deducting capital expenditures and dividends should be more than $300 million, which is in line with last year. We are pleased with the continued strength of our cash flows and remain committed to our ongoing priorities for the use of the cash.
As noted before, these priorities are our first to dividend, which we paid every year since going public in 1948 and raised for 55 consecutive years. Our 2011 annual dividend of $1.80 per share represents a 10% increase from $1.64 in 2010 and represents a payout of approximately 60% of our 2010 earnings per share. Currently, the dividend is yielding approximately 3.3% and historically, had ranged from 3% to 4%. Additional priorities for cash include the ongoing reinvestment in each of the 4 businesses, strategic acquisitions where appropriate and share repurchases.
Our investment and capital expenditures was $22.2 million for the third quarter, down from $31.0 million invested in the third quarter last year. For the 9 months, CapEx is up slightly to $63.9 million for 2011 compared to $59.0 million in 2010. We continue to expect our CapEx spending to be in a range of $100 million to $110 million for the full year with the vast majority of these investments weighted toward productivity and enhancement projects, primarily in technology.
Depreciation and amortization $21.5 million in the quarter and is $66.9 million for the 9 months, which is in line with the same periods in 2010. We expect D&A to hold relatively constant with last year at approximately $90 million for the full year.
Strategic acquisitions continue to be an ongoing and important use of cash and are integral to our growth plans for the company. In the third quarter, our Electrical business completed the Cobra Wire & Cable acquisition on September 1 and our Industrial unit made a small acquisition in July. Combined with the Industrial's 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, annual revenues for the acquired companies add to approximately $125 million, and as Tom covered earlier, we also recently announced our investment in Exego, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter. So we continue to find opportunities to do acquisition and remain disciplined in our approach to this element of our growth strategy. We're excited about the growth potential of a large investments such as Exego, but we will continue to primarily target those bolt-on types of acquisitions with annual revenues in the $25 million to $150 million range.
In the third quarter of 2011, we used our cash to repurchase approximately 1.2 million shares of our company's stock on the company's share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we purchased approximately 2.4 million shares and have another 13.5 million shares authorized and available for repurchase. We have no set pattern for these repurchases, but we expect to remain active in the program, as we continue to believe that our stock is an attractive investment and combined with the dividend provides the best return to our shareholders.
We're very pleased with our third quarter operating results and must thank all of our dedicated GPC associates for doing such a great job. We achieved our goals through their hard work, and we just can't say enough about their commitment to the success of Genuine Parts Company. As always, we also want to thank our customers and suppliers. We sincerely appreciate their continued support. Looking ahead, we remain optimistic in our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2011 and look forward to reporting continued progress in growing our sales and earnings and further improving our margins and working capital position. We remain committed to producing steady and consistent growth for the company, and we believe we have the right people and the right strategy to do this. 
As always, we'll continue to support our growth plans with strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet further maximizing our return to shareholders. Tom?"

Well, that pretty much concludes our review of the third quarter and 9-month results. And with sales up 12% year-to-date and earnings per share up 21%, we think that our folks have done a good job, thus far in 2011. 
Now as far as the outlook for the final quarter of the year, we continue to feel good about our overall prospects. The underlying fundamentals in the Automotive aftermarket remain generally favorable, and gasoline prices have moderated somewhat over the past few weeks.
Industrial production, capacity utilization and the purchasing managers index are each at healthy levels, creating a favorable end market climate for our Industrial and Electrical, Electronic businesses. The outlier for us is the Office Product segment, where we anticipate continued sluggish demand across the industry for a while yet. So the external conditions remain favorable in 3 of our 4 business segments currently. However, at the same time, we are aware of the overall uncertainty in the outlook for the general economic climate and its potential impact on end market demand. 
With all of that said, our fourth quarter expectations are for our Automotive operations to be up 7% to 9%, Industrial and Electrical to be up 10% to 12% each, Office Products to be up 2% to 4%. And this would combine for a 7% to 9% increase for GPC for the fourth quarter and will put us up 11% to 12% for the year. And with revenue increases in this range, we would expect earnings per share to be $3.51 to $3.55 for the full year, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $3.40 to $3.50, and it would put us up 17% to 18% for the year. 
From our perspective, an 11% to 12% revenue increase this year on top of last year's 11% increase and an EPS increase of 17% to 18% this year following last year's 20% improvement would represent another good performance from the GPC team. And as said earlier, we're proud of the job that they're doing. 
At this point, we'd like to try to answer any questions that you may have, and we'll turn the call back over to Brooke."

And then we also see the larger growth rates potentially in some of the Southeast Asian markets that Exego probably would be the right platform to use for expansion into those markets. This does not at all signal any less confidence than what we've had in our North American business, and we'll continue to, I think, do the kind of job that we have been doing. In fact, it's a vote of confidence for our Automotive management team that we feel that we can make this move and at the same time, count on our North American team to continue to do the good job they've been doing."

And just hoping that you could share some insight, Tom, when you go back to Q3 and Q4 of '08, it seems like a challenge where at that time in Q3, Industrial is running up 7 but then went flat in the fourth quarter and there's obviously some unique things that happened then.

We don't see it in the data, and we don't see it in the marketplace. We started to see it in the data in the fourth quarter of '08, and we certainly were experiencing it in the marketplace. And it was, as I recall, the second week on October of 2008 that we saw a dramatic drop off in demand in the Industrial side. We don't see anything that would indicate that, that type of drop off is out there. And in fact, we don't see a drop-off at this point. So our sense is that we should be performing at reasonable levels at least through the end of this year and on into the early part of next year, and then we'll just have to moderate what's going on and see how we react to whatever may happen, but there's no indication of a slowdown at this point."

So they're going to be looking for the lowest viable cost for any of the product that they might buy from our Automotive business for sure, the heavy duty side of it as well with some of the fleets that they run. So we can see some downward pressure there. At the same time, there's some significant reductions in headcount that are being forced upon those customer sets, some of which may come in areas that we deal with, that might, in fact, moderate some of the downward pressure and maybe we can provide more service or better value for them rather than them doing it themselves. The offset is that they're reducing headcount across their offices as well, and that has an impact on our customer base. We don't sell to any of these people directly, but our customer set does, and demands for them would be off some. So I think it will be perhaps neutral for us on the Automotive side, but somewhat negative on the Office Products side."
