Good morning, everyone. We have just completed a good quarter, which rakes up another successful year for the company despite the challenges associated with healthcare reform in the U.S. and economic pressures in Europe.
In previous calls and meetings we, from Bristol-Myers Squibb, talked a lot than any other company of U.S. healthcare reform and European prices. I think that at this point, we should take these two factors for granted and move forward. Today, it's more important to discuss how our achievements in 2010 position the company well for the longer term growth. Specifically, 2010 was a groundbreaking year with respect to clinical data, a real testament to our biopharma strategy and our exclusive focus on pharmaceuticals.
We presented survival data on ipilimumab metastatic melanoma. The study was stopped early efficacy. The profile of dapagliflozin continues to emerge, and we shared encouraging data on our portfolio.
We also made significant progress on our string-of-pearls initiative. Most importantly, we acquired ZymoGenetics while we continue to integrate. We remain focused on increasing shareholder value. We increased our dividend for the second consecutive year. We initiated a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion in common stock. We bought back debt, and we still ended the year with $10 billion in cash.
You may have also noticed that we restructured our foreign legal entities, and this resulted in more than 85% of our cash now being held in the United States. Charlie will talk more about that.
With respect to manufacturing, we delivered on our optimization plan and continued to improve our costs while we faced some challenges, we take very seriously the quality issues raised in the warning letter and the voluntary AVALIDE recall. I personally have devoted a significant amount of time to ensure understanding of what happened, and that we take all necessary actions to remediate the issues also by assessment from third-party quality consulting experts. In fact, our plant in Manati is inspection-ready, and we're looking forward to ranges that. 
Let me turn to some highlights from the fourth quarter.
We have good sales growth in some of our key brands, which are important to our future growth, including SPRYCEL, ORENCIA, and the ONGLYZA franchise. We continue to have positive news on our pipeline. We received regulatory approval for SPRYCEL for use in stress-line testing in the U.S. and Europe and for in the U.S. We completed key regulatory commission. We submitted for regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. The European Medicines Agency has already validated our submission there, and we are waiting acceptance of the submission in the U.S.
In 2011, we will build on the momentum created in 2010, as we continue to position our company for long-term success as a focused, differentiated biopharma company. There are several upcoming key events that will help shape our future. The first milestone is regulatory action on our filing for ipilimumab, as well as first-line data, both expected during the first quarter. We are very excited about this product, and we are ready to launch it.
Between 2011 and 2012, we anticipated up to five possible new product approvals. In addition to ipilimumab, the other four for organ transplantation, ORENCIA, subcutaneous formulation, dapagliflozin for diabetes and our anticoagulant. For based on discussions with the FDA and in agreement with Pfizer, we expect to submit the studies together in the U.S., which will cover the broader spectrum of patients in one single file. We expect to have top line data on our in the second quarter of this year and submit in the U.S. and Europe for Q4. 
In 2011, we are also anticipating four significant Phase III transitions in hepatitis C, Alzheimer's disease and oncology. And finally, 2011, we expect strong sales for brands and indications, including and SPRYCEL, all this adapter our 2011 guidance that you have seen in the press release and that Charlie will review.
In the release, we have also reaffirmed our 2013 guidance. Over the past few weeks, we have heard questions for many of you about our earnings in 2013, given some of the external challenges. Well, we have listened and have decided to review our longer term plan, and we are reaffirming 2013 minimum non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.95. Our earnings release contains important information regarding our assumptions underlying this guidance.
Taken together, 2010 was a good year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very happy with the progress we have made over the past year, strategically and financially, and feel very confident about our future. Most importantly, we have continued to strengthen our base and positioned ourselves for significant growth over the next few years, particularly for 2013 and beyond. Our sales are up. Our financials are strong, and our pipeline is robust. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have another solid quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management was offset by a higher effective tax rate compared to Q4 2009. Included in",942,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did have another solid quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management was offset by a higher effective tax rate compared to Q4 2009. Included in our fourth quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. 
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our fourth quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.
We reported fourth quarter net sales from continuing operations of $5.1 billion, up 2% compared to last year. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.5% negative impact on net sales in the quarter, and incremental EU measures had a negative impact of under 1%. Volume was up 2%.
As I look at the fourth quarter sales performance, I am encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes dark look, and SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. Hepatitis B was up 25%, including 28% growth internationally. Full year sales for BARACLUDE were $931 million, with over 80% of our business outside the U.S. The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $73 million. Compared to the third quarter, sequentially our business was up over 40% in the U.S. and doubled internationally. We are in the process of launching and expected it to be a key component of the franchise growth. SPRYCEL was up 42% in the quarter. And as you know, we recently received the first-line indication in both the U.S. and Europe. We believe this represents a meaningful long-term opportunity and are off to a good start.
ORENCIA was up 20% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biological choice. At the same time, we are preparing for potential launch of our subcu formulation in the U.S. later this year. 
The AVAPRO AVALIDE franchise was down 26% in the quarter. This includes the impact of the AVALIDE recall and supply interruption in supply markets, the U.S. Mexico Canada, Puerto Rico and Argentina. AVALIDE net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $60 million in the quarter. Full year AVALIDE sales in the affected markets were $355 million in 2010. As we move into 2011, resupply to the market is not certain. And therefore, we are assuming a meaningful impact from an extended supply interruption.
Lastly, our mature brands declined 14% or $125 million compared to last year. Divestitures in and rationalization of our nine strategic mature brands portfolio represents approximately 50% of the decline. 
The full year impact from U.S. healthcare reform in 2010 was about $0.10. Our estimated incremental impact for 2011 is approximately $0.15. This reflects the annualization of Managed Medicaid, expected PHS expansion and the new impact from both part be that whole coverage and the pharma fee. As a reminder, we share in part by the sales and pharmacy impact with our partners.
Now let me give you just a couple of comments from the rest of our P&L. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 19% to $271 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle, and sharing of certain identify SPRYCEL and expenses. This was partially offset by increased investment spend in new products and new indications.
Effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 25.7% in the fourth quarter. The tax rate reflects the full year impact of the R&D tax credit, which was partially offset due to earnings mix between high- and low-tax jurisdictions. Our full year non-GAAP rate was 23.6%, right in the middle of our 2010 guidance range.
As Lamberto mentioned, we restructured certain of our foreign legal entities, resulting in 85% of our $10 billion in cash and marketable securities now being held in the U.S. There was an associated $207 million tax charge which is included as a specified tax item. 
Let me turn to guidance. We have issued 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. I'll cover our non-GAAP line item guidance. We expect sales growth to be in the low mid-single digits. This includes the impact from U.S. healthcare reform, expected EU pricing pressure, another step down in our contractual share of and the AVALIDE supply issue I mentioned earlier. We expect the incremental sales impact from Medicare Part D coverage gap to be approximately $250 million. Gross margin percent should be consistent with 2010. Advertising promotion is expected to decrease in the mid-high single-digit range. This reflects continued life cycle management of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, partially offset by investments in new products and indications.
MS&A is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. This includes the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform pharmacy expected to be approximately $250 million. Excluding this fee, MS&A should be roughly flat.
R&D is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. This includes the impact from ZymoGenetics and investments across our portfolio. We expect our tax rate to be between 25% to 26%. The pharmacy adds approximately 1% in the tax rate. Additionally, our expected change in earnings mix will also drive our rate higher. As in past years, we are assuming a few tax discrete items in 2011, which will cost some variability in our quarterly rate based on timing.
Finally, we have also confirmed our 2013 non-GAAP floor guidance of $1.95. Moving forward, we do not plan on updating our long-term guidance on a quarterly basis and you should expect updates to 2013 annually in July, consistent with our longer-term planning cycle. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

It's impossible to predict with confidence an exact date, but we are on track for approval for that PDUFA date. And we are working through our medical group, with our commercial colleagues, so that we are properly prepared for launch. And Tony will a little bit more about that. You has some comments about life expectancy. And part of my confidence comes not only from the very important Phase II studies and the result of '20 and the clear survival benefits, but also because of how long '24, the front line study has taken. The median age of the median survival time period for the group that is currently being followed, which is blinded. It exceeds three years. And we think this is quite remarkable. As you know, the standard of care predicts a 75% mortality rate in the first year and less than a 14% survival rate at year two. And so our statistics show us that we are adequately powered. We are close to achieving the required number of events, and I have great confidence that this study will be concluded in the first quarter.  I do not believe we need to submit any more study information to work with the FDA. Our focus is on the adequate communication of the unusual mechanism, although unit mechanism and the safety, to ensure proper it use in other for patients to achieve maximum survival benefit. And the communication of the results, our goal will be to present at the sign take form hopefully at ASCO this year."

And that's our agreed-upon plan with the agency, and it's also the analysis we believe all regulatory authorities want to see. And also, the other question that we get a lot is the time and therapeutic range, the I&R for warfarin in the study,  because you want to be monitoring this closely to have a very good comparison with well-controlled patients to the extent possible. We are monitoring this very closely in the trial. We believe if a proportion of warfarin patients in the therapeutic range will be closer to what was seen in the rely trial, that's the mid-60s rather than the rocket trial, which was under 60%."

I believe IP being manufactured out of that facility with a PDUFA date of March 26. Does that inspection have to occur before that in order for the FDA to approve the product?

I think that as I said in my comments before, John, we are very what we delivered in terms of optimization plan of our manufacturing network and improvement of our costs. But we also take in very seriously a couple of quality issues that we're raised in that warning letter at Manati that doesn't affect ipilimumab and the. But personally spent a lot of time understand. And based on the assessment regulatory from my people but also by third-party quality consulting experts, I believe that we do not have systemic issues manufacturing facility. As I said before and I think Charlie we are ready for inspection in Manatee. And in fact, we are waiting for that inspection. You're asking about the commercial model. This is a very important question. We have two important factors, the evolution of the market environment and the number of products that we are going to launch if we get an approval as we hope. We have devoted a lot of time at modifying things according to the requirement for the marketplace. I think we are very ready for the launch of ipilimumab. But as Tony was saying before, we have moved to a totally different model than one we have used in the past. We have tested a lot of components of that model with existing products, so we feel very confident that we have a global approach to the different people involved in dealing with ipilimumab from prescribers to nurses to reimbursement specialists to patients in a very innovative way. And the same is happening for all our other launches are expected launches. So a lot in technology, we are based technology, a lot we've invested in creating the right file that will allow us to be more effective in targeting our promotion. And the technology is also helping us to make the work of our reps better, more focused, more targeted and support that we've worked peer-to-peer, web-based interactions and giving access to relevant information to all our stakeholders when they want and in the format that is more convenient to them."

We will see the first phase to be beta sometime this year. And we'll be able to make some decisions about its course forward in its evolving profile. To that group of five, which can potentially be approved, by the end of '12, beginning this year, I would add an important catalytic event of subcu. At the same time, there are four compounds we hoped to potentially transition to Phase III this year. I am very sure elotuzumab will go into Phase III for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It's an antibiotic directed to a very specific cellular protein on myeloma cells, and we've had very ported response and insights on how to improve current regimen. And we have to Hepatitis C programs that I expect the transition to Phase III, One is our novel first-in-class. and one is our potentially superior interferon interferon lambda. We have a lot of clinical data will be discussing the scientific forms on our whole portfolio, both at the meetings. The fist in April and the second in November. And this data will give insights to the doses that we will be taking in to Phase III and we'll be talking about our Phase III strategy later in the year. The one program that we are waiting for more Phase II data on before a decision of transition is our gamma secretase and Alzheimer's. We believe we have a more specific inhibitor in this pathway than predecessors. We want some confirmatory data. We are studying both pre-dementia, as well as mild to moderate.

In the setting of a very significant survival of to pretreated patients whether there is no approved therapy. So I'm pleased with the progress so far, but I don't have any more than that to report in Europe. And with regard to apixaban, what the key message is today that instead of doing this in two stages, a narrower indication with AVERROES, given the proximity of ARISTOTLE, and quite honestly the complexities that we could imagine with ensuring appropriate use which just that indication and the need to really see the comparability as a field change with warfarin, we feel, with Pfizer and after consultation with the FDA, that we have a much, much stronger application waiting to filed by the end of Q3, early Q4 for the broadest possible opportunity. In both cases, we have included AVERROES, which may entitle one to review on a priority basis, but that's a decision that the FDA will make when they look at the file, look at the field and give us a filing decision and a categorization decision. I believe this is an area of unmet medical need, and we'll make those cases. With regard to the competitor, I do understand the biomarker possibilities. We don't have data that really has allowed us to pick out a very favorable biomarker,  but we're constantly searching for this. We have a biomarker study. And we're looking at ways to predict. I will make a very important point though. And most of our outside advisers have strongly urged that, although we're going to do biomarker work in parallel, the most important thing that we can do is to add combinations of drugs, existing and novel target agents, to try to increase the small but significant number of patients that have a remarkable durable response. The key to this drug is durability. We want to maximize the efficacy by combination therapy, use it said in early lines, different tumor types, as well as look for biomarker results."

Good morning, everyone. We have just completed a good quarter, which wraps up another successful year for the company despite the challenges associated with healthcare reform in the U.S. and economic pressures in Europe.
In previous calls and meetings we, from Bristol-Myers Squibb, talked a lot than any other company of U.S. healthcare reform and European prices. I think that at this point, we should take these two factors for granted and move forward. Today, it is more important to describe how our achievements in 2010 have helped to position the company well for the longer-term growth. Specifically, 2010 was a groundbreaking year with respect to clinical data, a real testament to our biopharma strategy and our exclusive focus on pharmaceuticals.
We presented overall survival data on ipilimumab in second-line metastatic melanoma. The AVERROES study was stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. The attractive profile of dapagliflozin continues to emerge, and we shared encouraging data on our Hepatitis C portfolio.
We also made significant progress on our String of Pearls initiative. Most importantly, we acquired ZymoGenetics while we continue to integrate Medarex. We remain focused on increasing shareholder value. We increased our dividend for the second consecutive year. We initiated a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion in common stock. We bought back debt, and we still ended the year with $10 billion in cash.
You may have also noticed that we restructured our foreign legal entities, and this resulted in more than 85% of our cash now being held in the United States. Charlie will talk more about that.
With respect to manufacturing, we delivered on our optimization plan and continued to improve our costs. While we faced some challenges, we take very seriously the quality issues raised in the Manati warning letter and the voluntary AVALIDE recall. I personally have devoted a significant amount of time to ensure understanding of what happened, and that we take all necessary actions to remediate the issues [ph] also by assessment from third-party quality consulting experts. In fact, our plant in Manati is inspection-ready, and we're looking forward to our inspection. 
Let me turn to some highlights from the fourth quarter.
We have good sales growth in some of our key brands, which are important to our future growth, including SPRYCEL, ORENCIA, BARACLUDE and the ONGLYZA franchise. We continue to have positive news on our pipeline. We received regulatory approval for SPRYCEL for use in a stress-line testing in the U.S. and Europe and for KOMBIGLYZE in the U.S. We completed key regulatory submissions. We submitted dapagliflozin for regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. The European Medicines Agency has already validated our submission there, and we are waiting acceptance of the submission in the U.S.
In 2011, we will build on the momentum created in 2010, as we continue to position our company for long-term success as a focused, differentiated biopharma company. There are several upcoming key events that will help shape our future. The first milestone is regulatory action on our filing for ipilimumab, as well as first-line data, both expected during the first quarter. We are very excited about this product, and we are ready to launch it.
Between 2011 and 2012, we anticipated up to five possible new product approvals. In addition to ipilimumab, the other four are belatacept for organ transplantation, ORENCIA in a subcutaneous formulation, dapagliflozin for diabetes and apixaban, our anticoagulant. For apixaban, based on discussions with the FDA and in agreement with Pfizer, we expect to submit the AVERROES and ARISTOTLE studies together in the U.S., which will cover the broad spectrum of patients in one single file. We expect to have top line data on ARISTOTLE in the second quarter of this year and submit in the U.S. and Europe either in late Q3 or Q4. 
In 2011, we are also anticipating four significant Phase III transitions in hepatitis C, Alzheimer's disease and oncology. And finally, in 2011, we expect strong sales trend for new brands and indications, including KOMBIGLYZE and SPRYCEL, all this adds up to our 2011 guidance that you have seen in the press release and that Charlie will review.
In the release, we have also reaffirmed our 2013 guidance. Over the past few weeks, we have heard questions for many of you about our earnings in 2013, given some of the external challenges. Well, we have listened and have decided to review our longer-term plan, and we are reaffirming 2013 minimum non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.95. Our earnings release contains important information regarding our assumptions underlying this guidance.
Taken together, 2010 was a good year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very happy with the progress we have made over the past year, strategically and financially, and feel very confident about our future. Most importantly, we have continued to strengthen our base and positioned ourselves for significant growth over the next few years, particularly for 2013 and beyond. Our sales are up. Our financials are strong, and our pipeline is robust. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have another solid quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management was offset by a higher effective tax rate compared to Q4 2009. Included in",954,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did have another solid quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management was offset by a higher effective tax rate compared to Q4 2009. Included in our fourth quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. 
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our fourth quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.
We reported fourth quarter net sales from continuing operations of $5.1 billion, up 2% compared to last year. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.5% negative impact on net sales in the quarter, and incremental EU measures had a negative impact of under 1%. Volume was up 2%.
As I look at the fourth quarter sales performance, I am encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. BARACLUDE, our treatment for Hepatitis B was up 25%, including 28% growth internationally. Full year sales for BARACLUDE were $931 million, with over 80% of our business outside the U.S. The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $73 million. Compared to the third quarter, sequentially our business was up over 40% in the U.S. and doubled internationally. We are in the process of launching KOMBIGLYZE and expect it to be a key component of the franchise growth. SPRYCEL was up 42% in the quarter. And as you know, we recently received the first-line indication in both the U.S. and Europe. We believe this represents a meaningful long-term opportunity and are off to a good start.
ORENCIA was up 20% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice. At the same time, we are preparing for the potential launch of our subcu [subcutaneous] formulation in the U.S. later this year. 
The AVAPRO AVALIDE franchise was down 26% in the quarter. This includes the impact of the AVALIDE recall and supply interruption in five markets, the U.S. Mexico Canada, Puerto Rico and Argentina. AVALIDE net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $60 million in the quarter. Full year AVALIDE sales in the affected markets were $355 million in 2010. As we move into 2011, resupply to the market is not certain. And therefore, we are assuming a meaningful impact from an extended supply interruption.
Lastly, our mature brands declined 14% or $125 million compared to last year. Divestitures in and rationalization of our non-strategic mature brands portfolio represents approximately 50% of the decline. 
The full year impact from U.S. healthcare reform in 2010 was about $0.10. Our estimated incremental impact for 2011 is approximately $0.15. This reflects the annualization of managed Medicaid, expected PHS expansion and the new impact from both Part D Donut Hole coverage and the pharma fee. As a reminder, we share in part both the sales and pharma fee impact with our partners.
Now let me give you just a couple of comments from the rest of our P&L. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 19% to $271 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle, and to its sharing of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications.
The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 25.7% in the fourth quarter. The tax rate reflects the full year impact of the R&D tax credit, which was partially offset due to earnings mix between high- and low-tax jurisdictions. Our full year non-GAAP rate was 23.6%, right in the middle of our 2010 guidance range.
As Lamberto mentioned, we restructured certain of our foreign legal entities, resulting in 85% of our $10 billion in cash and marketable securities now being held in the U.S. There was an associated $207 million tax charge, which is included as a specified tax item. 
Let me turn to guidance. We have issued 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. I'll cover our non-GAAP line-item guidance. We expect sales growth to be in the low mid-single digits. This includes the impact from U.S. healthcare reform, expected EU pricing pressure, another step down in our contractual share of ABILIFY and the AVALIDE supply issue I mentioned earlier. We expect the incremental sales impact from Medicare Part D coverage gap to be approximately $250 million. Gross margin percent should be consistent with 2010. Advertising promotion is expected to decrease in the mid-high single-digit range. This reflects continued life cycle management of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, partially offset by investments in new products and indications.
MS&A is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. This includes the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform pharma fee expected to be approximately $250 million. Excluding this fee, MS&A should be roughly flat.
R&D is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. This includes the impact from ZymoGenetics and investments across our portfolio. We expect our tax rate to be between 25% to 26%. The pharma fee adds approximately 1% to the tax rate. Additionally, our expected change in earnings mix will also drive our rate higher. As in past years, we are assuming a few tax discrete items in 2011, which will cost some variability in our quarterly rate based on timing.
Finally, we have also confirmed our 2013 non-GAAP floor guidance of $1.95. Moving forward, we do not plan on updating our long-term guidance on a quarterly basis and you should expect updates to 2013 annually in July, consistent with our longer-term planning cycle. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

Could you just reiterate for us whether or not this 2013 guidance now incorporates European austerity measures, and obviously what the offsets are to that? And then I have some questions for Elliott on ipilimumab. First, just curious to know your conviction level that FDA will approve second-line, if front-line data is not available. And secondly, for the front-line study, just curious to know if you have a sense of what the life expectancy of the control arm is. The six-plus months or so is from the Genasense trial which is now about five years old. And since then, the standard of care has probably improved. And if that is the case, is the trial adequately powered to detect a difference in your opinion?

And our first approval, and we do expect this year in metastatic melanoma in pretreated patients, I can say that we are actively engaged with the agency in all the types of activity as you would imagine, that would be moving towards an approval by our PDUFA date, in March 36. It's impossible to predict with confidence an exact date, but we are on track for approval for that PDUFA date. And we are working through our medical group, with our commercial colleagues, so that we are properly prepared for launch. And Tony will say a little bit more about that. You have some comments about life expectancy. And part of my confidence comes not only from the very important Phase II studies and the result of '20 and the clear survival benefits, but also because of how long '24, the front line study has taken. The median age of the median survival time period for the group that is currently being followed, which is blinded, exceeds three years. And we think this is quite remarkable. As you know, the standard of care predicts a 75% mortality rate in the first year and less than a 14% survival rate at year two. And so our statistics show us that we are adequately powered. We are close to achieving the required number of events, and I have great confidence that this study will be concluded in the first quarter.  I do not believe we need to submit any more study information to work with the FDA. Our focus is on the adequate communication of the unusual mechanism, though unit mechanism and the safety, to ensure proper it use in other for patients to achieve maximum survival benefit. And the communication of the results, our goal will be to present at the sign take form hopefully at ASCO this year."

We are pleased to be at the pioneering edge of this and have, from the beginning, committed to a differentiated product that meets the medical need of powerful efficacy, with better safety and tolerability and ease-of-use than Coumadin. And as the data has emerged from our competition, we are gratified to see the market uptake and the excitement about the whole new class. And we continue to see a need for the differentiation that we have aimed from the beginning of our development program, powerful efficacy as you saw in AVERROES, a very attractive major bleeding profile. And when we see ARISTOTLE, what we must look for is comparability to Coumadin and hopefully superiority in bleeding, safety and tolerability. This program is unique and including studying of patients that are intolerant or unable to take warfarin and in going for the exact benefit risk of powerful efficacy with improved safety.

And that's our agreed-upon plan with the agency, and it's also the analysis we believe all regulatory authorities want to see. And also, the other question that we get a lot is the time and therapeutic range, the INR for warfarin in the study,  because you want to be monitoring this closely to have a very good comparison with well-controlled patients on Coumadin to the extent possible. We are monitoring this very closely in the trial. And we believe that as the proportion of warfarin patients in the therapeutic range will be closer to what was seen in the RE-LY trial. That's the mid-60s rather than the ROCKET trial, which was under 60%."

One thing that has obviously been challenging has been the commercial model. You are in the cost of launching five new assets. Can you help me understand how Bristol is adapting this commercial infrastructure to accommodate the assets that you're about to launch? And how should we be thinking about launch curves of some of these assets? Second question just has to do with if ipilimumab, I thought you had indicated there was an inspection that had to occur, in the Manati facility. I believe ipi [ipilimumab] being manufactured out of that facility, you have a PDUFA date of March 26. Does that inspection have to occur before that in order for the FDA to approve the product? Or is that not linked or tied to it? And then last question just has to do with the four assets, Elliott, that you'll put into Phase III development. Can you just give some commentary around elotuzumab and its rank within those four assets in terms how you allocate assets across those four assets going forward?"

So ipi and Manati are totally disconnected. I probably can take this as an opportunity to make a couple of comments about again about our manufacturing. I think that, as I said in my comments before, John, we are very happy at what we delivered in terms of optimization plan of our manufacturing network and improvement of our costs. But we also take in very seriously a couple of quality issues that were raised in that warning letter of Manati, that I believe doesn't affect ipilimumab and the AVALIDE recall sites. I personally spend a lot of time to understand what happened. And based on the assessment, because I also received not only from my people but also by third-party quality consulting experts, I believe that we do not have systemic issues with our manufacturing facility. As I said before, and I think Charlie repeat it, we are ready for inspection in Manati. And in fact, we are eagerly waiting for that inspection. You were asking about the commercial model. This is a very important question. We have two important factors, the evolution of the market environment and the number of products that we are going to launch if we get an approval as we hope. We have devoted a lot of time at modifying things according to the requirements of the marketplace. I think, we are very ready for the launch of ipilimumab. But as Tony was saying before, we have moved to a totally different model than the one we have used in the past. We have tested a lot of components of that model with existing products, so we feel very confident that we have a global approach to the different people involved in dealing with ipilimumab from prescribers to nurses to reimbursement specialists to patients in a very innovative way. And the same is happening for all our other launches or expected launches. So a lot we're investing in technology, a lot in base technology, a lot we've invested in creating the right files that will allow us to be more effective in targeting our promotion. And the technology is also helping us to make the work of our reps better, more focused, more targeted and support that work with peer-to-peer, web-based interactions and giving access to relevant information to all our stakeholders, when they want and in the format that is more convenient to them."

Our biologic in the treatment of multiple myeloma, which Lamberto mentioned, we will, I believe, transition into Phase III this year. I'm very excited about that. I just wanted to distinguish between the five drugs we're working very hard with to get approved by the end of '12 and at the same time sustain the Phase III pipeline by four transitions into Phase III, including elotuzumab. So the five that we're trying to get approved, we've been talking about ipilimumab, apixaban, dapagliflozin, belatacept and Brivanib. Of those, we've seen the Phase III data and are in regulatory discussions with all but Brivanib. Brivanib, we will see the first Phase III data sometime this year, and we'll be able to make some decisions about its course forward in and evolving profile. To that group of five, which can potentially be approved, by the end of '12, beginning this year, I would add an important catalytic event of ORENCIA subcu. At the same time, there are four compounds we hope to potentially transition to Phase III this year. I am very sure elotuzumab will go into Phase III for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It's an antibody that is directed to a very specific cellular protein on myeloma cells, and we've had very important response and insights on how to improve current regimen. And we have two Hepatitis C programs that I expect to transition to Phase III. One is our novel first-in-class 5A, and one is our potentially superior Interferon Lambda. We have a lot of clinical data we'll be discussing at scientific forums on our whole portfolio, both at EASL at the Liver meetings. The fist in April and the second in November. And this data will give insights to the doses that we will be taking in to Phase III and we'll be talking about our Phase III strategy later in the year. The one program that we are waiting for more Phase II data on before a decision of transition is our gamma secretase in Alzheimer's. We believe, we have a more specific inhibitor in this pathway than predecessors. We want some confirmatory data. We are studying both pre-dementia, as well as mild to moderate. And we'll be getting some data early part of the year and making some decisions hopefully, moving to Phase III by the end of the year."

We put in the press release specifically all the different items that go into R&D, so that you see, in addition to discovery, early clinical, you have late clinical support and support for marketed products. Those two last components form the numerator for the 30% to 40%. But in addition, we add in to the denominator, not only the research and early clinical, but also the Phase IV marketed supported products, some biologics work that supports the pipeline in manufacturing, the medical support for products that are in the market, as well as some very important aspects of -- well, I mentioned of the Phase IV that are done jointly in the region. That percentage is about the same as has been tracking, 30% to 40%, over the last several years.

In the setting of a very significant survival event in pretreated patients where there is no approved therapy. So I'm pleased with the progress so far, but I don't have any more than that to report in Europe. And with regard to apixaban, what the key message is today that instead of doing this in two stages, a narrower indication with AVERROES, given the proximity of ARISTOTLE, and quite honestly, the complexities that we could imagine with ensuring appropriate use with just that indication and the need to really see the comparability as a field of change with warfarin, we feel, with Pfizer and after consultation with the FDA, that we have a much stronger application waiting to file by the end of Q3, early Q4 for the broadest possible opportunity. In both cases, we have included AVERROES, which may entitle one to review on a priority basis, but that's a decision that the FDA will make when they look at the file, look at the field and give us a filing decision and a categorization decision. I believe this is an area of unmet medical need, and we'll make those cases. With regard to the competitor, I do understand the biomarker possibilities. We don't have data that really has allowed us to pick out a very favorable biomarker,  but we're constantly searching for this. We have a biomarker study. And we're looking at ways to predict. I will make a very important point though. And most of our outside advisers have strongly urged that, although we're going to do biomarker work in parallel, the most important thing that we can do is to add combinations of drugs, existing and novel target agents, to try to increase the small but significant number of patients that have a remarkable durable response. The key to this drug is durability. We want to maximize the efficacy by combination therapy, use it in early lines, different tumor types, as well as look for biomarker results."

Good morning, everyone. We have just completed a good quarter, which wraps up another successful year for the company despite the challenges associated with healthcare reform in the U.S. and economic pressures in Europe.
In previous calls and meetings we, from Bristol-Myers Squibb, talked a lot in area that other companies of U.S. healthcare reform and European prices. I think that at this point, we should take these two factors for granted and move forward. Today, it is more important to describe how our achievements in 2010 have helped to position the company well for the longer-term growth. Specifically, 2010 was a groundbreaking year with respect to clinical data, a real testament to our BioPharma strategy and our exclusive focus on pharmaceuticals.
We presented overall survival data on ipilimumab in second-line metastatic melanoma. The AVERROES study was stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. The attractive profile on dapagliflozin continues to emerge, and we shared encouraging data on our Hepatitis C portfolio.
We also made significant progress on our String of Pearls initiative. Most importantly, we acquired ZymoGenetics while we continue to integrate Medarex. We remain focused on increasing shareholder value. We increased our dividend for the second consecutive year. We initiated a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion in common stock. We bought back debt, and we still ended the year with $10 billion in cash.
You may have also noticed that we restructured our foreign legal entities, and this resulted in more than 85% of our cash now being held in the United States. Charlie will talk more about that.
With respect to manufacturing, we delivered on our optimization plan and continued to improve our costs. While we faced some challenges, we take very seriously the quality issues raised in the Manati warning letter and the voluntary AVALIDE recall. I personally have devoted a significant amount of time to ensure understanding of what happened, and that we take all necessary action to remediate the issues, informed also by assessment from third-party quality consulting experts. In fact, our plant in Manati is inspection-ready, and we are looking forward to our inspection. 
Let me turn to some highlights from the fourth quarter.
We have good sales growth in some of our key brands, which are important to our future growth, including SPRYCEL, ORENCIA, BARACLUDE and the ONGLYZA franchise. We continue to have positive news on our pipeline. We received regulatory approval for SPRYCEL for use in a stress-line testing in the U.S. and Europe and for KOMBIGLYZE in the U.S. We completed key regulatory submissions. We submitted dapagliflozin for regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. The European Medicines Agency has already validated our submission there, and we are waiting acceptance of the submission in the U.S.
In 2011, we will build on the momentum created in 2010, as we continue to position our company for long-term success as a focused, differentiated BioPharma company. There are several upcoming key events that will help shape our future. The first milestone is regulatory action on our filing for ipilimumab, as well as the first-line data, both expected during the first quarter. We are very excited about this product, and we are ready to launch it.
Between 2011 and 2012, we anticipated up to five possible new product approvals. In addition to ipilimumab, the other four are belatacept for organ transplantation, ORENCIA in a subcutaneous formulation, dapagliflozin for diabetes and apixaban, our anticoagulant. For apixaban, based on discussions with the FDA and in agreement with Pfizer, we expect to submit the AVERROES and ARISTOTLE studies together in the U.S., which will cover the broad spectrum of patients in one single file. We expect to have top line data on ARISTOTLE in the second quarter of this year and submit in the U.S. and Europe either in late Q3 or Q4. 
In 2011, we are also anticipating four significant Phase III transitions in hepatitis C, Alzheimer's disease and oncology. And finally, in 2011, we expect strong sales trend for new brands and indications, including KOMBIGLYZE and SPRYCEL, all this adds up to our 2011 guidance that you have seen in the press release and that Charlie will review.
In the release, we have also reaffirmed our 2013 guidance. Over the past few weeks, we have heard questions from many of you about our earnings in 2013, given some of the external challenges. Well, we have listened and have decided to review our longer-term plan, and we are reaffirming 2013 minimum non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.95. Our earnings release contains important information regarding our assumptions underlying this guidance.
Taken together, 2010 was a good year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very happy with the progress we have made over the past year, strategically and financially, and feel very confident about our future. Most importantly, we have continued to strengthen our base and positioned ourselves for significant growth over the next few years, particularly for 2013 and beyond. Our sales are up. Our financials are strong, and our pipeline is robust. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have another solid quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management was offset by a higher effective tax rate compared to Q4 2009. Included in",956,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did have another solid quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management was offset by a higher effective tax rate compared to Q4 2009. Included in our fourth quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. 
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our fourth quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.
We reported fourth quarter net sales from continuing operations of $5.1 billion, up 2% compared to last year. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.5% negative impact on net sales in the quarter, and incremental EU measures had a negative impact of under 1%. Volume was up 2%.
As I look at the fourth quarter sales performance, I am encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. BARACLUDE, our treatment for Hepatitis B was up 25%, including 28% growth internationally. Full year sales for BARACLUDE were $931 million, with over 80% of our business outside the U.S. The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $73 million. Compared to the third quarter, sequentially our business was up over 40% in the U.S. and doubled internationally. We are in the process of launching KOMBIGLYZE and expect it to be a key component of the franchise growth. SPRYCEL was up 42% in the quarter. And as you know, we recently received the first-line indication in both the U.S. and Europe. We believe this represents a meaningful long-term opportunity and are off to a good start.
ORENCIA was up 20% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice. At the same time, we are preparing for the potential launch of our subcu [subcutaneous] formulation in the U.S. later this year. 
The AVAPRO AVALIDE franchise was down 26% in the quarter. This includes the impact of the AVALIDE recall and supply interruption in five markets, the U.S. Mexico, Canada, Puerto Rico and Argentina. AVALIDE net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $60 million in the quarter. Full year AVALIDE sales in the affected markets were $355 million in 2010. As we move into 2011, resupply to the market is not certain. And therefore, we are assuming a meaningful impact from an extended supply interruption.
Lastly, our mature brands declined 14% or $125 million compared to last year. Divestitures in and rationalization of our non-strategic mature brands portfolio represents approximately 50% of the decline. 
The full year impact from U.S. healthcare reform in 2010 was about $0.10. Our estimated incremental impact for 2011 is approximately $0.15. This reflects the annualization of managed Medicaid, expected PHS expansion and the new impact from both Part D Donut Hole coverage and the pharma fee. As a reminder, we share in part both the sales and pharma fee impact with our partners.
Now let me give you just a couple of comments from the rest of our P&L. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 19% to $271 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle, and to its suka [ph] sharing of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications.
The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 25.7% in the fourth quarter. The tax rate reflects the full year impact of the R&D tax credit, which was partially offset due to earnings mix between high- and low-tax jurisdictions. Our full year non-GAAP rate was 23.6%, right in the middle of our 2010 guidance range.
As Lamberto mentioned, we restructured certain of our foreign legal entities, resulting in 85% of our $10 billion in cash and marketable securities now being held in the U.S. There was an associated $207 million tax charge, which is included as a specified tax item. 
Let me turn to guidance. We have issued 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. I'll cover our non-GAAP line-item guidance. We expect sales growth to be in the low mid-single digits. This includes the impact from U.S. healthcare reform, expected EU pricing pressure, another step down in our contractual share of ABILIFY and the AVALIDE supply issue I mentioned earlier. We expect the incremental sales impact from Medicare Part D coverage gap to be approximately $250 million. Gross margin percent should be consistent with 2010. Advertising promotion is expected to decrease in the mid-high single-digit range. This reflects continued life cycle management of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, partially offset by investments in new products and indications.
MS&A is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. This includes the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform pharma fee expected to be approximately $250 million. Excluding this fee, MS&A should be roughly flat.
R&D is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. This includes the impact from ZymoGenetics and investments across our portfolio. We expect our tax rate to be between 25% to 26%. The pharma fee adds approximately 1% to the tax rate. Additionally, our expected change in earnings mix will also drive our rate higher. As in past years, we are assuming a few tax discrete items in 2011, which will cause some variability in our quarterly rate based on timing.
Finally, we are also confirmed, our 2013 non-GAAP floor guidance of $1.95. Moving forward, we do not plan on updating our long-term guidance on a quarterly basis and you should expect updates to 2013 annually in July, consistent with our longer-term planning cycle. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

It's impossible to predict with confidence an exact date, but we are on track for approval for that PDUFA date. And we are working through our medical group, with our commercial colleagues, so that we are properly prepared for launch. And Tony will say a little bit more about that. You have some comments about life expectancy. And part of my confidence comes not only from the very important Phase II studies and the result of '20 and the clear survival benefit, but also because of how long '24, the front line study has taken. The median age of the median survival time period for the group that is currently being followed, which is blinded, exceeds three years. And we think this is quite remarkable. As you know, the standard of care predicts a 75% mortality rate in the first year and less than a 14% survival rate at year two. And so our statistics show us that we are adequately powered. We are close to achieving the required number of events, and I have great confidence that this study will be concluded in the first quarter.  I do not believe we need to submit any more study information to work with the FDA. Our focus is on the adequate communication of the unusual mechanism, the unique mechanism of action and the safety, to ensure appropriate use in order for patients to achieve maximum survival benefit. And the communication of the results, our goal would be to present at the scientific forum hopefully at ASCO this year."

And how should we be thinking about launch curves of some of these assets? The second question just has to do with if ipilimumab. I thought you had indicated there was an inspection that had to occur at the Manati facility. I believe ipi [ipilimumab] being manufactured out of that facility, you have a PDUFA date of March 26. Does that inspection have to occur before that in order for the FDA to approve the product? Or is that not linked or tied to it? And then last question just has to do with the four assets, Elliott that you'll put into Phase III development. Can you just give some commentary around elotuzumab and its rank within those four assets in terms how you allocate assets across those four assets going forward?"

So ipi [ipilimumab] and Manati are totally disconnected. I probably can take this as an opportunity to make a couple of comments about, again, about our manufacturing. I think that, as I said in my comments before, John, we are very happy at what we delivered in terms of optimization plan of our manufacturing network and improvement of our costs. But we also taking very seriously a couple of quality issues that were raised in that warning letter of Manati, that I believe doesn't affect ipilimumab and the AVALIDE recall sites. I personally spend a lot of time to understand what happened. And based on the assessment that I also received not only from my people, but also by third-party quality consulting experts, I believe that we do not have systemic issues with our manufacturing facility. As I said before, and I think Charlie repeat it, we are ready for inspection in Manati. And in fact, we are eagerly waiting for that inspection. You were asking about the commercial model. This is a very important question. We have two important factors, the evolution of the market environment and the number of products that we are going to launch if we get an approval as we hope. We have devoted a lot of time at modifying things according to the requirements of the marketplace. I think, we are very ready for the launch of ipilimumab. But as Tony was saying before, we have moved to a totally different model than the one we have used in the past. We have tested a lot of components of that model with existing products, so we feel very confident that we have a global approach to the different people involved in dealing with ipilimumab from prescribers to nurses to reimbursement specialists to patients in a very innovative way. And the same is happening for all our other launches or expected launches. So a lot we've investing in technology, a lot in base technology, a lot we've invested in creating the right files that will allow us to be more effective in targeting our promotion. And the technology is also helping us to make the work of our reps better, more focused, more targeted and support that work with peer-to-peer, web-based interactions and giving access to relevant information to all our stakeholders, when they want them and in the format that is more convenient to them."

Our biologic in the treatment of multiple myeloma, which Lamberto mentioned, we will, I believe, transition into Phase III this year. I'm very excited about that. I just want to distinguish between the five drugs we're working very hard with to get approved by the end of '12 and at the same time sustain the Phase III pipeline by four transitions into Phase III, including elotuzumab. So the five that we're trying to get approved, we've been talking about ipilimumab, apixaban, dapagliflozin, belatacept and Brivanib. Of those, we've seen the Phase III data and are in regulatory discussions with all but Brivanib. Brivanib, we will see the first Phase III data sometime this year, and we'll be able to make some decisions about its course forward in and its evolving profile. To that group of five, which can potentially be approved, by the end of '12, beginning this year, I would add an important catalytic event of ORENCIA subcu. At the same time, there are four compounds we hope to potentially transition to Phase III this year. I am very sure elotuzumab will go into Phase III for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It's an antibody that is directed to a very specific cellular protein on myeloma cells, and we've had very important response and insights on how to improve current regimen. And we have two Hepatitis C programs that I expect to transition to Phase III. One is our novel first-in-class 5A, and one is our potentially superior Interferon Lambda. We have a lot of clinical data we'll be discussing at scientific forums on our whole portfolio, both at EASL at the Liver meetings, the fist in April and the second in November. And this data will give insights to the doses that we will be taking in to Phase III and we'll be talking about our Phase III strategy later in the year. The one program that we are waiting for more Phase II data on before a decision of transition is our gamma secretase in Alzheimer's. We believe we have a more specific inhibitor in this pathway than predecessors. We want some confirmatory data. We are studying both pre-dementia, as well as mild to moderate. And we'll be getting some data early part of the year and making some decisions hopefully, moving to Phase III by the end of the year."

Those two last components form the numerator for the 30% to 40%.

We are supplying them with all the information that they ask for.

So I'm pleased with the progress so far, but I don't have any more than that to report in Europe. And with regard to apixaban, what the key message is today that instead of doing this in two stages, a narrower indication with AVERROES, given the proximity of ARISTOTLE, and quite honestly, the complexities that we could imagine with ensuring appropriate use with just that indication and the need to really see the comparability as the field has changed with warfarin, we feel, with Pfizer and after consultation with the FDA, that we have a much stronger application waiting to file by the end of Q3, early Q4 for the broadest possible opportunity. In both cases, we have included AVERROES, which may entitle one to review on a priority basis, but that's a decision that the FDA will make when they look at the file, look at the field and give us a filing decision and a categorization decision. I believe this is an area of unmet medical need, and we'll make those cases. With regard to the competitor, I do understand the biomarker possibilities. We don't have data that really has allowed us to pick out a very favorable biomarker, but we're constantly searching for this. We have a biomarker study. And we're looking at ways to predict. I will make a very important point though. And most of our outside advisers have strongly urged that, although we're going to do biomarker work in parallel, the most important thing that we can do is to add combinations of drugs, existing and novel target agents, to try to increase the small but significant number of patients that have a remarkable durable response. The key to this drug is durability. We want to maximize the efficacy by combination therapy, use it in earlier lines, different tumor types, as well as look for biomarker results."

Could you just qualitatively comment on SG&A spend longer term? I think, you've highlighted the company is pretty lean after multiple rounds of cost cutting. It seems like there should be some incremental spend here, with obviously, some important launches next few years. Are there further savings to be had here? Or should we anticipate an upward bias towards spend, over the next couple of years? Second question is on cash deployment, any changes in priority with the company now holding about $4.5 billion of net cash, with most of that cash in the U.S? And do we ever increase in clarity on the pipeline; is how you're thinking of the preference between kind of share repo, mid-stage deals and in market transactions?"

Good morning, everyone. We have just completed a good quarter, which wraps up another successful year for the company despite the challenges associated with healthcare reform in the U.S. and economic pressures in Europe. In previous",850,"Well, thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. We have just completed a good quarter, which wraps up another successful year for the company despite the challenges associated with healthcare reform in the U.S. and economic pressures in Europe. In previous calls and meetings, we from Bristol-Myers Squibb talked a lot in area that other companies of U.S. healthcare reform and European prices. I think that at this point, we should take these two factors for granted and move forward. Today, it is more important to describe how our achievements in 2010 have helped to position the company well for the longer-term growth. 
Specifically, 2010 was a groundbreaking year with respect to clinical data, a real testament to our BioPharma strategy and our exclusive focus on pharmaceuticals. We presented overall survival data on ipilimumab in second-line metastatic melanoma. The AVERROES study was stopped early due to overwhelming efficacy. The attractive profile on dapagliflozin continues to emerge, and we shared encouraging data on our Hepatitis C portfolio. 
We also made significant progress on our String of Pearls initiative. Most importantly, we acquired ZymoGenetics while we continued to integrate Medarex. 
We remain focused on increasing shareholder value. We increased our dividend for the second consecutive year. We initiated a share repurchase program of up to $3 billion in common stock. We bought back debt, and we still ended the year with $10 billion in cash. You may have also noticed that we restructured our foreign legal entities, and this resulted in more than 85% of our cash now being held in the United States. Charlie will talk more about that. 
With respect to manufacturing, we delivered on our optimization plan and continued to improve our costs, but we faced some challenges. We take very seriously the quality issues raised in the Manati warning letter and the voluntary AVALIDE recall. I personally have devoted a significant amount of time to ensure understanding of what happened, and that we take all necessary action to remediate the issues, informed also by assessment from third-party quality consulting experts. In fact, our plant in Manati is inspection-ready, and we are looking forward to a re-inspection. 
Let me turn to some highlights from the fourth quarter. We had good sales growth in some of our key brands, which are important to our future growth, including SPRYCEL, ORENCIA, BARACLUDE and the ONGLYZA franchise. We continue to have positive news on our pipeline. We received regulatory approval for SPRYCEL for use in a stress-line testing in the U.S. and Europe and for KOMBIGLYZE in the U.S. 
We completed key regulatory submissions. We submitted dapagliflozin for regulatory review in both the U.S. and Europe. The European Medicines Agency has already validated our submission there, and we are awaiting acceptance of the submission in the U.S. 
In 2011, we will build on the momentum created in 2010, as we continue to position our company for long-term success as a focused, differentiated BioPharma company. There are several upcoming key events that will help shape our future. The first milestone is regulatory action on our filing for ipilimumab, as well as the first-line data, both expected during the first quarter. We are very excited about this product, and we are ready to launch it. 
Between 2011 and 2012, we anticipated up to five possible new product approvals. In addition to ipilimumab, the other four are belatacept for organ transplantation, ORENCIA in a subcutaneous formulation, dapagliflozin for diabetes and apixaban, our anticoagulant. For apixaban, based on discussions with the FDA and in agreement with Pfizer, we expect to submit the AVERROES and ARISTOTLE studies together in the U.S., which will cover the broadest spectrum of patients in one single filing. We expect to have top line data on ARISTOTLE in the second quarter of this year and submit in the U.S. and Europe either in late Q3 or Q4. 
In 2011, we are also anticipating four significant Phase III transitions in hepatitis C, Alzheimer's disease and oncology. And finally, in 2011, we expect strong sales strength for new brands and indications, including KOMBIGLYZE and SPRYCEL. All this adds up to our 2011 guidance that you have seen in the press release and that Charlie will review. 
In the release, we have also reaffirmed our 2013 guidance. Over the past few weeks, we have heard questions from many of you about our earnings in 2013, given some of the external challenges. Well, we have listened and have decided to review our longer-term plan, and we are reaffirming 2013 minimum non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.95. Our earnings release contains important information regarding our assumptions underlying this guidance. 
Taken together, 2010 was a good year for Bristol-Myers Squibb. I'm very happy with the progress we have made over the past year, strategically and financially, and feel very confident about our future. Most importantly, we have continued to strengthen our base and positioned ourselves for significant growth over the next few years, particularly for 2013 and beyond. Our sales are up. Our financials are strong, and our pipeline is robust. And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have another solid quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management was offset by a higher effective tax rate compared to Q4 2009. Included in",953,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did have another solid quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management was offset by a higher effective tax rate compared to Q4 2009. Included in our fourth quarter EPS is a negative $0.02 impact of U.S. healthcare reform. 
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our fourth quarter financial results and talk about guidance before we go to your questions. We reported fourth quarter net sales from continuing operations of $5.1 billion, up 2% compared to last year. U.S. healthcare reform had a 1.5% negative impact on net sales in the quarter, and incremental EU measures had a negative impact of under 1%. Volume was up 2%. 
As I look at the fourth quarter sales performance, I am encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. BARACLUDE, our treatment for Hepatitis B, was up 25%, including 28% growth internationally. Full year sales for BARACLUDE were $931 million, with over 80% of our business outside the U.S. 
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $73 million. Compared to the third quarter, sequentially our business was up over 40% in the U.S. and doubled internationally. We are in the process of launching KOMBIGLYZE and expect it to be a key component of the franchise growth. SPRYCEL was up 42% in the quarter. And as you know, we recently received the first-line indication in both the U.S. and Europe. We believe this represents a meaningful long-term opportunity and are off to a good start. 
ORENCIA was up 20% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice. At the same time, we are preparing for the potential launch of our subcu [subcutaneous] formulation in the U.S. later this year. 
The AVAPRO/0AVALIDE franchise was down 26% in the quarter. This includes the impact of the AVALIDE recall and supply interruption in five markets, the U.S. Mexico, Canada, Puerto Rico and Argentina. AVALIDE net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $60 million in the quarter. Full year AVALIDE sales in the affected markets were $355 million in 2010. As we move into 2011, resupply to the market is not certain. And therefore, we are assuming a meaningful impact from an extended supply interruption. 
Lastly, our mature brands declined 14% or $125 million compared to last year. Divestitures in and rationalization of our non-strategic mature brands portfolio represents approximately 50% of the decline. 
The full year impact from U.S. healthcare reform in 2010 was about $0.10. Our estimated incremental impact for 2011 is approximately $0.15. This reflects the annualization of managed Medicaid, expected PHS expansion and the new impact from both Part D Donut Hole coverage and the pharma fee. As a reminder, we share in part both the sales and pharma fee impact with our partners. 
Now let me give you just a couple of comments from the rest of our P&L. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 19% to $271 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle, and to Otsuka sharing of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications. 
The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 25.7% in the fourth quarter. The tax rate reflects the full year impact of the R&D tax credit, which was partially offset due to earnings mix between high- and low-tax jurisdictions. Our full year non-GAAP rate was 23.6%, right in the middle of our 2010 guidance range. 
As Lamberto mentioned, we restructured certain of our foreign legal entities, resulting in 85% of our $10 billion in cash and marketable securities now being held in the U.S. There was an associated $207 million tax charge, which is included as a specified tax item. 
Let me turn to guidance. We have issued 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. I'll cover our non-GAAP line-item guidance. We expect sales growth to be in the low mid-single digits. This includes the impact from U.S. healthcare reform, expected EU pricing pressure, another step down in our contractual share of ABILIFY and the AVALIDE supply issue I mentioned earlier. We expect the incremental sales impact from Medicare Part D coverage gap to be approximately $250 million. Gross margin percent should be consistent with 2010. Advertising promotion is expected to decrease in the mid-high single-digit range. This reflects continued life cycle management of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, partially offset by investments in new products and indications. 
MS&A is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. This includes the impact of the U.S. healthcare reform pharma fee expected to be approximately $250 million. Excluding this fee, MS&A should be roughly flat. 
R&D is expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. This includes the impact from ZymoGenetics and investments across our portfolio. We expect our tax rate to be between 25% to 26%. The pharma fee adds approximately 1% to the tax rate. Additionally, our expected change in earnings mix will also drive our rate higher. As in past years, we are assuming a few tax discrete items in 2011, which will cause some variability in our quarterly rate based on timing. Finally, we are also confirmed, our 2013 non-GAAP floor guidance of $1.95. 
Moving forward, we do not plan on updating our long-term guidance on a quarterly basis and you should expect updates to 2013 annually in July, consistent with our longer-term planning cycle. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

And our first approval, and we do expect this year in metastatic melanoma in pretreated patients, I can say that we are actively engaged with the agency in all the types of activities you would imagine, that would be moving towards an approval by our PDUFA date, in March 26. It's impossible to predict with confidence an exact date, but we are on track for approval for that PDUFA date. And we are working through our medical group, with our commercial colleagues, so that we are properly prepared for launch. And Tony will say a little bit more about that. You have some comments about life expectancy. And part of my confidence comes not only from the very important Phase II studies and the result of -020 and the clear survival benefit, but also because of how long -024, the front line study has taken. The median age of the median survival time period for the group that is currently being followed, which is blinded, exceeds three years. And we think this is quite remarkable. As you know, the standard of care predicts a 75% mortality rate in the first year and less than a 14% survival rate at year two. And so our statistics show us that we are adequately powered. We are close to achieving the required number of events, and I have great confidence that this study will be concluded in the first quarter.  I do not believe we need to submit any more study information to work with the FDA. Our focus is on the adequate communication of the unusual mechanism, the unique mechanism of action and the safety, to ensure appropriate use in order for patients to achieve maximum survival benefit. And the communication of the results, our goal would be to present at the scientific forum hopefully at ASCO this year."

And she will amplify her opinion of the market. From the very beginning, we've had the feeling that this new age of oral anti-coagulation that would replace Coumadin in many patients in preventing stroke and atrial fibrillation and standard of care that often includes aspirin, where Coumadin is not administered 40% or 50% of the time in high-risk patients is going to be a tremendous opportunity, and there will be multiple entrants. We are pleased to be at the pioneering edge of this and have, from the beginning, committed to a differentiated product that meets the medical need of powerful efficacy, with better safety and tolerability and ease-of-use than Coumadin. And as the data has emerged from our competition, we are gratified to see the market uptake and the excitement about the whole new class. And we continue to see a need for the differentiation that we have aimed from the beginning of our development program, powerful efficacy as you saw in AVERROES, a very attractive major bleeding profile. And when we see ARISTOTLE, what we must look for is comparability to Coumadin and hopefully superiority in bleeding, safety and tolerability. This program is unique and including studying of patients that are intolerant or unable to take warfarin and in going for the exact benefit risk of powerful efficacy with improved safety. And from what we've seen from our own data so far and from the competition, we're happy with our differentiation strategy. Beatrice?"

But as the years go by, as you see the variation and the evolution of the reaction to the product, we will strongly position our product as very important for the risk benefit that we will develop. So in terms of our ability to position the product, we have a strong feeling that the 50 will be very important, not just the efficacy and the discontinuation rate that we're currently seeing both in the warfarin patient but also in the patient that are using aspirin, and that we will see a gathering momentum with the new usage of the patient replacing warfarin will create the opportunity for us."

I thought you had indicated there was an inspection that had to occur at the Manati facility. I believe ipi [ipilimumab] being manufactured out of that facility, you have a PDUFA date of March 26. Does that inspection have to occur before that in order for the FDA to approve the product? Or is that not linked or tied to it?

I think that, as I said in my comments before, John, we are very happy at what we delivered in terms of optimization plan of our manufacturing network and improvement of our costs. But we also taking very seriously a couple of quality issues that were raised in that warning letter of Manati, that I believe doesn't affect ipilimumab and the AVALIDE recall sites. I personally spend a lot of time to understand what happened. And based on the assessment that I also received not only from my people, but also by third-party quality consulting experts, I believe that we do not have systemic issues with our manufacturing facility. As I said before, and I think Charlie repeat it, we are ready for inspection in Manati. And in fact, we are eagerly waiting for that inspection. You were asking about the commercial model. This is a very important question. We have two important factors, the evolution of the market environment and the number of products that we are going to launch if we get an approval as we hope. We have devoted a lot of time at modifying things according to the requirements of the marketplace. I think we are very ready for the launch of ipilimumab. But as Tony was saying before, we have moved to a totally different model than the one we have used in the past. We have tested a lot of components of that model with existing products, so we feel very confident that we have a global approach to the different people involved in dealing with ipilimumab from prescribers to nurses to reimbursement specialists to patients in a very innovative way. And the same is happening for all our other launches or expected launches. So there is a lot within that technology, a lot in base technology, a lot we've invested in creating the right files that will allow us to be more effective in targeting our promotion. And the technology is also helping us to make the work of our reps better, more focused, more targeted and support that work with peer-to-peer, web-based interactions and giving access to relevant information to all our stakeholders, when they want them and in the format that is more convenient to them."

Our biologic in the treatment of multiple myeloma, which Lamberto mentioned, we will, I believe, transition into Phase III this year. I'm very excited about that. I just want to distinguish between the five drugs we're working very hard with to get approved by the end of '12 and at the same time sustain the Phase III pipeline by four transitions into Phase III, including elotuzumab. So the five that we're trying to get approved, we've been talking about ipilimumab, apixaban, dapagliflozin, belatacept and Brivanib. Of those, we've seen the Phase III data and are in regulatory discussions with all but Brivanib. Brivanib, we will see the first Phase III data sometime this year, and we'll be able to make some decisions about its course forward and its evolving profile. To that group of five, which can potentially be approved by the end of '12, beginning this year, I would add an important catalytic event of ORENCIA subcu. At the same time, there are four compounds we hope to potentially transition to Phase III this year. I am very sure elotuzumab will go into Phase III for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It's an antibody that is directed to a very specific cellular protein on myeloma cells, and we've had very important response and insights on how to improve current regimen. And we have two Hepatitis C programs that I expect to transition to Phase III. One is our novel first-in-class 5A, and one is our potentially superior Interferon Lambda. We have a lot of clinical data we'll be discussing at scientific forums on our whole portfolio, both at EASL at the Liver meetings, the first in April and the second in November. And this data will give insights to the doses that we will be taking in to Phase III and we'll be talking about our Phase III strategy later in the year. The one program that we are waiting for more Phase II data on before a decision of transition is our gamma secretase in Alzheimer's. We believe we have a more specific inhibitor in this pathway than predecessors. We want some confirmatory data. We are studying both pre-dementia, as well as mild to moderate. And we'll be getting some data early part of the year and making some decisions hopefully, moving to Phase III by the end of the year."

Those two last components form the numerator for the 30% to 40%.

So I'm pleased with the progress so far, but I don't have any more than that to report in Europe. And with regard to apixaban, what the key message is today that instead of doing this in two stages, a narrower indication with AVERROES, given the proximity of ARISTOTLE, and quite honestly, the complexities that we could imagine with ensuring appropriate use with just that indication and the need to really see the comparability as the field has changed with warfarin, we feel, with Pfizer and after consultation with the FDA, that we have a much stronger application waiting to file by the end of Q3, early Q4 for the broadest possible opportunity. In both cases, we have included AVERROES, which may entitle one to review on a priority basis, but that's a decision that the FDA will make when they look at the file, look at the field and give us a filing decision and a categorization decision. I believe this is an area of unmet medical need, and we'll make those cases. With regard to the competitor, I do understand the biomarker possibilities. We don't have data that really has allowed us to pick out a very favorable biomarker, but we're constantly searching for this. We have a biomarker study. And we're looking at ways to predict. I will make a very important point though. And most of our outside advisers have strongly urged that, although we're going to do biomarker work in parallel, the most important thing that we can do is to add combinations of drugs, existing and novel target agents, to try to increase the small but significant number of patients that have a remarkable durable response. The key to this drug is durability. We want to maximize the efficacy by combination therapy, use it in earlier lines, different tumor types, as well as look for biomarker results."

First of all, at a higher level, the strategy in Hepatitis C is to look at multiple mechanisms of small molecules and to deliver a superior interferon. We think this is going to be a field modeled after HIV of combination therapy. We have a chance of cure, to increase that cure rate and reduce the tolerability issues with the therapy and increase the number of patients that are being treated. We have a first-in-class 5A inhibitor in the field and we're very impressed with Pharmasset's capabilities in the nucleoside area. And so we are combining those two agents with and without ribavirin, to see if an all oral regimen of that nature, two new drugs and an older drug can treat patients. This is a clinical trial agreement. We have our own combinations, and we have an openness to working with others with regard to delivering the best treatment regimen to patients."

One that clearly demonstrates that our biopharma strategy is working. Our financials were strong. Our pipeline continues to deliver, and of course, YERVOY was approved and launched in the U.S. Taken together, I am very encouraged with our results. 
Before discussing some recent highlights, just want to note that our operations in Japan continued unabated. Our shipments and sales were unaffected, and most importantly, our colleagues were spared any physical harm. In fact, our first rate management team and our staff of dedicated employees have demonstrated extraordinary resolve through this entire crisis. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor our operations in Japan, and we'll update as appropriate.
So with that, let me begin with the most exciting development of the quarter, YERVOY. On March 25, the FDA approved YERVOY for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This was great news for our company, and for the many patients who will benefit from this breakthrough treatment, first such therapy to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit.
The FDA decision is a major accomplishment for Bristol-Myers Squibb. It concerns our strong position in oncology and establishes our leadership in immune oncology. It demonstrates the value of our Medarex acquisition in particular, and our string of pearls initiative in general. And it strengthens our vision of BMS as a benchmark biopharma company. As you know, YERVOY became commercially available in the U.S. in early April, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Let me give you a few examples of this response.
First, the NCCN guidelines, which were updated on April 13, now lists YERVOY as a category one choice for metastatic melanoma. This is important, not only with respect to the speed with which it was done, but also because this will help facilitate reimbursement by the managed healthcare companies. 
Second example, we have already met with or have scheduled to meet with most of the key commercial accounts. Third and very important, physician increase has been particularly strong. In fact, our customers grant our people much more time than usual. While it is not very common, as you know nowadays in the pharma world.
And finally, activity on the website and at the call center has been very busy. Moreover, to improve our ability to execute commercially, we are utilizing a new customer model. One that takes a more holistic, more informed approach to the process by focusing on all aspects of the patient's journey and all of the customers including physicians, nurses, payers, hospitals and of course, patients. This customer model, along with our patient assistance programs, will help to make YERVOY widely available through thousands of Americans who suffer this terrible disease.
As you also know, we have announced that a second Phase III clinical trial of YERVOY known as study 024 met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. The data has been submitted to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO, and we are hoping to present this at the annual meeting in June. And finally, outside of the U.S., YERVOY is currently under review in Europe where we are expecting a decision later this year, followed by decisions in Australia, Canada and other countries as well.
Let me now discuss a few key regulatory and clinical developments. We have had two positive developments in Europe. For ELIQUIS, Apixaban, we received a positive opinion for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip or knee orthopedic surgery, and are expecting a decision soon. 
We also received a positive opinion from CHMP for neurologic -- for kidney transplantation and are expecting a decision soon, too. On dapagliflozin, we announced the FDA a separate for review the map the NBA so we are on track for a decision this fall. Additionally, the European Marketing Authorization Application was validated and this marks the start of the procedure in Europe as well.
And with respect to our hepatitis C portfolio -- we just presented encouraging data for our novel interference and our first in class NS5A inhibitor, both of which we plan to move into Phase III this year.
Let me now give you an update on Manati, the -- was as expected, we received a letter from the FDA with several observations. We responded to that letter and believe we had addressed the points raised. And we are continuing our discussions with the FDA. Manufacturing remains uninterrupted in Manati, and I want to assure you that resolving the issues in Manati is one of our top priorities. As we said before, this could delay a decision on NULOJIX. 
Second, our company is in a solid position as demonstrated by this very strong quarter. We delivered on pipeline and we delivered on financials. And the progress we are making gives me confidence that we are well positioned to deliver for the PLAVIX and AVAPRO era. And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have a strong quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.58. Strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management were partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. Included in our first quarter EPS is an incremental negative $0.03 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and to a lesser extent the coverage both of which went into effect in 2011.
I know what to give you some brief highlights from our first quarter financial results before we go to your questions. We reported first quarter net sales from continuing operations of $5 billion, up 4% compared to last year. EU measures had a negative impact of 1% and foreign exchange had a 1% favorable impact on sales. 
As Lamberto mentioned, our operations in Japan were largely uninterrupted and we did realize a slight increase in wholesaler purchases of approximately $10 million. As I look at the first quarter sales performance, I continue to be encouraged by the transit many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis D was up 27%, including 30% growth internationally. BARACLUDE has been a real international success story as over 80% of our business is outside the U.S. 
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $81 million an 11% increase sequentially versus the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with the early trends for KOMBIGLYZE which helped drive a 30% increase in ONGLYZA franchise prescription sequentially versus the fourth quarter. Reported sales from KOMBIGLYZE in the quarter do not reflect prescription demand partially due to inventory work down.
SPRYCEL was up 31% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first line indication. U.S. prescriptions were strong and our market share in the U.S. increased roughly 10% despite our competitors' three month head start. ORENCIA was up 18% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice. We now have roughly 30% of the first line IV biologic market, up from under 25% a year ago. At the same time, we are preparing for the potential launch of our subcu formulation in the U.S. later this year.
The AVAPRO AVALIDE franchise was down 8% in the quarter but up 15% versus fourth quarter 2010. The negative impact of the AVALIDE supply interruption in the quarter was $40 million to $50 million. The sales increase versus Q4 was due to restocking as we were able to resupply the market in February with two of the three dosages. We expect current per strip to continue based on lost demand and the fact that we do not have the third dosage form of the market.
Now let me give you a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks our non-GAAP results, reconciliation story GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website. Gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to the same period last year and 80 basis points compared to fourth quarter of 2010. The improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by foreign exchange.
Advertising and promotion expenses were basically flat at $214 million for the quarter, less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, product at the end of the life cycle was offset by increased investment spend on our new products and indication. We expect AMP spend to suffer in the second of the year as we further managed PLAVIX and AVAPRO towards the end of their life cycle. 
Marketing selling and administrative expenses increased 4% due to the pharmacy of $61 million. Excluding the pharmacy, MSNA would have been down 3%. R&D was down 3%, mostly due to timing of portfolio investments. R&D spend is expected to increase through the year as we begin Phase III studies for HCV portfolio and YERVOY in long concert. You may have noticed an increase in equity income sequentially versus the fourth quarter of last year. This is primarily due to order timing, reduction in discovery royalties and improve profitability as we in kind of the our JV partner manage expenses. The effective overall tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 26% in the quarter. The pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I mentioned on the January call, I would expect quarterly viability of the tax rate based on the timing of certain discrete items.
Finally, we have confirmed our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance with no changes to our line item guidance. I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

As we look at the marketplace, we always said that between 13,000 and 20,000 patients of metastatic melanoma in the U.S. and about 10,000 newly diagnosed patients per year. And these tend to come across fairly evenly across just under 1,000 patients per month being diagnosed. The AP program had at its peak about 2.6 or 200,600 patients for the U.S. and patients do have the option of either continuing on the AP program or converting to the commercial plant. We're seeing about a 30/30 split between those completing the AP versus those going to the commercial plan. So we see the uptake being a combination of 1,000 new patients indicated or diagnosed per month, together with second line patients who are other indicators as they come forward and that's where we see the growth and uptake in the marketplace. The initial response in terms of ordering of vials have been positive but obviously I'd like to see this in a few more weeks to make sure that we can block it down. We've launched the product as we said with a unique different custom model. It's a model that takes a much more holistic approach, more informed approach process by focusing on all aspects of patient journey and all customers involved including the physicians, the nurses, the patients and the hospitals. As Lamberto said our initial response has been great with physicians actually granting us we 2x to 3x the amount of time we normally give us and in fact the so-called positions of reaching out to us and asking to spend some time with us. Metastatic melanoma is treated, as you know, by medical oncologists and about 1/2 the patients treated in the hospital institutions which represent about 600 positions. And the other 1/2 of the patients are treated in the community, representing about 5,000 community oncologists. We have about 23 well-trained specialists melanoma individuals looking after the academic institutions. And one of our own oncology teams of close to 100 people looking out to the community oncologist. And other 30 trained MSOs looking after physicians across the country, 18 dedicated reimbursement specialists backed up by our third-party vendor destination access. The model itself is unique in that because of the distribution model as an order is placed, it triggers immediately the BMS team response., which allows us to instantaneously have an MSL reaching out to the practice to make sure that the practice understands how to use a product and some important safety issues. But at the same time it mobilizes the BMS team, which consists of the melanoma cell specialist, the reimbursement specialist, the MSM the assistance from the medical support center and the entire unit of care comprising each of the critical roles in the treatment team of inspectors to work with a person or the people that person prescriber the side effect manager, the dosing administrator, the patient educator as well as the practice or is reimbursement financial together with the patient and the patient's caregivers. So far we think the model is working exceptionally well we know exactly where sales are going and the responses from physicians have been outstanding. The discussions with our payers, as Lamberto said, the NTC guidelines quick as they did have been great beneficial in all our discussions about 80% of our top payor clients to date all of these discussions are going exceptionally well. They focus around a medical discussion and all the other medical organizations within the payer groups have identified the important innovation this drug brings together with the important overall survival."

We'll be talking about the full study at ASCO in June. You noted correctly that the study was in first line and essentially we already have that broad indication in the label. But the immediate impact of two positive studies in metastatic melanoma, which has seen no positive survival studies, is important. This is an important data. When you look at the study presented at ASCO, one of the things you'll focus on, no doubt, will be any consistencies between the two studies in both efficacy and safety. And the uniqueness of the survival curve, which characterizes duration of response. And so I think at this point, I would say that I think it's a very important information to make available. Will see it in full in June. We are currently in discussions with the health authorities, the 3 milligram dose for now is our dose in the label that we can't speculate about future labeling unapproved dosage regimens.

And our thinking has moved to having the most complete characterization of that study later in the year or early next year before beginning our Phase III. We are having high to move into phase three as the science dictates. With its mechanism, it is important to show selectivity for beta inhibition relative to notch we believe our compound has accomplished is more than any other compound in the field. We're hoping that this selectivity will provide the therapeutic window that will allow efficacy with acceptable side effects. But it's going to be very important to select the right dose and the right patient population for Phase III. To that end, we have two Phase II studies as I mentioned and you referred to one being completed. That 013 study, six-month study performed in patients with mild to moderate his completed results to be presented in July at the international Alzheimer's meeting. The second study, 018, is an ongoing two-year trial performed in patients with pre-dementia. We have decided to wait for the results of an interim analysis of the pre-dementia study is slated for the fourth quarter of this year. Prior to making a decision on Phase III and pending the results of the study, we could move into Phase III sometime in '12."

And as we speak, the FDA is moving towards approval of what we think of as the first wave improvement over standard of care that existed for over a decade. In our HIV experience, we have been cognizant of the fact that this virus will require a combination therapy and that there will be more of a personalized approach for patients. What that means is we think the market will evolve into a stratified set of patient populations based on different genotypes, polymorphisms of the host and geographies. And therefore, we have from the beginning, sought a broad-based portfolio that has multiple mechanisms for combination therapy and for selecting the right regimen for the right patient population and the right part of the world. We have the first-in-class NS5A inhibitor. We have perhaps a second wave prodase inhibitor targeted at the unmet need that should still exist once the current drugs down at the FDA are approved. We have a preliminary inhibitor and we have a novel interferon. Many people are trying to replace interferon alpha, not totally clear that, that's going to be possible at all cases that we do protect a need for these important medicine. However, the goal of improving safety and tolerability, we think can be achieved by this genomics derived form of interferon that uses the same inter-sailor mechanism but a different set of target receptors, targeted to the liver and sparing the side effects by not targeting elsewhere. I am not highly concerned but obviously studying any side effects such as the liver side effect at high doses that you mentioned with regard to that interferon. We will be transitioning into Phase III but without the highest dose. It is a common issue in interferons including alpha interferon to have elevated LFP's. So this is not two surprising but picking the right dose and the right management's came will be our approach as we transition into Phase III. Just to conclude before Beatrice adds her important perspective, out of Berlin, we were very excited at that international conference to be the first company to show that two too small molecules can cure patients as measured by sustained viral reduction of 24 weeks after therapy without interferon. We've been able to progress to which patients can be selected for two drugs. We've shown that two drugs on top of standard of care can treat patients that are no responders, do not respond to current standard of care can achieve with small numbers now in early studies between 90% and 100% cure. And this is even a far advanced improvement over the new medicines currently being considered under regulatory review."

So this product is a clearly recognize as a market leader., which is about on a worldwide basis with the pathologist, which will help us in the future. So obviously, very important product not just BARACLUDE but pathology the future. We look at the various region internationally and you see very strong growth in Europe, we have 42% value market share. We have continued feeling of that segment so it's not just want my product so first-line. We see that in all the region in Asia, very strong success in Japan. We also have very strong growth in Asia and Japan of 38%. We see basically the preference of that product most by of patients and physicians. So do we have challenges turn out where we are going. We have oh so generics coming onboard. But the value of the compound and the people that are using it and the physicians keep a very strong longevity growth behind that compound. So far we see from continued growth in that region outside of the U.S. The U.S. is still growing, also gross product in the U.S. So very, very interesting for us long-term. It's a good setup for the company, it's also good setup for the patient and is also serving us as a base for image in the pathology in general."

Let me move into the question on YERVOY in terms of the hurdles, obviously, the first question that we are asked what is the price of the product and then we spend a huge amount of time discussing the value proposition that brings those combination of overall survival and means survival as we have no pushback from the medical organizations over there. The question of course is really around a temporary in the beginning, which is around the time it's going to take before institutions and hospitals are reimbursed. So we spent quite a bit of time working with our distributors to ensure that we have sufficient base, that we are granting to our distributors, which they pass it on to the hospitals to get them at 120, 130 days to really get their money before they are paying us. So at this stage, we are seeing no major hurdles in terms of use of the drug and the supply is going slightly better than we would have expected at the beginning."

One that clearly demonstrates that our biopharma strategy is working. Our financials were strong. Our pipeline continues to deliver, and of course, YERVOY was approved and launched in the U.S. Taken together, I am very encouraged with our results. 
Before discussing some recent highlights, just want to note that our operations in Japan continued unabated. Our shipments and sales were unaffected, and most importantly, our colleagues were spared any physical harm. In fact, our first-rate management team and our staff of dedicated employees have demonstrated extraordinary resolve through this entire crisis. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor our operations in Japan, and we'll update as appropriate.
So with that, let me begin with the most exciting development of the quarter, YERVOY. On March 25, the FDA approved YERVOY for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This was great news for our company and for the many patients who will benefit from this breakthrough treatment, first such therapy to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit.
The FDA's decision is a major accomplishment for Bristol-Myers Squibb. It concerns our strong position in oncology and establishes our leadership in immune oncology. It demonstrates the value of our Medarex acquisition in particular, and our String of Pearls initiative in general. And it strengthens our vision of BMS as a benchmark biopharma company. As you know, YERVOY became commercially available in the U.S. in early April, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Let me give you a few of examples of this response.
First, the NCCN guidelines, which were updated on April 13, now lists YERVOY as a category one choice for metastatic melanoma. This is important, not only with respect to the speed with which it was done, but also because this will help facilitate reimbursement by the managed healthcare companies. 
Second example, we have already met with or are scheduled to meet with most of the key commercial accounts. Third and very important, physician interest has been particularly strong. In fact, our customers grant our people much more time than usual. Well, it is not very common, as you know, nowadays, in the pharma world.
And finally, activity on the website and at the call center has been very busy. Moreover, to improve our ability to execute commercially, we are utilizing a new customer model. One that takes a more holistic, more informed approach to the process by focusing on all aspects of the patient's journey and all of the customers involved, including physicians, nurses, payers, hospitals and of course, patients. This customer model, along with our patient-assistance programs, will help to make YERVOY widely available through thousands of Americans who suffer this terrible disease.
As you also know, we have announced that a second Phase III clinical trial of YERVOY known as study 024 met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. The data has been submitted to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO, and we are hoping to present this at the annual meeting in June. And finally, outside of the U.S., YERVOY is currently under review in Europe, where we are expecting a decision later this year, followed by decisions in Australia, Canada and other countries as well.
Let me now discuss a few key regulatory and clinical developments. We have had two positive developments in Europe. For ELIQUIS, apixaban, we also received a positive opinion for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip or knee orthopedic surgery, and are expecting a decision soon.  We also received a positive opinion from CHMP for NULOJIX belatacept for kidney transplantation, and are expecting a decision soon, too. On dapagliflozin, we announced the FDA accepted for review the dapa [dapaglifozin] NDA, and so we are on track for a decision this fall. Additionally, the European Marketing Authorization Application was validated, and this marks the start of the release procedure in Europe as well.
And with respect to our hepatitis C portfolio at EASL, we just presented encouraging data for our novel interference and our first-in-class NS5A inhibitor, both of which we plan to move into Phase III this year.
Let me now give you an update on Manati, the plant was inspected. We received a letter from the FDA with several observations. We responded to that letter and believe we addressed the points raised. And we are continuing our discussions with the FDA. Manufacturing remains uninterrupted at Manati, and I want to assure you that resolving the issues in Manati is one of our top priorities. As we said before, this could delay FDA decision on NULOJIX and ORENCIA subcu [subcutaneous]. 
Taken as a whole, our company is in a solid position as demonstrated by this very strong quarter. We delivered on pipeline and we delivered on financials. And the progress we are making gives me confidence that we are well positioned to deliver for the PLAVIX and AVAPRO era. And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have a strong quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.58. Strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management were partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. Included on our first quarter EPS is an incremental negative $0.03 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and to a lesser extent, the donut hole coverage, both of which went into effect in 2011.
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our first quarter financial results before we go to your questions. We reported first quarter net sales from continuing operations of $5 billion, up 4% compared to last year. EU measures had a negative impact of 1% and foreign exchange had a 1% favorable impact on sales. 
As Lamberto mentioned, our operations in Japan were largely uninterrupted and we did realize a slight increase in wholesaler purchases of approximately $10 million. As I look at the first quarter sales performance, I continue to be encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. 
BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B was up 27%, including 30% growth internationally. BARACLUDE has been a real international success story as over 80% of our business is outside the U.S. 
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $81 million, an 11% increase sequentially versus the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with the early trends for KOMBIGLYZE which helped drive a 30% increase in ONGLYZA franchise prescriptions sequentially versus the fourth quarter. Reported sales for KOMBIGLYZE in the quarter do not reflect prescription demand, partially due to inventory work down.
SPRYCEL was up 31% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. U.S. prescriptions were strong and our market share in the U.S. increased to roughly 10% despite our competitors' three-month head start. ORENCIA was up 18% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice. We now have roughly 30% of the first-line IV biologic market, up from under 25% a year ago. At the same time, we are preparing for the potential launch of our subcu formulation in the U.S. later this year.
The AVAPRO AVALIDE franchise was down 8% in the quarter, but up 15% versus fourth quarter of 2010. The negative impact of the AVALIDE supply interruption in the quarter was $40 million to $50 million. The sales increase versus Q4 was due to restocking as we were able to resupply the market in February with two of the three dosages. We expect current prescription trends to continue based on lost demand and the fact that we do not have that third dosage form on the market.
Now let me give you a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results, reconciliations to our GAAP results are available on our press release and on our website. Gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to the same period last year and 80 basis points compared to fourth quarter of 2010. The improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by foreign exchange.
Advertising and promotion expenses were basically flat at $214 million for the quarter, less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle was offset by increased investment spend on our new products and indication. We expect A&P spend to soften in the second half of the year as we further manage PLAVIX and AVAPRO towards the end of their life cycle. 
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 4% due to the pharma fee of $61 million. Excluding the pharma fee, MS&A would have been down 3%. R&D was down 3%, mostly due to timing of portfolio investment. R&D spend is expected to increase through the year as we begin Phase III studies for elotuzumab, our HCV portfolio and YERVOY in lung cancer. You may have noticed an increase in equity income sequentially versus the fourth quarter of last year. This is primarily due to order timing, reduction in discovery royalties and improved profitability as we and sanofi, our JV partner, manage expenses. The effective overall tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 26% in the quarter. The pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I mentioned on the January call, I would expect quarterly variability in the tax rate based on timing of certain discrete items. Finally, we have confirmed our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance with no changes to our line-item guidance. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

As we look at the marketplace, we always said that between 15,000 and 20,000 patients of metastatic melanoma in the U.S. and about 10,000 newly diagnosed patients per year. And these tend to come across -- fairly evenly across just under 1,000 patients per month being diagnosed. The EAP program had at its peak about 2.6 or 2,600 patients in it for the U.S., and patients do have the option of either continuing on the EAP program or converting to the commercial plan. We're seeing about a 30/30 split between those completing the EAP versus those going to the commercial plan. So we see the uptake being a combination of 1,000 new patients indicated or diagnosed per month, together with second-line patients who are failing on other indicators as they come forward, and that's where we see the growth and uptake of the marketplace. The initial response in terms of ordering of vials has been positive, but I'd obviously like to see this in a few more weeks to make sure that we can block it down. We've launched the product, as we've said, with a unique different customer model. It's a model that takes a much more holistic approach, more informed approach process by focusing on all aspects of the patient journey and all customers involved including the physicians, the nurses, the payers and the hospitals. As Lamberto said, our initial response has been great with physicians actually granting us we 2x to 3x the amount of time they normally give us, and in fact the so-called no-see physicians proactively reaching out to us and asking to spend some time with us. Metastatic melanoma is treated, as you know, by medical oncologists, and about 1/2 the patients are treated in academic or hospital institutions, which represent about 600 physicians, and the other 1/2 of the patients are treated in the community, representing about 5,000 community oncologists. We have about 23 well-trained specialists melanoma individuals looking after the academic institutions, and one of our oncology teams of close to 100 people looking after the community oncologists. Another 50 trained MSLs looking after physicians across the country, 18 dedicated reimbursement specialists backed up by our third-party vendor destination access. The model itself is unique in that because of the distribution model, as an order is placed, it triggers immediately the BMS team response, which allows us to instantaneously have an MSL reaching out to practice to make sure that the practice understands how to use a product and some important safety issues. But at the same time, it mobilizes the BMS team, which consists of the melanoma cell specialist, the reimbursement specialist, the MSL with assistance from the medical support center and the entire unit of care comprising each of the critical roles and the treatment team of each practice. They work with a person or the people that acts as the patient's prescriber, the side effect manager, the dosing administrator, the patient educator as well as the practice's reimbursement of financial need together with the patient and the patient's caregivers. So far, we think the model is working exceptionally well. We know exactly where sales are going, and the responses from physicians have been outstanding. The discussions with our payers, as Lamberto said, the NCCN guidelines have got there as quick as they did have been very beneficial. In all our discussions, about 80% of our top payer clients to date, all of these discussions have gone exceptionally well. They focused around the medical discussion, and all the medical organizations within the payer groups have identified the important innovation this drug brings together with the important overall survival."

We'll be talking about the full study at ASCO in June. You noted correctly that the study was in first line, and essentially we already have that broad indication in the label. But the immediate impact of two positive studies in metastatic melanoma, which has seen no positive survival studies, is important. This is an important data. When you look at this study presented at ASCO, one of the things you'll focus on, no doubt, will be any consistencies between the two studies in both efficacy and safety and the uniqueness of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, which characterizes duration of response. And so I think, at this point, I would say, that I think this is a very important information to make available. We'll see it in full in June. We are currently in discussions with the health authorities, the 3 milligram dose for now is our dose in the label and we can't speculate about future labeling on approved dosage regimens.

And let me say first that the beta-amyloid hypothesis remains a leading one in the area, and we continue to pursue it. We're diligently moving forward on our Phase II program. As you mentioned, we have completed one Phase II to be presented soon. But the one in pre-dementia is ongoing. And our thinking has moved to having the most complete characterization of that study later in the year or early next year before beginning our Phase III. We are -- have an eye to move into Phase III as the science dictates. With this mechanism, it is important to show selectivity for Abeta inhibition relative to Notch, and we believe our compound has accomplished this more than any other compound in the field. We're hoping that this selectivity will provide the therapeutic window that will allow efficacy with acceptable side effects. But it's going to be very important to select the right dose and the right patient population for Phase III. To that end, we have two Phase II studies, as I mentioned, and you referred to one being completed. That 013 study, six-month study performed in patients with mild to moderate is completed, results to be presented in July at the International Alzheimer's Meeting. The second study, 018, is an ongoing two-year trial performed in patients with pre-dementia. We have decided to wait for the results of an interim analysis of the pre-dementia study slated for the fourth quarter of this year. Prior to making a decision on Phase III and pending the results of the study, we could move into Phase III sometime in '12."

And as we speak, the FDA is moving towards approval of what we think of as the first-wave improvement over standard of care that existed for over a decade. In our HIV experience, we have been cognizant of the fact that this virus will require a combination therapy and that there will be more of a personalized approach for patients. What that means is we think the market will evolve into a stratified set of patient populations based on different genotypes, polymorphisms of the host and geographies. And therefore, we have from the beginning, sought a broad-based portfolio that has multiple mechanisms for combination therapy and for selecting the right regimen for the right patient population in the right part of the world. We have the first-in-class NS5A inhibitor. We have perhaps a second-wave protease inhibitor targeted at the unmet need that should still exist once the current drugs down at the FDA are approved. We have a preliminary inhibitor and we have a novel interferon. Many people are trying to replace interferon alpha. Not totally clear that, that's going to be possible at all cases. We do protect a need for these important medicine. However, the goal of improving safety and tolerability, we think, can be achieved by this genomics-derived form of interferon that uses the same inter-cellular mechanism but a different set of target receptors, targeted to the liver and sparing the side effects by not targeting elsewhere. I am not highly concerned, but obviously studying any side effects such as the liver side effect at high doses that you mentioned, with regard to that interferon. We will be transitioning into Phase III, but without the highest dose. It is a common issue in interferons even including alpha interferon to have elevated LFTs. So this is not too surprising, but picking the right dose and the right management scheme will be our approach, as we transition into Phase III. Just to conclude before Beatrice adds her important perspective, out of Berlin, we were very excited at that international conference to be the first company to show that two small molecules can cure patients as measured by sustained viral reduction at 24 weeks after therapy, without interferon. We've been able to progress to which patients can be selected for two drugs. We have shown that two drugs on top of standard of care can treat patients that are no responders, do not respond to current standard of care, can achieve, with small numbers now in early studies between 90% and 100% cure. And this is even a far advanced improvement over the new medicines currently being considered under regulatory review."

And that is at least equal attention ought to be paid into increasing the number of patients that do respond as to trying to figure out a marker to predict the 20% of the patients that have a very significant durability. And we have those options at hand today. We have potential combination therapy, that is standard chemotherapy, sequential chemotherapy and new targeted agents that we and others have in their pipeline. So our effort here is to take immuno oncology to a place where ipilimumab is foundational in a variety of tumor types and can be response can be improved upon by other therapies, both targeted and otherwise. The evidence that other tumor types -- first of all, the theory that this ought to be applicable is the basic mechanism that this is unleashing the immune system that has been put in check by the cancer, and in so doing, activates T-cells to attack the evading cancer. There should be more of a general mechanism of classically immunogenic tumor that have been thought to be melanoma and kidney cancer. So those are the first two applications. However, we now have a probe to prove or disprove that and broaden the number of tumor types with our early data in prostate. We are conducting Phase III programs in prostate cancer with our data presented last year and Phase II lung cancer. We are encouraged to begin a Phase III program this year in lung cancer and more data about lung cancer will be presented at ASCO."

This is part of a larger program, as you know, that includes the unique program of AVERROES that read out last year very favorably, where patients that can't take warfarin because of frailty or bleeding risk were compared with standard of care. It's important to know the comparison with Coumadin, given the evolving landscape, and so we have designed an 18,000-patient study with patients that had atrial fibrillation and at least one risk factor for stroke. The CHADS score, the average CHADS score was about 2. This compares with what dabigatran had for RE-LY, as well as quite similar to AVERROES. And that means on average a patient had either two risk factors for stroke in addition to a fib or had a prior stroke. The endpoint is the time to -- the dose is our 5 milligrams BID, which we think in multiple studies, has given us positive benefit risk versus warfarin, where we try to keep the INR in the 2 to 3 range. The endpoint is the time to first occurrence of confirmed stroke or systemic embolism, the time to major bleeding and treatment or follow-up. It's an event-driven trial. We hope to have the results in the coming months, and we hope to present the results in Paris in September at the European Society of Cardiology. And we are working on a filing that combines AVERROES and ARISTOTLE should the results dictate."

And their current therapy of either subcu Heparin or Coumadin has its disadvantages. And the first trial, I don't know that we've seen full results yet, but with regard to what the FDA requires is a 30-day read and then a follow-up, had some at 30 days in good efficacy, but there was increased bleeding. Our approach from the beginning has to pick the dose of apixaban and the regimen that balances efficacy with bleeding. We have focused on benefit risk being a quotient of efficacy and bleeding. And that is in stark contrast to some of the competitor programs. So our ADOPT trial is in the same type of patient population with a very similar design but with a different approach to benefit risk. But we must wait until that Phase III data matures later this year, and perhaps we'll be able to present it then."

The question, of course, is really around the temporary J code in the beginning, which is around the time it's going to take before institutions and hospitals are reimbursed.

And second, let me confirm that we are not going to look again at our guidance for 2013 until we review our plan. Just as a reminder, when we confirmed our guidance in January, we have gone through an exercise that considered the present portfolio and gave a certain degree of risk to the different products in the portfolio itself. Obviously, at that point, we had a strong belief in the importance of YERVOY. So again, what we are seeing -- and again, we are only at the very beginning of the launch of YERVOY. What we are seeing for YERVOY, we do not consider as a surprise. And again, we are not going to update our guidance until planning time. Beatrice?"

It's often requiring multiple medication to provide long-term comfort. We know that more than 40% of the Type 2 diabetes patient are not achieving treatment goal on current therapy. So the patient management today is pretty straightforward, but there is a lot of financial. And we need to mobilize more around treatment guideline diabetes. And as we provide new options for treatment, to further improve quality of diabetes care, the segmentation of the way the patients are treated depending on their profile, depending on their comorbidity level. So we are very excited by dapagliflozin's unique and certainly independent mechanism because it's not only first-in-class, it's first in a very different class. It acts independently from insulin, and therefore, offering a very different type of option from existing therapies. So we believe it could have also, a meaningful effect on addition to glucose control, on parameters such as weight and blood pressure. And in a disease like diabetes, also attributes could be extremely important and valued by the patients themselves, not just the physician with the ability of increasing compliance for the patient. So we feel extremely encouraged by what we see with dapagliflozin. We have launched more and more, and we continue learning about the diabetes market and what the levers will be. So we are working on those, and hopefully, we will be able to get a fair share of the market we will access at the time of our launch."

We have just completed a very strong quarter, one that clearly demonstrates that our biopharma strategy is working. Our financials were strong. Our pipeline continues to deliver, and of course, YERVOY was approved and launched in the U.S. Taken together, I am very encouraged with our results. 
Before discussing some recent highlights, I just want to note that our operations in Japan continued unabated. Our shipments and sales were unaffected, and most importantly, our colleagues were spared any physical harm. In fact, our first-rate management team and our staff of dedicated employees have demonstrated extraordinary resolve through this entire crisis. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor our operations in Japan, and we'll update as appropriate.
So with that, let me begin with the most exciting development of the quarter, YERVOY. On March 25, the FDA approved YERVOY for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This was great news for our company and for the many patients who will benefit from this breakthrough treatment, the first such therapy to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit.
The FDA's decision is a major accomplishment for Bristol-Myers Squibb. It concerns our strong position in oncology and establishes our leadership in immune oncology. It demonstrates the value of our Medarex acquisition in particular, and our String of Pearls initiative in general. And it strengthens our vision of BMS as a benchmark biopharma company. As you know, YERVOY became commercially available in the U.S. in early April, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Let me give you a few of examples of this response.
First, the NCCN guidelines, which were updated on April 13, now lists YERVOY as a category one choice for metastatic melanoma. This is important, not only with respect to the speed with which it was done, but also because this will help facilitate reimbursement by the managed healthcare companies. 
Second example, we have already met with or are scheduled to meet with most of the key commercial accounts. Third and very important, physician interest has been particularly strong. In fact, our customers grant our people much more time than usual. Well, this is not very common, as you know, nowadays, in the pharma world.
And finally, activity on the website and at the call center has been very busy. Moreover, to improve our ability to execute commercially, we are utilizing a new customer model. One that takes a more holistic, more informed approach to the process by focusing on all aspects of the patient's journey and all of the customers involved, including physicians, nurses, payers, hospitals and of course, patients. This customer model, along with our patient-assistance programs, will help to make YERVOY widely available to the thousands of Americans who suffer this terrible disease.
As you also know, we have announced that a second Phase III clinical trial of YERVOY known as study 024 met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. The data has been submitted to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO, and we are hoping to present this at the annual meeting in June. And finally, outside of the U.S., YERVOY is currently under review in Europe, where we are expecting a decision later this year, followed by decisions in Australia, Canada and other countries as well.
Let me now discuss a few key regulatory and clinical developments. We have had two positive developments in Europe. For ELIQUIS, apixaban, we also received a positive opinion for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip or knee orthopedic surgery, and are expecting a decision soon.  We also received a positive opinion from CHMP for NULOJIX belatacept for kidney transplantation, and are expecting a decision soon, too. On dapagliflozin, we announced the FDA accepted for review the dapa [dapaglifozin] NDA, and so we are on track for a decision this fall. Additionally, the European Marketing Authorization Application was validated, and this marks the start of the release procedure in Europe as well.
And with respect to our hepatitis C portfolio at EASL, we just presented encouraging data for our novel interference and our first-in-class NS5A inhibitor, both of which we plan to move into Phase III this year.
Let me now give you an update on Manati, the plant was inspected. We received a letter from the FDA with several observations. We responded to that letter and believe we addressed the points raised. And we are continuing our discussions with the FDA. Manufacturing remains uninterrupted at Manati, and I want to assure you that resolving the issues in Manati is one of our top priorities. As we said before, this could delay FDA decision on NULOJIX and ORENCIA subcu [subcutaneous]. 
Taken as a whole, our company is in a solid position as demonstrated by this very strong quarter. We delivered on pipeline and we delivered on financials. And the progress we are making gives me confidence that we are well positioned to deliver for the post PLAVIX and AVAPRO era. And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have a strong quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.58.

We did have a strong quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.58. Strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management were partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. Included on our first quarter EPS is an incremental negative $0.03 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and to a lesser extent, the donut hole coverage, both of which went into effect in 2011.
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our first quarter financial results before we go to your questions. We reported first quarter net sales from continuing operations of $5 billion, up 4% compared to last year. EU measures had a negative impact of 1% and foreign exchange had a 1% favorable impact on sales. 
As Lamberto mentioned, our operations in Japan were largely uninterrupted and we did realize a slight increase in wholesaler purchases of approximately $10 million. As I look at the first quarter sales performance, I continue to be encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. 
BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B was up 27%, including 30% growth internationally. BARACLUDE has been a real international success story as over 80% of our business is outside the U.S. 
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $81 million, an 11% increase sequentially versus the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with the early trends for KOMBIGLYZE which helped drive a 30% increase in ONGLYZA franchise prescriptions sequentially versus the fourth quarter. Reported sales for KOMBIGLYZE in the quarter do not reflect prescription demand, partially due to inventory work down.
SPRYCEL was up 31% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. U.S. prescriptions were strong and our market share in the U.S. increased to roughly 10% despite our competitors' three-month head start. ORENCIA was up 18% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice. We now have roughly 30% of the first-line IV biologic market, up from under 25% a year ago. At the same time, we are preparing for the potential launch of our subcu formulation in the U.S. later this year.
The AVAPRO AVALIDE franchise was down 8% in the quarter, but up 15% versus fourth quarter of 2010. The negative impact of the AVALIDE supply interruption in the quarter was $40 million to $50 million. The sales increase versus Q4 was due to restocking as we were able to resupply the market in February with 2 of the 3 dosages. We expect current prescription trends to continue based on lost demand and the fact that we do not have that third dosage form on the market.
Now let me give you a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results, reconciliations to our GAAP results are available on our press release and on our website. Gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to the same period last year and 80 basis points compared to fourth quarter of 2010. The improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by foreign exchange.
Advertising and promotion expenses were basically flat at $214 million for the quarter, less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle was offset by increased investment spend on our new products and indications. We expect A&P spend to soften in the second half of the year as we further manage PLAVIX and AVAPRO towards the end of their life cycle. 
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 4% due to the pharma fee of $61 million. Excluding the pharma fee, MS&A would have been down 3%. R&D was down 3%, mostly due to timing of portfolio investments. R&D spend is expected to increase through the year as we begin Phase III studies for elotuzumab, our HCV portfolio and YERVOY in lung cancer. You may have noticed an increase in equity income sequentially versus the fourth quarter of last year. This is primarily due to order timing, reduction in discovery royalties and improved profitability as we and sanofi, our JV partner, manage expenses. The effective overall tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 26% in the quarter. The pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I mentioned on the January call, I would expect quarterly variability in the tax rate based on timing of certain discrete items. Finally, we have confirmed our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance with no changes to our line-item guidance. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

As we look at the marketplace, we always said that between 15,000 and 20,000 patients of metastatic melanoma in the U.S. and about 10,000 newly diagnosed patients per year. And these tend to come across -- fairly evenly across just under 1,000 patients per month being diagnosed. The EAP program had at its peak about 2.6 or 2,600 patients in it for the U.S., and patients do have the option of either continuing on the EAP program or converting to the commercial plan. We're seeing about a 50/50 split between those completing the EAP versus those going to the commercial plan. So we see the uptake being a combination of the 1,000 new patients indicated or diagnosed per month, together with second-line patients who are failing on other indications that they can't afford, and that's where we see the growth and uptake of the marketplace. The initial response in terms of ordering of vials has been fairly positive, but I'd obviously like to see this in a few more weeks to make sure that we can lock it down. We've launched the product, as we've said, with a unique different customer model. It's a model that takes a much more holistic approach, more informed approach to the process by focusing on all aspects of the patient journey and all customers involved including the physicians, the nurses, the payers and the hospitals. As Lamberto said, our initial response has been great with physicians actually granting us we 2x to 3x the amount of time they normally give us, and in fact the so-called no-see physicians proactively reaching out to us and asking to spend some time with us. Metastatic melanoma is treated, as you know, by medical oncologists, and about 1/2 the patients are treated in academic or hospital institutions, which represent about 600 physicians, and the other 1/2 of the patients are treated in the community, representing about 5,000 community oncologists. We have about 23 well-trained specialists melanoma individuals looking after the academic institutions, and one of our oncology teams of close to 100 people looking after the community oncologists. Another 50 trained MSLs looking after physicians across the country, 18 dedicated reimbursement specialists backed up by our third-party vendor destination access. The model itself is unique in that because of the distribution model, as an order is placed, it triggers immediately the BMS team response, which allows us to instantaneously have an MSL reaching out to the practice to make sure that the practice understands how to use the product and some important safety issues. But at the same time, it mobilizes the BMS team, which consists of the melanoma cell specialist, the reimbursement specialist, the MSL with assistance from the medical support center and the entire unit of care comprising each of the critical roles and the treatment team of each practice. They work with a person or the people that acts as the patient's prescriber, the side effect manager, the dosing administrator, the patient educator as well as the practice's reimbursement or financial lead together with the patient and the patient's caregivers. So far, we think the model is working exceptionally well. We know exactly where sales are going, and the responses from physicians have been outstanding. The discussions with our payers, as Lamberto said, the NCCN guidelines have got there as quick as they did have been very beneficial. In all our discussions, about 80% of our top payer clients to date, all of these discussions have gone exceptionally well. They focused around the medical discussion, and all the medical organizations within the payer groups have identified the important innovation this drug brings together with the important overall survival."

We'll be talking about the full study at ASCO in June. You noted correctly that the study was in first line, and essentially we already have that broad indication in the label. But the immediate impact of two positive studies in metastatic melanoma, which has seen no positive survival studies, is important. This is an important data. When you look at this study presented at ASCO, one of the things you'll focus on, no doubt, will be any consistencies between the two studies in both efficacy and safety and the uniqueness of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, which characterizes duration of response. And so I think, at this point, I would say, that I think this is a very important information to make available. We'll see it in full in June.

As you mentioned, we have completed one Phase II to be presented soon. But the one in pre-dementia is ongoing. And our thinking has moved to having the most complete characterization of that study later in the year or early next year before beginning our Phase III. We are -- have an eye to move into Phase III as the science dictates. With this mechanism, it is important to show selectivity for Abeta inhibition relative to Notch, and we believe our compound has accomplished this more than any other compound in the field. We're hoping that this selectivity will provide the therapeutic window that will allow efficacy with acceptable side effects. But it's going to be very important to select the right dose and the right patient population for Phase III. To that end, we have two Phase II studies, as I mentioned, and you referred to one being completed. That 013 study, six-month study performed in patients with mild to moderate is completed, results to be presented in July at the International Alzheimer's Meeting. The second study, 018, is an ongoing two-year trial performed in patients with pre-dementia.

And as we speak, the FDA is moving towards approval of what we think of as the first-wave improvement over standard of care that's existed for over a decade. In our HIV experience, we have been cognizant of the fact that this virus will require a combination therapy and that there will be more of a personalized approach for patients. What that means is we think the market will evolve into a stratified set of patient populations based on different genotypes, polymorphisms of the host and geographies. And therefore, we have from the beginning, sought a broad-based portfolio that has multiple mechanisms for combination therapy and for selecting the right regimen for the right patient population in the right part of the world. We have the first-in-class NS5A inhibitor. We have perhaps a second-wave protease inhibitor targeted at the unmet need that should still exist once the current drugs down at the FDA are approved. We have a polymerase inhibitor and we have a novel interferon. Many people are trying to replace interferon alpha. Not totally clear that, that's going to be possible at all cases. We do protect a need for this important medicine. However, the goal of improving safety and tolerability, we think, can be achieved by this genomics-derived form of interferon that uses the same inter-cellular mechanism but a different set of target receptors, targeted to the liver and sparing the side effects by not targeting elsewhere. I am not highly concerned, but obviously studying any side effects such as the liver side effect at high doses that you mentioned, with regard to that interferon. We will be transitioning into Phase III, but without the highest dose. It is a common issue in interferons even including alpha interferons to have elevated LFTs. So this is not too surprising, but picking the right dose and the right management scheme will be our approach, as we transition into Phase III. Just to conclude before Beatrice adds her important perspective, out of Berlin, we were very excited at that international conference to be the first company to show that 2 small molecules can cure patients as measured by sustained viral reduction at 24 weeks after therapy, without interferon. We've been able to progress to which patients can be selected for 2 drugs. We have shown that 2 drugs on top of standard of care can treat patients that are no responders, do not respond to current standard of care, can achieve, with small numbers now in early studies between 90% and 100% cure. And this is even a far advanced improvement over the new medicines currently being considered under regulatory review."

And that is at least equal attention ought to be paid into increasing the number of patients that do respond as to trying to figure out a marker to predict the 20% of the patients that have a very significant durability. And we have those options at hand today. We have potential combination therapy, that is standard chemotherapy, sequential chemotherapy and new targeted agents that we and others have in their pipeline. So our effort here is to take immuno oncology to a place where ipilimumab is foundational in a variety of tumor types and it's response can be improved upon by other therapies, both targeted and otherwise. The evidence that other tumor types -- first of all, the theory that this ought to be applicable is the basic mechanism that this is unleashing the immune system that has been put in check by the cancer, and in so doing, activates T-cells to attack the evading cancer. This should be more of a general mechanism. Classically, immunogenic tumors that have been thought to be melanoma and kidney cancer. So those are the first two applications. However, we now have a probe to prove or disprove that and broaden the number of tumor types with our early data in prostate. We are conducting Phase III programs in prostate cancer with our data presented last year and Phase II lung cancer. We are encouraged to begin a Phase III program this year in lung cancer and more data about lung cancer will be presented at ASCO."

This is part of a larger program, as you know, that includes the unique program of AVERROES that read out last year very favorably, where patients that can't take warfarin because of frailty or bleeding risk were compared with standard of care. It's important to know the comparison with Coumadin, given the evolving landscape, and so we have designed an 18,000-patient study with patients that had atrial fibrillation and at least one risk factor for stroke. The CHADS score, the average CHADS score was about 2. This compares with what dabigatran had for RE-LY, as well as quite similar to AVERROES. And that means that on average a patient had either two risk factors for stroke in addition to a fib or had a prior stroke. The endpoint is the time to -- the dose is our 5 milligrams BID, which we think in multiple studies, has given us positive benefit to risk versus warfarin, where we try to keep the INR in the 2 to 3 range. The endpoint is the time to first occurrence of confirmed stroke or systemic embolism, the time to major bleeding and treatment or follow-up. It's an event-driven trial.

We have everywhere increased awareness. We have acceptance of the long-term efficacy of the product. We continue delivering long-term safety and resistance data over time. So this product is clearly recognized as a market leader, which is helping us also on a worldwide basis, with the pathologist and [indiscernible] which will help us in the future for our [indiscernible]. So obviously, a very important product, not just BARACLUDE but the link to pathology in the future. We look at the various region internationally. And you see very strong growth in Europe, about 42% value market share. We have a continued fueling of that growth in the [indiscernible] segments, it's not just a one-line product, it's also a first-line. We see that in all the region in Asia, very strong success in Japan. We also have very strong growth in Asia and Japan of 38%. We see basically the preference of that product both by of patients and physicians driving the growth. So now we have challenges. If you take China, where we are growing. We have also generics coming now onboard. But the value of the compound and the people that are using it and the physician, keep a very strong branded genetic growth behind that compound. So far we see some continued growth in that region outside of the U.S. The U.S. is still growing, let's not forget that. Also a growth product in the U.S. so very, very interesting for us long-term. It's a good success for the company, it's also good success for the patient, and is also serving us as a base for image in the pathology in general."

So we continue to show very good growth there. Let me move into the question on YERVOY in terms of the hurdles. Obviously, the first question that we are asked is what is the price of the product and then we spend a huge amount of time discussing the value proposition this drug brings, those combination of overall survival and mean survival, and we'll have no pushback from the medical organizations over there. The question, of course, is really around the temporary J code [ph] in the beginning, which is around the time it's going to take before institutions and hospitals are reimbursed. So we spent quite a bit of time working with our distributors to ensure that we have sufficient days, that we are granting to our distributors, which they pass it on to the hospitals to give them your 120, 130 days to really get their money before they are paying us. So at this stage, we are seeing no major hurdles in terms of the use of the drug, and the supply is going slightly better than we would have expected it to be, yes."

So ONGLYZA and the franchise of ONGLYZA is going to be followed by dapaglifozin later on. So diabetes is a huge investment for us. We do it obviously, with our partners, AstraZeneca. The second area is looking at cancer and starting with brivanib, which probably would be one of the first coming. As you know, AGC [ph] is a key disease and again 70% of the case are in Asia Pacific. So it will represent a big opportunity for us in the liver franchise and as we discussed earlier, we have also been very successful in the past.

So the patient management today is pretty straightforward, but there is a lot of financial. And we need to mobilize more around treatment guideline diabetes. And as we provide new options for treatment, to further improve quality of diabetes care, the segmentation of the way the patients are treated depending on their profile, depending on their comorbidity level. So we are very excited by dapagliflozin's unique and certainly independent mechanism because it's not only first-in-class, it's first in a very different class. It acts independently from insulin, and therefore, offering a very different type of option from existing therapies. So we believe it could have also, a meaningful effect on addition to glucose control, on parameters such as weight and blood pressure. And in a disease like diabetes, those attributes could be extremely important and valued by the patients themselves, not just the physician with the ability of increasing compliance for the patient. So we feel extremely encouraged by what we see with dapagliflozin. We have launched more and more, and we continue learning about the diabetes market and what the levers will be. So we are working on those, and hopefully, we will be able to get a fair share of what market we will access at the time of our launch."

We have just completed a very strong quarter, one that clearly demonstrates that our biopharma strategy is working. Our financials were strong. Our pipeline continues to deliver, and of course, YERVOY was approved and launched in the U.S. Taken together, I am very encouraged with our results. 
Before discussing some recent highlights, I just want to note that our operations in Japan continued unabated. Our shipments and sales were unaffected, and most importantly, our colleagues were spared any physical harm. In fact, our first-rate management team and our staff of dedicated employees have demonstrated extraordinary resolve through this entire crisis. Nonetheless, we continue to monitor our operations in Japan, and we'll update as appropriate.
So with that, let me begin with the most exciting development of the quarter, YERVOY. On March 25, the FDA approved YERVOY for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. This was great news for our company and for the many patients who will benefit from this breakthrough treatment, the first such therapy to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit.
The FDA's decision is a major accomplishment for Bristol-Myers Squibb. It concerns our strong position in oncology and establishes our leadership in immune oncology. It demonstrates the value of our Medarex acquisition in particular, and our String of Pearls initiative in general. And it strengthens our vision of BMS as a benchmark biopharma company. As you know, YERVOY became commercially available in the U.S. in early April, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Let me give you a few of examples of this response.
First, the NCCN guidelines, which were updated on April 13, now lists YERVOY as a category one choice for metastatic melanoma. This is important, not only with respect to the speed with which it was done, but also because this will help facilitate reimbursement by the managed healthcare companies. 
Second example, we have already met with or are scheduled to meet with most of the key commercial accounts. Third and very important, physician interest has been particularly strong. In fact, our customers grant our people much more time than usual. Well, this is not very common, as you know, nowadays, in the pharma world.
And finally, activity on the website and at the call center has been very busy. Moreover, to improve our ability to execute commercially, we are utilizing a new customer model. One that takes a more holistic, more informed approach to the process by focusing on all aspects of the patient's journey and all of the customers involved, including physicians, nurses, payers, hospitals and of course, patients. This customer model, along with our patient-assistance programs, will help to make YERVOY widely available to the thousands of Americans who suffer this terrible disease.
As you also know, we have announced that a second Phase III clinical trial of YERVOY known as study 024 met its primary endpoint of improving overall survival in previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. The data has been submitted to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, ASCO, and we are hoping to present this at the annual meeting in June. And finally, outside of the U.S., YERVOY is currently under review in Europe, where we are expecting a decision later this year, followed by decisions in Australia, Canada and other countries as well.
Let me now discuss a few key regulatory and clinical developments. We have had two positive developments in Europe. For ELIQUIS, apixaban, we also received a positive opinion for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total hip or knee orthopedic surgery, and are expecting a decision soon.  We also received a positive opinion from CHMP for NULOJIX belatacept for kidney transplantation, and are expecting a decision soon, too. On dapagliflozin, we announced the FDA accepted for review the dapa [dapaglifozin] NDA, and so we are on track for a decision this fall. Additionally, the European Marketing Authorization Application was validated, and this marks the start of the release procedure in Europe as well.
And with respect to our hepatitis C portfolio at EASL, we just presented encouraging data for our novel interference and our first-in-class NS5A inhibitor, both of which we plan to move into Phase III this year.
Let me now give you an update on Manati, the plant was inspected. We received a letter from the FDA with several observations. We responded to that letter and believe we addressed the points raised. And we are continuing our discussions with the FDA. Manufacturing remains uninterrupted at Manati, and I want to assure you that resolving the issues in Manati is one of our top priorities. As we said before, this could delay FDA decision on NULOJIX and ORENCIA subcu [subcutaneous]. 
Taken as a whole, our company is in a solid position as demonstrated by this very strong quarter. We delivered on pipeline and we delivered on financials. And the progress we are making gives me confidence that we are well positioned to deliver for the post PLAVIX and AVAPRO era. And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did have a strong quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.58. Strong sales growth in most of our key products and continued focused expense management were partially offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. Included on our first quarter EPS is an incremental negative $0.03 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and to a lesser extent, the donut hole coverage, both of which went into effect in 2011.
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our first quarter financial results before we go to your questions. We reported first quarter net sales from continuing operations of $5 billion, up 4% compared to last year. EU measures had a negative impact of 1% and foreign exchange had a 1% favorable impact on sales. 
As Lamberto mentioned, our operations in Japan were largely uninterrupted and we did realize a slight increase in wholesaler purchases of approximately $10 million. As I look at the first quarter sales performance, I continue to be encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. 
BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B was up 27%, including 30% growth internationally. BARACLUDE has been a real international success story as over 80% of our business is outside the U.S. 
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $81 million, an 11% increase sequentially versus the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with the early trends for KOMBIGLYZE which helped drive a 30% increase in ONGLYZA franchise prescriptions sequentially versus the fourth quarter. Reported sales for KOMBIGLYZE in the quarter do not reflect prescription demand, partially due to inventory work down.
SPRYCEL was up 31% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. U.S. prescriptions were strong and our market share in the U.S. increased to roughly 10% despite our competitors' three-month head start. ORENCIA was up 18% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice. We now have roughly 30% of the first-line IV biologic market, up from under 25% a year ago. At the same time, we are preparing for the potential launch of our subcu formulation in the U.S. later this year.
The AVAPRO AVALIDE franchise was down 8% in the quarter, but up 15% versus fourth quarter of 2010. The negative impact of the AVALIDE supply interruption in the quarter was $40 million to $50 million. The sales increase versus Q4 was due to restocking as we were able to resupply the market in February with 2 of the 3 dosages. We expect current prescription trends to continue based on lost demand and the fact that we do not have that third dosage form on the market.
Now let me give you a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results, reconciliations to our GAAP results are available on our press release and on our website. Gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to the same period last year and 80 basis points compared to fourth quarter of 2010. The improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by foreign exchange.
Advertising and promotion expenses were basically flat at $214 million for the quarter, less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle was offset by increased investment spend on our new products and indications. We expect A&P spend to soften in the second half of the year as we further manage PLAVIX and AVAPRO towards the end of their life cycle. 
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 4% due to the pharma fee of $61 million. Excluding the pharma fee, MS&A would have been down 3%. R&D was down 3%, mostly due to timing of portfolio investments. R&D spend is expected to increase through the year as we begin Phase III studies for elotuzumab, our HCV portfolio and YERVOY in lung cancer. You may have noticed an increase in equity income sequentially versus the fourth quarter of last year. This is primarily due to order timing, reduction in discovery royalties and improved profitability as we and sanofi, our JV partner, manage expenses. The effective overall tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 26% in the quarter. The pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I mentioned on the January call, I would expect quarterly variability in the tax rate based on timing of certain discrete items. Finally, we have confirmed our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance with no changes to our line-item guidance. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

As we look at the marketplace, we always said that between 15,000 and 20,000 patients of metastatic melanoma in the U.S. and about 10,000 newly diagnosed patients per year. And these tend to come across -- fairly evenly across just under 1,000 patients per month being diagnosed. The EAP program had at its peak about 2.6 or 2,600 patients in it for the U.S., and patients do have the option of either continuing on the EAP program or converting to the commercial plan. We're seeing about a 50/50 split between those completing the EAP versus those going to the commercial plan. So we see the uptake being a combination of the 1,000 new patients indicated or diagnosed per month, together with second-line patients who are failing on other indications that they can't afford, and that's where we see the growth and uptake of the marketplace. The initial response in terms of ordering of vials has been fairly positive, but I'd obviously like to see this in a few more weeks to make sure that we can lock it down. We've launched the product, as we've said, with a unique different customer model. It's a model that takes a much more holistic approach, more informed approach to the process by focusing on all aspects of the patient journey and all customers involved including the physicians, the nurses, the payers and the hospitals. As Lamberto said, our initial response has been great with physicians actually granting us we 2x to 3x the amount of time they normally give us, and in fact the so-called no-see physicians proactively reaching out to us and asking to spend some time with us. Metastatic melanoma is treated, as you know, by medical oncologists, and about 1/2 the patients are treated in academic or hospital institutions, which represent about 600 physicians, and the other 1/2 of the patients are treated in the community, representing about 5,000 community oncologists. We have about 23 well-trained specialists melanoma individuals looking after the academic institutions, and one of our oncology teams of close to 100 people looking after the community oncologists. Another 50 trained MSLs looking after physicians across the country, 18 dedicated reimbursement specialists backed up by our third-party vendor destination access. The model itself is unique in that because of the distribution model, as an order is placed, it triggers immediately the BMS team response, which allows us to instantaneously have an MSL reaching out to the practice to make sure that the practice understands how to use the product and some important safety issues. But at the same time, it mobilizes the BMS team, which consists of the melanoma cell specialist, the reimbursement specialist, the MSL with assistance from the medical support center and the entire unit of care comprising each of the critical roles and the treatment team of each practice. They work with a person or the people that acts as the patient's prescriber, the side effect manager, the dosing administrator, the patient educator as well as the practice's reimbursement or financial lead together with the patient and the patient's caregivers. So far, we think the model is working exceptionally well. We know exactly where sales are going, and the responses from physicians have been outstanding. The discussions with our payers, as Lamberto said, the NCCN guidelines have got there as quick as they did have been very beneficial. In all our discussions, about 80% of our top payer clients to date, all of these discussions have gone exceptionally well. They focused around the medical discussion, and all the medical organizations within the payer groups have identified the important innovation this drug brings together with the important overall survival."

We'll be talking about the full study at ASCO in June. You noted correctly that the study was in first line, and essentially we already have that broad indication in the label. But the immediate impact of two positive studies in metastatic melanoma, which has seen no positive survival studies, is important. This is an important data. When you look at this study presented at ASCO, one of the things you'll focus on, no doubt, will be any consistencies between the two studies in both efficacy and safety and the uniqueness of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, which characterizes duration of response. And so I think, at this point, I would say, that I think this is a very important information to make available. We'll see it in full in June. We are currently in discussions with the health authorities, the 3 milligram dose for now is our dose in the label and we can't speculate about future labeling on approved dosage regimens.

As you mentioned, we have completed one Phase II to be presented soon. But the one in pre-dementia is ongoing. And our thinking has moved to having the most complete characterization of that study later in the year or early next year before beginning our Phase III. We are -- have an eye to move into Phase III as the science dictates. With this mechanism, it is important to show selectivity for Abeta inhibition relative to Notch, and we believe our compound has accomplished this more than any other compound in the field. We're hoping that this selectivity will provide the therapeutic window that will allow efficacy with acceptable side effects. But it's going to be very important to select the right dose and the right patient population for Phase III. To that end, we have two Phase II studies, as I mentioned, and you referred to one being completed. That 013 study, six-month study performed in patients with mild to moderate is completed, results to be presented in July at the International Alzheimer's Meeting. The second study, 018, is an ongoing two-year trial performed in patients with pre-dementia. We have decided to wait for the results of an interim analysis of the pre-dementia study slated for the fourth quarter of this year. Prior to making a decision on Phase III and pending the results of the study, we could move into Phase III sometime in '12."

And as we speak, the FDA is moving towards approval of what we think of as the first-wave improvement over standard of care that's existed for over a decade. In our HIV experience, we have been cognizant of the fact that this virus will require a combination therapy and that there will be more of a personalized approach for patients. What that means is we think the market will evolve into a stratified set of patient populations based on different genotypes, polymorphisms of the host and geographies. And therefore, we have from the beginning, sought a broad-based portfolio that has multiple mechanisms for combination therapy and for selecting the right regimen for the right patient population in the right part of the world. We have the first-in-class NS5A inhibitor. We have perhaps a second-wave protease inhibitor targeted at the unmet need that should still exist once the current drugs down at the FDA are approved. We have a polymerase inhibitor and we have a novel interferon. Many people are trying to replace interferon alpha. Not totally clear that, that's going to be possible at all cases. We do protect a need for this important medicine. However, the goal of improving safety and tolerability, we think, can be achieved by this genomics-derived form of interferon that uses the same inter-cellular mechanism but a different set of target receptors, targeted to the liver and sparing the side effects by not targeting elsewhere. I am not highly concerned, but obviously studying any side effects such as the liver side effect at high doses that you mentioned, with regard to that interferon. We will be transitioning into Phase III, but without the highest dose. It is a common issue in interferons even including alpha interferons to have elevated LFTs. So this is not too surprising, but picking the right dose and the right management scheme will be our approach, as we transition into Phase III. Just to conclude before Beatrice adds her important perspective, out of Berlin, we were very excited at that international conference to be the first company to show that 2 small molecules can cure patients as measured by sustained viral reduction at 24 weeks after therapy, without interferon. We've been able to progress to which patients can be selected for 2 drugs. We have shown that 2 drugs on top of standard of care can treat patients that are no responders, do not respond to current standard of care, can achieve, with small numbers now in early studies between 90% and 100% cure. And this is even a far advanced improvement over the new medicines currently being considered under regulatory review."

And that is at least equal attention ought to be paid into increasing the number of patients that do respond as to trying to figure out a marker to predict the 20% of the patients that have a very significant durability. And we have those options at hand today. We have potential combination therapy, that is standard chemotherapy, sequential chemotherapy and new targeted agents that we and others have in their pipeline. So our effort here is to take immuno oncology to a place where ipilimumab is foundational in a variety of tumor types and it's response can be improved upon by other therapies, both targeted and otherwise. The evidence that other tumor types -- first of all, the theory that this ought to be applicable is the basic mechanism that this is unleashing the immune system that has been put in check by the cancer, and in so doing, activates T-cells to attack the evading cancer. This should be more of a general mechanism. Classically, immunogenic tumors that have been thought to be melanoma and kidney cancer. So those are the first two applications. However, we now have a probe to prove or disprove that and broaden the number of tumor types with our early data in prostate. We are conducting Phase III programs in prostate cancer with our data presented last year and Phase II lung cancer. We are encouraged to begin a Phase III program this year in lung cancer and more data about lung cancer will be presented at ASCO."

This is part of a larger program, as you know, that includes the unique program of AVERROES that read out last year very favorably, where patients that can't take warfarin because of frailty or bleeding risk were compared with standard of care. It's important to know the comparison with Coumadin, given the evolving landscape, and so we have designed an 18,000-patient study with patients that had atrial fibrillation and at least one risk factor for stroke. The CHADS score, the average CHADS score was about 2. This compares with what dabigatran had for RE-LY, as well as quite similar to AVERROES. And that means that on average a patient had either two risk factors for stroke in addition to a fib or had a prior stroke. The endpoint is the time to -- the dose is our 5 milligrams BID, which we think in multiple studies, has given us positive benefit to risk versus warfarin, where we try to keep the INR in the 2 to 3 range. The endpoint is the time to first occurrence of confirmed stroke or systemic embolism, the time to major bleeding and treatment or follow-up. It's an event-driven trial. We hope to have the results in the coming months, and we hope to present the results in Paris in September at the European Society of Cardiology. And we are working on a filing that combines AVERROES and ARISTOTLE should the results dictate."

And their current therapy of either subcu Heparin or Coumadin has its disadvantages. And the first trial, I don't know that we've seen full results yet, but with regard to what the FDA requires is a 30-day read and then a follow-up, had some at 30 days in good efficacy, but there was increased bleeding. Our approach from the beginning has to pick the dose of apixaban and the regimen that balances efficacy with bleeding. We have focused on benefit risk being a quotient of efficacy and bleeding. And that is a stark contrast to some of the competitor programs. So our ADOPT trial is in the same type of patient population with a very similar design but with a different approach to benefit risk. But we must wait until that Phase III data matures later this year, and perhaps we'll be able to present it then."

It's often requiring multiple medication to provide long-term comfort. We know that more than 40% of the Type 2 diabetes patient are not achieving treatment goal on current therapy. So the patient management today is pretty straightforward, but there is a lot of financial. And we need to mobilize more around treatment guideline diabetes. And as we provide new options for treatment, to further improve quality of diabetes care, the segmentation of the way the patients are treated depending on their profile, depending on their comorbidity level. So we are very excited by dapagliflozin's unique and certainly independent mechanism because it's not only first-in-class, it's first in a very different class. It acts independently from insulin, and therefore, offering a very different type of option from existing therapies. So we believe it could have also, a meaningful effect on addition to glucose control, on parameters such as weight and blood pressure. And in a disease like diabetes, those attributes could be extremely important and valued by the patients themselves, not just the physician with the ability of increasing compliance for the patient. So we feel extremely encouraged by what we see with dapagliflozin. We have launched more and more, and we continue learning about the diabetes market and what the levers will be. So we are working on those, and hopefully, we will be able to get a fair share of what market we will access at the time of our launch."

While we have just completed a very good quarter and as you have seen, we have raised our guidance for 2011 and confirmed minimum GAAP guidance for 2013. Our financial results were strong with double-digit growth in sales. Operationally, the execution of the year by launch has already started delivering positive results and from an R&D perspective, we had several global regulatory approvals, including ELIQUIS and NULOJIX. For ELIQUIS, we also announced exciting top line data growth for stroke in atrial fibrillation.
Across all our operations globally, we continue to demonstrated our biopharma strategies on track moving forward and delivering results. Charlie will speak to the financials working through the specifics. I will then focus on some of the other key developments.
Clearly, a highlights of this quarter was the launch of YERVOY, approved in the U.S. in March, our breakthrough medicine for Metastatic Melanoma was officially launched early in the second quarter. And already, in its first 3 months in the U.S. market YERVOY sales were strong at $95 million. While some patient demand had been building pending YERVOY's approval, most of these initial sales were due to one simple and compelling fact, the product is good. And there is a very high demand for the first treatment [indiscernible] and the first one ever to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefits in this patient population.
A key driver of YERVOY's strong initial sales was our ability to execute commercially, utilizing the new customer model we talked about during last quarter's call. We have received very positive feedback, both about the level of support we are providing and the materials we are making available to the entire unit of care. Based on the initial success of YERVOY, supported by our new customer model, we'll adopt a similarly thoughtful, holistic and focused approach to commercialize the all new products in all countries. The approach we take to thoroughly understanding the patient journey and the needs of the all the customers involved will always remain core.
A few additional notes about YERVOY. Outside of the U.S., YERVOY was approved in Australia in June and it was just approved on July 14 in the European union. And at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, we presented the results of the second Phase III study of YERVOY, results that again demonstrated improved overall survival in patients with the most aggressive form of cancer.
So taken together, the approval, the launches, the clinical advances, this was an excellent quarter for YERVOY. 
More generally, in addition to YERVOY, we had several other global regulatory successes. Most notable were the approvals of our 2 other new products: ELIQUIS and NULOJIX. ELIQUIS ipilimumamb, was approved and launched in Europe for the prevention of VT [indiscernible] events in adult patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery. Soon after, we announced top line results from our Phase III [indiscernible] which demonstrated ELIQUIS superiority with respect to both test, safety and efficacy for the prevention of stroke in patients with [indiscernible] atrial fibrillation compared to [indiscernible]. This data will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology Meeting at the end of August and we are still on target for some [indiscernible] regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU later this year.
And NULOJIX belatacept, our first-in-class biologic immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients, was approved and launched in both the U.S. and Europe. As we know, we just received a negative opinion on [indiscernible] from the FDA's advisory committee and while disappointed, I want you to know that we are not at all dissuaded and that we and AstraZeneca will continue to work with the FDA. I'm saying this now because this is what we are supposed to say but it's because we do believe in these products and remains firmly committed to its success.
And finally, adding to our overall good operating news during the quarter, we were informed by the FDA in June that the corrective actions we have taken at our [indiscernible] manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico has sufficiently addressed the [indiscernible] events identified in 2010 FDA warning letter. I, and my management team, remain committed to ensuring the actions we took at the [indiscernible] site are maintained and that the [indiscernible] site and all our other manufacturing sites are in full compliance with both company and regulatory requirements.
Before passing the floor to Charlie, I want to mention 2 business development transactions that we just completed, both for which happened in the end of the second quarter but I think that they are worth mentioning. First, we announced the global agreement with [indiscernible] a biotech company France for the development and commercialization of a biologic in state one development. A good addition to our strong immuno-oncology portfolio. And just last week, we entered into an agreement to apply a [indiscernible] pharmaceuticals, a San Diego-based company, that focuses on the discovery and development of medicine for the treatment of [indiscernible] disease. It is an area of increasing interest for us.
Again, taken together, it was a very good quarter. We delivered solid results across all our operations globally and these not only increases my pride in our company. It also increases my confidence in our future. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did had a very good quarter we had a non-GAAP EPS of $0.56. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. Included in our second quarter EPS is an incremental negative $0.03 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and to a lesser extent, the [indiscernible] coverage both of which went into effect in 2011. I now want to give you some brief highlights from our second quarter financial results before we go to your questions.
We reported second quarter net sales of $5.4 billion, up 14% compared to last year. Volume were strong, providing the 5% favorable impact on sales. Price was also favorable by 5% and foreign exchange contributed 4% to sales. The U.S. healthcare reform coverage gap implemented in 2011 and EU measures, together had just over a 1% negative impact on sales. As I look at the second quarter sales performance, I am very encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes continued strong performance for BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL, ORENCIA and as you've seen the YERVOY launch has been quite strong. 
As Lamberto discussed, we are pleased with the performance of YERVOY with sales of $95 million the in the quarter. We believe the strong start reflects both the compelling profile of the drug and the execution of our commercial model. We are breaking YERVOY's sales into 3 categories: a stacking element, a bonus or onetime element and underlying demand. As expected, wholesalers are holding what we consider normal levels of inventory. Our preliminary estimates are that the [indiscernible] accounted for approximately 30% of our Q2 sales. We believe the majority of the bolus was driven by a warehouse effect and patients on current therapy being switched on to YERVOY before disease progression. As we move into Q3, we will get better sense of the actual size of the bolus and whether it has fully run its course.
The largest driver of our Q2 sales was strong demand. New patient starts are split approximately 40% in first line and 60% in second line and the majority of demand has been driven by physicians experienced with YERVOY. For the remainder of the year, the YERVOY sales range will be dependent on a few factors, the actual size and depletion of the bolus and the extent to which we can beyond the current subscriber set and beyond the patient pool. 
As I move to the rest of our product performance, please remember that foreign change did have a positive impact on all of our Global Brands. Performance excluding foreign exchange is available on our website.
BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B, was up 31% including 33% growth internationally. BARACLUDE's long-term efficacy, safety and 5-year resistance data has strengthened its position as the preferred first-line agent. The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $112 million, a 38% increase sequentially versus the first quarter. The franchise delivered 22% prescription growth versus 6% for the class. Going forward, we are focused on commercial execution and positioning our data in renal patients and our head-to-head study versus as used.
SPRYCEL was up 46% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. U.S. prescriptions were up 11% and our market share in the U.S. increased to roughly 10% [indiscernible]. ORENCIA was up 28% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice, highlighting efficacy and durability of response. We are prepared for the expected launch of our subQ formulation with its PDUFA date next week.
ABILIFY was up 12% in the quarter despite step down in contractual of net sales. The antipsychotic market in the U.S. sems to have stabilized after several quarters of decline, growing at roughly 3% in the quarter while ABILIFY prescriptions grew approximately twice the market. European sales were also strong.
Now let me give you just a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website. Gross margin was 73.1%, down 70 basis points compared to second quarter last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact from certain manufacturing variances year-over-year.
Advertising and promotion expenses were down 4% or 6%, excluding exchange at $253 million for the quarter. Less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle, was partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications. We expect A&P spend to soften in the second half of the year as we further manage PLAVIX and AVAPRO towards the end of their life cycle.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16%. This is due primarily to the pharmacy, which is recorded in G&A and the negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the pharmacy, MSMA was up 9% with approximately half driven by foreign exchange. We did have increases in investment spending behind YERVOY, NULOJIX and ELIQUIS.
R&D increased 8%, driven by overall portfolio spend and [indiscernible] acquisition. The effective overall tax rate was 27.9% in the quarter, earnings mix had a negative impact in the quarter and the pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I mentioned on the January call, I expect quarterly variability in the tax rate based on the timing of certain discrete items, which we expect to occur later this year.
As Lamberto mentioned, we raised our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our non-GAAP guidance for 2011 is now $2.20 to $2.30. Overall, we are seeing good sales trends for our key products, including YERVOY. At the same time, we are selectively increasing our investments in these products as we look to maximize the value of our portfolio.
As I update our line item guidance, let me point out that this guidance assumes current foreign exchange rate remain constant for the balance of 2011. We now expect sales to increase in the high single-digit range. Advertising and promotion is expected to decrease in the mid-single-digit range. MS&A is expected to grow in the high single-digit range. And we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26%. Please note that this includes the impact of certain tax discrete items expected to occur in the fourth quarter.
We have also confirmed our 2013 non-GAAP floor EPS guidance of $1.95. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

So very much in line with what we have projected. We were surprised at the number of patients that were moved i.e. stable patients that was more than what we expected. And then lastly, the warehouse of patients we saw was much larger in terms of patient that have brought in brought in for first-line and second line. So when we look at the dosing, we don't have accurate data yet but in general, and the feedback we're getting from physicians, that in the majority they're using the 3-milligram dose.

In that case, they lost about 85% of their demand in the first 2 months with only 2 generics and as you correctly say, we will not have the 180-day exclusivity period and therefore, we anticipate multiple generics coming in at the same time. I'd like to also remind folks that in the marketplace both the wholesalers and the retailers hold a fair amount of inventory. [indiscernible] the wholesalers is holding between 0.4 and 0.5 a month and retail holding as much as a one-month.

As we entered 2011, one of the drivers that put pressure on the tax rate with the nondeductibility of the pharmacy, as we look now throughout the full year of 2011, the increment to the high end of that range of our original guidance is primarily due to earnings mix between low and high tax jurisdictions.

We are constantly evaluating various tax planning opportunities that will hopefully have a positive impact on our rate and also PLAVIX is a U.S. based partner product.

While we have just completed a very good quarter and as you have seen, we have raised our guidance for 2011 and confirmed minimum non-GAAP guidance for 2013.  Our financial results were strong, with double-digit growth in sales.
Operationally, the execution of the YERVOY launch has already started delivering positive results and from an R&D perspective, we had several global regulatory approvals, including ELIQUIS and NULOJIX. For ELIQUIS, we also announced exciting top line data for our 4-stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Across all our operations globally, we continue to demonstrate that our bio-pharma strategy is on track, moving forward, and delivering results. Charlie will speak to the financials, working through the specifics. I will instead focus on some of the other key developments.
Clearly, a highlights of this quarter was the launch of YERVOY, approved in the U.S. in March, our breakthrough medicine for metastatic melanoma was officially launched early in the second quarter. And already, in its first 3 months on the U.S. market YERVOY sales were strong at $95 million. While some patient demand had been building up, pending YERVOY's approval, most of these initial sales were due to one simple and compelling fact. The product is good. And there is a very high demand for the first new treatment [indiscernible] and the first one ever to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit in this patient population. A key driver of YERVOY's strong initial sales was our ability to execute commercially, utilizing the new customer model we talked about during last quarter's call. We have received very positive feedback, both about the level of support we are providing, and the materials we are making available to the entire unit of care. Based on the initial success of YERVOY, supported by our new customer model, we'll adopt a similarly thoughtful, holistic and focused approach to commercializing all new products in all countries. The approach we take to thoroughly understanding the patient journey, and the needs of all the customers involved, will always remain core.
A few additional notes about YERVOY. Outside of the U.S., YERVOY was approved in Australia in June and it was just approved on July 14 in the European Union. And at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, we presented the results of the second Phase III study of YERVOY, results that again demonstrated improved overall survival in patients with the most aggressive form of cancer. So taken together, the approval, the launches, the clinical advances, this was an excellent quarter for YERVOY.
More generally, in addition to YERVOY, we had several other global regulatory successes. Most notable were the approvals of our 2 other new products: ELIQUIS and NULOJIX. ELIQUIS apixaban, was approved and launched in Europe for the prevention of VTE or venous thromboembolic events in adult patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery. Soon after, we announced top line results from our Phase III ARISTOTLE trial which demonstrated ELIQUIS superiority with respect to both test, safety and efficacy for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation compared to warfarin. This data will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology Meeting at the end of August, and we are still on target for submitting regulatory filings in the U.S. and E.U. later this year.
And NULOJIX belatacept, our first-in-class biologic immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant patients, was approved and launched in both the U.S. and Europe. As you know, we just received a negative opinion on dapagliflozin from the FDA's advisory committee. And while disappointed, I want you to know that we are not at all dissuaded, and that we and AstraZeneca will continue to work with the FDA. I'm saying this now because this is what we are supposed to say, but it's because we do believe in this product and remain firmly committed to its success.
And finally, adding to our overall good operating news during the quarter. We were informed by the FDA in June that the corrective actions we have taken at our Manati manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico has sufficiently addressed the matters identified in a 2010 FDA warning letter. I, and my management team, remain committed to ensuring the actions we took at the Manati site are maintained and that the Manati site, and all our other manufacturing sites, are in full compliance with both company and regulatory requirements.
Before passing the floor to Charlie, I want to mention 2 business development transactions that we just completed. Both of which happened in the end of the second quarter, but I think that they are worth mentioning. First, we announced the global agreement with Innate Pharma S.A., a biotech company in France, for the development and commercialization of a biologic in Phase I development. A good addition to our strong immuno-oncology portfolio. And just last week, we entered into an agreement to acquire Amira Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego-based company, that focuses on the discovery and development of medicine for the treatment of fibrotic disease. This is an area of increasing interest for us.
Again, taken together, it was a very good quarter. We delivered solid results across all our operations globally. And this not only increases my pride in our company, it also increases my confidence in our future. And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did had a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.56. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. In",1112,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did had a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.56. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. Included in our second quarter EPS is an incremental negative $0.03 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and to a lesser extent, the doughnut hole coverage, both of which went into effect in 2011.
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our second quarter financial results before we go to your questions.
We reported second quarter net sales of $5.4 billion, up 14% compared to last year. Volume were strong, providing the 5% favorable impact on sales. Price was also favorable by 5% and foreign exchange contributed 4% to sales. The U.S. healthcare reform coverage gap implemented in 2011, and E.U. measures, together had just over a 1% negative impact on sales. As I look at the second quarter sales performance, I am very encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes continued strong performance for BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL, ORENCIA, and as you've seen the YERVOY launch has been quite strong. As Lamberto discussed, we are pleased with the performance of YERVOY with sales of $95 million in the quarter. We believe this strong start reflects both the compelling profile of the drug and the execution of our commercial model. We are breaking YERVOY's sales into 3 categories: a stocking element, a bolus or onetime element and underlying demand. As expected, wholesalers are holding what we consider normal levels of inventory. Our preliminary estimates are that the bolus accounted for approximately 30% of our Q2 sales. We believe the majority of the bolus was driven by a warehouse effect and patients on current therapy being switched on to YERVOY before disease progression. As we move into Q3, we will get a better sense of the actual size of the bolus and whether it has fully run its course. The largest driver of our Q2 sales was strong demand. New patient starts are split, approximately 40% in first line and 60% in second line, and the majority of demand has been driven by physicians experienced with YERVOY. For the remainder of the year, the YERVOY sales range will be dependent on a few factors, the actual size and depletion of the bolus and the extent to which we can broaden our physician base beyond the current prescriber set and expand the patient pool.
As I move to the rest of our product performance, please remember that foreign exchange did have a positive impact on all of our Global Brands. Performance, excluding foreign exchange, is available on our website.
BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B, was up 31% including 33% growth internationally. BARACLUDE's long-term efficacy, safety and 5-year resistance data has strengthened its position as the preferred first-line agent. The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $112 million, a 38% increase sequentially versus the first quarter. The franchise delivered 22% prescription growth versus 6% for the class. Going forward, we are focused on commercial execution and positioning our data in renal patients and our head-to-head study versus SUs. SPRYCEL was up 46% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. U.S. prescriptions were up 11%, and our market share in the U.S. increased to roughly 10%, or parity with Tasigna. ORENCIA was up 28% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice, highlighting efficacy and durability of response. We are prepared for the expected launch of our subQ formulation with its PDUFA date next week. ABILIFY was up 12% in the quarter despite the step down in contractual of net sales. The antipsychotic market in the U.S. sems to have stabilized after several quarters of decline, growing at roughly 3% in the quarter, while ABILIFY prescriptions grew approximately twice the market. European sales were also strong.
Now let me give you just a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website.
Gross margin was 73.1%, down 70 basis points compared to second quarter last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact from certain manufacturing variances year-over-year. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 4% or 6%, excluding exchange, at $253 million for the quarter. Less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle, was partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications. We expect A&P spend to soften in the second half of the year as we further manage PLAVIX and AVAPRO towards the end of their life cycle. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16%. This is due primarily to the pharmacy, which is recorded in G&A, and the negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the pharmacy, MS&A was up 9%, with approximately half driven by foreign exchange. We did have increases in investment spending behind YERVOY, NULOJIX and ELIQUIS. R&D increased 8%, driven by overall portfolio spend and the ZymoGenetics acquisition. The effective overall tax rate was 27.9% in the quarter, earnings mix had a negative impact in the quarter and the pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I mentioned on the January call, I expect quarterly variability in the tax rate based on the timing of certain discrete items, which we expect to occur later this year.
As Lamberto mentioned, we raised our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our non-GAAP guidance for 2011 is now $2.20 to $2.30. Overall, we are seeing good sales trends for our key products, including YERVOY. At the same time, we are selectively increasing our investments in these products as we look to maximize the value of our portfolio. As I update our line item guidance, let me point out that this guidance assumes current foreign exchange rate remain constant for the balance of 2011. We now expect sales to increase in the high single digit range. Advertising and promotion is expected to decrease in the mid-single digit range. MS&A is expected to grow in the high single digit range. And we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26%. Please note that this includes the impact of certain tax discrete items expected to occur in the fourth quarter. We have also confirmed our 2013 non-GAAP floor EPS guidance of $1.95. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

Second, what percentage of real-world dosing is at 10 milligrams rather than the labeled 3-milligram dosing? And then third, on YERVOY, how should we think about third quarter sales sequentially? Should we expect them to be up or down from what you reported in the second quarter?

And then lastly, the warehouse of patients we saw was much larger in terms of patient that have been brought in on both first-line and second-line. So when we look at the dosing, we don't have accurate data, yet but in general and the feedback we're getting from physicians, that in the majority they're using the 3-milligram dose.

You're asking about resources. We are allocating the right resources to both products and it's clear that, for ELIQUIS, we have under way a good analysis of whether additional resources are needed, because of the different profile that we now have from what our base case was projecting.

I'd like to also remind folks that in the marketplace, both the wholesalers and the retailers hold a fair amount of inventory. Our data shows the wholesalers holding between 0.4 and 0.5 a month and retail holding as much as a one-month.

And as it relates to 2011, it was primarily sales-driven, YERVOY in part. But if you look across the rest of our brands, we've also seen very strong performance, particularly, sequentially quarter-to-quarter from Q1 to Q2. So we're very encouraged by that."

So the first thing I will say is that it's confirmed that there is a huge opportunity beyond what product size already capturing of the market. It's certainly an unsatisfying market. We don't medically need and we see with our launch benefit of working very closely with the cardiologists soon a launch that would comprise. It is one that pulled away to cardiologist education, as well as patient and physician integration. So that's very important. Well we learn from them, too, that we need to understand a bit more in that, what's going on between the cardiologist and general practitioners, as well as some internist. Because that's linked between the 2 are going to be critical for the speed of adoption of the time once you have passed the first wave of cardiology prescriptions. So we are looking at that intently. We are preparing with Pfizer on what's the best customer model to bring our product to the customers as soon as we can do that. And that's important to us to realize that the huge opportunity needs to come with the appropriate customer model the way we have done these results upon us."

As we look at the YERVOY data at the moment, plan to determine the actual number of patients is kind of tough.

But we've done some calculations, which would put the numbers in excess of 1,000 at least at this particular stage and we'll keep digging down to try and make sure we understand what the situation is. As we break the data up, it's pretty clear we're getting more usage in the second line at the moment, but first line is much higher than we thought it would be at about 40%. PLAVIX itself continues to be a unique success story. It is, without doubt, a wonderful treatment for a broad range of patients. And our sales from the U.S. were up about 17% this year and about 7% higher than last quarter. Driven primarily by price and inventory build, as well as some decreased demand in higher Medicaid Part D rebates. If you look at the TRX data, we're down about 4% but if you look at the volume in terms of actual capital. That's only down about 2%, showing that the prescriptions has actually got slightly longer. The market itself is slightly softer due to a decreased level of spend. But the rest of the business is fairly flat and we are holding out market share quite strongly."

Very different situation from ONGLYZA because that was a true large unmet medical need and there don't seem to be a treatment in our share as we saw in the diabetes market. So clearly, looking at what's happening there, we need to understand now the relationship between the cardiologist and the general practitioner to see how we create the right form for the prescription to go fast. However, we have here very strong data. We have head-to-head comparison with a standard of care, whether we are depending on the patient profile or warfarin or we'll have we that also an update. So we have a broad scope of data, we have work that have been done already to educate by boys here our product staff. So we believe the penetration could be significantly only faster than ONGLYZA. And obviously, we are spending a lot of time now trying to optimize that in an even better fashion. YERVOY EU, we are very pleased because we got the approval on the 14th of July, so you can imagine that was an important moment for team. And we have now launched in Germany, in Sweden and in the Netherlands. So this is early days, because it's only 2 weeks. We are planning to launch in the U.K. as soon as we have final clearance probably for May and August. And all that we hear from our investigators and our subscribers of potential interest for very important. We have worked very carefully with all the governments to look at how to transition that market-by-market the European access program. As you know, in Europe there are different regulations according to countries and therefore we are moving in that EPE program depending on the market. In the market like Germany where we have launched, we have launched after the similar price as the U.S. it was $30,000 per infusion it's about EUR 21,000. And as you know, in Europe, we discussed country-by-country over time, so our price will come through the access negotiation on a country-by-country basis.

Elliott enjoys these calls and would like to be here, but he recently had some knee surgery and he's recovering well. He enjoys participating, as I said, and he's looking forward to the October call. So with Brian for Q&A, also we have Beatrice Cazala, Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations with responsibility for commercialization, Europe and emerging markets; as well as Tony Hooper, Senior Vice President Commercial Operations with responsibility for the U.S., Japan and rest of world.
Before we get started, I'll take care of the legal requirements. During this call, we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and reports on 10-Q and 8-K. These documents are available from the SEC, the BMS website or from Bristol-Myers Investor Relations.
In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change.
During the call, we'll also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to include certain cost expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available on our website. Lamberto?"

While we have just completed a very good quarter and as you have seen, we have raised our guidance for 2011 and confirmed minimum non-GAAP guidance for 2013. Our financial results were strong, with double-digit growth in sales.
Operationally, the execution of the YERVOY launch has already started delivering positive results and from an R&D perspective, we had several global regulatory approvals, including ELIQUIS and NULOJIX. For ELIQUIS, we also announced exciting top line data for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Across all our operations globally, we continue to demonstrate that our bio-pharma strategy is on track, moving forward, and delivering results. Charlie will speak to the financials, work you through the specifics. I will instead focus on some of the other key developments.
Clearly, a highlight of this quarter was the launch of YERVOY. Approved in the U.S. in March, our breakthrough medicine for metastatic melanoma was officially launched early in the second quarter. And already, in its first 3 months on the U.S. market YERVOY sales were strong at $95 million. While some patient demand had been building up pending YERVOY's approval, most of these initial sales were due to one simple and compelling fact: the product is good. And there is a very high demand for the first new treatment in over a decade and the first one ever to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit in this patient population.
A key driver of YERVOY's strong initial sales was our ability to execute commercially, utilizing the new customer model we talked about during last quarter's call. We have received very positive feedback, both about the level of support we are providing and the materials we are making available to the entire unit of care. Based on the initial success of YERVOY, supported by our new customer model, we'll adopt a similarly thoughtful, holistic and focused approach to commercializing all new products in all countries. The approach we take to thoroughly understanding the patient journey and the needs of all the customers involved, will always remain core.
A few additional notes about YERVOY. Outside of the U.S., YERVOY was approved in Australia in June and it was just approved on July 14 in the European Union. And at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, we presented the results of the second Phase III study of YERVOY, results that again demonstrated improved overall survival in patients with the most aggressive form of cancer. So taken together, the approval, the launches, the clinical advances, this was an excellent quarter for YERVOY.
More generally, in addition to YERVOY, we had several other global regulatory successes. Most notable were the approvals of our 2 other new products: ELIQUIS and NULOJIX. ELIQUIS (apixaban) was approved and launched in Europe for the prevention of VTE or venous thromboembolic events in adult patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery. Soon after, we announced top line results from our Phase III ARISTOTLE trial which demonstrated ELIQUIS' superiority with respect to both safety and efficacy for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation compared to warfarin. This data will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology Meeting at the end of August, and we are still on target for submitting regulatory filings in the U.S. and E.U. later this year.
And NULOJIX (belatacept), our first-in-class biologic immunosuppressive therapy for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplantation, was approved and launched in both the U.S. and Europe.
As you know, we just received a negative opinion on dapagliflozin from the FDA's advisory committee. And while disappointed, I want you to know that we are not at all dissuaded, and that we and AstraZeneca will continue to work with the FDA. I'm saying this not because this is what we are supposed to say, but it's because we do believe in this product and remain firmly committed to its success.
And finally, adding to our overall good operating news during the quarter, we were informed by the FDA in June that the corrective actions we have taken at our Manati manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico has sufficiently addressed the matters identified in a 2010 FDA warning letter. I and my management team remain committed to ensuring the actions we took at the Manati site are maintained and that the Manati site, and all our other manufacturing sites, are in full compliance with both company and regulatory requirements.
Before passing the floor to Charlie, I want to mention 2 business development transactions that we just completed, both of which happened in the end of the second quarter, but I think that they are worth mentioning. First, we announced a global agreement with Innate Pharma S.A., a biotech company in France, for the development and commercialization of a biologic in Phase I development, a good addition to our strong immuno-oncology portfolio. And just last week, we entered into an agreement to acquire Amira Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego-based company that focuses on the discovery and development of medicine for the treatment of fibrotic disease. This is an area of increasing interest for us.
Again, taken together, it was a very good quarter. We delivered solid results across all our operations globally. And this not only increases my pride in our company, it also increases my confidence in our future. And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."

We did had a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.56. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. In",1111,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did had a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.56. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and a higher effective tax rate compared to the same period last year. Included in our second quarter EPS is an incremental negative $0.03 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and, to a lesser extent, the doughnut hole coverage, both of which went into effect in 2011.
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our second quarter financial results before we go to your questions.
We reported second quarter net sales of $5.4 billion, up 14% compared to last year. Volume was strong, providing a 5% favorable impact on sales. Price was also favorable by 5% and foreign exchange contributed 4% to sales. The U.S. healthcare reform coverage gap implemented in 2011, and E.U. measures, together had just over a 1% negative impact on sales.
As I look at the second quarter sales performance, I am very encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes continued strong performance for BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL, ORENCIA, and as you've seen, the YERVOY launch has been quite strong. As Lamberto discussed, we are pleased with the performance of YERVOY with sales of $95 million in the quarter. We believe this strong start reflects both the compelling profile of the drug and the execution of our commercial model.
We are breaking YERVOY's sales into 3 categories: a stocking element, a bolus or onetime element, and underlying demand. As expected, wholesalers are holding what we consider normal levels of inventory. Our preliminary estimates are that the bolus accounted for approximately 30% of our Q2 sales. We believe the majority of the bolus was driven by a warehouse effect and patients on current therapy being switched onto YERVOY before disease progression. As we move into Q3, we will get a better sense of the actual size of the bolus and whether it has fully run its course. The largest driver of our Q2 sales was strong demand. New patient starts are split, approximately 40% in first line and 60% in second line, and the majority of demand has been driven by physicians experienced with YERVOY. For the remainder of the year, the YERVOY sales range will be dependent on a few factors: the actual size and depletion of the bolus and the extent to which we can broaden our physician base beyond the current prescriber set and expand the patient pool.
As I move to the rest of our product performance, please remember that foreign exchange did have a positive impact on all of our global brands. Performance, excluding foreign exchange, is available on our website.
BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B, was up 31% including 33% growth internationally. BARACLUDE's long-term efficacy, safety and 5-year resistance data has strengthened its position as the preferred first-line agent.
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $112 million, a 38% increase sequentially versus the first quarter. The franchise delivered 22% prescription growth versus 6% for the class. Going forward, we are focused on commercial execution and positioning our data in renal patients and our head-to-head study versus SUs.
SPRYCEL was up 46% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. U.S. prescriptions were up 11%, and our market share in the U.S. increased to roughly 10%, or parity with Tasigna.
ORENCIA was up 28% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice, highlighting efficacy and durability of response. We are prepared for the expected launch of our subQ formulation with its PDUFA date next week.
ABILIFY was up 12% in the quarter despite the step-down in our contractual share of net sales. The antipsychotic market in the U.S. seems to have stabilized after several quarters of decline, growing at roughly 3% in the quarter, while ABILIFY prescriptions grew at approximately twice the market. European sales were also strong.
Now let me give you just a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website.
Gross margin was 73.1%, down 70 basis points compared to second quarter last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact from certain manufacturing variances year-over-year.
Advertising and promotion expenses were down 4%, or 6% excluding exchange, at $253 million for the quarter. Less spending on the promotion of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, products at the end of their life cycle, was partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications. We expect A&P spend to soften in the second half of the year as we further manage PLAVIX and AVAPRO towards the end of their life cycle.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16%. This is due primarily to the pharmacy, which is recorded in G&A, and the negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the pharmacy, MS&A was up 9%, with approximately half driven by foreign exchange. We did have increases in investment spending behind YERVOY, NULOJIX and ELIQUIS.
R&D increased 8%, driven by overall portfolio spend and the ZymoGenetics acquisition.
The effective overall tax rate was 27.9% in the quarter. Earnings mix had a negative impact in the quarter and the pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I mentioned on the January call, I expect quarterly variability in the tax rate based on the timing of certain discrete items, which we expect to occur later this year.
As Lamberto mentioned, we raised our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our non-GAAP guidance for 2011 is now $2.20 to $2.30. Overall, we are seeing good sales trends for our key products, including YERVOY. At the same time, we are selectively increasing our investments in these products as we look to maximize the value of our portfolio.
As I update our line item guidance, let me point out that this guidance assumes current foreign exchange rates remain constant for the balance of 2011. We now expect sales to increase in the high single-digit range. Advertising and promotion is expected to decrease in the mid single-digit range. MS&A is expected to grow in the high single-digit range. And we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26%. Please note that this includes the impact of certain tax discrete items expected to occur in the fourth quarter. We have also confirmed our 2013 non-GAAP floor EPS guidance of $1.95. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

Second, what percentage of real-world dosing is at 10 milligrams rather than the labeled 3-milligram dosing? And then third, on YERVOY, how should we think about third quarter sales sequentially?

But our extrapolations show that only between, probably, $3 million and $5 million of our sales were the evolution of patients from the EAP program to a commercial supply. So very much in line with what we had projected. We were surprised at the number of patients that were moved, i.e. stable switched patients. That was more than what we had expected. And then lastly, the warehouse of patients we saw was much larger in terms of patients that have been brought in on both first-line and second-line. So when we look at the dosing, we don't have accurate data yet, but in general and the feedback we're getting from physicians, that in the majority they're using the 3-milligram dose. And last but not least, as I look into Q3 I think the bolus will, by definition, roll into Q3 to an extent because of the dosage being 12 weeks.

So that should give you a sense of how we implement our share repurchase program. As it relates to capital allocation, I think we've been very consistent on this. We look across the board at capital allocation as it relates to business development and shareholder distributions. We try to have a balanced approach. We think, at this stage, our best return on our capital is business development, but we will remain disciplined.

When we lose the patent on May 17, 2012, we do expect generic erosion to occur very quickly. I think we've run a model with about the last 7 generic erosions, but I probably believe that the recent case with Cozzar provides a useful data point. In that case, they lost about 85% of their demand in the first 2 months with only 2 generics, and as you correctly say, we will not have the 180-day exclusivity period and therefore, we anticipate multiple generics coming at the same time. I'd like to also remind folks that in the marketplace, both the wholesalers and the retailers hold a fair amount of inventory. Our data shows the wholesalers holding between 0.4 and 0.5 a month and retail holding as much as a month. So if you're selling about $550 million a month, that's about $750 million of stock, and therefore we expect that the actual x factory sales are going to be dramatically different to what the end market demand will be post loss of exclusivity."

It's certainly an unsatisfied market with unmet medical need and we see with our launch benefit of working very closely with the cardiologists through a launch that would comprise. It is one that falls away to cardiologist education, as well as patient and physician integration. So that's very important. Well, we learn from them, too, that we need to understand a bit more in that, what's going on between the cardiologist and general practitioners, as well as some internist. Because that's link between the 2 are going to be critical for the speed of adoption of the time, once you have passed the first wave of cardiology prescriptions. So we are looking at that intently.

PLAVIX itself continues to be a unique success story. It is, without doubt, a wonderful treatment for a broad range of patients. And our sales from the U.S. were up about 17% this year and about 7% higher than last quarter, driven primarily by price and inventory build, as well as some decreased demand and higher Medicaid Part D rebates. If you look at the TRx data, we're down about 4%, but if you look at the volume in terms of actual capital, that's only down about 2%, showing that the prescriptions have actually got slightly longer. The market itself is slightly softer due to a decreased level of stents, but the rest of the business is fairly flat and we are holding out market share quite strongly."

Very different situation from ONGLYZA, because that was a true large unmet medical need and there don't seem to be a treatment in our share, as we saw in the diabetes market. So clearly, looking at what's happening there, we need to understand now the relationship between the cardiologist and the general practitioner, to see how we create the right form for the prescription to grow fast. However, we have here very strong data. We have head-to-head comparison with a standard of care, whether we are depending on the patient profile as it was with warfarin -- or we'll have -- we have data also on aspirin. So we have a broad scope of data. We have work that have been done already to educate by both [indiscernible] here our product staff. So we believe the penetration could be significantly faster than ONGLYZA. And obviously, we are spending a lot of time now trying to optimize that in an even better fashion. YERVOY EU, we are very pleased because we got the approval on the 14th of July, so you can imagine that was an important moment for the team. And we have now launched in Germany, in Sweden and in the Netherlands. So this is early days, because it's only 2 weeks. We are planning to launch in the U.K. as soon as we have final clearance, probably in August. And all what we hear from our investigators and our subscribers of potential interest for the price [ph] are very important. We have worked very carefully with all the governments to look at how to transition that market-by-market, the European access program. As you know, in Europe there are different regulations according to countries and therefore we are moving in that EAP program depending on the market. In the market like Germany where we have launched, we have launched at the similar price as the U.S. It was $30,000 per infusion. It's about EUR 21,000. And as you know, in Europe, we discussed country-by-country over time, so our price will come through the access negotiation on a country-by-country basis.

Before I talk about the results of the third quarter, I want to note a few management changes that we have recently made, changes that underscore our commitment, growth and recognize the talent of our senior executives. I have promoted Giovanni",791,"Thank you. Before I talk about the results of the third quarter, I want to note a few management changes that we have recently made, changes that underscore our commitment, growth and recognize the talent of our senior executives. I have promoted Giovanni President of U.S. pharmaceutical and he has joined by senior management team. Giovanni is a physician with a strong business background, and this is a natural career step that builds on his senior operational experience and strategic leadership in our European U.S. and global commercialization units. And I also find that Charlie Bancroft and Beatrice Cazala for the position of Executive Vice President standing their respective growth and responsibility. Naturally, I'm very pleased by how these changes will strengthen our already strong management team. 
So with that, let's go back to the subject of this call. We have just completed another very good quarter with strong sales financial and significant R&D and business development activities achievements. In the short, we proved that once again, that our value BioPharma strategy is on track, delivering results today while building a sound foundation for tomorrow. With third quarter net sales of $5.3 billion, we delivered an 11% increase over last year. That is double digit growth for the second straight quarter. We also reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 in the quarter compared to $0.59 a year ago. Our top line performance was strong across a wide range of products. This includes, of course, YERVOY, our breakthrough treatment for metastatic melanoma, which in only its second quarter in the market, has worldwide sales of $121 million. I note the sales would have been $148 million instead of $121 million if we have not changed our returns policy, which Charlie will describe later in the call. 
During the second quarter, we launched YERVOY in Europe with a few countries that have already started recording sales while others have initiated their pricing and reimbursement discussions. In the U.S., brand awareness of YERVOY is at virtually 100%, and the number of accounts ordering the products continued to increase month-over-month. And most importantly, update for YERVOY remain strong, both in hospitals and community-based treatment centers. 
Moving to our pipeline, we continue to deliver good news, most notable of which was the announcement of the full results of the ARISTOTLE clinical trial of ELIQUIS, apixaban, at the EFC Congress in Paris. The results are that Phase III study were very volatile and demonstrated ELIQUIS statistical superiority to warfarin a with respect to reducing the risk of stroke and reducing the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation Is the leading cause of stroke, affecting approximately 10 million patients worldwide. The results were remarkably consistent across all subgroups and demonstrated that statistically significant improvement in mortality. 
This is a very important, very important development, one that underscores the strength and promise of our pipeline. And I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work of our desert research and development organization and staff commitment to both follow the signs and work in good sync with the business organization in the development of ELIQUIS.  In Europe, we have already launched ELIQUIS for embolic events, and we'll let you know the AP submission has been accepted in the U.S. and when the get a PDUFA date, which we should receive before the end of the year. 
Business development continues to be a priority and how we think about capital allocation and strengthening our pipeline. We have had 5 key pipeline development created into our single build initiative in the last few months. We started off the third quarter with an agreement with Pharma for the development and commercialization of in one of oncology biologics in Phase I. And then other one to acquire Amira Pharmaceuticals, a company focused on small molecules for fibrotic diseases. Through an agreement with we then received exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize immunobiologics in diabetes and heart disease. And very important for our immuno-oncology portfolio, through an agreement with Pharmaceuticals, we expanded our territorial rights on the anti PD-1 that we are developing for a variety of tumor types including renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. 
Finally, we announced yesterday our new partnership with to develop and commercialize a fix gross dose combination concerning our and boosting agent 
So taken as a whole, it was a very good quarter for us. Executing against our biopharma strategy, we continue to drive short-term results while building a solid long-term foundation, delivering strong sales while strengthening our pipeline. This is a good timing, the luck of our company, but we do not rest on our laurels. We delivered today and plan for tomorrow. Thank you. And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."
25798,141283814,179094,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Lamberto. We did have a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in investment spending, the pharmacy and a higher effective tax rate versus the same period la",1187,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did have a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in investment spending, the pharmacy and a higher effective tax rate versus the same period last year. Included in our third quarter EPS is a negative $0.04 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and the coverage, both of which were incremental in 2011. 
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our third quarter financial results before we go to your questions. We reported third quarter net sales of $5.3 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Volumes were strong providing a 6% favorable impact on sales, the price was favorable by 2% and foreign exchange contributed 3% of sales. The U.S. Healthcare Reform Coverage Act implemented in 2011 and EU measures together had just under a  3% negative impact on sales. 
As I look at the third quarter sales performance, I'm very encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important for our future growth. This includes continued strong performance for BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. This was another very good quarter for YERVOY, and we believe this reflects both a compelling profile of the drug and the execution of our commercial model. 
As Lamberto mentioned, we reported YERVOY sales of $121 million in the quarter. Excluding the sales deferral, YERVOY sales would have been $148 million. Last quarter, we discussed U.S. YERVOY sales in 3 categories, a stocking element, a bolus or onetime element and underlying demand. I'll cover those 3 again, but first, I'll address the sales deferral. As a result of our customer model and our ability to connect with the entire unit of care, we have identified an opportunity to implement a new returns policy to alleviate financial concerns related to potential of YERVOY returns. Since the prevalence of this disease is quite low, many community oncologists see only a few patients each year. If the intended patient does not use the ordered drug, it may be sometime before the oncologists has another eligible patient. We believe that the new policy will remove such concerns and facilitate greater uptake by these physicians. 
From a historical perspective, typically, we use our returns trend based on history of returns, but we don't yet have enough history to reliably estimate the returns for YERVOY under this new policy. So accounting standards require that the only book the sale when the product is used. As a result, we are deferring $27 million in sales, which corresponds to our estimate of the inventory in the channel at the end of Q3. 
Now back to the 3 categories of U.S. YERVOY sales. Wholesalers are holding approximately 2 to 3 weeks of inventory, which is a build of $10 million to $15 million this quarter. We estimate that the bolus accounted for about  $10 million to $20 million of our Q2 sales, and the we should see little to no impact moving forward. The largest driver of our third quarter sales were strong demand. New patient starts are split approximately 60% in first line and 40% in second line. Access and reimbursement has gone very well, and we now have a C code, allowing hospitals to be reimbursed. And we expect a pertinent J curve in January. 
As Lamberto the mentioned, we are in the process of launching YERVOY in Europe and reported $12 million in international sales. We are working with authorities to try and obtain full reimbursement in the major European markets, which is expected over the course of 2012. 
As I move to the rest of our product performance, please remember that foreign exchange did have a positive impact on all of our global brands. Performance excluding foreign exchange is available on our website. BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B, was up 36%, including 43% growth internationally. BARACLUDE's long-term efficacy, safety and 5-year resistance data has strengthened its position as the preferred first-line agent. 
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $127 million, a 13% increase sequentially versus the second quarter. The franchise delivered 15% prescription growth versus 5% for the class. Going forward, we are focused on commercial execution and positioning our data in renal patients and our head-to-head study versus SUs. 
SPRYCEL was up 47% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. In the U.S., our rolling 3-month share indicates we are the leading second-generation agent in first line with over a 15% share. 
ORENCIA was up 27% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice, highlighting efficacy and durability of response. We have recently launched our subQ formulation, allowing us to compete in the 2/3 of the market that is currently subQ. 
ABILIFY was up 14% in the quarter despite the step down in our contractual share of net sale. ABILIFY were up 4% in the U.S., roughly double the market growth. International sales were also strong up 27%. 
Now let me give you a few comments on the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website. Gross margin was 74%, up 10 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 11% at $205 million for the quarter, less spending on the promotional of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, which partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications. 
Marketing, selling and admin expenses increased 15%. This due primary to the pharmacy which is recorded in G&A and the negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the pharmacy, MS&A was up 10% with just under half driven by foreign exchange. We did have increases in investment spending behind YERVOY, and ELIQUIS. 
R&D increased 8% driven by overall portfolio spend and the ZymoGenetics acquisition. The effective overall tax rate was 26.4% in the quarter. The increase, compared to the third quarter 2010 is primarily due to certain tax settlement last year. Earnings mix had a negative impact in this quarter, and the pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I've mentioned, I expect a favorable impact from the resolution of certain discrete items during the fourth quarter. 
We have refined our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our non-GAAP guidance for 2011 is now $2.25 to $2.30. Overall, we are seeing good sales trends for our key products including YERVOY. At the same time, we are selectively increasing our investments in these products as we look to maximize the value of our portfolio. The only change to our line item guidance is MS&A where we now expect a low double digit increase. As I look back over 2011, there are 2 main drivers from our original expectations for MS&A. First, based on changes in FX, we've seen a more negative impact. Second, we have increased investment in our products that should contribute to our long-term growth. I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

You had a question on ELIQUIS labeling and what is needed. It's pretty mature to talk about labeling at this point. Certainly, the clinical data needs to be and the label to fully inform the type of clinical investigation that was done. But I think what's needed in this field is an anticoagulant that's oral, better than Coumadin in both efficacy and safety. Essentially, physicians, I believe, are looking for an improved therapeutic window. They know Coumadin well as having a narrow therapeutic window, and I think they are very concerned, in general, about delivering adequate anticoagulation to achieve superiority in stroke prevention while improving the side effect profile of available medicines. So this, I think, will expand the market to the 40% or 50% of patients that are not on Coumadin but should be. And be a very important option for patients that are anticoagulant it because it's better in efficacy and better in safety."

Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about the results of the third quarter, I want to note a few management changes that we have recently made, changes that underscore our commitment, growth and recognize the talent of our senior executives. 
I have promoted Giovanni Caforio to President U.S. pharmaceuticals, and he has joined my senior management team. Giovanni is a physician with a strong business background, and this is a natural career step that builds on his senior operational experience and strategic leadership in our European, U.S. and global commercialization units. 
And I've also appointed Charlie Bancroft and Beatrice Cazala for the position of Executive Vice President, expanding their respective roles and responsibilities. Naturally, I am very pleased by how these changes will strengthen our already strong management team. 
So with that, let's go back to the subject of this call. We have just completed another very good quarter with strong sales, solid financials and significant R&D and business development achievements. In short, we proved that once again, that our BioPharma strategy is on track, delivering results today, while building a sound foundation for tomorrow. 
With third quarter net sales of $5.3 billion, we delivered an 11% increase over last year. That is double-digit growth for the second straight quarter. We also reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 in the quarter compared to $0.59 a year ago. Our top line performance was strong across a wide range of products. This include, of course, YERVOY, our breakthrough treatment for metastatic melanoma, which in only its second quarter on the market, had worldwide sales of $121 million. I note that sales should have been $148 million instead of $121 million if we have not changed our returns policy, which Charlie will describe later in the call. 
During the second quarter, we launched YERVOY in Europe with a few countries that have already started recording sales, while others have initiated their pricing and reimbursement discussions. In the U.S., brand awareness of YERVOY is at virtually 100%, and the number of accounts ordering the products continued to increase month-over-month. And most importantly, update for YERVOY remains strong, both in hospitals and community-based treatment centers. 
Moving to our pipeline, we continue to deliver good news, most notable of which was the announcement of the full results of the ARISTOTLE clinical trial on ELIQUIS, apixaban at the ESC Congress in Paris. The results are that Phase III studies were very positive and demonstrated ELIQUIS statistical superiority to warfarin with respect to reducing the risk of stroke and reducing the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the leading cause of stroke, affecting approximately 10 million patients worldwide. The results were remarkably consistent across all subgroups and demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mortality. 
This is a very important, very encouraging development, one that underscores the strength and promise of our pipeline. And I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work of our research and development organization and it's their steadfast commitment to both follow the science and work in good sync with the business organization in the development of ELIQUIS. In Europe, we have already launched ELIQUIS for venous thromboembolic events, VTE, and we'll let you know when the AZ submission has been accepted in the U.S. and we get -- when the get a PDUFA date, which we should receive before the end of the year. 
Business development continues to be a priority in how we think about capital allocation and strengthening our pipeline. We have had 5 key pipeline development related to our single pill initiative in the last few months. We started off the third quarter with an agreement with Innate Pharma for the development and commercialization of a novel immuno-oncology biologic in Phase I. And then other one, to acquire Amira Pharmaceuticals, a company focused on small molecules for fibrotic diseases. Through an agreement with Ambrix, we then received exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize novel biologics in diabetes and heart disease. And very important for our immuno-oncology portfolio, through an agreement with Ono Pharmaceuticals, we expanded our territorial rights on the anti PD-1 that we are developing for a variety of tumor types including renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. 
Finally, we announced yesterday our new partnership with Gilead to develop and commercialize fixed dose combination containing our REYATAZ and their boosting agent cobicistat.
So taken as a whole, it was a very good quarter for us. Executing against our biopharma strategy, we continue to drive short-term results while building a solid long-term foundation, delivering strong sales while strengthening our pipeline. This is a good timing, the life of our company. But we do not rest on our laurels. We deliver today and plan for tomorrow. Thank you. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."
25798,141283814,179346,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Lamberto. We did have a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in investment spending, the pharmacy and a higher effective tax rate versus the same period la",1194,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did have a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in investment spending, the pharmacy and a higher effective tax rate versus the same period last year. Included in our third quarter EPS is a negative $0.04 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and donut hole the coverage, both of which were incremental in 2011. 
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our third quarter financial results before we go to your questions. We reported third quarter net sales of $5.3 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Volume were strong, providing a 6% favorable impact on sale. Price was favorable by 2%, and foreign exchange contributed 3% of sales. The U.S. healthcare reform coverage gap implemented in 2011 and EU measures, together at just under a 3% negative impact on sales. 
As I look at the third quarter sales performance, I am very encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important for our future growth. This includes continued strong performance for BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. This was another very good quarter for YERVOY, and we believe this reflects both a compelling profile of the drug and the execution of our commercial model. 
As Lamberto mentioned, we reported YERVOY sales of $121 million in the quarter. Excluding the sales deferral, YERVOY sales would have been $148 million. Last quarter, we discussed U.S. YERVOY sales in 3 categories: A stocking element, a bolus or onetime element and underlying demand. I'll cover those 3 again, but first, I'll address the sales deferral. As a result of our customer model and our ability to connect with the entire unit of care, we've identified an opportunity to implement a new returns policy to alleviate financial concerns physicians have raised related to potential YERVOY returns. 
Since the prevalence of this disease is quite low, many community oncologists see only a few patients each year. If the intended patient does not use the ordered drug, it may be some time before the oncologists has another eligible patient. We believe that the new policy will remove such concerns and facilitate greater uptake by these physicians. 
From a historical perspective, typically, we use a returns trend based on history of returns, but we don't yet have enough history to reliably estimate the returns for YERVOY under this new policy. So accounting standards require that we only book the sale when the product is used. As a result, we are deferring $27 million of sales, which corresponds to our estimate of the inventory in the channel at the end of Q3. 
Now back to the 3 categories of U.S. YERVOY sales. Wholesalers are holding approximately 2 to 3 weeks of inventory, which is a build of $10 million to $15 million this quarter. We estimate that the bolus accounted for about  $10 million to $20 million of our Q3 sales, and that we should see little to no impact moving forward. The largest driver of our third quarter sales were strong demand. New patient starts are split approximately 60% in first line and 40% in second line. Access in reimbursement has gone very well, and we now have a C code, allowing hospitals to be reimbursed. And we expect a permanent J code in January. 
As Lamberto the mentioned, we are in the process of launching YERVOY in Europe and reported $12 million in international sales. We are working with authorities to try and obtain full reimbursement in the major European markets, which is expected over the course of 2012. 
As I move to the rest of our product performance, please remember that foreign exchange did have a positive impact on all of our global brands. Performance excluding foreign exchange is available on our website. BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B, was up 36%, including 43% growth internationally. BARACLUDE's long-term efficacy, safety and 5-year resistance data has strengthened its position as the preferred first-line agent. 
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $127 million, a 13% increase sequentially versus the second quarter. The franchise delivered 15% prescription growth versus 5% for the class. Going forward, we are focused on commercial execution and positioning our data in renal patients and our head-to-head study versus SUs. 
SPRYCEL was up 47% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. In the U.S., our rolling 3-month share indicates we are the leading second-generation agent in first line with over a 15% share. 
ORENCIA was up 27% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice, highlighting efficacy and durability of response. We have recently launched our subQ formulation, allowing us to compete in the 2/3 of the market that is currently subQ.
ABILIFY was up 14% in the quarter despite the step down in our contractual share of net sale. ABILIFY's prescriptions were up 4% in the U.S., roughly double the market growth. International sales were also strong, up 27%. 
Now let me give you just a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website. Gross margin was 74%, up 10 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 11% at $205 million for the quarter, less spending on the promotional of PLAVIX and AVAPRO, which partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications. 
Marketing, selling and admin expenses increased 15%. This due primary to the pharmacy which is recorded in G&A and the negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the pharmacy, MS&A was up 10% with just under half driven by foreign exchange. We did have increases in investment spending behind YERVOY, NULOJIX, and ELIQUIS.
R&D increased 8% driven by overall portfolio spend and the ZymoGenetics acquisition. The effective overall tax rate was 26.4% in the quarter. The increase, compared to the third quarter 2010, is primarily due to certain tax settlements last year. Earnings mix had a negative impact in this quarter, and the pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I've mentioned, I expect a favorable impact from the resolution of certain discrete items during the fourth quarter. 
We have refined our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our non-GAAP guidance for 2011 is now $2.25 to $2.30. Overall, we are seeing good sales trends for our key products including YERVOY.

The only change to our line item guidance is MS&A, where we now expect a low double-digit increase. As I look back over 2011, there are 2 main drivers from our original expectations for MS&A. First, based on changes in FX, we've seen a more negative impact. Second, we have increased investment in our products that should contribute to our long-term growth.

We followed that up in Japan, as you referred to, that we will be presenting at the liver meetings because the predominant genotype in that geography is 1b.

The good point for our portfolio, as you know, is that we have an innovative compound. All our discussion today are happening with our products with an innovative portfolio. So that put us in the more favorable position than if we have not. We see clearly across Europe all the market of the constant. They are looking carefully at pricing of mature products. So to that effect, we we feel comfortable that being aware that market-by-market, there could be differences with our innovative portfolio, we will be able, over time, obviously, as it takes time in some markets, to get there result, new innovative compound."

I think I have to reiterate that this is early days with anti-PD-1, and certainly, even with immunotherapy. However, based on the data, we've become firm believers that there are ways to reactivate one's own immune system to fight malignancies that these responses in some patients may well be durable. If we begin to accumulate experience of 5 years, as we may be approaching with some patients with melanoma, we could one day, hopefully, talk about cures. But it's too early at this point. These 2 approaches are different in their mechanism of activating T  2cells. They give somewhat different safety and efficacy profiles and perhaps different relevance, different tumor types. As we've said, we're testing multiple tumor types with anti PD-1, including lung. We will ramp up to a Phase III program. We'll be talking more about next year, and I think immuno-oncology remains a very important priority for Bristol-Myers Squibb."

So as I think about the combination of the near-term step up investments that you guys are making, the early stages of patent had with next year, but then, the ramp up of new products following, I guess I don't see why 2013 is really the relevant trough anymore and that next year, actually, might really be the tough. So I guess I wanted to see if you could comment on that logic?

That will be clearly important for the years to come. Despite 2012, I think that my recommendation is that we internally and you externally will also look at how generic competition works nowadays. We have 2 big products losing exclusivity next year, AVAPRO and PLAVIX. In PLAVIX, remember, losing exclusivity with a lot of generic from the very first day. So we are refining our analysis of how we will suffer because of the loss of exclusivity, I suggest that everybody does the same exercise because there might be a disconnect between what the reality is and what some might project for PLAVIX. But going back to my message I'm giving you, we are building a strong portfolio, and we are committed to it. And at the same time, we are very careful in not losing our by now consolidated attention to productivity in all across the entire company."

We were not able to compete in that market segment. So our plan are, clearly, to position the ORENCIA subQ as a biologic of choice in first line, but also to recognize that many patient with subcutaneous agent would also be a possible patient for ORENCIA subQ. We expect, however, that initially, the early adoption will come from current prescriber for ORENCIA, and we expect some portion of our patient, particularly those covered by commercial insurance would switch to the subQ. However, we are planning, to your question, to continue investing in organic ORENCIA growth and to plan to grow the IV also.

You had a question on ELIQUIS labeling and what is needed. It's premature to talk about labeling at this point. Certainly, the clinical data needs to be in the label to fully inform the type of clinical investigation that was done. But I think what's needed in this field is an anticoagulant that's oral, better than Coumadin in both efficacy and safety. Essentially, physicians, I believe, are looking for an improved therapeutic window. They know Coumadin well as having a narrow therapeutic window. And I think they are very concerned, in general, about delivering adequate anti-coagulation to achieve superiority in stroke prevention while improving the side effect profile of available medicines. So this, I think, will expand the market to the 40% or 50% of patients that are not on Coumadin but should be and be a very important option for patients that are anti-coagulated because it's better in efficacy and better in safety."

Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about the results of the third quarter, I want to note a few management changes that we have recently made, changes that underscore our commitment to growth and recognize the talent of our senior executives. 
I have promoted Giovanni Caforio to President U.S. Pharmaceuticals, and he has joined my senior management team. Giovanni is a physician with a strong business background, and this is a natural career step that builds on his senior operational experience and strategic leadership in our European, U.S. and global commercialization units. 
And I've also appointed Charlie Bancroft and Beatrice Cazala to the position of Executive Vice President, expanding their respective roles and responsibilities. Naturally, I am very pleased by how these changes will strengthen our already strong management team. 
So with that, let's go back to the subject of this call. We have just completed another very good quarter with strong sales, solid financials and significant R&D and business development achievements. In short, we proved that once again, that our BioPharma strategy is on track, delivering results today, while building a sound foundation for tomorrow. 
With third quarter net sales of $5.3 billion, we delivered an 11% increase over last year. That is double-digit growth for the second straight quarter. We also reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 in the quarter compared to $0.59 a year ago. Our top line performance was strong across a wide range of products. This includes, of course, YERVOY, our breakthrough treatment for metastatic melanoma, which in only its second quarter on the market, had worldwide sales of $121 million. I note that sales should have been $148 million instead of $121 million if we have not changed our returns policy, which Charlie will describe later in the call. 
During the second quarter, we launched YERVOY in Europe with a few countries that have already started recording sales, while others have initiated their pricing and reimbursement discussions. In the U.S., brand awareness of YERVOY is at virtually 100%, and the number of accounts ordering the product continues to increase month-over-month. And most importantly, update for YERVOY remains strong, both in hospitals and community-based treatment centers. 
Moving to our pipeline, we continue to deliver good news, most notable of which was the announcement of the full results of the ARISTOTLE clinical trial on ELIQUIS, apixaban at the ESC Congress in Paris. The results are that Phase III studies were very positive and demonstrated ELIQUIS statistical superiority to warfarin with respect to reducing the risk of stroke and reducing the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the leading cause of stroke, affecting approximately 10 million patients worldwide. The results were remarkably consistent across all subgroups and demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mortality. 
This is a very important, very encouraging development, one that underscores the strength and promise of our pipeline. And I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work of our research and development organization and it's their steadfast commitment to both follow the science and work in good sync with the business organization in the development of ELIQUIS. In Europe, we have already launched ELIQUIS for venous thromboembolic events, VTE, and we'll let you know when the AZ submission has been accepted in the U.S. and we get -- when the get a PDUFA date, which we should receive before the end of the year. 
Business development continues to be a priority in how we think about capital allocation and strengthening our pipeline. We have had 5 key pipeline developments related to our single pill initiative in the last few months. We started off the third quarter with an agreement with Innate Pharma for the development and commercialization of a novel immuno-oncology biologic in Phase I. And then another one, to acquire Amira Pharmaceuticals, a company focused on small molecules for fibrotic diseases. Through an agreement with Ambrix, we then received exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop and commercialize novel biologics in diabetes and heart disease. And very important for our immuno-oncology portfolio, through an agreement with Ono Pharmaceuticals, we expanded our territorial rights on the anti PD-1 that we are developing for a variety of tumor types including renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. 
Finally, we announced yesterday our new partnership with Gilead to develop and commercialize fixed dose combination containing our REYATAZ and their boosting agent cobicistat.
So taken as a whole, it was a very good quarter for us. Executing against our biopharma strategy, we continue to drive short-term results while building a solid long-term foundation, delivering strong sales while strengthening our pipeline. This is a good timing, the life of our company. But we do not rest on our laurels. We deliver today and plan for tomorrow. Thank you. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Charlie."
25798,141283814,179494,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Bristol-Myers Squibb Company","Executives","Thank you, Lamberto. We did have a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in investment spending, the pharmacy and a higher effective tax rate versus the same period la",1194,"Thank you, Lamberto. We did have a very good quarter. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.61. Sales growth across our key brands was partially offset by an increase in investment spending, the pharmacy and a higher effective tax rate versus the same period last year. Included in our third quarter EPS is a negative $0.04 impact due to U.S. healthcare reform. This impact is primarily from the pharmacy and the donut hole coverage, both of which were incremental in 2011. 
I now want to give you some brief highlights from our third quarter financial results before we go to your questions. We reported third quarter net sales of $5.3 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Volume was strong, providing a 6% favorable impact on sale. Price was favorable by 2%, and foreign exchange contributed 3% of sales. The U.S. healthcare reform coverage gap implemented in 2011 and EU measures, together at just under a 3% negative impact on sales. 
As I look at the third quarter sales performance, I am very encouraged by the trends in many of our key brands that are important to our future growth. This includes continued strong performance for BARACLUDE, ONGLYZA, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. This was another very good quarter for YERVOY, and we believe this reflects both a compelling profile of the drug and the execution of our commercial model. 
As Lamberto mentioned, we reported YERVOY sales of $121 million in the quarter. Excluding the sales deferral, YERVOY sales would have been $148 million. Last quarter, we discussed U.S. YERVOY sales in 3 categories: A stocking element, a bolus or onetime element and underlying demand. I'll cover those 3 again, but first, I'll address the sales deferral. As a result of our customer model and our ability to connect with the entire unit of care, we've identified an opportunity to implement a new returns policy to alleviate financial concerns physicians have raised related to potential YERVOY returns. 
Since the prevalence of this disease is quite low, many community oncologists see only a few patients each year. If the intended patient does not use the ordered drug, it may be some time before the oncologists has another eligible patient. We believe that the new policy will remove such concerns and facilitate greater uptake by these physicians. 
From a historical perspective, typically, we use a returns trend based on history of returns, but we don't yet have enough history to reliably estimate the returns for YERVOY under this new policy. So accounting standards require that we only book the sale when the product is used. As a result, we are deferring $27 million of sales, which corresponds to our estimate of the inventory in the channel at the end of Q3. 
Now back to the 3 categories of U.S. YERVOY sales. Wholesalers are holding approximately 2 to 3 weeks of inventory, which is a build of $10 million to $15 million this quarter. We estimate that the bolus accounted for about  $10 million to $20 million of our Q3 sales, and that we should see little to no impact moving forward. The largest driver of our third quarter sales were strong demand. New patient starts are split approximately 60% in first line and 40% in second line. Access in reimbursement has gone very well, and we now have a C code, allowing hospitals to be reimbursed. And we expect a permanent J code in January. 
As Lamberto mentioned, we are in the process of launching YERVOY in Europe and reported $12 million in international sales. We are working with authorities to try and obtain full reimbursement in the major European markets, which is expected over the course of 2012. 
As I move to the rest of our product performance, please remember that foreign exchange did have a positive impact on all of our global brands. Performance excluding foreign exchange is available on our website. BARACLUDE, our treatment for hepatitis B, was up 36%, including 43% growth internationally. BARACLUDE's long-term efficacy, safety and 5-year resistance data has strengthened its position as the preferred first-line agent. 
The ONGLYZA franchise delivered sales of $127 million, a 13% increase sequentially versus the second quarter. The franchise delivered 15% prescription growth versus 5% for the class. Going forward, we are focused on commercial execution and positioning our data in renal patients and our head-to-head study versus SUs. 
SPRYCEL was up 47% in the quarter, reflecting successful commercial execution and the launch of the first-line indication. In the U.S., our rolling 3-month share indicates we are the leading second-generation agent in first line with over a 15% share. 
ORENCIA was up 27% as we continue to make progress in becoming the IV biologic of choice, highlighting efficacy and durability of response. We have recently launched our subQ formulation, allowing us to compete in the 2/3 of the market that is currently subQ.
ABILIFY was up 14% in the quarter despite the step down in our contractual share of net sale. ABILIFY prescriptions were up 4% in the U.S., roughly double the market growth. International sales were also strong, up 27%. 
Now let me give you just a few comments from the rest of our P&L. I will focus my remarks on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to our GAAP results are available in our press release and on our website. Gross margin was 74%, up 10 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Advertising and promotion expenses were down 11% at $205 million for the quarter. Less spending on the promotional of PLAVIX and AVAPRO was partially offset by increased investment spend on new products and indications. 
Marketing, selling and admin expenses increased 15%. This is due primarily to the pharmacy which is recorded in G&A and the negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding the pharmacy, MS&A was up 10% with just under half driven by foreign exchange. We did have increases in investment spending behind YERVOY, NULOJIX, and ELIQUIS.
R&D increased 8% driven by overall portfolio spend and the ZymoGenetics acquisition. The effective overall tax rate was 26.4% in the quarter. The increase, compared to the third quarter 2010, is primarily due to certain tax settlements last year. Earnings mix had a negative impact in this quarter, and the pharmacy had a negative 1% impact. As I've mentioned, I expect a favorable impact from the resolution of certain discrete items during the fourth quarter. 
We have refined our 2011 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our non-GAAP guidance for 2011 is now $2.25 to $2.30. Overall, we are seeing good sales trends for our key products including YERVOY. At the same time, we are selectively increasing our investments in these products as we look to maximize the value of our portfolio. The only change to our line item guidance is MS&A, where we now expect a low double-digit increase. As I look back over 2011, there are 2 main drivers from our original expectations for MS&A. First, based on changes in FX, we've seen a more negative impact. Second, we have increased investment in our products that should contribute to our long-term growth. 
I would now like to turn it over to your questions."

And consequently, we believe multiple therapeutic approaches may be needed given the diversity of the patient populations around the world. Based on the breadth of our portfolio, with several small molecule mechanisms and the interferon lambda, we believe we're well positioned in this area. We were the first EASL to show that a combination of 2 oral agents could indeed cure a subset of populations. That was correlated with patients that had genotype 1b, when the NS5A was paired with a protease inhibitor. We followed that up in Japan, as you referred to, that we will be presenting at the liver meetings because the predominant genotype in that geography is 1b. We have a very exciting program of both the dual approach and the quad approach in a variety of patient populations. Our NS5A inhibitor is in Phase III now. Several studies are ramping up. We will be doing a variety of studies for different situations around the world, as I mentioned. And we are following up the use of NS5A with a protease inhibitor alone and in combinations with PEG-Interferon alfa and ribavirin. And we have Phase III starting relatively soon for interferon lambda."

In those cases, should that happen, we will adjust our expectation and plan accordingly. You were asking about specific markets. Obviously, we are huge across Europe, specifically, to look at country-by-country, understand the situation. We are looking at all our launches very carefully and are negotiating all our assets. The good point for our portfolio, as you know, is that we have an innovative compound. All our discussion today are happening with our products with an innovative portfolio.

So we are refining our analysis of how we will suffer because of the loss of exclusivity.

So our plan are, clearly, to position the ORENCIA subQ as a biologic of choice in first line, but also to recognize that many patient with subcutaneous agent would also be a possible patient for ORENCIA subQ. We expect, however, that initially, the early adoption will come from current prescriber for ORENCIA, and we expect some portion of our patient, particularly those covered by commercial insurance, would switch to the subQ. However, we are planning, to your question, to continue investing in organic ORENCIA growth and to plan to grow the IV also.

Essentially, physicians, I believe, are looking for an improved therapeutic window. They know Coumadin well as having a narrow therapeutic window. And I think they are very concerned, in general, about delivering adequate anti-coagulation to achieve superiority in stroke prevention, while improving the side effect profile of available medicines.
