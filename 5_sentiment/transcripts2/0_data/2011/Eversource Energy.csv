From all aspects, 2010 was a very good year for Northeast Utilities,  its customers and shareholders. David will cover the financial details of the quarter and the year and I'd like to hit the year's high points. 
Our earnings for the year were will be on our Schmidt projected range of $1.80 to $2 per share. That was due to a combination of factors, including strong cost control, sound operations, a hot summer and the impact of midyear rate decisions. Earnings growth last year exceeded our 6% to 9% percentage long-term growth rates we continue to increase our dividend at the rate that is faster than the industry average. 
As you know, earlier this month , our Board of Trustees approved a 7.3% increase in the dividend to an annualized amount of $1.10 per share, the 11th consecutive year we had a dividend increase that exceeds the industry average.
In terms of how we serve our customers, we continue to see a number of successes. The benefits to customers from the transmission upgrades we completed in southwest Connecticut has saved electric customers more than $600 million since they were completed. We continue to invest more than $400 million annually, improving the reliability of our three state electric distribution system. Our new customer information system has allowed us to dramatically improve our response rate to customer inquiries. 
Our communities benefit from the improved reliability of our facilities, property tax revenue generated by our new equipment, by our employment levels, which have remained steady and by our Corporate philantrophy if he has reached record levels of nearly $5 million nearly 2010. Heating the call of Connecticut's new government Governor Malloy, we are ensuring that the state is open for business by improving our liability, streamlining our processes and implementing some of the most aggressive energy conservation programs in the country. In 2010 , CL&P synergy conservation expenditures totaled approximately $120 million , including $43 million invested in the commercial and industrial sectors. in Transmission, we received final approval of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project this past fall and have already begun construction and. An ISO New England confirmed the need for the Interstate Reliability Project.  In addition, we received strong remarks for the operation and security of our Transmission system.
On February 11, FERC approved the Transmission Services Agreement associated with our new northern has transmission line to import power from Hydro-Qu√©bec. That approval was a significant next step in the process. FERC recognize our TSA, the product of more than a year of negotiations, as uniquely beneficial to our region. It approved our requested initial Return on Equity of 12.56%, our requested 50% equity, 50% the capital structure and our fully tracking cost recovery tariff. 
We expect the Northern Pass Line to commence operation by the end of 2015 and immediately provide New England's electric customers with an attractive combination of economic benefits, a significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption and a very real reduction in New England's greenhouse gas initiatives. We will provide you with a summary of our work as we continue to move this project forward.
On the distribution spot side, despite an unusual level of storm activity  and a very hot summer, we maintained a reliable system, improved our customer service metrics and significantly reduce our uncollectible balances. We also secured approvals from our Connecticut and New Hampshire regulators to continue to invest heavily to replace our aging distribution infrastructure and completed half of a new gas pipeline linking our LNG facility in Waterbury with a significant load center in the Wallingford Chester area. The project will reduce gas congestion on the Yankee Gas system and help our customers lower their fuel costs and emissions. 
On the generation side, we continue to make significant progress on PSNH's Clean Air Project at Merrimack Station, brought online our First Solar facility in Massachusetts and announced the location of a second site for a larger solar facility.
And on the strategic side, we announced our transformative merger with NSTAR, and have filed all of the regulatory applications which must be approved before we close. The shareholder voted on the merger is continuing to progress. Proxy advisory firms are recommended NU shareholder approval and the special holder meetings for both companies are set for March 4, a week from today.
The mandatory waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired, and FCC approval has been secured. We expect other Federal reviewers before the FERC and the NRC to be smooth. Our application for approval of the merger was filed late last year with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, and the discovery process continues. The DPU is currently reviewing various on the standard of review  it should utilize in reviewing the merger. We and NSTAR firmly believe that this standard should remain a no-net harm standard and have served the state well for about 60 years. Once the DPU makes the determination on the appropriate standard of review, we expect it will reestablish the schedule for the conclusion of the case. At that time, though there is no statutory deadline, we expect the DPU to be in a position to vote on the merger by the end of the third quarter.
In Connecticut, we continue to believe that regulatory approval is not necessarily and remain hopeful that the DPUC will reaffirming in the near-term their prior conclusion that they do not have jurisdiction over the merger. Oral arguments occurred a week ago on the earlier DPUC draft session which concluded that since there was no change of control in Northeast Utilities, CL&P or Yankee Gas, DPUC approval was not required. In addition to the oral argument , the DPUC will hold a public informational hearing on the merger in the near future.
You may be aware that a bill has been raised in the Connecticut legislature that would confer DPUC jurisdiction over mergers such as ours. While we have not yet seen the detailed description of that bill, we nonetheless believe that such an approach would not serve the best interest of the state.
We have formed integration teams that would develop recommendations on how the two companies should be merged. So we can fulfill our commitment to our customers, our communities and our investors that they will benefit from this business combination. We believe this merger will be a pathway for both companies to implement best practices in a cost-effective way that can result in better service at a lower cost than each could provide on a standalone basis. We believe the combined businesses can offer investors a compelling opportunity to invest in a company that offers earnings and dividend growth better than most of our peers. Together, we expect that a combined NU and NSTAR can provide long-term cumulative annual earnings growth at the higher end of the 6% to 9% range we have targeted for NU on a standalone basis.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

Overall, we have a very good year operationally despite a very significant increase in storm activity over both 2009 and historic levels. We experienced 39 major storms in 2010 as compared with 19 in 2009 and expensed about $30 million i",1041,"Thank you, chuck. Overall, we have a very good year operationally despite a very significant increase in storm activity over both 2009 and historic levels. We experienced 39 major storms in 2010 as compared with 19 in 2009 and expensed about $30 million in costs, more than double our budget of $14 million. We were however able to successfully offset $16 million of higher storm-related expenses through rigorous cost controls and strong uncollectible expense performance. 
Aside from those storms and some very high peak loads throughout the summer, our system performed well throughout the year. System reliability clearly benefited from the capital investments we have made in recent years and from our strong focus on preventative maintenance. 
Turning to generation, our baseload units, which include our renewable woodchip burning northern wood power plant operated reliably and achieved an 81% capacity factor. Our larger incineration project currently underway, PSNH's Merrimack Clean Air Project, is currently 82% complete and on schedule to begin operation in mid-2012. The $430 million project involved installing a wet scrubber at our two unit Merrimack coal fired station. 
Through December 31, PSNH capitalized nearly $300 million associated with the project, about half of which was capitalized in 2010. In Massachusetts, coking operations of its energy facility in October 26, located on a brownfield site in Pittsfield with 1.8-megawatt facilities as the largest in New England. In January, PIMCO announced its plan to develop a second and larger project located on a capped landfill in Springfield. We believe this site can accommodate 4.2 megawatts of power in the major permitting and procurement activities for this project are underway. Assuming a favorable outcome, we would begin construction in the second quarter of 2011. The cost associated with both soul facilities, including in the authorized Return on Equity will be recovered through a fully tracking rate mechanism.
With respect to 2011, we are seeing heavier weather-related natural gas loads. Yankee Gas has had record commodity send outs on both January 23 and 24. Sent out on January 24 was nearly 351 million BTUs, which eclipsed the previous day's record by more than 4%. You've probably noticed that natural gas sales rose by 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of 2009 due to both colder weather and the attraction of natural gas prices in this current energy environment. We expect to see strong sales from the first quarter of 2011 relative to 2010 as well largely as a result of much colder January and February temperatures. David will discuss some of the specifics on the Yankee Gas rate case that we filed last month but the key aspect of the case is our capital investment program. Yankee Gas invested nearly $95 million in it system in 2010, of which $26.6 million was invested in the Waterbury to Wallingford pipeline. Which will improve liability and meet increasing demand in natural gas in this area. Approximately 10 miles of the 16-mile line extension included in the Narcotec another tech like sentient went into service in November. The remainder of the project, which involves increasing vaporization output of the Yankee's Waterbury LNG facility and connecting it to the new line  should be complete by this November. We recently reduced our total estimate cost of the project from $63 million to $57.6 million due to a combination of factors, including lower labor cost, lower-than-expected contractor bids on our LNG upgrade bringing that project into rates and increasing the scale of our programs to replace older cash on deal, gas mains, our core elements of our rate case recently filed. 
Turning to Western Mass Electric, a key element of our 2010 rate case was our proposal to increase distribution capital spending from approximately $30 million annually to about $50 million annually to better address aging infrastructure. In this decision, which was effective this month, the DPU denied our proposed capital investment tracking mechanism. As a result, Western Mass will not increase its current level of distribution capital expenditures.
Turning to transition , we continue to forecast capital expenditures of $445 million in 2011, up significantly from the $261 million we invested in our transmission system in 2010. That increase primarily reflects increased investment in our $795 million Greater Springfield Reliability Project, which we began building in December. Major overhead construction will begin this spring, and we continue to target a late 2013 in-service date for the project. The Greater Springfield project is by far our largest project associated with the New England East-West Solutions family of transmission upgrades. We at National Grid are targeting the second half of 2011  for filing our siting application associated with the Interstate Reliability Project. That project will run from eastern Connecticut through western Rhode Island and into Massachusetts. Our Connecticut section is expected to cost approximately $300 million. 
In late 2010, ISO New England is confirmed the need for the interest of. Though same plans continue to review the date of need for the third major leg of news Central Connecticut Reliability Project and we believe ISO will complete a preliminary needs assessment this fall.
Earlier, Chuck discussed approval of the transition services agreement we signed within affiliate of Hydro-Qu√©bec. We filed for two weather approvals in October , we filed with the U.S. Department of Energy for our presidential permit and with ISO New England for a technical approval of the line. Last week, we updated the presidential application to identify location in Pittsburgh New Hampshire as our preferred option for where the lines should cross the Canadian U.S. border. We are close to filing our U.S. service application and expect to make an additional application within the New Hampshire setting evaluation committee and various federal agencies early next year and to have it fully permitted by early 2013. We have set up an office in the New Hampshire to better enable us to work with the community and landowners along the project road. We continue to forecast completion of the line by the end of 2015. 
NU's 75% share of the $1.1 billion project is approximately $830 million. As you know went to our merger with NSTAR occurs future would be 100%. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to David."

As Chuck indicated earlier, 2010 was a good year financially for the company. We are $387.9 million or $2.19 per share compared with earnings of more than $30 million or $1.91 per share in 2009. Excluding the non-recurring impacts of the p",2535,"Thank you, Lee. As Chuck indicated earlier, 2010 was a good year financially for the company. We are $387.9 million or $2.19 per share compared with earnings of more than $30 million or $1.91 per share in 2009. Excluding the non-recurring impacts of the parent company tax settlement and merger-related expenses we are in $2.16 per share in 2010. That level is consistent with the guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 pressure that we gave at the Edison Electric Financial Conference last November. 
This year on the standalone basis, we are projecting earnings per share of between $2.25 to $2.40 excluding approximately $0.15 per share of expected merger-related costs. Those earnings are consistent with our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 9% and they reflect the earnings power relating to the capital expenditure and rate base productions provided to you at EI in November as well. We recognize that this guidance is clearly above consensus which seems to be harboring around $2.25 per share for several of you prior to the call, we sense that some of this difference may be related to the benefits of additional cash flow resulting from bonus depreciation, a lower effective tax rate which we view to be about 35%, a higher level of equity capitalization within our companies and our continued focus on cost control.
I'll spend more time on 2011 in a moment and break this down for you by segment, but let me start with the details behind 2010 results.  We are earned $129.3 million or $0.73 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $84.7 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. The most significant improvement was in our Distribution segment, which earned $206.2 million in '10 compared with $159.2 million in 2009. That improvement was concentrated in the second half of the year, and resulted from a combination of factors, including the implementation of distribution rate decisions at CL&P and PSNH, hottest summer weather and colder December temperatures and some significant progress we made in cost management, particularly in reducing our uncollectibles expense. These factors were particularly meaningful in the fourth quarter of 2010, when our Distribution segment earned $75.5 million compared with $39.2 million in 2009. These factors are also helping to position our distribution companies to earn their earned Return on Equity levels. 
CL&P's Distribution segment earned $39.9 million in the fourth quarter of '10 compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. It earned $91.1 million for the full year of 2010 compared with $74 million for the year 2009. Revenues didn't necessarily drive the improvement in for division rate increase did not CL&P take effect until January 10/2/2011. Rather, both fourth quarter and full year improvements were due to a combination of lower depreciation and operating expense, both the result of CL&P's rate case addition and lower collectible expense due to significant progress we've made in this area and the benefits of tax settlements. These improvements were partially offset by higher storm and pension expense. 
For the year, CL&P electric sales were up 1.8% over 2009 although they were down 1.8% on a weather-adjusted basis.  For the full year , CL&P improved its Distribution segment regulatory ROE from 7.3% in 2009 to 7.9% in 2010. In 2011, we expect CL&P to experience further improvement in its ROE, and we expect to earn in the 9% area. 
CL&P's allowed return is 9.4% as a reminder. PSNH Distribution and generation of segment earned $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $69.3 million for the full year of 2010 compared with $47.5 million for the full year 2009. PSNH benefited from the division rate increases that we're effective in August of 2009 and July of 2010, as well as from higher if earnings on $430 million Clean Air Project. You may recall that in addition to PSNH's permanent distribution rate increase , the company will collect approximately $13.7 million from July 2010 through June 2011. 
To recruit revenues it did not received during the 11 months temporary rates were in affect. Partially as a result of those additional revenues, PSNH has combined distribution and generation segment revelatory ROE for 2010 was 10.2%, the recruitment period will end in June 2011 and for the full year 2011, we are projecting a combined distribution and generation segment regulatory ROE in the area of 9%. 
For the year 2010, PSNH's sales were up 1.3% over '09, although they were down 1.8% on a weather-adjusted basis. Mass Electric Co. their division segment earnings were $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, down about $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to a $2.1 million charge resulting from the Massachusetts DPU's January 31 rate decision. For the year, Western Mass Electric Distribution segment earned $10.1 million compared to $16.7 million in 2009. While WIMECO did see sales growth of more than 2% in both the fourth quarter and full year 2010 , compared with '09 , higher operating expenses in the aforementioned fourth quarter charge more than off set the additional revenue. As expected, WIMECO is division segment ROE early it was up significantly in 2010. They are 4.6% for the year compared with  8.4% in 2009. 
As you probably saw in January 31, the Massachusetts DPU approved an annualized distribution rate increase of $16.8 million for the company that was effective this month. While it was less than $28.4 million initial request, we expect it will allow WIMECO's earnings to recover in this year. We are currently projecting the Distribution segment regulatory ROE in the area of 9% for WIMECO go in 2011 compared with the DPO authorized level of 9.6%. I should also note that additional jury increase the DPU approved WIMECO's sales to company proposal and our pension tracking mechanisms remain in place.
Yankee Gas  earned $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of '09. For the full year, Yankee Gas earned $32.7 million compared with $21 million all in 2009. The principal drivers for Yankee Gas 2010 earnings improvement were sales and significantly lower uncollectible expense. Yankee Gas firm sales rose 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. And while a colder month of December compared with '09 helped, weather-adjusted sales still rose by 6.3% for the quarter. For the full year, despite a mild first quarter, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 1.9% compared with 2009. On a weather-adjusted basis, firm sales were up 6.2% for the year.
Improvement we made in collecting overdue bills were particularly helpful for Yankee Gas where a pretax uncollectible expense that effects earnings declined by about $10 million in the fourth quarter alone and $15.7 million for the year. In 2010, Yankee Gas earned a regulatory ROE of 8.6% compared with an authorized level of 10.1%. Yankee Gas filed a rate case the Connecticut DPUC last month seeking a $32.8 million increase in base rates effective July 1, 2011 and another $13 million increase effective July 1, 2012. The primary reason for the application is to reflect in rates our continued high level of investment in the Yankee Gas system, the increase in investment is somewhat offset by increased sales  and lower uncollectible expense but additional rate increases are still needed to recover investments like the Waterbury to Wallingford project.
In the January filing, Yankee Gas  has to maintain it's currently allowed regulatory ROE of 10.1% in a skeletal received a distribution decision in the case in June. Hearing is scheduled for March.
Overall , we are it earned $1.16 per share of distribution and generation segment in 2010 and in 2011, we expect that segment earned between 125 and 135%. There are a number of feedback still into the production edition to the rate case addition we have already received. We expect continued economic recovery for the first time in three years we are not projecting sales decline. With that, said we see retail sales at essentially flat to 2010 other weather adjusted basis. Recall that over the past three years, weather-adjusted electric sales were down by more than 2% annually.
We also foresee increased employee benefit expenses and are assuming that untracked pension and health-care expense primarily related to the Distribution segment rises about $0.11 per share in 2011 compared with '10. Other untracked O&M is expected to rise about 2% overall or $0.04 per share.
Now turning to Transmission, the segment earned $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '10 compared with $44.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, our Transmission segment earned $177.8 million compared with $164.3 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the ongoing investment in our transmission system. Our transmission rate base totaled $2.76 billion at the end of 2010 compared with $2.6 million at the end of '09, an increase of about $160 million or more than 6%. 
For 2011, Transmission segment earnings guidance is $1.05 to $1.10 per share. With earnings growth driven primarily by construction of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. By year-end we transmission rate base going to $2.93 billion, up 6.3% over year end '10. Our competitive businesses earned $8.3 million in 2010 compared with $15.8 million in 2009. This is in parts reflects expected lower operating results and mark to market the in 2010. In terms of earnings guidance going forward, we'll merge our competitive businesses into our parent and other company guidance. This reflects aggressively smaller impact the competitive businesses will have on our financial performance in future years.
Finally, in relation to NU parent another companies, weather we reported our results last evening , we singled out the $6.3 million net positive impact related to a tax settlement we reached in the fourth quarter of 2010, net of our merger-related expenses.  The tax settlement was a non-recurring item that added $15.7 million to earnings in the quarter. The merger-related expenses totaled $9.4 million after-tax. Excluding those impacts, we recorded after-tax parent expenses of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $10.7 million for the full year, which was consistent with our previous earnings guidance. These figures are similar to what we recorded in 2009.
In 2011, we project net after-tax, parent and other expenses of $0.05 per share, excluding merger-related expenses. At this time, , we are projecting just under $30 million of after-tax merger expenses in 2011 assuming the merger closes this year. That would amount to about $0.15 per share based on our current outstanding common share count. All of 2011 guidance figures are on a standalone basis.
From earnings let me turn to a few balance sheet and cash flow items. As result of our strong performance in 2010  total  common shareholder equity levels rose by about $230 million to just over $3.8 billion during the year. Over the same period , our total debt levels rose about $300 million to just under $5 billion. So our total debt represented about 56%  of our total capitalization at the end of 2010, excluding rate reduction bonds. This level is well below the 60% level that total capitalization to which we have managed our capital structure in recent years.
When reason for the strength of our balance sheet is the improving cash flow profile. In 2010, operating cash flows after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled $833 million compared with $745 million in 2009. An important cash flow item going forward related to the impact relates to the impact of bonus depreciation in 2010 in 2010 traffic the. We expect those provisions to have a of $250 million the cash flow 2011 alone and about $450 million to $550 million to cash flow over the three-year period in 2011 through 2013. As a result, we anticipate net cash flows from operations after retirement of rate reduction bonds to total between $950 million and $1 billion in 2011.
In terms of specific earnings impacts in 2011, the increased cash flows should reduced interest expense by about $5 million after-tax. That will be only partially offset by a $2 million reduction in earnings as a result of a lower rate base. So there is a net favorable impact of bonus depreciation of about $3 million or $0.02 a share this year.
In terms of a longer-term impact, we'll be updating our standalone five-year capital expenditures related rate base figures in our 10-K which we anticipate filing later today. Although you'll find that total projected rate base by the end of 2015 is down by about $500 million or 4%, the vast majority of the impact is in the Distribution segment and even with this update, we feel very strongly that are we can achieve our projected 6% to 9% compounded annual EPS growth rate in part because we will use this additional cash flow to offset that amount of planned external debt and equity capital rates.
In terms of financing activity, 2011 cash flow will fund a vast majority of our capital expenditures which we continue to project to be approximately $1.2 billion this year on a standalone basis. As a result, we are projecting only two new long-term debt issuances, both of them later this year. We have regulatory approval to undertake both of those issuances, $160 million of new bonds at PSNH and $100 million of senior notes at Western Mass Electric and we have no debt maturities this year and are back once have been extended through September of 2013. 
Our cash flow is that of our increasing contributions to our pension plan. In 2010, we contributed $45 million to the plan. In 2011, we expect to contribute about $145 million to the plan. We had earlier projected $200 million of contributions in '11, but we lowered that figure due to a number of factors, including the strong performance of the assets in our plan. We are in 2010, we saw a 16.75% return.
Also helping cash flows will be the impact of the CL&P 2010 distribution rate increase. You may recall that oil the $63.4 million 2010 rate increase was effective July 1 of 2010, the impact on customers was deferred until January 1, '11 So that implementation could correspond to a sharp decline in our competitive assessment charge or CPA. The decline in the TCA was a result of sale in making the final principle interest payment in December of 2010  of more than $1.4 billion of rate reduction bonds that were issued in 2001.  PRB payments were faster crossover drop off is not affecting our cash flows however, the average $0.05 per kilowatt hour increase in the distribution charge affected January 1 we'll increase sales these cash generation in 2011 without customers seeing an increased in the overall electric plays to go. In fact, because of the decline in commodity prices, facilities residential and small combustor may nonstandard service experienced the 7.8% decline in their overall bill in January.

From all aspects, 2010 was a very good year for Northeast Utilities,  its customers and its shareholders. David will cover the financial details of the quarter and the year, and I'd like to hit the year's high points. 
Earnings for the year were well beyond our initially projected range of $1.80 to $2 per share. That was due to a combination of factors, including strong cost control, sound operations, a hot summer and the impact of midyear rate decisions. Earnings growth last year exceeded our 6% to 9% long-term growth rates, and we continue to increase our dividend at a rate that is faster than the industry average. 
As you know, earlier this month, our Board of Trustees approved a 7.3% increase in the dividend to an annualized amount of $1.10 per share, the 11th consecutive year we have had a dividend increase that exceeds the industry average.
In terms of how we serve our customers, we continue to see a number of successes. The benefits to customers from the transmission upgrades we completed in Southwest Connecticut has saved electric customers more than $600 million since they were completed. We continue to invest more than $400 million annually, improving the reliability of our three state electric distribution system. Our new customer information system has allowed us to dramatically improve our response rate to customer inquiries. 
Our communities benefit from the improved reliability of our facilities; property tax revenue generated by our new equipment; by our employment levels, which have remained steady; and by our corporate philanthropy, which reached record levels of nearly $5 million in 2010. Heeding the call of Connecticut's new Governor Malloy, we are ensuring that the state is open for business by improving our reliability, streamlining our processes and implementing some of the most aggressive energy conservation programs in the country. In 2010, CL&P's energy conservation expenditures totaled approximately $120 million, including $43 million invested in the commercial and industrial sectors. in Transmission, we received final approval of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project this past fall and have already begun construction, and ISO New England confirmed the need for the Interstate Reliability Project. In addition, we received strong remarks for the operation and security of our transmission system.
On February 11, FERC approved the Transmission Services Agreement associated with our new Northern Pass transmission line to import power from Hydro-Qu√©bec. That approval was a significant next step in the process. FERC recognized our TSA, the product of more than a year of negotiations, as uniquely beneficial to our region. It approved our requested initial Return on Equity of 12.56%, our requested 50% equity, 50% debt capital structure and our fully tracking cost recovery tariff. 
We expect the Northern Pass line to commence operation by the end of 2015 and immediately provide New England's electric customers with an attractive combination of economic benefits, a significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption and a very real reduction in New England's greenhouse gas initiatives. We will provide you with a summary of our work as we continue to move this project forward.
On the distribution spot side, despite an unusual level of storm activity and a very hot summer, we maintained a reliable system, improved our customer service metrics and significantly reduced our uncollectible balances. We also secured approvals from our Connecticut and New Hampshire regulators to continue to invest heavily to replace our aging distribution infrastructure and completed half of a new gas pipeline linking our LNG facility in Waterbury with a significant load center in the Wallingford/Cheshire area. The project will reduce gas congestion on the Yankee Gas system and help our customers lower their fuel costs and emissions. 
On the generation side, we continue to make significant progress on PSNH's Clean Air Project at Merrimack Station, brought online our first solar facility in Massachusetts and announced the location of a second site for a larger solar facility.
And on the strategic side, we announced our transformative merger with NSTAR and had filed all of the regulatory applications which must be approved before we close. The shareholder vote on the merger is continuing to progress. Proxy advisory firms have recommended NU shareholder approval, and the special holder meetings for both companies are set for March 4, a week from today.
The mandatory waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired, and FCC approval has been secured. We expect other Federal reviews before the FERC and the NRC to be smooth. Our application for approval of the merger was filed late last year with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, and the discovery process continues. The DPU is currently reviewing various filings on the standard of review it should utilize in reviewing the merger. We and NSTAR firmly believe that this standard should remain a ""no net harm"" standard that has served the state well for about 60 years. Once the DPU makes this determination on the appropriate standard of review, we expect it will reestablish a schedule for the conclusion of the case. At that time, though there is no statutory deadline, we expect the DPU to be in a position to vote on the merger by the end of the third quarter.
In Connecticut, we continue to believe that regulatory approval is not necessary and remain hopeful that the DPUC will reaffirm in the near term their prior conclusion that they do not have jurisdiction over the merger. Oral arguments occurred a week ago on the earlier DPUC draft decision, which concluded that since there was no change of control in Northeast Utilities, CL&P or Yankee Gas, DPUC approval was not required. In addition to the oral argument, the DPUC will hold a public informational hearing on the merger in the near future.
You may be aware that a bill has been raised in the Connecticut legislature that would confer DPUC jurisdiction over mergers such as ours. While we have not yet seen a detailed description of that bill, we nonetheless believe that such an approach would not serve the best interest of the state.
We have formed the integration teams that will develop recommendations on how the two companies should be merged, so we can fulfill our commitment to our customers, our communities and our investors that they will benefit from this business combination. We believe this merger will be a pathway for both companies to implement best practices in a cost-effective way that can result in better service at a lower cost than each could provide on a standalone basis. We believe the combined businesses can offer investors a compelling opportunity to invest in a company that offers earnings and dividend growth better than most of our peers. Together, we expect that a combined NU and NSTAR can provide long-term cumulative annual earnings growth at the higher end of the 6% to 9% range we have targeted for NU on a standalone basis.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

Overall, we had a very good year operationally, despite a very significant increase in storm activity over both 2009 and historic levels. We experienced 39 major storms in 2010 as compared with 19 in 2009 and expensed about $30 million i",1058,"Thank you, Chuck. Overall, we had a very good year operationally, despite a very significant increase in storm activity over both 2009 and historic levels. We experienced 39 major storms in 2010 as compared with 19 in 2009 and expensed about $30 million in costs, more than double our budget of $14 million. We were, however, able to successfully offset $16 million of higher storm-related expenses through rigorous cost controls and strong uncollectible expense performance. 
Aside from those storms and some very high peak loads throughout the summer, our system performed well throughout the year. System reliability clearly benefited from the capital investments we have made in recent years and from our strong focus on preventative maintenance. 
Turning to generation, our baseload units, which include our renewable woodchip burning northern wood power plant  [ph] operated reliably and achieved an 81% capacity factor. Our large incineration project currently underway, PSNH's Merrimack Clean Air Project, is currently 82% complete and on schedule to begin operation in mid-2012. The $430 million project involved installing a wet scrubber at our two-unit Merrimack coal-fired station?
  
Through December 31, PSNH has capitalized nearly $300 million associated with the project, about half of which was capitalized in 2010. In Massachusetts,   Coke [ph] commenced operations of its first solar energy facility in October 26 located on a brownfield site in Pittsfield with 1.8-megawatt facilities as the largest in New England. In January, WMECO announced its plan to develop a second and larger project located on a capped landfill in Springfield. We believe this site can accommodate 4.2 megawatts of power, and the major permitting and procurement activities for this project are underway. Assuming a favorable outcome, we would begin construction in the second quarter of 2011. The cost associated with both solar facilities, including the authorized Return on Equity, will be recovered through a fully tracking rate mechanism.
With respect to 2011, we are seeing heavier weather-related natural gas loads. Yankee Gas has had record commodity send outs on both January 23 and 24. Send out on January 24 was nearly 351 million BTUs, which eclipsed the previous day's record by more than 4%. You've probably noticed that Firm  [ph] Natural Gas sales rose by 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of 2009 due to both colder weather and the attraction of natural gas prices in this current energy environment. We expect to see strong sales from the first quarter of 2011 relative to 2010 as well, largely as a result of much colder January and February temperatures. David will discuss some of the specifics on the Yankee Gas rate case that we filed last month, but a key aspect of the case is our capital investment program. Yankee Gas invested nearly $95 million in its system in 2010, of which $26.6 million was invested in the Waterbury-to-Wallingford pipeline, which will improve reliability and meet increasing demand for natural gas in this area. Approximately 10 miles of the 16-mile line extension, including the Naugatuck River Crossing is complete. And the line extension between Wallingford and Cheshire went into service in November. The remainder of the project, which involves increasing vaporization output of Yankee's Waterbury LNG facility and connecting it to the new line should be complete by this November. We recently reduced our total estimated cost of the project from $63 million to $57.6 million due to a combination of factors, including lower labor cost, lower-than-expected contractor bids on our LNG upgrade bringing that project into rates and increasing the scale of our programs to replace older cast iron and bare steel gas mains, our core elements of our rate case recently filed. 
Turning to Western Mass Electric, a key element of our 2010 rate case was our proposal to increase distribution capital spending from approximately $30 million annually to about $50 million annually to better address aging infrastructure. In its decision, which was effective this month, the DPU denied our proposed capital investment tracking mechanism. As a result, Western Mass Electric will not increase its current level of distribution capital expenditures.
Turning to transition , we continue to forecast capital expenditures of $445 million in 2011, up significantly from the $261 million we invested in our transmission system in 2010. That increase primarily reflects increased investment in our $795 million Greater Springfield Reliability Project, which we began building in December. Major overhead construction will begin this spring, and we continue to target a late 2013 in-service date for the project. The Greater Springfield project is by far our largest project associated with the New England East-West Solutions family of transmission upgrades. We at National Grid are targeting the second half of 2011 for filing our siting applications associated with the Interstate Reliability Project. That project will run from Eastern Connecticut through Northwestern Rhode Island and into Massachusetts. Our Connecticut section is expected to cost approximately $300 million. 
In late 2010, ISO New England planners confirmed the need for the interstate. Though same plans continue to review the date of need for the third major leg of news the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We believe ISO will complete a preliminary needs assessment this fall.
Earlier, Chuck discussed FERC's approval of the transmission services agreement we signed with an affiliate of Hydro-Qu√©bec. We filed for two other approvals in October. We filed with the U.S. Department of Energy for our presidential permit and with ISO New England for a technical approval of the line. Last week, we updated the presidential permit application to identify a location in Pittsburg, New Hampshire, as our preferred option for where the lines should cross the Canadian-U.S. border. We are close to filing our U.S. service application and expect to make an additional application within the New Hampshire Siting Evaluation Committee and various Federal agencies early next year and to have the line fully permitted by early 2013. We have set up an office in Northern New Hampshire to better enable us to work with the community and the landowners along the project road. We continue to forecast completion of the line by the end of 2015. 
NU's 75% share of the $1.1 billion project is approximately $830 million, as you know, went to our merger with NSTAR occurs in new share will be 100%. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to David."
292525,119023027,106911,"Northeast Utilities, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2011",2011-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee. As Chuck indicated earlier, 2010 was a good year financially for the company. We are in the $387.9 million or $2.19 per share compared with earnings of $30 million or $1.91 per share in 2009. Excluding the non-recurring impacts of the pare",2542,"Thank you, Lee. As Chuck indicated earlier, 2010 was a good year financially for the company. We are in the $387.9 million or $2.19 per share compared with earnings of $30 million or $1.91 per share in 2009. Excluding the non-recurring impacts of the parent company tax settlement and merger-related expenses, we are in $2.16 per share in 2010. That level is consistent with the guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 pressure that we gave at the Edison Electric Financial Conference last November. 
This year on a standalone basis, we are projecting earnings per share of between $2.25 to $2.40, excluding approximately $0.15 per share of expected merger-related costs. Those earnings are consistent with our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 9%. And they reflect the earnings power related to the capital expenditure and rate base projections provided to you at EEI in November as well. We recognize that this guidance is clearly above consensus, which seems to be harboring around $2.25 per share. And speaking to several of you prior to the call, we sense that some of this difference may be related to the benefits of additional cash flow resulting from bonus depreciation, a lower effective tax rate, which we view to be about 35%, a higher level of equity capitalization within our companies and our continued focus on cost control.
I'll spend more time on 2011 in a moment and break this down for you by segment, but let me start with the details behind 2010 results.  We earned $129.3 million or $0.73 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $84.7 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. The most significant improvement was in our Distribution segment, which earned $206.2 million in '10 compared with $159.2 million in 2009. That improvement was concentrated in the second half of the year and resulted from a combination of factors, including the implementation of distribution rate decisions at CL&P and PSNH, hottest summer weather and colder December temperatures, and some significant progress we made in cost management, particularly in reducing our uncollectibles expense. These factors were particularly meaningful in the fourth quarter of 2010, when our Distribution segment earned $75.5 million compared with $39.2 million in 2009. These factors are also helping to position our distribution companies to improve their earned Return on Equity levels. 
CL&P's Distribution segment earned $39.9 million in the fourth quarter of '10 compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. It earned $91.1 million for the full year of 2010 compared with $74 million for the year 2009. Revenues didn't necessarily drive the improvement in financial performance since CL&P's distribution rate increase did not take effect until January 1, 2011. Rather, both fourth quarter and full year improvements were due to a combination of lower depreciation and operating expense, both the result of CL&P's rate case decision and lower uncollectible expense due to significant progress we've made in this area and the benefits of tax settlements. These improvements were partially offset by higher storm and pension expense. 
For the year, CL&P's electric sales were up 1.8% over 2009, although they were down 1.8% on a weather-adjusted basis. For the full year, CL&P improved its Distribution segment regulatory ROE from 7.3% in 2009 to 7.9% in 2010. In 2011, we expect CL&P to experience further improvement in its ROE, and we expect to earn in the 9% area. 
CL&P's allowed return is 9.4% as a reminder. PSNH's Distribution and Generation segment earned $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $69.3 million for the full year of 2010 compared with $47.5 million for the full year 2009. PSNH benefited from the distribution rate increases that we're effective in August of 2009 and July of 2010, as well as from higher AFUDC earnings on $430 million Clean Air Project. You may recall that in addition to PSNH's permanent distribution rate increase, the company will collect approximately $13.7 million from July 2010 through June 2011
to recruit revenues it did not receive during the 11 months that temporary rates were in effect. Partially, as a result of those additional revenues, PSNH's combined Distribution and Generation segment regulatory ROE for 2010 was 10.2%, the recruitment period will end in June 2011, and for the full year 2011, we are projecting a combined Distribution and Generation segment regulatory ROE in the area of 9%. 
For the year 2010, PSNH's sales were up 1.3% over '09, although they were down 1.8% on a weather-adjusted basis. Western Mass Electric Company, their Distribution segment earnings were $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, down about $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to a $2.1 million charge resulting from the Massachusetts DPU's January 31 rate decision. For the year, Western Mass Electric Distribution segment earned $10.1 million compared to $16.7 million in 2009. While WMECO did see sales growth of more than 2% in both the fourth quarter and full year 2010 compared with '09, higher operating expenses in the aforementioned fourth quarter charge more than offset the additional revenue. As expected, WMECO's distribution segment ROE was off significantly in 2010. They earned 4.6% for the year compared with 8.4% in 2009. 
As you probably saw on January 31, the Massachusetts DPU approved an annualized distribution rate increase of $16.8 million for the company that was effective this month. While it was less than $28.4 million initial request, we expect it will allow WMECO's earnings to recover in this year. We are currently projecting a Distribution segment regulatory ROE in the area of 9% for WMECO in 2011 compared with the DPU-authorized level of 9.6%. I should also note that in addition to the rate increase, the DPU approved WMECO's sales decoupling proposal and our pension tracking mechanisms remain in place.
Yankee Gas earned $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of '09. For the full year, Yankee Gas earned $32.7 million compared with $21 million for all of 2009. The principal drivers for Yankee Gas 2010 earnings improvement were sales and significantly lower uncollectible expense. Yankee Gas firm sales rose 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. And while a colder month of December compared with '09 helped, weather-adjusted sales still rose by 6.3% for the quarter. For the full year, despite a mild first quarter, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 1.9% compared with 2009. On a weather-adjusted basis, firm sales were up 6.2% for the year.
Improvements we made in collecting overdue bills were particularly helpful for Yankee Gas, where a pretax uncollectible expense that effects earnings declined by about $10 million in the fourth quarter alone and $15.7 million for the year. In 2010, Yankee Gas earned a regulatory ROE of 8.6% compared with an authorized level of 10.1%. Yankee Gas filed a rate case the Connecticut DPUC last month seeking a $32.8 million increase in base rates effective July 1, 2011, and another $13 million increase effective July 1, 2012. The primary reason for the application is to reflect in rates our continued high level of investment in the Yankee Gas system, the increase in investment is somewhat offset by increase in sales and lower uncollectible expense, but additional rate increases are still needed to recover investments like the Waterbury-to-Wallingford project.
In the January filing, Yankee Gas asked to maintain it's currently allowed regulatory ROE of 10.1% in an attempt [ph] to receive a decision in the case in June. Hearings are scheduled for March.
Overall, we are earned $1.16 per share in our Distribution and Generation segment in 2010. And in 2011, we expect that segment to earn between $1.25 and $1.35 per share. There are a number of key factors built into the projection in addition to the rate case decisions we have already received. We expect continued economic recovery, and for the first time in three years, we are not projecting sales decline. With that said, we see retail sales at essentially flat to 2010 on a weather-adjusted basis. Recall that over the past three years, weather-adjusted electric sales were down by more than 2% annually.
We also foresee increased employee benefit expenses and are assuming that untracked pension and healthcare expense primarily related to the Distribution segment rises about $0.11 per share in 2011 compared with '10. Other untracked O&M is expected to rise about 2% overall or $0.04 per share.
Now turning to Transmission. The segment earned $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '10 compared with $44.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, our Transmission segment earned $177.8 million compared with $164.3 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the ongoing investment in our transmission system. Our transmission rate base totaled $2.76 billion at the end of 2010 compared with $2.6 million at the end of '09, an increase of about $160 million or more than 6%. 
For 2011, Transmission segment earnings guidance is $1.05 to $1.10 per share, with earnings growth driven primarily by construction of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. By year end we transmission rate base growing to $2.93 billion, up 6.3% over year-end '10. Our competitive businesses earned $8.3 million in 2010 compared with $15.8 million in 2009. This in part reflects expected lower operating results and mark-to-market gains in 2010. In terms of earnings guidance going forward, we'll merge our competitive businesses into our parent and other company guidance. This reflects the progressively smaller impact that our competitive businesses will have on our financial performance in future years.
Finally, in relation to NU parent and other companies, when we reported our results last evening, we singled out the $6.3 million net positive impact related to a tax settlement we reached in the fourth quarter of 2010 net of our merger-related expenses.  The tax settlement was a nonrecurring item that added $15.7 million to earnings in the quarter. The merger-related expenses totaled $9.4 million after tax. Excluding those impacts, we recorded after-tax parent expenses of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $10.7 million for the full year, which was consistent with our previous earnings guidance. These figures are similar to what we recorded in 2009.
In 2011, we project net after-tax, parent and other expenses of $0.05 per share, excluding merger-related expenses. At this time, we are projecting just under $30 million of after tax merger expenses in 2011, assuming the merger closes this year. That would amount to about $0.15 per share based on our current outstanding common share count. All of the 2011 guidance figures are on a standalone basis.
From earnings, let me turn to a few balance sheet and cash flow items. As the result of our strong performance in 2010, total common shareholder equity levels rose by about $230 million to just over $3.8 billion during the year. Over the same period, our total debt levels rose about $300 million to just under $5 billion. So our total debt represented about 56%  of our total capitalization at the end of 2010, excluding rate reduction bonds. This level is well below the 60% level of total capitalization to which we have managed our capital structure in recent years.
One reason for the strength of our balance sheet is the improving cash flow profile. In 2010, operating cash flows after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled $833 million compared with $745 million in 2009. An important cash flow item going forward relates to the impact of bonus depreciation in the 2010 federal tax bill. We expect those provisions to add a total of about $250 million to cash flow in 2011 alone and about $450 million to $550 million to cash flow over the three-year period in 2011 through 2013. As a result, we anticipate net cash flows from operation after retirement of rate reduction bonds to total between $950 million and $1 billion in 2011.
In terms of specific earnings impacts in 2011, the increased cash flows should reduce interest expense by about $5 million after tax. That will be only partially offset by a $2 million reduction in earnings as a result of a lower rate base. So there is a net favorable impact of bonus depreciation of about $3 million or $0.02 a share this year.
In terms of a longer-term impact, we'll be updating our standalone, five-year capital expenditures and related rate base figures in our 10-K, which we anticipate filing later today. Although you'll find that total projected rate base by the end of 2015 is down by about $500 million or 4%, the vast majority of the impact is in the Distribution segment. And even with this update, we feel very strongly that we can achieve our projected 6% to 9% compounded annual EPS growth rate in part because we will use this additional cash flow to offset a significant amount of planned external debt and equity capital raise.
In terms of financing activity, 2011 cash flow will fund a vast majority of our capital expenditures which we continue to project to be approximately $1.2 billion this year on a standalone basis. As a result, we are projecting only two new long-term debt issuances, both of them later this year. We have regulatory approval to undertake both of those issuances: $160 million of new bonds at PSNH and $100 million of senior notes at Western Mass Electric. And we have no debt maturities this year, and our bank loans have been extended through September of 2013. 
Our cash flow estimates are net of our increasing contributions to our pension plan. In 2010, we contributed $45 million to the plan. In 2011, we expect to contribute about $145 million to the plan. We had earlier projected $200 million of contributions in '11, but we lowered that figure due to a number of factors, including the strong performance of the assets in our plan. We are in 2010, we saw a 16.75% return.
Also helping cash flows will be the impact of the CL&P 2010 distribution rate increase. You may recall that while the $63.4 million 2010 rate increase was effective July 1, 2010, the impact on customers was deferred until January 1, '11, so that its implementation could correspond to a sharp decline in our competitive transition assessment charge or CTA. The decline in the CTA was the result of CL&P making the final principal and interest payment in December of 2010 and more than $1.4 billion of rate reduction bonds that were issued in 2001.  The RRB payments were pass-through costs, so their drop-off does not affect our cash flows. However, the average $0.05 a kilowatt hour increase in the distribution charge effective January 1 will increase CL&P's cash generation in 2011 without customers seeing an increase in the overall electric plays. In fact, because of the declining commodity prices, CL&P's residential and small commercial customers who remain on standard service experienced the 7.8% decline in their overall bill in January.

And I'd like to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon. From all aspects, 2010 was a very good year for Northeast Utilities,  its customers and its shareholders.

From all aspects, 2010 was a very good year for Northeast Utilities,  its customers and its shareholders. David will cover the financial details of the quarter and the year, but I'd like to hit the year's high points. 
Earnings for the year were well beyond our initially projected range of $1.80 to $2 per share. That was due to a combination of factors, including strong cost control, sound operations, a hot summer and the impact of midyear rate decisions. Earnings growth last year exceeded our 6% to 9% long-term growth rate, and we continue to increase our dividend at a rate that is faster than the industry average. 
As you know, earlier this month, our Board of Trustees approved a 7.3% increase in the dividend to an annualized amount of $1.10 per share, the 11th consecutive year we have had a dividend increase that exceeds the industry average.
In terms of how we serve our customers, we continue to see a number of successes. The benefits to customers from the transmission upgrades we completed in Southwest Connecticut has saved electric customers more than $600 million since they were completed. We continue to invest more than $400 million annually, improving the reliability of our three state electric distribution system. Our new customer information system has allowed us to dramatically improve our response rate to customer inquiries. 
Our communities benefit from the improved reliability of our facilities; property tax revenue generated by our new equipment; by our employment levels, which have remained steady; and by our corporate philanthropy, which reached record levels of nearly $5 million in 2010. Heeding the call of Connecticut's new Governor Malloy, we are ensuring that the state is open for business by improving our reliability, streamlining our processes and implementing some of the most aggressive energy conservation programs in the country. In 2010, CL&P's energy conservation expenditures totaled approximately $120 million, including $43 million invested in the commercial and industrial sectors. In Transmission, we received final approval of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project this past fall and have already begun construction, and ISO New England confirmed the need for the Interstate Reliability Project. In addition, we received strong remarks for the operation and security of our transmission system.
On February 11, FERC approved the Transmission Services Agreement associated with our new Northern Pass transmission line to import power from Hydro-Qu√©bec. That approval was a significant next step in the process. FERC recognized our TSA, the product of more than a year of negotiations, as uniquely beneficial to our region. It approved our requested initial Return on Equity of 12.56%, our requested 50% equity, 50% debt capital structure and our fully tracking cost recovery tariff. 
We expect the Northern Pass line to commence operation by the end of 2015 and immediately provide New England's electric customers with an attractive combination of economic benefits, a significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption and a very real reduction in New England's greenhouse gas emissions. We will provide you with a summary of our work as we continue to move this project forward.
On the distribution spot side, despite an unusual level of storm activity and a very hot summer, we maintained a reliable system, improved our customer service metrics and significantly reduced our uncollectible balances. We also secured approvals from our Connecticut and New Hampshire regulators to continue to invest heavily to replace our aging distribution infrastructure and completed half of a new gas pipeline linking our LNG facility in Waterbury with a significant load center in the Wallingford/Cheshire area. The project will reduce gas congestion on the Yankee Gas system and help our customers lower their fuel costs and emissions. 
On the generation side, we continue to make significant progress on PSNH's Clean Air Project at Merrimack Station, brought online our first solar facility in Massachusetts and announced the location of a second site for a larger solar facility.
And on the strategic side, we announced our transformative merger with NSTAR and have filed all of the regulatory applications which must be approved before we close. The shareholder vote on the merger is continuing to progress. Proxy advisory firms have recommended NU shareholder approval, and the special holder meetings for both companies are set for March 4, a week from today.
The mandatory waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino Act has expired, and FCC approval has been secured. We expect other Federal reviews before the FERC and the NRC to be smooth. Our application for approval of the merger was filed late last year with the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, and the discovery process continues. The DPU is currently reviewing various filings on the standard of review it should utilize in reviewing the merger. We and NSTAR firmly believe that this standard should remain a ""no net harm"" standard that has served the state well for about 60 years. Once the DPU makes this determination on the appropriate standard of review, we expect it will reestablish a schedule for the conclusion of the case. At that time, though there is no statutory deadline, we expect the DPU to be in a position to vote on the merger by the end of the third quarter.
In Connecticut, we continue to believe that regulatory approval is not necessary and remain hopeful that the DPUC will reaffirm in the near term their prior conclusion that they do not have jurisdiction over the merger. Oral arguments occurred a week ago on the earlier DPUC draft decision, which concluded that since there was no change of control in Northeast Utilities, CL&P or Yankee Gas, DPUC approval was not required. In addition to the oral argument, the DPUC will hold a public informational hearing on the merger in the near future.
You may be aware that a bill has been raised in the Connecticut legislature that would confer DPUC jurisdiction over mergers such as ours. While we have not yet seen a detailed description of that bill, we nonetheless believe that such an approach would not serve the best interest of the state.
We have formed the integration teams that will develop recommendations on how the two companies should be merged, so we can fulfill our commitment to our customers, our communities and our investors, that they will benefit from this business combination. We believe this merger will be a pathway for both companies to implement best practices in a cost-effective way that can result in better service at a lower cost than each could provide on a standalone basis. We believe the combined businesses can offer investors a compelling opportunity to invest in a company that offers earnings and dividend growth better than most of our peers. Together, we expect that a combined NU and NSTAR can provide long-term cumulative annual earnings growth at the higher end of the 6% to 9% range we have targeted for NU on a standalone basis.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

Overall, we had a very good year operationally, despite a very significant increase in storm activity over both 2009 and historic levels. We experienced 39 major storms in 2010 as compared with 19 in 2009 and expensed about $30 million i",1055,"Thank you, Chuck. Overall, we had a very good year operationally, despite a very significant increase in storm activity over both 2009 and historic levels. We experienced 39 major storms in 2010 as compared with 19 in 2009 and expensed about $30 million in costs, more than double our budget of $14 million. We were, however, able to successfully offset $16 million of higher storm-related expenses through rigorous cost controls and strong uncollectible expense performance. 
Aside from those storms and some very high peak loads throughout the summer, our system performed well throughout the year. System reliability clearly benefited from the capital investments we have made in recent years and from our strong focus on preventative maintenance. 
Turning to generation, our baseload units, which include our renewable woodchip burning northern wood power plant operated reliably and achieved an 81% capacity factor. Our large incineration project currently underway, PSNH's Merrimack Clean Air Project, is currently 82% complete and on schedule to begin operation in mid-2012. The $430 million project involved installing a wet scrubber at our two-unit Merrimack coal-fired station?
  
Through December 31, PSNH has capitalized nearly $300 million associated with the project, about half of which was capitalized in 2010. In Massachusetts,   WMECO commenced operations of its first solar energy facility in October 26 located on a brownfield site in Pittsfield with 1.8-megawatt facilities as the largest in New England. In January, WMECO announced its plan to develop a second and larger project located on a capped landfill in Springfield. We believe this site can accommodate 4.2 megawatts of power, and the major permitting and procurement activities for this project are underway. Assuming a favorable outcome, we would begin construction in the second quarter of 2011. The cost associated with both solar facilities, including the authorized Return on Equity, will be recovered through a fully tracking rate mechanism.
With respect to 2011, we are seeing heavier weather-related natural gas loads. Yankee Gas has had record commodity send outs on both January 23 and 24. Send out on January 24 was nearly 351 million BTUs, which eclipsed the previous day's record by more than 4%. You've probably noticed that Firm Natural Gas sales rose by 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of 2009 due to both colder weather and the attraction of natural gas prices in this current energy environment. We expect to see strong sales from the first quarter of 2011 relative to 2010 as well, largely as a result of much colder January and February temperatures. David will discuss some of the specifics on the Yankee Gas rate case that we filed last month, but a key aspect of the case is our capital investment program. Yankee Gas invested nearly $95 million in its system in 2010, of which $26.6 million was invested in the Waterbury-to-Wallingford pipeline, which will improve reliability and meet increasing demand for natural gas in this area. Approximately 10 miles of the 16-mile line extension, including the Naugatuck River Crossing is complete. And the line extension between Wallingford and Cheshire went into service in November. The remainder of the project, which involves increasing vaporization output of Yankee's Waterbury LNG facility and connecting it to the new line should be complete by this November. We recently reduced our total estimated cost of the project from $63 million to $57.6 million due to a combination of factors, including lower labor cost, lower-than-expected contractor bids on our LNG upgrade bringing that project into rates and increasing the scale of our programs to replace older cast iron and bare steel gas mains, our core elements of our rate case recently filed. 
Turning to Western Mass Electric, a key element of our 2010 rate case was our proposal to increase distribution capital spending from approximately $30 million annually to about $50 million annually to better address aging infrastructure. In its decision, which was effective this month, the DPU denied our proposed capital investment tracking mechanism. As a result, Western Mass Electric will not increase its current level of distribution capital expenditures.
Turning to transmission, we continue to forecast capital expenditures of $445 million in 2011, up significantly from the $261 million we invested in our transmission system in 2010. That increase primarily reflects increased investment in our $795 million Greater Springfield Reliability Project, which we began building in December. Major overhead construction will begin this spring, and we continue to target a late 2013 in-service date for the project. The Greater Springfield project is by far our largest project associated with the New England East-West Solutions family of transmission upgrades. We and National Grid are targeting the second half of 2011 for filing our siting applications associated with the Interstate Reliability Project. That project will run from Eastern Connecticut through Northwestern Rhode Island and into Massachusetts. Our Connecticut section is expected to cost approximately $300 million. 
In late 2010, ISO New England planners confirmed the need for the interstate. Though same plans continue to review the date of need for the third major leg of news the Central Connecticut Reliability Project. We believe ISO will complete a preliminary needs assessment this fall.
Earlier, Chuck discussed FERC's approval of the transmission services agreement we signed with an affiliate of Hydro-Qu√©bec. We filed for two other approvals in October. We filed with the U.S. Department of Energy for our presidential permit and with ISO New England for a technical approval of the line. Last week, we updated the presidential permit application to identify a location in Pittsburg, New Hampshire, as our preferred option for where the lines should cross the Canadian-U.S. border. We are close to filing our U.S. Forest service application and expect to make an additional application within the New Hampshire Siting Evaluation Committee and various Federal agencies early next year and to have the line fully permitted by early 2013. We have set up an office in Northern New Hampshire to better enable us to work with the community and the landowners along the project route. We continue to forecast completion of the line by the end of 2015. 
NU's 75% share of the $1.1 billion project is approximately $830 million, as you know, went to our merger with NSTAR occurs in new share will be 100%. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to David."

As Chuck indicated earlier, 2010 was a good year financially for the company. We earned $387.9 million or $2.19 per share compared with earnings of $330 million or $1.91 per share in 2009. Excluding the non-recurring impacts of the parent",2539,"Thank you, Lee. As Chuck indicated earlier, 2010 was a good year financially for the company. We earned $387.9 million or $2.19 per share compared with earnings of $330 million or $1.91 per share in 2009. Excluding the non-recurring impacts of the parent company tax settlement and merger-related expenses, we earned $2.16 per share in 2010. That level is consistent with the guidance of $2.10 to $2.20 per share that we gave at the Edison Electric Financial Conference last November. 
This year on a standalone basis, we are projecting earnings per share of between $2.25 to $2.40, excluding approximately $0.15 per share of expected merger-related costs. Those earnings are consistent with our projected long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 9%. And they reflect the earnings power related to the capital expenditure and rate base projections we provided to you at EEI in November as well. We recognize that this guidance is clearly above consensus, which seems to be harboring around $2.25 per share. And speaking to several of you prior to the call, we sense that some of this difference may be related to the benefits of additional cash flow resulting from bonus depreciation, a lower effective tax rate, which we view to be about 35%, a higher level of equity capitalization within our companies and our continued focus on cost control.
I'll spend more time on 2011 in a moment and break this down for you by segment, but let me start with the details behind 2010 results.  We earned $129.3 million or $0.73 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with earnings of $84.7 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. The most significant improvement was in our Distribution segment, which earned $206.2 million in '10 compared with $159.2 million in 2009. That improvement was concentrated in the second half of the year and resulted from a combination of factors, including the implementation of distribution rate decisions at CL&P and PSNH, hotter summer weather and colder December temperatures, and some significant progress we made in cost management, particularly in reducing our uncollectibles expense. These factors were particularly meaningful in the fourth quarter of 2010, when our Distribution segment earned $75.5 million compared with $39.2 million in 2009. These factors are also helping to position our distribution companies to improve their earned Return on Equity levels. 
CL&P's Distribution segment earned $39.9 million in the fourth quarter of '10 compared with $19 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. It earned $91.1 million for the full year of 2010 compared with $74 million for the year 2009. Revenues didn't necessarily drive the improvement in financial performance since CL&P's distribution rate increase did not take effect until January 1, 2011. Rather, both fourth quarter and full year improvements were due to a combination of lower depreciation and operating expense, both the result of CL&P's rate case decision and lower uncollectible expense due to significant progress we've made in this area and the benefits of tax settlements. These improvements were partially offset by higher storm and pension expense. 
For the year, CL&P's electric sales were up 1.8% over 2009, although they were down 1.8% on a weather-adjusted basis. For the full year, CL&P improved its Distribution segment regulatory ROE from 7.3% in 2009 to 7.9% in 2010. In 2011, we expect CL&P to experience further improvement in its ROE, and we expect to earn in the 9% area. 
CL&P's allowed return is 9.4% as a reminder. PSNH's Distribution and Generation segment earned $17.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $69.3 million for the full year of 2010 compared with $47.5 million for the full year 2009. PSNH benefited from the distribution rate increases that we're effective in August of 2009 and July of 2010, as well as from higher AFUDC earnings on $430 million Clean Air Project. You may recall that in addition to PSNH's permanent distribution rate increase, the company will collect approximately $13.7 million from July 2010 through June 2011
to recruit revenues it did not receive during the 11 months that temporary rates were in effect. Partially, as a result of those additional revenues, PSNH's combined Distribution and Generation segment regulatory ROE for 2010 was 10.2%, the recruitment period will end in June 2011, and for the full year 2011, we are projecting a combined Distribution and Generation segment regulatory ROE in the area of 9%. 
For the year 2010, PSNH's sales were up 1.3% over '09, although they were down 1.8% on a weather-adjusted basis. Western Mass Electric Company, their Distribution segment earnings were $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, down about $2 million from the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to a $2.1 million charge resulting from the Massachusetts DPU's January 31 rate decision. For the year, Western Mass Electric Distribution segment earned $10.1 million compared to $16.7 million in 2009. While WMECO did see sales growth of more than 2% in both the fourth quarter and full year 2010 compared with '09, higher operating expenses in the aforementioned fourth quarter charge more than offset the additional revenue. As expected, WMECO's distribution segment ROE was off significantly in 2010. They earned 4.6% for the year compared with 8.4% in 2009. 
As you probably saw on January 31, the Massachusetts DPU approved an annualized distribution rate increase of $16.8 million for the company that was effective this month. While it was less than $28.4 million initial request, we expect it will allow WMECO's earnings to recover in this year. We are currently projecting a Distribution segment regulatory ROE in the area of 9% for WMECO in 2011 compared with the DPU-authorized level of 9.6%. I should also note that in addition to the rate increase, the DPU approved WMECO's sales decoupling proposal and our pension tracking mechanisms remain in place.
Yankee Gas earned $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of '09. For the full year, Yankee Gas earned $32.7 million compared with $21 million for all of 2009. The principal drivers for Yankee Gas 2010 earnings improvement were sales and significantly lower uncollectible expense. Yankee Gas firm sales rose 9.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. And while a colder month of December compared with '09 helped, weather-adjusted sales still rose by 6.3% for the quarter. For the full year, despite a mild first quarter, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 1.9% compared with 2009. On a weather-adjusted basis, firm sales were up 6.2% for the year.
Improvements we made in collecting overdue bills were particularly helpful for Yankee Gas, where a pretax uncollectible expense that affects earnings declined by about $10 million in the fourth quarter alone and $15.7 million for the year. In 2010, Yankee Gas earned a regulatory ROE of 8.6% compared with an authorized level of 10.1%. Yankee Gas filed a rate case the Connecticut DPUC last month seeking a $32.8 million increase in base rates effective July 1, 2011, and another $13 million increase effective July 1, 2012. The primary reason for the application is to reflect in rates our continued high level of investment in the Yankee Gas system, the increase in investment is somewhat offset by increasing sales and lower uncollectible expense, but additional rate increases are still needed to recover investments like the Waterbury-to-Wallingford project.
In the January filing, Yankee Gas asked to maintain it's currently allowed regulatory ROE of 10.1% and is scheduled to receive a decision in the case in June. Hearings are scheduled for March.
Overall, we are earned $1.16 per share in our Distribution and Generation segment in 2010. And in 2011, we expect that segment to earn between $1.25 and $1.35 per share. There are a number of key factors built into the projection in addition to the rate case decisions we have already received. We expect continued economic recovery, and for the first time in three years, we are not projecting sales declines. With that said, we see retail sales at essentially flat to 2010 on a weather-adjusted basis. Recall that over the past three years, weather-adjusted electric sales were down by more than 2% annually.
We also foresee increased employee benefit expenses and are assuming that untracked pension and healthcare expense primarily related to the Distribution segment rises about $0.11 per share in 2011 compared with '10. Other untracked O&M is expected to rise about 2% overall or $0.04 per share.
Now turning to Transmission. The segment earned $50.5 million in the fourth quarter of '10 compared with $44.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, our Transmission segment earned $177.8 million compared with $164.3 million in 2009. The improvement was primarily due to the ongoing investment in our transmission system. Our transmission rate base totaled $2.76 billion at the end of 2010 compared with $2.6 billion at the end of '09, an increase of about $160 million or more than 6%. 
For 2011, Transmission segment earnings guidance is $1.05 to $1.10 per share, with earnings growth driven primarily by construction of the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. By year end we transmission rate base growing to $2.93 billion, up 6.3% over year-end '10. Our competitive businesses earned $8.3 million in 2010 compared with $15.8 million in 2009. This in part reflects expected lower operating results and mark-to-market gains in 2010. In terms of earnings guidance going forward, we'll merge our competitive businesses into our parent and other company guidance. This reflects the progressively smaller impact that our competitive businesses will have on our financial performance in future years.
Finally, in relation to NU parent and other companies, when we reported our results last evening, we singled out the $6.3 million net positive impact related to a tax settlement we reached in the fourth quarter of 2010 net of our merger-related expenses.  The tax settlement was a nonrecurring item that added $15.7 million to earnings in the quarter. The merger-related expenses totaled $9.4 million after tax. Excluding those impacts, we recorded after-tax parent expenses of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $10.7 million for the full year, which was consistent with our previous earnings guidance. These figures are similar to what we recorded in 2009.
In 2011, we project net after-tax, parent and other expenses of $0.05 per share, excluding merger-related expenses. At this time, we are projecting just under $30 million of after tax merger expenses in 2011, assuming the merger closes this year. That would amount to about $0.15 per share based on our current outstanding common share count. All of the 2011 guidance figures are on a standalone basis.
From earnings, let me turn to a few balance sheet and cash flow items. As the result of our strong performance in 2010, total common shareholder equity levels rose by about $230 million to just over $3.8 billion during the year. Over the same period, our total debt levels rose about $300 million to just under $5 billion. So our total debt represented about 56%  of our total capitalization at the end of 2010, excluding rate reduction bonds. This level is well below the 60% level of debt total capitalization to which we have managed our capital structure in recent years.
One reason for the strength of our balance sheet is the improving cash flow profile. In 2010, operating cash flows after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled $833 million compared with $745 million in 2009. An important cash flow item going forward relates to the impact of bonus depreciation in the 2010 federal tax bill. We expect those provisions to add a total of about $250 million to cash flow in 2011 alone and about $450 million to $550 million to cash flow over the three-year period in 2011 through 2013. As a result, we anticipate net cash flows from operation after retirement of rate reduction bonds to total between $950 million and $1 billion in 2011.
In terms of specific earnings impacts in 2011, the increased cash flows should reduce interest expense by about $5 million after tax. That will be only partially offset by a $2 million reduction in earnings as a result of a lower rate base. So there is a net favorable impact of bonus depreciation of about $3 million or $0.02 a share this year.
In terms of a longer-term impact, we'll be updating our standalone, five-year capital expenditures and related rate base figures in our 10-K, which we anticipate filing later today. Although you'll find that total projected rate base by the end of 2015 is down by about $500 million or 4%, the vast majority of the impact is in the Distribution segment. And even with this update, we feel very strongly that we can achieve our projected 6% to 9% compounded annual EPS growth rate in part because we will use this additional cash flow to offset a significant amount of planned external debt and equity capital raise.
In terms of financing activity, 2011 cash flow will fund a vast majority of our capital expenditures, which we continue to project to be approximately $1.2 billion this year on a standalone basis. As a result, we are projecting only two new long-term debt issuances, both of them later this year. We have regulatory approval to undertake both of those issuances: $160 million of new bonds at PSNH and $100 million of senior notes at Western Mass Electric. And we have no debt maturities this year, and our bank lines have been extended through September of 2013. 
Our cash flow estimates are net of our increasing contributions to our pension plan. In 2010, we contributed $45 million to the plan. In 2011, we expect to contribute about $145 million to the plan. We had earlier projected $200 million of contributions in '11, but we lowered that figure due to a number of factors, including the strong performance of the assets in our plan. Where in 2010, we saw a 16.75% return.
Also helping cash flows will be the impact of the CL&P 2010 distribution rate increase. You may recall that while the $63.4 million 2010 rate increase was effective July 1, 2010, the impact on customers was deferred until January 1, '11, so that its implementation could correspond to a sharp decline in our competitive transition assessment charge or CTA. The decline in the CTA was the result of CL&P making the final principal and interest payment in December of 2010 on more than $1.4 billion of rate reduction bonds that were issued in 2001.  The RRB payments were pass-through costs, so their drop-off does not affect our cash flows. However, the average $0.05 a kilowatt hour increase in the distribution charge effective January 1 will increase CL&P's cash generation in 2011 without customers seeing an increase in the overall electric rates. In fact, because of the declining commodity prices, CL&P's residential and small commercial customers who remain on standard service experienced a 7.8% decline in their overall bill in January.

And we said that those credits are more significant in years in which we're spending a lot of capital in the state of Connecticut because it's the Connecticut CapEx type of credit. We stopped short of trying to quantify exactly what that is, but for example, in '11, where we're spending -- we're really ramping up on the Greater Springfield Project, even though there's spend in Massachusetts, were spending capital in Connecticut, next year we'll spend a good deal of capital in Connecticut. So you should expect that that will continue to be those below-the-line benefits. We haven't really gone through a great deal of specificity, Chris, on what that is."

And I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on this Friday afternoon. We've had a very strong start to the year, both financially and operationally.

We've had a very strong start to the year, both financially and operationally. Lee and David will provide you with more details. But as you saw in our earnings news release, first quarter financial results were well above 2010 results, and consistent with our guidance for 2011. 
We have also made good progress on our major projects that are supportive of the energy policies of the states in which we serve. They include the news projects, public-service New Hampshire Clean Air Project and the Yankee gas Waterbury-to-Wallingford line. We will update you on each of these projects shortly. 
Economic recovery across our service territory continues to vary. In New Hampshire, which, along with the Boston area, appears to have the strongest economic growth in New England, manufacturing employment is up by nearly 2% over last year while non-manufacturing employment is up about 1%. New Hampshire's unemployment rate in March fell to 5.2%, one of the lowest in New England. While not as robust as New Hampshire, we've seen growth in Connecticut as well. Employment is up more than 1% and personal income up 3.4%. While hiring is yet to pick up in Western Massachusetts, first new income is up 4.2% from last year. Cost control in a continued reduction in uncollectible expense have helped us improve results as our regional economy has begun to turn upward.
Our major initiatives, we cleared another milestone in February with our Northern Pass transmission project when FERC accepted without change the transmission services agreement, which spells out the terms and conditions of the arrangement between Northern Pass LLC our project subsidiary and Hydro-Qu√©bec. As you know, the Northern Pass transmission project will bring 1200 megawatts clean hydroelectric power from Canada into New England at a highly competitive rate. 
In the fourth quarter of last year, we moved into what we expect will be more than a two-year effort to cite the project when we apply for a presidential permit from the U.S. Department of Energy. We continue to believe the project offers significant benefits to both the state of New Hampshire and to New England. This new source of energy will benefit everyone in the region by improving electric reliability and fuel diversity lessening our reliance on foreign fuels, reducing emissions and producing energy savings for homeowners and businesses. 
New Hampshire will gain additional benefits in the form of well-paying construction jobs, $25 million a year in new tax revenue and from $260 million to $315 million in increased economic outlook during the development and construction phases of the project.
As you no doubt can appreciate, building 180-mile transmission project, especially one that may require up to 40 miles of new rights-of-way, requires a good deal of support before construction can begin. We have are probably aware that in March, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill that would limit the ability of utilities to use eminent domain to build a project such as Northern Pass, namely projects that are environmental and economic goals rather than reality requirements. That bill is pending in the New Hampshire Senate. 
While we opposed the bill because it could add to that time and cost of completing the project, we nonetheless understand our responsibility to work with the communities to which Northern Pass ultimately will be built. As a result of extensive conversations with various stakeholders in New Hampshire, we recently asked the U.S. Department of Energy to extend the current public comment period with a presidential permit application by 60 days. The DOE granted that request.
In addition, the approval process required us to submit a variety of alternative routes and after due consideration of the concerns expressed in New Hampshire, we likewise asked that these alternative routes be removed from consideration. We fully understand the need to work constructively with our neighbors to identify a route that will bring significant and economic environmental benefits to New Hampshire and other New England states while at the same time respecting the rights of property owners and protecting some of the most scenic areas of our region. We continue to expect to begin construction in 2013 and to complete it by the end of 2015.
Turning to our pending merger with NSTAR. We've had a number of positive development since our late February conference call. On March 4, NU and NSTAR shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger. Approximately 81% of all NU shares were voted at the meeting and 98% of those shares were voted in support of the merger. We thank our shareholders who are listening to this call for the support.
On April 5, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission issued an order confirming that it did not have jurisdiction over the merger and on April 15, the Maine Public Utilities Commission hearing examiner responsible for our merger docket recommended that the full commission approve the merger subject to FERC approval. Main regulators are scheduled to deliberate on that recommendation next week. Our merger applications remain pending before both the FERC and the NERC and we have not seen significant issues raised by either agency.
In Connecticut, the DPUC issued a draft decision in January stating that it does not have jurisdiction over the merger. That decision has not yet been finalized but the DPUC did hold an informational meeting on the merger in late March. Also in late March, the Connecticut legislature's energy and technology committee narrowly endorsed Senate Bill 1140, which would expand the DPUC's jurisdiction over utility merger. But that bill has not advanced in either the Senate or the House since then.
In Massachusetts, you may recall that on March 10, the DPU modified its utility merger review standard and adopted a net benefits test rather than the historic no net harm test. On April 8, we and NSTAR filed supplemental testimony that discussed very substantial cost and environmental benefits of the merger. Over the first 10 years of the merger, we estimate that net benefits of the merger will be $784 million. 
We also demonstrated our commitment to the region's environmental and energy initiatives by proposing an expansion of our energy conservation and solar generation programs. Hearings on the merger are now scheduled to begin July 6, while no date beyond the start of hearings have been identified by the DPU, we believe the schedule should support consummation of the merger in the second half of 2011.
Integration teams from both companies have begun to identify the best practices that should be adopted once the merger is complete. The two companies will be ready to operate as one company once we receive the required regulatory approvals and closed this transformative transaction. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

As Chuck said, we are very pleased with our operating performance during the first three months of the year, despite a difficult record of January snowfall.

As Chuck said, we are very pleased with our operating performance during the first three months of the year, despite a difficult record of January snowfall. Overall reliability was far better than the first quarter of 2011 than it was in the first quarter 2010 when we had very significant windstorms and damage in both Southwest Connecticut and New Hampshire. 
Our customer service metrics have improved significantly over the course of the last 12 months, particularly in our call centers. Yankee Gas has the highest JD Power customer service ranking of any East Coast midsize natural gas utility this year. Credit and collections performance has also been very strong, with non-hardship uncollectible expense down by more than 50% in the first quarter of this year as compared to the fear first three months of 2010. 
Our PSNH generating stations operated well during a very cold winter and our six largest fossil fuel units at an average availability factor of 95% in the quarter. Our wood-burning brand operated at a strong 89% capacity factor and produced nearly 83,000 renewable energy certificates in the quarter.
Our $430 million Clean Air Project, which involves installing a wet scrubber on our two unit Merrimack coal-fired station is ahead of schedule and currently 82% complete. Some of the new equipment is now being tested, system tie-ins, start up and commission activities are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, and the scrubber itself could be operational by the end of the year. The entire project should be fully complete by mid 2012. 
You may recall that the scrubbers required under New Hampshire's mercury reduction law which was enacted about five years ago. We believe that this technology will provide us with some of the cleanest coal burning units in the country and will position us well to meet the EPA's post rules on hazardous air pollutants. Our coal related emissions have been further reduced by the wood-burning unit at Shilo station, which are placed 50-megawatt coal burning boiler several years ago. 
Turning to transmission, the greatest spring for reliability project is the largest of the three major projects we expect to undertake as part of the news NEEWS family of projects. We commenced substation work on the GSRP in December 2010 and begin side work on the Massachusetts over at section in the first quarter of 2011.
Construction should begin in the third quarter when we expect to receive the Army Corps of Engineers and Massachusetts environmental permits. We expect to invest $180 million in GSRP in 2011, $16 million less than we had estimated at EEI. But we continue to expect the project to be completed by the end of 2013 at a cost of $795 million. 
The Interstate Reliability Project will provide a new 345-kV line connecting Connecticut with Ireland and Massachusetts. Reconfirm the need for the IRP last year, and we are currently coordinating with National Grid so that we can file our setting applications with all three states later this year. We continue to estimate the project will be completed in 2015.
As we have looked forward with our design of the interstate, ISO New England has identified some unrelated transmission infrastructure upgrades that will be required to result specific reliability issues in Eastern Connecticut. As a result, we will not need to undertake certain substation upgrades with inhibition as part of the interstate project. Instead, that work will be deferred and studied as part of the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, our third major piece of NEEWS. Therefore, we have reduced our estimate for our share of the interstate project by $50 million, from $301 million to approximately $251 million. About 1/2 of that reduction will be offset by a $25 million increase in transmission expenditures related to the Eastern Connecticut upgrades I just mentioned. Those upgrades will be advanced from 2014 into 2011 and the 2012 period.
But central Connecticut reliability project continues to be reviewed by ISO New England. ISO New England is evaluating that project as part of an overall review of transmission that now encompasses a broader geographical area in central Connecticut. We expect the review to be completed and the needs identified in late 2011 with specific projects identified in late 2012. We continue to project the cost of CCRP of $338 million and we'll update the cost estimates and project completion dates after ISO New England has completed its review.
We believe the project will be completed about 18 months after the interstate project. Despite the slight changes in timing and spending on some of our projects, we continue to project investing approximately $444 million on our transmission infrastructure this year. Early to discuss some of the recent developments concerning gas, project, the Department of Energy had seven public meetings on the project in New Hampshire in mid-March, which were very well attended. 
While there has been considerable support for the project among key stakeholder groups such as business and industrial associations, organized labor, there were a number of concerns raised about the project, including the alternative routes. We are listening to all concerns and are examining various solutions. We expect this process to continue to about this year and into 2012 as we advance through the citing process. 
Turning from electric transmission to natural gas distribution. With a long winter behind us, we resumed work in March on the water gas pipeline. This year's work primarily involves modification to our Waterbury LNG facility and building on approximately 6-mile pipeline from Waterbury to connect with the pipeline we installed last year in Cheshire. This project will address reliability issues and bottlenecks on our distribution system and also serve a growing demand for natural gas in Yankee Gas' service territory. 
Yankee Gas continues to see strong sales growth with first quarter sales in 2011 at 16.9% higher than they were in the same period of 2010. On a weather adjusted basis, they were 3.2% higher. We've seen significant peak date demand growth in our system resulting from two drivers distributor generation and customers switching from interruptible to firm service. 
For example, in this past heating season, Yankee Gas saw a 5% growth in peak day demand. To put this in perspective, that's the equivalent of eight years of peak day demand growth just in the last two years. This significant difference between oil and gas prices with the energy equivalent cost of natural gas basic behalf of that of oil continues to drive demand for residential conversions and new customer connections. 
With 83% on main penetration, Yankee Gas has the potential to add 41,000 new customers to the existing base of 206,000 customers. You may recall from our EEI presentation that we are projecting about a $25 million a year increase in Yankee Gas' capital investment to address aging infrastructure, primarily to replace cast iron and steel distribution piping. This is consistent with the federally mandated distribution integrity management programs. We expect to receive the DPUC's position on this investment as part of the Yankee Gas rate case decision next month. Now I would like to turn the phone call over to David."
292525,130661985,123697,"Northeast Utilities, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 06, 2011",2011-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee. Following our release of mid year results last year, Chuck noted that we have reached an inflection point where we announced a decision to improve our distribution results and expect to begin earning much closer to our allowed returns. T",1629,"Thank you, Lee. Following our release of mid year results last year, Chuck noted that we have reached an inflection point where we announced a decision to improve our distribution results and expect to begin earning much closer to our allowed returns. 
This view is primarily due to the inclusion of the CL&P and PSNH distribution rate cases. Results FFrom the past three quarters show that we indeed reached that inflection point in mid 2010. And our first quarter results for 2011 demonstrates that's a continuing trend. Excluding the impact of the merger related expenses of $0.05 per share, we earned $122.5 million or $0.69 per share in the first quarter compared with $86.2 million or $0.49 per share in the same quarter of 2010.
Including merger expenses, we earned $0.64 per share. As is true in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, the primary area of year-over-year earnings growth was in the distribution segment, where we earned $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $47.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. That improvement was driven by a number of factors, including the distribution rate decision. We also benefited from the impact of much colder quarter 2011 than in 2010 and from our continued focus on managing our costs. 
Largely because of the impact of weather, electric sales were up 3% in the first quarter 2011 versus 2010 heating days are up 18.6% in the Hartford, Connecticut area and 17.7% in the Concord, New Hampshire area. Translating that to earnings, relative to the first quarter of 2010, the weather effect accounted for $0.05 per share of the quarter's $0.20 per share increase.
On a weather adjusted basis, retail electric sales were down 0.2%, which is pretty consistent with our expectations of flat weather adjusted sales for the full year. PSNH sales were the strongest of our three electric companies, rising 0.4% on a weather adjusted basis while CL&P and WMECO weather adjusted sales were down about 0.5%. Within customer classes on a weather adjusted basis, residential sales were flat, commercial sales were down to 0.9% and industrial sales show some modest growth rising 1.4%. 
In Connecticut, industrial sales increased 1.6% at CL&P and 11.7% at Yankee Gas. We see support for continued growth in Connecticut manufacturing employment and hours of work across number of sectors including defense, position manufacturing and other high-tech industries. These developments and support sales trends in this class of customers over the coming quarters.
Another important variable is the price of electricity. Within natural gas, prices continue to soften and customers see declining prices. In January one of this year, CL&P residential and small commercial customers on extended service at an average rate decrease of 7.8%. 
On April 1, large customers on last resort rates experienced small decreased in their energy rates to $0.718 per kilowatt hour, down very significantly from the end of 2008 and that rate was nearly $.127 per kilowatt hour. As Lee mentioned, natural gas sales continue to grow at a very attractive rate in large part due to the significant and increasing price advantage of natural gas versus home heating oil. 
At CL&P, distribution earnings were $28.5 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2010. The primary driver was last summer's rate decision, which increased distribution revenues and lower depreciation expense. CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months ended March 31st 2011 8.8% and we continue to project that distribution ROE of approximately 9% in 2011 compared to our allowed return of 9.4%. 
At PSNH, distribution and generation earnings totaled $21.5 million in the quarter compared with $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. The distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2010, was the primary driver but other factors included a 2.7% increase in electric sales, increased generation earnings from AFUDC on the Merrimack Scrubber project and a $1 million after-tax charge PSNH generation in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the enactment of federal healthcare legislation.
The PSNH's combined distribution and generation ROE was 11.1% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011. We expect that level to decline over the balance of the year due in part to a small rate reduction that will be effective July 1 as our recruitment period ends and we expect for the full year 2011 our ROE to be approximately 9%.
WMECO distribution earnings totaled $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. WMECO benefited from a $16.8 million distribution rate increase that was effective February 1, 2011. WMECO sales increased 2% in the quarter may be the result of weather adjusted sales were down 0.6% in the first quarter of 11 compared with the first quarter of 2010. 
I should note that the DPUC rate decision approved the revenue decoupling at Western Mass which provides us with approximately $125 million a year in distribution revenue regardless of the weather and regardless of the economic trend. WMECO's distribution ROE was 5.9% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011. And we continue to project a distribution regulatory ROE of about 9% this year. 
Yankee Gas earned $22.5 million in the first quarter of 11 compared with $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. Much of that improvement was due to higher sales, which were 16% over last year or 3.2% on a weather normalized basis. Yankee's ROE for the full year will depend to some extent on the outcome of its current rate case. In January, Yankee Gas's filed an application we the Connecticut DPUC to raise distribution rates by $32.8 million effective July 1, 2011, and an incremental $13 million effective July 1, 2012. 
The primary objective in this case is reflected in rates in Waterbury Wallingford line we discussed earlier. As part of the normal rate case process, Yankee Gas subsequently reduced that rate $29.1 million in mid 11 and an incremental $10.3 million in mid-2012. The lower rate request was due primarily to the impact of bonus tax appreciation. Final brief have been filed in the case and we are expecting a draft decision in early June and a final decision later that month. 
Turning from distribution. Our transmission segment earned $44.7 million in the first quarter compared with $40.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. The increase was due primarily to a higher transmission rate case, which totaled $2.8 billion at March 31, 2011 compared with $2.6 million as of March 31, 2010.
Additionally, transmission earnings in the first quarter of 2010 included a charge of $800,000 related to the enactment of federal healthcare legislation. New parent and other companies recorded $8.7 million expenses in the first quarter of 2011, including $8.3 million in charges related to the merger. Note that effective with the first quarter of 2011, we no longer report our competitive business results separately as we wind down that business and it enters its final few years.
We now project after tax merger expenses of about $0.20 per share this year. That represents an increase of $0.05 per share of merger cost compared with our estimate earlier this year. The increase is due to a number of factors including additional integration activities currently underway. In terms of earnings guidance, as our news release noted, we reaffirmed stand-alone earnings guidance for the year of $2.25 to $2.40, excluding merger-related expenses. That guidance includes earnings of between about $0.25 and $1.35 per share at the distribution segment and $1.05 to $1.10 per share at the transmission segment. 
We continue to project net expenses of about $0.05 at NU parent and other companies excluding the $0.20 of charges related to the merger. Turning from earnings to cash flow. We generated $356 million of cash from operations after repaying reduction bond in the first quarter of this year compared with $159 million in the first quarter of 2010. The improved cash flow is primarily due to the impact of bonus depreciation, as well as higher earnings. We now project cash flows from operations after repayment of rate reduction bonds of between $900 million and $950 million this year, aided by a $200 million benefit from bonus depreciation. We reduced these figures by about $50 million as a result of clarifications the IRS has recently made about what capital expenditures qualify for bonus depreciation.
We continue to see benefits of our improved cash flow and credit quality, as well as lower interest rates. On April 1, we completed the one-year reoffering of $62 million of CL&P tax business bonds at a rate of 1.25%, down from last year's rate of 1.4%. On April 29, PSNH issued mandatory notices on two issues of tax -- bonds totaling nearly $120 million and carrying a coupon of 6%. PSNH expect to issue -- later this spring to refinance those bonds, and we are anticipating more than $1 million a year in interest savings.
As I mentioned in February, we expect PSNH to issue $160 million of new bonds in the second half of this year and Western Mass to issue $100 million of senior unsecured notes, also in the second half of the year. We expect PSNH's financing to benefit from Fitch's recent upgrade of PSNH secured debt to A-, which occurred on April 18. 
You may have noticed that Fitch also rates CL&P outlook to positive from stable in recognition of CL&P's improving credit metrics, which maintained its watch positive outlook on NU unsecured debt pending confirmation of the merger with NSTAR. I look forward to seeing many of you at the ADA conference in Florida on May 15 and 16. Now let me turn the call back over to Jeff Kotkin."

From the standpoint of the overall project cost, we had always said the overall project cost is sort of about $1.5 billion. We have recently done a filing that David will talk more about in terms of collection of construction work in progress from the regional networks system from L&S customers, which is essentially CL&P, Western Mass Electric in New Hampshire that will lower the overall cost so we won't have to refund that back to the local network service customers. But you're looking at it a total project cost for NEEWS of about $1.35 billion not refunding but the credits to local network service customers.

Within that flat, it will vary by class of course. What we've seen so far in the first three months of the year is a little bit, and this is all weather adjusted, strip away all of the heating differential that we've seen. But we have seen some strength and I use that term loosely in the industrial area up 1.5% on average across all of our classes. We see a little bit of growth in the residential area, and still some weakness for the commercial across all of our businesses, commercial is still down about 1%. And as I suggested, on our prepared remarks, it does vary by state where you are seeing a little bit more strength in our New Hampshire area and that's historically what we had recognized. So I think particularly in southern New Hampshire, they experienced the strength that we see coming out of the Boston market. A little bit weaker in Massachusetts and a little bit more balanced in Connecticut. But when you kind of look at the trends, I had to say commercial still struggling to make a lot of progress as consumer spending isn't where it was, industrial progressing and keep in mind particularly in Connecticut this is a big market for exporting, exporting to France, to Canada, to Germany, to China, so those companies are actually doing well particularly given where the dollar is these days. And the residential consumer I'm not sure sort of sprung back to life but they're right at about flat for now. We'll continue to watch that, Jay. I think we still look for sales across the entire platform of our companies and our customers, still balanced out to about flat. And as you heard in our comments, too, we try to weather that with a revenue decoupling cost in Massachusetts and that's not a big earnings issue there. We'll report back as trends continue."

As I mentioned before, you've got the issue around Yankee, what will happen there. If the floor stays very low or goes to zero, then the likelihood is that some of those plants will shut down although they shut down as a result of the environmental emissions issues coming either from the states or the EPA. That's good for a transmission obviously there are better solutions we think the building new capacity in terms of transmission solutions including bringing in renewable energy from a renewable energy and some sourcing project in New Hampshire and Maine, as well of course as the Northern Pass or HVDC coming out from Quebec.

We've had a very strong start to the year, both financially and operationally. Lee and David will provide you with more details. But as you saw in our earnings news release, first quarter financial results were well above 2010 results, and consistent with our guidance for 2011. 
We have also made good progress on our major projects that are supportive of the energy policies of the states in which we serve. They include the news projects, public-service New Hampshire's Clean Air Project and the Yankee Gas' Waterbury-to-Wallingford line. We will update you on each of these projects shortly. 
Economic recovery across our service territory continues to vary. In New Hampshire, which, along with the Boston area, appears to have the strongest economic growth in New England, manufacturing employment is up by nearly 2% over last year while nonmanufacturing employment is up about 1%. New Hampshire's unemployment rate in March fell to 5.2%, one of the lowest in New England. While not as robust as New Hampshire, we've seen growth in Connecticut as well. Employment is up more than 1% and personal income up 3.4%. While hiring is yet to pick up in Western Massachusetts, first new income is up 4.2% from last year. Cost control in a continued reduction in uncollectible expense have helped us improve results as our regional economy has begun to turn upward.
Our major initiatives, we cleared another milestone in February with our Northern Pass transmission project when FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] accepted without change the transmission services agreement, which spells out the terms and conditions of the arrangement between Northern Pass LLC, our project subsidiary and Hydro-Qu√©bec. As you know, the Northern Pass transmission project will bring 1,200 megawatts clean hydroelectric power from Canada into New England at a highly competitive rate. 
In the fourth quarter of last year, we moved into what we expect will be more than a 2-year effort to site the project when we apply for a presidential permit from the U.S. Department of Energy. We continue to believe the project offers significant benefits to both the state of New Hampshire and to New England. This new source of energy will benefit everyone in the region by improving electric reliability and fuel diversity, lessening our reliance on foreign fuels, reducing emissions and producing energy savings for homeowners and businesses. 
New Hampshire will gain additional benefits in the form of well-paying construction jobs, $25 million a year in new tax revenue and from $260 million to $315 million in increased economic output during the development and construction phases of the project.
As you no doubt can appreciate, building 180-mile transmission project, especially one that may require up to 40 miles of new rights-of-way, requires a good deal of support before construction can begin. You are probably aware that in March, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill that would limit the ability of utilities to use eminent domain to build a project such as Northern Pass, namely projects that are needy to meet environmental and economic goals rather than reliability requirements. That bill is pending in the New Hampshire Senate. 
While we opposed the bill because it could add to the time and cost of completing the project, we nonetheless understand our responsibility to work with the communities to which Northern Pass ultimately will be built. As a result of extensive conversations with various stakeholders in New Hampshire, we recently asked the U.S. Department of Energy to extend the current public comment period with a presidential permit application by 60 days. The DOE granted that request.
In addition, the approval process required us to submit a variety of alternative routes and after due consideration of the concerns expressed in New Hampshire, we likewise asked that these alternative routes be removed from consideration. We fully understand the need to work constructively with our neighbors to identify a route that will bring significant and economic environmental benefits to New Hampshire and other New England states. While at the same time, respecting the rights of property owners and protecting some of the most scenic areas of our region. We continue to expect to begin construction in 2013 and to complete it by the end of 2015.
Turning to our pending merger with NSTAR. We've had a number of positive development since our late February conference call. On March 4, NU and NSTAR shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger. Approximately 81% of all NU shares were voted at the meeting and 98% of those shares were voted in support of the merger. We thank our shareholders who are listening to this call for their support.
On April 5, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission issued an order confirming that it did not have jurisdiction over the merger and on April 15, the Maine Public Utilities Commission hearing examiner responsible for our merger document -- docket recommended that the full commission approved the merger subject to FERC approval. Maine regulators are scheduled to deliberate on that recommendation next week. Our merger applications remain pending before both the FERC and the NERC [North American Electric Reliability Corporation] and we have not seen any significant issues raised by either agency.
In Connecticut, the DPUC [Department of Public Utility Control] issued a draft decision in January stating that it does not have jurisdiction over the merger. That decision has not yet been finalized but the DPUC did hold an informational meeting on the merger in late March. Also in late March, the Connecticut legislature's energy and technology committee narrowly endorsed Senate Bill 1140, which would expand the DPUC's jurisdiction over utility merger. But that bill has not advanced in either the Senate or the House since then.
In Massachusetts, you may recall that on March 10, the DPU modified its utility merger review standard and adopted a net benefits test rather than the historic no net harm test. On April 8, we and NSTAR filed supplemental testimony that discussed very substantial cost and environmental benefits of the merger. Over the first 10 years of the merger, we estimate that net benefits of the merger will be $784 million. 
We also demonstrated our commitment to the region's environmental and energy initiatives by proposing an expansion of our energy conservation and solar generation programs. Hearings on the merger are now scheduled to begin July 6, while no date beyond the start of hearings have been identified by the DPU, we believe the schedule should support consummation of the merger in the second half of 2011.
Integration teams from both companies have begun to identify the best practices that should be adopted once the merger is complete. The two companies will be ready to operate as one company once we receive the required regulatory approvals and closed this transformative transaction. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

As Chuck said, we are very pleased with our operating performance during the first three months of the year, despite a difficult win through with record January snowfall.

As Chuck said, we are very pleased with our operating performance during the first three months of the year, despite a difficult win through with record January snowfall. Overall, reliability was far better than the first quarter of 2011 than it was in the first quarter 2010 when we had very significant windstorms and damage in both Southwest Connecticut and New Hampshire. 
Our customer service metrics have improved significantly over the course of the last 12 months, particularly in our call centers. Yankee Gas has the highest J.D. Power customer service ranking of any East Coast mid-size natural gas utility this year. Credit and collections performance has also been very strong, with non-hardship uncollectible expense down by more than 50% in the first quarter of this year as compared to the first three months of 2010. 
Our PSNH [Public Service of New Hampshire] generating stations operated well during a very cold winter and our 6 largest fossil fuel units had an average availability factor of 95% in the quarter. Our wood-burning plant, at Shiloh, operated at a strong 89% capacity factor and produced nearly 83,000 renewable energy certificates in the quarter.
Our $430 million Clean Air Project, which involves installing a wet scrubber on our two unit Merrimack coal-fired station is ahead of schedule and currently 82% complete. Some of the new equipment is now being tested, system tie-ins, start up and conditioning activities are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, and the scrubber itself could be operational by the end of the year. The entire project should be fully complete by mid-2012. 
You may recall that the scrubbers required under New Hampshire's mercury reduction law, which was enacted about 5 years ago. We believe that this technology will provide us with some of the cleanest coal burning units in the country and will position us well to meet the EPA's [Environmental Protection Agency] post rules on hazardous air pollutants. Our coal-related emissions have been further reduced by the wood-burning unit at Shiloh Station, which we placed a 50-megawatt coal burning boiler several years ago. 
Turning to transmission. The greatest spring for reliability project is the largest of the 3 major projects we expect to undertake as part of the NEEWS [New England East-West Solution] family of projects. We commenced substation work on the GSRP [Greater Springfield Reliability Project] in December 2010 and begin site work on the Massachusetts overhead section in the first quarter of 2011.
Full construction should begin in the third quarter when we expect to receive the Army Corps of Engineers and Massachusetts environmental permits. We expect to invest $180 million in GSRP in 2011, $16 million less than we had estimated at EEI. But we continue to expect the project to be completed by the end of 2013 at a cost of $795 million. 
The Interstate Reliability Project will provide a new 345-kV transmission line connecting Connecticut with Ireland and Massachusetts. ISO New England reconfirmed the need for the IRP last year, and we are currently coordinating with National Grid. So that we can file our siting applications with all 3 states later this year. We continue to estimate the project will be completed in 2015.
As we have moved forward with our design of the interstate, ISO New England has identified some unrelated transmission infrastructure upgrades that will be required to result specific to reliability issues in Eastern Connecticut. As a result, we will not need to undertake certain substation upgrades with early inhibition as part of the interstate project. Instead, that work will be deferred and studied as part of the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, our third major piece of NEEWS. Therefore, we have reduced our estimate for our share of the interstate project by $50 million, from $301 million to approximately $251 million. About 1/2 of that reduction will be offset by a $25 million increase in transmission expenditures related to the Eastern Connecticut upgrades I just mentioned. Those upgrades will be advanced from 2014 into 2011 and the 2012 period.
But Central Connecticut Reliability Project continues to be reviewed by ISO New England. ISO New England is evaluating that project as part of an overall review of transmission that now encompasses a broader geographical area in Central Connecticut. We expect the review to be completed and the needs identified in late 2011 with specific projects identified in late 2012. We continue to project the cost of CCRP of $338 million, and we'll update the cost estimates and project completion dates after ISO New England has completed its review.
We believe the project will be completed about 18 months after the interstate project. Despite the slight changes in timing and spending on some of our projects, we continue to project investing approximately $444 million on our transmission infrastructure this year. Early, Chuck discussed some of the recent developments concerning Northern Pass project, the Department of Energy had 7 public meetings on the project in New Hampshire in mid-March, which were very well attended. 
While there has been considerable support for the project among key stakeholder groups such as business and industrial associations, organized labor, there were a number of concerns raised about the project, including the alternative routes. We are listening to all concerns and are examining various solutions. We expect this process to continue throughout this year and into 2012 as we advance through the siting process. 
Turning from electric transmission to natural gas distribution. With a long winter behind us, we resumed work in March on the Waterbury-to-Wallingford gas pipeline. This year's work primarily involves modification to our Waterbury LNG [liquefied natural gas] facility and building on approximately 6-mile pipeline from Waterbury to connect with the pipeline we installed last year in Cheshire. This project will address reliability issues and bottlenecks on our distribution system and also serve a growing demand for natural gas in Yankee Gas' service territory. 
Yankee Gas continues to see strong sales growth with first quarter sales in 2011 at 16.9% higher than they were in the same period of 2010. On a weather adjusted basis, they were 3.2% higher. We've seen significant peak date demand growth in our system, resulting from two drivers: distributor generation and customers switching from interruptible to firm service. 
For example, in this past heating season, Yankee Gas saw a 5% growth in peak day demand. To put this in perspective, that's the equivalent of 8 years of peak day demand growth just in the last 2 years. This significant differential between oil and gas prices with the energy equivalent cost of natural gas being half of that of oil, continues to drive demand for residential conversions and new customer connections. 
With 83% on main penetration, Yankee Gas has the potential to add 41,000 new customers to the existing base of 206,000 customers. You may recall from our EEI presentation that we are projecting about a $25 million a year increase in Yankee Gas' capital investment to address aging infrastructure, primarily to replace cast iron and beer steel distribution piping. This is consistent with the federally mandated distribution integrity management programs. We expect to receive the DPUC's decision on this investment as part of the Yankee Gas rate case decision next month. Now I would like to turn the phone call over to David."
292525,130661985,124021,"Northeast Utilities, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 06, 2011",2011-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee. Following our release of mid-year results last year, Chuck noted that we have reached an inflection point where we announced a decision to improve our distribution results and expect to begin earning much closer to our allowed returns. T",1651,"Thank you, Lee. Following our release of mid-year results last year, Chuck noted that we have reached an inflection point where we announced a decision to improve our distribution results and expect to begin earning much closer to our allowed returns. 
This view is primarily due to the conclusion of the CL&P [Connecticut Light and Power Company] and PSNH distribution rate case decisions. Results from the past 3 quarters show that we indeed reached that inflection point in mid-2010, and our first quarter results for 2011 demonstrate that continuing trend. Excluding the impact of merger-related expenses of $0.05 per share, we earned $122.5 million or $0.69 per share in the first quarter compared with $86.2 million or $0.49 per share in the same quarter of 2010.
Including merger expenses, we earned $0.64 per share. As it's true in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, the primary area of year-over-year earnings growth was in the distribution segment, where we earned $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $47.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. That improvement was driven by a number of factors, including the distribution rate decision. We also benefited from the impact of much colder quarter 2011 than in 2010 and from our continued focus on managing our costs. Largely because of the impact of weather, electric sales were up 3% in the first quarter 2011 versus 2010. Heating degree days were up 18.6% in the Hartford, Connecticut area and 17.7% in the Concord, New Hampshire area. Translating that to earnings, relative to the first quarter of 2010, the weather effect accounted for $0.05 per share of the quarter's $0.20 per share increase.
On a weather-adjusted basis, retail electric sales were down 0.2%, which is pretty consistent with our expectations of flat weather-adjusted sales for the full year. PSNH sales were the strongest of our 3 electric companies, rising 0.4% on a weather-adjusted basis while CL&P and WMECO [Western Massachusetts Electric Company] weather-adjusted sales were down about 0.5%. Within customer classes on a weather-adjusted basis, residential sales were flat, commercial sales were down to 0.9% and industrial sales show some modest growth rising 1.4%. 
In Connecticut, industrial sales increased 1.6% at CL&P and 11.7% at Yankee Gas. We see support for continued growth in Connecticut manufacturing employment and hours worked across the number of sectors including defense, decision manufacturing and other high-tech industries. These developments, issue and support, sales trends in this class of customers over the coming quarters.
Another important variable is the price of electricity. Within natural gas, prices continue to soften and customers see declining prices. On January 1 of this year, CL&P residential and small commercial customers on extended service had an average rate decrease of 7.8%. 
On April 1, large customers on last resort rate experienced a small decreased in their energy rates to $0.718 per kilowatt hour, down very significantly from the end of 2008 and that rate was nearly $0.127 per kilowatt hour. As Lee mentioned, natural gas sales continue to grow at a very attractive rate. In large part due to this significant and increasing price advantage of natural gas versus home heating oil. 
At CL&P, distribution earnings were $28.5 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2010. The primary driver was last summer's rate decision, which increased distribution revenues and lower depreciation expense. CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011, 8.8%. And we continue to project the distribution ROE of approximately 9% in 2011 compared to our allowed return of 9.4%. 
At PSNH, distribution and generation earnings totaled $21.5 million in the first quarter compared with $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. The distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2010, was the primary driver but other factors included a 2.7% increase in electric sales, increased generation earnings from AFUDC [allowance for funds used during construction] on the Merrimack Scrubber project and a $1 million after-tax charge PSNH generation took in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the enactment of federal healthcare legislation.
PSNH's combined distribution and generation ROE was 11.1% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011. We expect that level to decline over the balance of the year due in part to a small rate reduction that will be effective July 1 as our recruitment period ends and we expect for the full year 2011, our ROE to be approximately 9%.
WMECO distribution earnings totaled $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. WMECO benefited from a $16.8 million distribution rate increase that was effective February 1, 2011. WMECO sales increased 2% during the quarter, mainly the result of weather. Weather-adjusted sales were down 0.6% in the first quarter of '11 compared with the first quarter of 2010. 
However, I should note that the DPUC -- excuse me, the DPU rate decision approved the revenue decoupling at Western Mass, which provides us with approximately $125 million a year in distribution revenue regardless of the weather and regardless of the economic trend. WMECO's distribution ROE was 5.9% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011. And we continue to project a distribution regulatory ROE of about 9% this year. 
Yankee Gas earned $22.5 million in the first quarter of '11 compared with $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. Much of that improvement was due to higher sales, which were 16% over last year or 3.2% on a weather-normalized basis. Yankee's ROE for the full year will depend to some extent on the outcome of its current rate case. In January, Yankee Gas filed an application with the Connecticut DUC (sic) [DPUC] to raise distribution rates by $32.8 million effective July 1, 2011, and an incremental $13 million effective July 1, 2012.
The primary objective in this case is reflecting in rates, the Waterbury-to-Wallingford line we discussed earlier. As part of the normal rate case process, Yankee Gas subsequently reduced that rate to $29.1 million in mid-'11 and an incremental $10.3 million in mid-2012. The lower rate request was due primarily to the impact of bonus tax appreciation. Final briefs have been filed in the case, and we are expecting a draft decision in early June and a file decision -- final decision later that month. 
Turning from distribution. Our Transmission segment earned $44.7 million in the first quarter compared with $40.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. The increase was due primarily to a higher transmission rate base, which totaled $2.8 billion at March 31, 2011 compared with $2.6 billion as of March 31, 2010.
Additionally, transmission earnings in the first quarter of 2010 included a charge of $800,000 related to the enactment of federal healthcare legislation. NU parent and other companies recorded $8.7 million of net expenses in the first quarter of 2011, including $8.3 million in charges related to the merger. Note that effective with the first quarter of 2011, we no longer report our competitive business results separately as we wind down that business and it enters its final few years.
We now project after-tax merger expenses of about $0.20 per share this year. That represents an increase of $0.05 per share of merger cost compared with our estimate earlier this year. The increase is due to a number of factors including additional integration pumping activities currently underway. In terms of earnings guidance, as our news release noted, we reaffirmed stand-alone earnings guidance for the year of $2.25 to $2.40, excluding merger-related expenses. That guidance includes earnings of between about $0.25 and $1.35 per share at the Distribution segment and $1.05 to $1.10 per share at the Transmission segment. We continue to project net expenses of about $0.05 at NU parent and other companies excluding the $0.20 of charges related to the merger. 
Turning from earnings to cash flow. We generated $356 million of cash from operations after repayment of rate reduction bond in the first quarter of this year compared with $159 million in the first quarter of 2010. The improved cash flow is primarily due to the impact of bonus depreciation, as well as higher earnings. We now project cash flows from operations after repayment of rate reduction bonds of between $900 million and $950 million this year, aided by a $200 million benefit from bonus depreciation. We reduced these figures by about $50 million as a result of clarifications the IRS has recently made about what capital expenditures qualify for bonus depreciation.
We continue to see benefits of our improved cash flow and credit quality, as well as lower interest rates. On April 1, we completed the one-year reoffering of $62 million of CL&P taxable bond at a rate of 1.25%, down from last year's rate of 1.4%. On April 29, PSNH issued mandatory call notices on two issues of taxable bonds, totaling nearly $120 million and carrying a coupon of 6%. PSNH expect to issue taxable debt later this spring to refinance those bonds, and we are anticipating more than $1 million a year in interest savings.
As I mentioned in February, we expect PSNH to issue $160 million of new bonds in the second half of this year and Western Mass to issue $100 million of senior unsecured notes, also in the second half of the year. We expect PSNH's financing to benefit from Fitch's recent upgrade of PSNH secured debt to A-, which occurred on April 18. 
You may have noticed that Fitch also raised CL&P's outlook to positive from stable in recognition of CL&P's improving credit metrics, which maintained it's watch positive outlook on NU unsecured debt pending confirmation of the merger with NSTAR. I look forward to seeing many of you at the AGA Conference in Florida on May 15 and 16. Now let me turn the call back over to Jeff Kotkin."

Within that flat, it will vary by class, of course. What we've seen so far in the first 3 months of the year is a little bit, and this is all weather adjusted, strip away all of the heating differential that we've seen. But we've seen some strength and I use that term loosely in the industrial area, up 1.5% on average across all of our classes. We see a little bit of growth in the residential area, and still some weakness for the commercial across all of our businesses, commercial is still down about 1%. And as I suggested, on our prepared remarks, it does vary by state where you're seeing a little bit more strength in our New Hampshire area and that's historically what we had recognized. So I think particularly in Southern New Hampshire, they experienced the strength that we see coming out of the Boston market. A little bit weaker in Massachusetts and a little bit more balanced in Connecticut. But when you kind of look at the trends, I had to say commercial still struggling to make a lot of progress as consumer spending isn't quite where it was, industrial progressing and keep in mind, particularly in Connecticut, this is a big market for exporting, exporting to France, to Canada, to Germany, to China. So those companies are actually doing well, particularly given where the dollar is these days. And the residential consumer I'm not sure sort of sprung back to life but they're right at about flat for now. We'll continue to watch that, Jay. I think we still look for sales across the entire platform of our companies and our customers, still to kind of balanced out to about flat. And as you heard in our comments, too, we try to weather that with a revenue decoupling cost in Massachusetts. So that's not a big earnings issue there. We'll report back as these trends continue."

As I mentioned before, you've got the issue around Vermont Yankee, what will happen there. If the floor stays very low or goes to zero, then the likelihood is that some of those plants will shut down, although the shutdowns is a result of the environmental emissions issues coming either from the states or the EPA. That's good for a transmission obviously there are better solutions we think than building new capacity in terms of transmission solutions, including bringing in renewable energy from a renewable energy and some sourcing project in New Hampshire and Maine, as well, of course, as the Northern Pass or HVDC coming down from Quebec. So from the standpoint of that some of these units retire, we think that is very supportive of transmission. And ISO was studying transmission in lower New Hampshire and lower Vermont, including transmission now that runs down from New Hampshire down into the Massachusetts, which is the [indiscernible] transmission line. Those projects are starting to mature, and we would place a higher profitability if those projects could get built in the future."

We've had a very strong start to the year, both financially and operationally. Lee and David will provide you with more details. But as you saw in our earnings news release, first quarter financial results were well above 2010 results, and consistent with our guidance for 2011. 
We have also made good progress on our major projects that are supportive of the energy policies of the states in which we serve. They include the news projects, public-service New Hampshire's Clean Air Project and Yankee Gas' Waterbury-to-Wallingford line. We will update you on each of these projects shortly. 
Economic recovery across our service territory continues to vary. In New Hampshire, which, along with the Boston area, appears to have the strongest economic growth in New England, manufacturing employment is up by nearly 2% over last year while nonmanufacturing employment is up about 1%. New Hampshire's unemployment rate in March fell to 5.2%, one of the lowest in New England. While not as robust as New Hampshire, we've seen growth in Connecticut as well. Employment is up more than 1% and personal income up 3.4%. While hiring has yet to pick up in Western Massachusetts, personal income is up 4.2% from last year. Cost control and a continued reduction in uncollectible expense have helped us improve results as our regional economy has begun to turn upward.
On of our major initiatives, we cleared another milestone in February with our Northern Pass transmission project when FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] accepted without change the transmission services agreement, which spells out the terms and conditions of the arrangement between Northern Pass LLC, our project subsidiary and Hydro-Qu√©bec. As you know, the Northern Pass transmission project will bring 1,200 megawatts of clean hydroelectric power from Canada into New England at a highly competitive rate. 
In the fourth quarter of last year, we moved into what we expect will be more than a 2-year effort to site the project when we apply for a presidential permit from the U.S. Department of Energy. We continue to believe the project offers significant benefits to both the state of New Hampshire and to New England. This new source of energy will benefit everyone in the region by improving electric reliability and fuel diversity, lessening our reliance on foreign fuels, reducing emissions and producing energy savings for homeowners and businesses. 
New Hampshire will gain additional benefits in the form of well-paying construction jobs, $25 million a year in new tax revenue and from $260 million to $315 million in increased economic output during the development and construction phases of the project.
As you no doubt can appreciate, building 180-mile transmission project, especially one that may require up to 40 miles of new rights-of-way, requires a good deal of support before construction can begin. You are probably aware that in March, the New Hampshire House of Representatives approved a bill that would limit the ability of utilities to use eminent domain to build a project such as Northern Pass, namely projects that are needed to meet environmental and economic goals rather than reliability requirements. That bill is pending in the New Hampshire Senate. 
While we oppose the bill because it could add to the time and cost of completing the project, we nonetheless understand our responsibility to work with the communities through which Northern Pass ultimately will be built. As a result of extensive conversations with various stakeholders in New Hampshire, we recently asked the U.S. Department of Energy to extend the current public comment period with a presidential permit application by 60 days. The DOE granted that request.
In addition, the approval process required us to submit a variety of alternative routes and after due consideration of the concerns expressed in New Hampshire, we likewise asked that these alternative routes be removed from consideration. We fully understand the need to work constructively with our neighbors to identify a route that will bring significant and economic environmental benefits to New Hampshire and other New England states, while at the same time, respecting the rights of property owners and protecting some of the most scenic areas of our region. We continue to expect to begin construction in 2013 and to complete it by the end of 2015.
Turning to our pending merger with NSTAR. We've had a number of positive developments since our late February conference call. On March 4, NU and NSTAR shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger. Approximately 81% of all NU shares were voted at the meeting and 98% of those shares were voted in support of the merger. We thank our shareholders who are listening to this call for their support.
On April 5, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission issued an order confirming that it did not have jurisdiction over the merger and on April 15, the Maine Public Utilities Commission hearing examiner responsible for our merger document -- docket recommended that the full commission approve the merger subject to FERC approval. Maine regulators are scheduled to deliberate on that recommendation next week. Our merger applications remain pending before both the FERC and the NERC [North American Electric Reliability Corporation] and we have not seen any significant issues raised by either agency.
In Connecticut, the DPUC [Department of Public Utility Control] issued a draft decision in January stating that it does not have jurisdiction over the merger. That decision has not yet been finalized but the DPUC did hold an informational meeting on the merger in late March. Also in late March, the Connecticut legislature's energy and technology committee narrowly endorsed Senate Bill 1140, which would expand the DPUC's jurisdiction over utility merger. But that bill has not advanced in either the Senate or the House since then.
In Massachusetts, you may recall that on March 10, the DPU modified its utility merger review standard and adopted a net benefits test rather than the historic ‚Äúno net harm‚Äù test. On April 8, we and NSTAR filed supplemental testimony that discussed very substantial cost and environmental benefits of the merger. Over the first 10 years of the merger, we estimate that net benefits of the merger will be $784 million. 
We also demonstrated our commitment to the region's environmental and energy initiatives by proposing an expansion of our energy conservation and solar generation programs. Hearings on the merger are now scheduled to begin July 6. And while no dates beyond the start of hearings have been identified by the DPU, we believe the schedule should support consummation of the merger in the second half of 2011.
Integration teams from both companies have begun to identify the best practices that should be adopted once the merger is complete. The two companies will be ready to operate as one company once we receive the required regulatory approvals and close this transformative transaction. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

As Chuck said, we are very pleased with our operating performance during the first three months of the year.

As Chuck said, we are very pleased with our operating performance during the first three months of the year. Despite a difficult winter with record January snowfall, overall, reliability was far better in the first quarter of 2011 than it was in the first quarter 2010 when we had very significant windstorms and damage in both Southwest Connecticut and New Hampshire. 
Our customer service metrics have improved significantly over the course of the last 12 months, particularly in our call centers. Yankee Gas has the highest J.D. Power customer service ranking of any East Coast mid-size natural gas utility this year. Credit and collections performance has also been very strong, with non-hardship uncollectible expense down by more than 50% in the first quarter of this year as compared to the first three months of 2010. 
Our PSNH [Public Service of New Hampshire] generating stations operated well during a very cold winter and our 6 largest fossil fuel units had an average availability factor of 95% in the quarter. Our wood-burning plant, at Shiloh, operated at a strong 89% capacity factor and produced nearly 83,000 renewable energy certificates in the quarter.
Our $430 million Clean Air Project, which involves installing a wet scrubber on our two unit Merrimack coal-fired station is ahead of schedule and currently 82% complete. Some of the new equipment is now being tested, system tie-ins, start up and conditioning activities are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, and the scrubber itself could be operational by the end of the year. The entire project should be fully complete by mid-2012. 
You may recall that the scrubbers are required under New Hampshire's mercury reduction law, which was enacted about 5 years ago. We believe that this technology will provide us with some of the cleanest coal burning units in the country and will position us well to meet the EPA's [Environmental Protection Agency] proposed rules on hazardous air pollutants. Our coal-related emissions have been further reduced by the wood-burning unit at Shiloh Station, which replaced a 50-megawatt coal burning boiler several years ago. 
Turning to transmission. The Greater Springfield reliability project is the largest of the 3 major projects we expect to undertake as part of the NEEWS [New England East-West Solution] family of projects. We commenced substation work on the GSRP [Greater Springfield Reliability Project] in December 2010 and began site work on the Massachusetts overhead section in the first quarter of 2011.
Full construction should begin in the third quarter when we expect to receive the Army Corps of Engineers and Massachusetts environmental permits. We expect to invest $180 million in GSRP in 2011, $16 million less than we had estimated at EEI. But we continue to expect the project to be completed by the end of 2013 at a cost of $795 million. 
The Interstate Reliability Project will provide a new 345-kV transmission line connecting Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. ISO New England reconfirmed the need for the IRP last year, and we are currently coordinating with National Grid so that we can file our siting applications with all 3 states later this year. We continue to estimate the project will be completed in 2015.
As we have moved forward with our design of the interstate, ISO New England has identified some unrelated transmission infrastructure upgrades that will be required to resolve specific reliability issues in Eastern Connecticut. As a result, we will not need to undertake certain substation upgrades we‚Äôd earlier envisioned as part of the interstate project. Instead, that work will be deferred and studied as part of the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, our third major piece of NEEWS. Therefore, we have reduced our estimate for our share of the interstate project by $50 million, from $301 million to approximately $251 million. About 1/2 of that reduction will be offset by a $25 million increase in transmission expenditures related to the Eastern Connecticut upgrades I just mentioned. Those upgrades will be advanced from 2014 into 2011 and the 2012 period.
The Central Connecticut Reliability Project continues to be reviewed by ISO New England. ISO New England is evaluating that project as part of an overall review of the transmission that now encompasses a broader geographical area in Central Connecticut. We expect the review to be completed and the needs identified in late 2011 with specific projects identified in late 2012. We continue to project the cost of CCRP of $338 million, and we'll update the cost estimates and project completion dates after ISO New England has completed its review.
We believe the project will be completed about 18 months after the interstate project. Despite the slight changes in timing and spending on some of our projects, we continue to project investing approximately $444 million on our transmission infrastructure this year. Earlier, Chuck discussed some of the recent developments concerning our Northern Pass project. The Department of Energy had 7 public meetings on the project in New Hampshire in mid March, which were very well attended. 
While there has been considerable support for the project among key stakeholder groups such as business and industrial associations, organized labor, there were a number of concerns raised about the project, including the alternative routes. We are listening to all concerns and are examining various solutions. We expect this process to continue throughout this year and into 2012 as we advance through the siting process. 
Turning from electric transmission to natural gas distribution. With a long winter behind us, we resumed work in March on the Waterbury-to-Wallingford gas pipeline. This year's work primarily involves modification to our Waterbury LNG [liquefied natural gas] facility and building an approximately 6-mile pipeline from Waterbury to connect with the pipeline we installed last year in Cheshire. This project will address reliability issues and bottlenecks on our distribution system and also serve a growing demand for natural gas in Yankee Gas' service territory. 
Yankee Gas continues to see strong sales growth with first quarter sales in 2011 at 16.9% higher than they were in the same period of 2010. On a weather adjusted basis, they were 3.2% higher. We've seen significant peak day demand growth in our system, resultant from two drivers: distributor generation and customers switching from interruptible to firm service. 
For example, in this past heating season, Yankee Gas saw a 5% growth in peak day demand. To put this in perspective, that's the equivalent of 8 years of peak day demand growth just in the last 2 years. The significant differential between oil and gas prices with the energy equivalent cost of natural gas being half of that of oil, continues to drive demand for residential conversions and new customer connections. 
With 83% on main penetration, Yankee Gas has the potential to add 41,000 new customers to the existing base of 206,000 customers. You may recall from our EEI presentation that we are projecting about a $25 million a year increase in Yankee Gas' capital investment to address aging infrastructure, primarily to replace cast iron and beer steel distribution piping. This is consistent with the federally mandated distribution integrity management program. We expect to receive the DPUC's decision on this investment as part of the Yankee Gas rate case decision next month. Now I would like to turn the phone call over to David."
292525,130661985,124091,"Northeast Utilities, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 06, 2011",2011-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee. Following our release of mid-year results last year, Chuck noted that we had reached an inflection point where we were now positioned to improve our distribution results and expected to begin earning much closer to our allowed returns. T",1651,"Thank you, Lee. Following our release of mid-year results last year, Chuck noted that we had reached an inflection point where we were now positioned to improve our distribution results and expected to begin earning much closer to our allowed returns. 
This view is primarily due to the conclusion of the CL&P [Connecticut Light and Power Company] and PSNH distribution rate case decisions. Results from the past 3 quarters show that we indeed reached that inflection point in mid-2010, and our first quarter results for 2011 demonstrate that continuing trend. Excluding the impact of merger-related expenses of $0.05 per share, we earned $122.5 million or $0.69 per share in the first quarter compared with $86.2 million or $0.49 per share in the same quarter of 2010.
Including merger expenses, we earned $0.64 per share. As is true in the third and fourth quarter of 2010, the primary area of year-over-year earnings growth was in the distribution segment, where we earned $78.2 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $47.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. That improvement was driven by a number of factors, including the distribution rate decision. We also benefited from the impact of much colder quarter 2011 than in 2010 and from our continued focus on managing our costs. Largely because of the impact of weather, electric sales were up 3% in the first quarter 2011 versus 2010. Heating degree days were up 18.6% in the Hartford, Connecticut area and 17.7% in the Concord, New Hampshire area. Translating that to earnings, relative to the first quarter of 2010, the weather effect accounted for $0.05 per share of the quarter's $0.20 per share increase.
On a weather-adjusted basis, retail electric sales were down 0.2%, which is pretty consistent with our expectations of flat weather-adjusted sales for the full year. PSNH sales were the strongest of our 3 electric companies, rising 0.4% on a weather-adjusted basis while CL&P and WMECO [Western Massachusetts Electric Company] weather-adjusted sales were down about 0.5%. Within customer classes on a weather-adjusted basis, residential sales were flat, commercial sales were down to 0.9% and industrial sales showed some modest growth, rising 1.4%. 
In Connecticut, industrial sales increased 1.6% at CL&P and 11.7% at Yankee Gas. We see support for continued growth in Connecticut manufacturing employment and hours worked across a number of sectors including defense, precision manufacturing and other high-tech industries. These developments should support sales trends in this class of customers over the coming quarters.
Another important variable is the price of electricity. Within natural gas, prices continue to soften and customers see declining prices. On January 1 of this year, CL&P residential and small commercial customers on standard service had an average rate decrease of 7.8%. 
On April 1, large customers on last resort rates experienced a small decrease in their energy rates to $0.718 per kilowatt hour, down very significantly from the end of 2008 and that rate was nearly $0.127 per kilowatt hour. As Lee mentioned, natural gas sales continued to grow at a very attractive rate. In large part due to this significant and increasing price advantage of natural gas versus home heating oil. 
At CL&P, distribution earnings were $28.5 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2010. The primary driver was last summer's rate decision, which increased distribution revenues and lower depreciation expense. CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011, 8.8%. And we continue to project a distribution ROE of approximately 9% in 2011 compared to our allowed return of 9.4%. 
At PSNH, distribution and generation earnings totaled $21.5 million in the first quarter compared with $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. The distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2010, was the primary driver but other factors included a 2.7% increase in electric sales, increased generation earnings from AFUDC [allowance for funds used during construction] on the Merrimack Scrubber project and a $1 million after-tax charge PSNH generation took in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the enactment of federal healthcare legislation.
PSNH's combined distribution and generation ROE was 11.1% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011. We expect that level to decline over the balance of the year due in part to a small rate reduction that will be effective July 1 as our recruitment period ends and we expect for the full year 2011, our ROE to be approximately 9%.
WMECO distribution earnings totaled $5.7 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. WMECO benefited from a $16.8 million distribution rate increase that was effective February 1, 2011. WMECO sales increased 2% during the quarter, mainly the result of weather. Weather-adjusted sales were down 0.6% in the first quarter of '11 compared with the first quarter of 2010. 
However, I should note that the DPUC -- excuse me, the DPU rate decision approved a revenue decoupling at Western Mass, which provides us with approximately $125 million a year in distribution revenue regardless of the weather and regardless of the economic trend. WMECO's distribution ROE was 5.9% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2011. And we continue to project a distribution regulatory ROE of about 9% this year. 
Yankee Gas earned $22.5 million in the first quarter of '11 compared with $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2010. Much of that improvement was due to higher sales, which were 16% over last year or 3.2% on a weather-normalized basis. Yankee's ROE for the full year will depend to some extent on the outcome of its current rate case. In January, Yankee Gas filed an application with the Connecticut DUC (sic) [DPUC] to raise distribution rates by $32.8 million effective July 1, 2011, and an incremental $13 million effective July 1, 2012.
A primary objective in this case is reflecting in rates, the Waterbury-to-Wallingford line we discussed earlier. As part of the normal rate case process, Yankee Gas subsequently reduced that rate request to $29.1 million in mid-'11 and an incremental $10.3 million in mid-2012. The lower rate request was due primarily to the impact of bonus tax appreciation. Final briefs have been filed in the case, and we are expecting a draft decision in early June and a file decision -- final decision later that month. 
Turning from distribution. Our Transmission segment earned $44.7 million in the first quarter compared with $40.1 million in the first quarter of 2010. The increase was due primarily to a higher transmission rate base, which totaled $2.8 billion at March 31, 2011 compared with $2.6 billion as of March 31, 2010.
Additionally, transmission earnings in the first quarter of 2010 included a charge of $800,000 related to the enactment of federal healthcare legislation. NU parent and other companies recorded $8.7 million of net expenses in the first quarter of 2011, including $8.3 million in charges related to the merger. Note that effective with the first quarter of 2011, we no longer report our competitive business results separately as we wind down that business and it enters its final few years.
We now project after-tax merger expenses of about $0.20 per share this year. That represents an increase of $0.05 per share of merger cost compared with our estimate earlier this year. The increase is due to a number of factors including additional integration pumping activities currently underway. In terms of earnings guidance, as our news release noted, we reaffirmed standalone earnings guidance for the year of $2.25 to $2.40, excluding merger-related expenses. That guidance includes earnings of between $1.25 and $1.35 per share at the Distribution segment and $1.05 to $1.10 per share at the Transmission segment. We continue to project net expenses of about $0.05 at NU parent and other companies excluding the $0.20 of charges related to the merger. 
Turning from earnings to cash flow. We generated $356 million of cash from operations after repayment of rate reduction bond in the first quarter of this year compared with $159 million in the first quarter of 2010. The improved cash flow is primarily due to the impact of bonus depreciation, as well as higher earnings. We now project cash flows from operations after repayment of rate reduction bonds of between $900 million and $950 million this year, aided by a $200 million benefit from bonus depreciation. We reduced these figures by about $50 million as a result of some clarifications the IRS has recently made about what capital expenditures qualify for bonus depreciation.
We continue to see benefits of our improved cash flow and credit quality, as well as lower interest rates. On April 1, we completed the one-year reoffering of $62 million of CL&P taxable bond at a rate of 1.25%, down from last year's rate of 1.4%. On April 29, PSNH issued mandatory call notices on two issues of taxable bonds, totaling nearly $120 million and carrying a coupon of 6%. PSNH expects to issue taxable debt later this spring to refinance those bonds, and we are anticipating more than $1 million a year in interest savings.
As I mentioned in February, we expect PSNH to issue $160 million of new bonds in the second half of this year and Western Mass to issue $100 million of senior unsecured notes, also in the second half of the year. We expect PSNH's financing to benefit from Fitch's recent upgrade of PSNH secured debt to A-, which occurred on April 18. 
You may have noticed that Fitch also raised CL&P's outlook to positive from stable in recognition of CL&P's improving credit metrics, which maintained it's watch positive outlook on NU unsecured debts pending consummation of the merger with NSTAR. I look forward to seeing many of you at the AGA Conference in Florida on May 15 and 16. Now let me turn the call back over to Jeff Kotkin."

We see a little bit of growth in the residential area, and still some weakness ‚Äì of course, commercial across all of our businesses, commercial is still down about 1%. And as I suggested, on our prepared remarks, it does vary by state where you're seeing a little bit more strength in our New Hampshire area and that's historically what we had recognized.

A little bit weaker in Massachusetts and a little bit more balanced in Connecticut.

So those companies are actually doing well, particularly given where the dollar is these days. And the residential consumer I'm not sure sort of sprung back to life but they're right at about flat for now. We'll continue to watch that, Jay. I think we still look for sales across the entire platform of our companies and our customers, still to kind of balance out to about flat. And as you heard in our comments, too, we try to weather that with a revenue decoupling cost in Massachusetts. So that's not a big earnings issue there. We'll report back as these trends continue."

If the floor stays very low or goes to zero, then the likelihood is that some of those plants will shut down, or they‚Äôll be shutdown as a result of the environmental emissions issues coming either from the states or the EPA. That's good for a transmission obviously. There are better solutions we think than building new capacity in terms of transmission solutions, including bringing in renewable energy from a renewable energy construction project in New Hampshire and Maine, as well, of course, as the Northern Pass or HVDC line coming down from Quebec. So from the standpoint that some of these units retire, we think that is very supportive of transmission. And ISO is studying transmission in lower New Hampshire and lower Vermont, including transmission now that runs down from New Hampshire down into the Northern Massachusetts, this is the Scobie Tukes [ph] transmission line. Those projects are starting to mature, and we would place a higher probability those projects could get built in the future."

Let me start by noting that NU had a good second quarter and a very strong first half of the year, both of which were consistent wit",1338,"Thank you, Jeff, and I'd like to thank all of the investors who are listening to our call for joining us this afternoon. 
Let me start by noting that NU had a good second quarter and a very strong first half of the year, both of which were consistent with our full year 2011 earnings guidance. As you can see in our news release from last night, earnings per share were up 25% for the first half of 2011 over the first half of 2010 excluding merger-related costs. In light of the results of the first half of 2011 and our prospects for the full year, last night, we raised the floor and hence, the midpoint of our guidance for full year results. For 2011, we now project earnings between $2.30 per share and $2.40 per share excluding merger expenses. 
As busy as the first half of the year has been, the first 6 months should see a number of very positive events. During the second half of the year, we expect to consummate our merger with NSTAR, be in full construction mode on our Greater Springfield Reliability Project, bring key elements of PSNH's Clean Air Project operation, announce the new route for the northern section of our Northern Pass project and achieve the financial performance that supports our updated earnings guidance. Our confidence in projecting near-term financial performance is enhanced by the fact for the first time in more than 2 years, we do not have either a distribution rate case pending or one that is about to be filed. 
We continue to make good progress on the major events facing the company, our merger with NSTAR. In the first past 3 months, we achieved a number of milestones. In May, regulators signed off on the merger subject for further approval, which we obtained in July. If you have read the FERC decision, it fully authorized our merger's being consistent with the public interest recognizing that the transaction would have no negative impact on competition in the New England energy marketplace. The fourth position when combined with the SEC approval and exploration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Justice Department review earlier in the year means that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sign off is the only federal approval we still require. 
As you know, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly endorse the merger in March. On a state regulatory side, the Connecticut DPUC issued a final decision on June 1 aiding that it did not have jurisdiction over the merger because it did not involve the change of control of a Connecticut utility. While that decision has been appealed to the Connecticut Superior Court, we believe the DPUC's ruling is legally sound. 
At the Massachusetts DPU, we've completed hearings on the merger with final briefs in the case due to be filed on September 19. We believe that time schedule positions us to receive a final DPU decision and close the merger on the fourth quarter of this year. The DPU hearings have provided a platform to allow NU and NSTAR to demonstrate the very significant value our merger will bring to the region, both in terms of cost savings and expanded environmental initiatives. 
We continue to be very comfortable with our projected $784 million of net benefits during the first 10 years after closing. I know many of you have asked Jeff about the early July motion by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to extend the docket scheduled significantly. We've opposed that motion vigorously and believe if granted, it would be counterproductive to stakeholder's interest by delaying our ability to bring the benefits of this merger to NU and NSTAR customers, shareholders and employees. 
The DPU hearing officer overseeing the case has not yet ruled on the DOER's motion and we are hopeful it will be rejected. NSTAR is not only our merger partner, it is also our partner with the Northern Pass transmission project in New Hampshire where we continue to work through the regulatory approval process. Lee will provide you with more details. But we now believe that the project schedule will need to be extended with construction likely to take place from 2014 through 2016 rather than 2013 through 2015. Although we believe there is a widespread view of the project will bring very significant economic and environmental benefits to both New Hampshire and other New England states, we also recognized that there were significant concerns about the initial 40-mile route we proposed with the northern section of the line in New Hampshire, where we do not currently own a right of way. We continue to listen to the different stakeholders involved in this process and to work with them to identify the best possible route for this line. 
As Lee will discuss in more detail, we expect to identify a new route for that northern section later this year so that regulatory review can continue. 
Moving from New Hampshire to Connecticut. This year, the Connecticut legislature enacted Comprehensive Energy Legislation, which among various provisions restructured the energy functions within interstate government, involve them under a new Department of Energy Environmental Protection or DEEP. The new public utilities regulatory authority led by 3 of the previous DPUC commissioners, assume responsibilities for most of the DPUC's regulatory roles, including rate cases. 
The more policy-driven responsibilities such as the state's integrated resource plan were assigned to a new energy division within DEEP. We are encouraged that from a policy standpoint, many of the initiatives we have been navigating for years appear consistent with use of both governmental and our first the Commissioner, Dan. We're also pleased that the new legislation will allow us to build 10 megawatts of regulated renewable generation in Connecticut. 
In approving the budget for the new fiscal year, Connecticut lawmakers revoked another piece of legislation passed in 2010 that would have been harmful to our customers. That legislation had authorized the issuance of nearly $1 billion of new bonds that would have had been to be repaid through customer's electric bills. With the state's budget picture improving, the legislature revoked the authorization before the bonds could be issued, thereby effectively lowering rates for CL&P customers this summer. We have never believed that attempting to balance the states budget in this manner was appropriate and we congratulate the governor and the legislative leadership on this outcome. 
On the regulatory front while we were pleased with the TURA's decision on the merger, we were disappointed with this decision in the Yankee Gas rate case. We appreciate the commission's support for our capital program but agree with much of the commentary from the financial community, which has observed that the authorized hourly of 8.83% is a negative outlier for the industry nationwide. 
We subsequently asked the PURA to reconsider 3 aspects of its final order. And yesterday, the authority agreed to reopen the case to consider one of them. David will discuss that in more detail shortly. 
At FERC, we were encouraged by the recent ruling on transmission planning and cost allocation. We believe it reflects the support for transportation development like our NEEWS and Northern Pass initiatives and respect the regional planning process in place in New England. Most importantly, the FERC commissioner has expressed deep support for continued investment in the nation's electric transmission infrastructure. This is a view with which we clearly agree. Finally, we're quite pleased with the company's ongoing operations. Our customer service metrics continue to improve. Our reliability is sound even in the face of the record heat we experienced in the northeast 2 weeks ago and the response of our employees to the extreme weather events such as the June 1 tornado that struck Springfield, Massachusetts has been very well organized and carried out. We received a number of positive comments from both state and municipal leaders on our response to these severe storms. We will provide more details on our operations and on the progress of our major projects. And now, I will turn over the call to him."
292525,138386909,151478,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Chuck. Our operating performance was quite good for the first half of the year and as has remain strong since the start of the summer. We have 2 major weather events in June, which caused significant damage into which our organization is going",1918,"Thank you, Chuck. Our operating performance was quite good for the first half of the year and as has remain strong since the start of the summer. We have 2 major weather events in June, which caused significant damage into which our organization is going to. On June 1, a damaging tornado tore through the city of Springfield. And the following week, 3 days of thunderstorms have accompanied by high winds, knocked out power to approximately 300,000 of our customers across 3 states. In both cases, the vast majority of customers had their power restored within the first 36 hours. 
Our prompt response to outages, along with outstanding call center performance, mitigated long protracted service restorations and praise from local elected leaders. In total, we spent about $17.8 million in restoration activities following those storms. More than $15 million of that, which is either capitalized or applied against our major storm funds. Pretax storm-related costs actually fell by about $5 million in the second quarter of 2011 as compared with 2010. 
We believe our customers appreciate the improvements we have been serving them. In the most recent JD Power survey on the utility customer satisfaction, all of our electric utility scores improved and Yankee Gas remained the highest ranked in the national gas distribution company in the northeast. Our $430 million Clean Air Project, a web scrubber being installed at our 2 unit Merrimack coal-fired station is ahead of schedule and currently 86% complete. System tie-ins, startup and commissioning activities are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the scrubber itself could be operational by the end of the year. 
The, budget should be completed by mid-2012. You may recall that the scrubbers is required under the New Hampshire's Mercury Reduction Law, which was enacted about 5 years ago. Two weeks ago in the New Hampshire Supreme Court dismissed an appeal that have been filed against the project saying, the plaintiffs did not have stand in to bring the case. In Massachusetts, our first solar installation, 1.8-megawatt facility in Pittsburgh has operated well and our second facility, a 2.2-megawatt installation, was under construction at a brownfield site in Springfield and should be completed by the end of the year. 
Turning to transmission. Our transmission capital expenditures totaled $164 million in the first 6 months of 2011. We expect the pace of capital spending to accelerate in the second half of the year as we move into full construction mode on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. The GSRP is the largest of the 3 major projects we expect to undertake as part of the NEEWS family of projects. In Massachusetts, we commenced substation work on GSRP in December of 2010 and began site work on the overhead section in the first quarter of 2011. We recently began substation work in Connecticut and we continue to expect full construction in Massachusetts to begin later this quarter after we receive the required on Army Corps of Engineers and Massachusetts environmental permits. We need those permits to work in or near wetland areas. And we've made substantial projects working through the remaining environmental permit issues over the past 3 months. 
We expect to receive the permits by the end of this month or in the first part of September. The workforce and materials are available to start construction in the wetland areas and immediately upon the receipt of the permits. In the mean time, we have accelerated our work on where we already have full permitting. As a result, we now estimate that the GSRP project is approximately 36% complete and we remain on target to complete the project by the end of 2013. To date, we have spent $231 million on GSRP. 
You may recall during our May earnings call, I mentioned that we've filed an application with FERC to recover and regional rates the financing cost of NEEWS during the construction period. That change has in effect reduces the AFUDC but increases cash flow from NEEWS during the construction period. This is related to the interplay between our local network rates and our regional network rates. For improved application for construction work in progress effective June 1, 2011, in regional rates. And as a result, we will be capitalizing less the financing cost from NEEWS during construction. This is good for New England customers because it will ultimately result in a lower cost project to be supported in regional rates. 
As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings discussion, this change reduces our total cost of NEEWS net of the United Illuminating investment and the larger Connecticut project to approximately $1.35 billion. For the Greater Springfield project, it reduces cost from $795 million to $718 million. By the end of the state, it reduces the cost from $251 million to $218 million. For the Central Connecticut project, it reduces the estimated cost from $338 million to $301 million. Those AFUDC-related changes were already factored into our rate base projections that we published in our in-report earlier this year. We do not believe it should have any impact on the NEEWS-related earnings estimates, Street analysts have developed. 
Turning to those other 2 major NEEWS projects. We at National Grid expect to follow a, applications in Connecticut and Massachusetts and Rhode Island late this year  and build the Interstate Reliability Project. Last month, we began formal consultations with several municipalities in Eastern Connecticut, a requirement before we file our formal state application. 
The Central Connecticut Reliability Project continues to be reviewed by ISO in New England as part of the overall review of transmission in Central Connecticut. We expect the review to be completed and, in late 2011 with specific projects identified in late 2012. 
We received good news from Washington in late June when the FERC denied a 3:1 vote reconsideration of the financial incentives for NEEWS that were approved in late 2008.  To remind you, those incentives include recovery of abandoned costs, a cash return on construction work in progress of the projects under construction and a 12.89% return on equity. Also I should note that from July 22, electricity usage increased significantly when the temperatures hit an all-time record of 103 degrees at, North of Hartford. 
The preliminary New England peak demand load of approximately 27,700 megawatts appeared to be the second highest ever recorded in New England. Fortunately, the lead generation, transmission, systems performed very well. The unanticipated increase in peak demand was would have been even higher if it not the fact that it occurred on a Friday afternoon, where many in the workforce begin their weekend departures, underscores the likelihood that peak demand is rising again in the region. 
Earlier Chuck discussed some of the recent developments concerning the Northern Pass project. Recall that the project involves 180 miles of new transmission line in the state, including an AC  section in Southern New Hampshire. Of those 180 miles, we currently have right away 140 miles. Our focus right now is on the 40 northern-most miles where we need new right-of-way. We continue with our outreach in New Hampshire stakeholders and communities as we identify and secure a route to those 40 miles. And hopefully announce such a route later this year. We were making solid progress in this effort. This process of identifying routes and providing stakeholders time to review and comment has added about an additional 9 months to the siting process. 
That is why we now estimate that the construction will begin in early 2014. As you may know, the U.S. Department of Energy, environmental assessment process begins once a specific route is submitted. We applied last fall with the DOE and they have left open the public comment period on the project so that the petition and review process can comment on the route we identified. 
The DOE will announce a consultant who will be working on the environmental data already collected for the lower 140 miles of the route. We expect this process to continue throughout this year and into 2012 as we advance through the siting process. Additionally, we will begin preparing our application for the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee once the northern 40 miles of the route are identified. On June 28, we took another step forward on Northern Pass when we filed a specially used application with the U.S. Forest Service to build approximately 10 miles of the Northern Pass project along our existing right-of-way corridor that runs through the White Mountain National Parks. 
PSNH developers, Florida more than 60 years ago and currently operates a 115-kV line there that serves customers, not of the national parks. We're proposing to relocate the existing line and build a new 350-kV line in this corridor. We look forward to working with the Forest Service as it participates as a cooperating agency in the overall review of the projects Environmental Impact Statement. 
As a reminder, the project has a number of benefits for New Hampshire and the region. It is expected to add more than $25 million a year in local property tax revenue and add 1,200 construction jobs. We estimate it will reduce the region's wholesale electric cost between $200 million and $300 million annually, including at least $30 million that were accrued to New Hampshire. And reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 5 million tons a year. In spite of the later projected startup of the construction in 2014, we continue to estimate that the project will cost about $1.1 billion, including in stores 25% share. Of the EEI conference in November, we will update our year-by-year capital expenditures projections for the Northern Pass to reflect for 2014 to 2016, projected construction period. 
Turning from electric transmission to natural gas distribution. Yankee has completed about 76% of its $57.6 million water rate alone project. We continue to expect the project  can enter service by November 1. And the DPUC rate decision allowed to the entire project to be included in rates. 
In the rate decision, the DPUC also endorsed Yankee Gas' plan to significantly increase its capital spending by $25 million  to $40 million annually to replace older cast iron and beer steel price. As Chuck noted earlier, we are not pleased with other aspects of the decision and we will continue to focus on how we can more effectively manage the operation and maintain resources at the Yankee Gas to mitigate the impact of this decision on financial performance. 
Yankee Gas sales continue to be strong in the second quarter. Some of it related to cooler temperatures in April and May. Firm retail sales rose 18.4% in the first half of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. 
On a weather-adjusted basis, sales rose 6.6%. With housing starts still relatively low, a great deal of unique resales is the result of new distributed generation coming online and fuel switching driven by high oil prices and low natural gas prices. Approximately 2/3 of this increase was a result of new distributed generation facilities coming at the service. 
For the second quarter, weather-adjusted commercial and industrial sales rose 25.7% and 11.2%, respectively, over 2010, primarily driven by the same factors. We also continue to see convergence in residential space as evidenced by a 7.8% weather adjusted increase in residential sales over second quarter 2010.

Our results for the first half of 2011 reflect many of the same favorable trends we've seen since the middle of 2010. They include improving distribution results as rate increases and cost control measures have allowed our returns to recover from last year's low levels. Favorable transmission earnings as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and a decline in a competitive business earnings as those businesses, particularly the Wholesale Marketing business, winds down to 2013. As a reminder, those results are now folded into our NU parent and other company's business segments. 
As Chuck noted earlier, we raised the lower end of our distribution segment value in the NU's consolidated guidance by $0.05, effectively raising the midpoint of NU's earnings guidance for the year. 
Our new range of the $2.30 per share to $2.40 excluding merger costs reflects the results we have experienced in the first half of 2011. The warmer temperatures and storm expense we have experienced in July and our prospects for the balance of the year, including the progress we are making on major projects particular the Greater Springfield Reliability Project and the Clean Air Project. IN fact, the progress we are making on our transmission program this year is expected to result in us, earning toward the upper end of our transmission guidance.  I will discuss our updated guidance in more detail shortly. 
Overall, we earned $77.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 or $0.44 per share compared with $71.9 million or $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Over the first 6 months of 2011, we earned $191.4 million or $1.08 per share compared with earnings of $158.2 million or $0.90 per share in the first half of 2010. Excluding charges related to our merger with NSTAR, we earned $200.9 million or $1.13 per share in the first half of 2011, up nearly 25% over 2010. 
Although we believe we are well-positioned for a successful year and you can see that in our adjustments to guidance, I recognized results for the quarter fell a little short of consensus, some of that maybe to the fact of last year, our competitive business has added about $0.03 for the quarter versus breakeven this quarter. We believe other items are timing related including PSNH rate case-related revenues and the pattern of transmission earnings where we see continued positive momentum for the second half of this year. 
Our transmission segment earned $42.4 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2011 compared to earnings of $41.9 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2010. 
Over the first 6 months of 2011, our Transmission segment earned $86.9 million or $0.49 per share compared with earnings of $82.1 million or $0.46 per share in the first half of 2010. Improved year-to-date transmission results reflect our ongoing investment in the high voltage grid that serves the region, as well as our forward-looking voice routing transmission tasks. We expect transmission earnings growth to accelerate over the coming quarters as we move into full construction mode on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project Lee mentioned a moment ago. 
Due to Greater Springfield and many smaller projects that are now under construction, our transmission rate base totaled $2.78 billion as of June 30, 2011, compared with $2.64 billion at June 30, 2010. 
I know that some of you have noticed that CL&P earnings were $2.1 million lower than second quarter 2011 than they were in the second quarter of 2010. This occurred even though CL&P's transmission rate base in the first half of '11 was about $2.15 billion, nearly 2% higher than it was in the first half of 2010. The reason for the decline in earnings is that we true up the many tracking features of our transmission tariff to coincide with the filing of our form one for the previous quarter, which was done in the second quarter each year in 2011, that true up resulted in a refund to our wholesale transmission customers, whereas in 2010, it resulted in incremental billings. That year-over-year resulted in a decline in CL&P's second quarter transmission earnings of $3.7 million from 2010 to 2011. We have no similar true ups for the remainder of the year. 
Overall, we remain very comfortable with our 2011 transmission earnings guidance of 105  to 110. In fact from what I mentioned earlier, we believe we'll earn toward the upper end of that range. 
Turning to the Distribution business. We are $40.3 million or $0.23 per share in the second quarter of '11 and $118.5 million or $0.67 per share in the first half of 2011. This compared with earnings of $27.1 million or $0.15 per share in the second quarter of '10 and $75 million or $0.43 per share in the first half of 2010. 
Some of the distribution segment earned $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $47.6 million in the first half of '11, compared with earnings of $8.4 million in the second quarter of '10 and $22.7 million in the first half of 2010. This improvement was due to a combination of strong cost controls and the distribution rate decision we received last year partially offset by higher pension and healthcare cost. That rate decision approved a $63.4 million rate increase effective July 1, 2010, and an additional $38.5 million that was effective on July 1, 2011. As of June 30, 2011, during this trailing 12-month distribution ROE was 9.8%. At this point in the year, we project a full regulatory ROE of about 9% for the year. 
Distribution generation segment are $16 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $37.5 million in the first half of '11, compared with $16.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $28.1 million in the first half of 2010. CCNH benefited from this July 10 distribution rate increase and AFUDC earnings from the Clean Air Project but those benefits were offset by higher pension and healthcare cost. Additionally, there were a number of relatively small one-time positive impacts in the second quarter of 2010 when, concluded its rate case. Those positive impacts which totaled about $3.85 million after-tax resulted from the fact the final rate decision was retroactive which targets August 2009. While we have the benefit of higher rates in the second quarter of 2011, we lost the benefit of those 2010, one-time impacts. As a result, PSNH's second quarter 2011 distribution earnings were down by about $1 million for 2010. PSNH distribution and regulatory ROE including generation earnings was 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 11. We expect that level to decline over the last 2 quarters of the year and for PSNH's distribution ROE to be approximately 9% for the year. This is primarily due to the roll off of the recruitment period associated with PSNH's decision from last year. From mid-2010 through mid-2011, we recovered approximately $13.7 million from customers to recruit revenues that we would otherwise would have recovered customers from August 1, '09  to mid-2010. 
With those dollars now fully recovered as of June 30, '11, our distribution rates declined last month by about $2.3 million on an annualized net basis. 
So Massachusetts Electric, the Distribution segment earned $4 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $9.7 million in the first half of 2011, compared with $2.3 million in the second quarter of '10 and $5.2 million in the first half of 2010. The improvement was primarily due to the resolution of AMECO's distribution rate case earlier this year, partially offset by higher operating costs. distribution regulatory ROE was 6.5% with the 12 months ended June 30, 2011, compared with an authorized return of 9.6. We expect less the math, distribution ROE to increase to approximately 9% for the calendar year of 2011. Recall that decoupling which began 6 months ago, sales volumes have little impact on AMECO's earning. 
Overall, retail electric sales fell 1.3% in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. The first half retail electric sales rose 0.9% in '11 compared with 2010. Weather-adjusted retail sales were down 0.9% in the second quarter of '11 and down 0.5% for the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. This weather dampened sales decline while somewhat more moderate than we have experienced in the past few years has nevertheless a bit larger than the flat year-to-year weather adjusted sales change we have projected to start of the year. Within customer classes on our weather-adjusted basis, year-to-date residential and industrial sales were flat. The weakness, we are seeing is in the Commercial sector where sales were down 1.3%. 
It's a very different story on the natural gas side of the business as Lee mentioned. For the year-to-date, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 18.4% and weather-adjusted firm up 6.6%. Commercial industrial sales continue to benefit from increased migration of interruptible customers switching to firm rates. 
And just to be clear these results and our views around sales for the balance of the year are incorporated into our updated guidance. Yankee Gas  earned $1.2 million in the second quarter of '11 and $23.7 million in the first half of '11 compared with a loss of $500,000 in the second quarter of 2010 and earnings of $19 million in the first half of 2010. Yankee sales increases were partially offset by higher operating costs, including higher pension and healthcare expenses. 
Chuck mentioned earlier that despite some constructive changes between the draft Yankee Gas rate decision and the final decision, the overall order was disappointing. With the final decision resulted in a rate decrease of approximately $500,000, which is effective July 20 to be followed by a rate increase of about $6.7 million effective July 1, 2012. 
While the pure have accepted our proposed capitalization ratio of 52.2% common equity and 47.8% debt, the authorized ROE of 8.83% is below what we think is a fair and reasonable return even this economic environment. Also the final decision disallowed from rate base certain equipment that is now in service and serving customers has disallowed recovery of wage increases for nonunion personnel. It also lowers rates by $1.5 million in rate year one and $3 million in rate year two to reflect expected savings from our merger with NSTAR, which still waits approval. 
With that, we consider 3 specific issues contained in the final decision. One was the implication of merger savings, another the inclusion of nonunion wage increases in rates over the next 2 years. And the third related to the correct regulatory treatment for deferred tax assets related to net operating loss associated with bonus depreciation. 
Together these items total $3.6 million in rate year one and $6.41 million in year 2. On August 2, yesterday, the issued addressed decision, granting our request to reconsider the deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses but denied our request to reconsider liquidation of merger savings and exclusion of wage increases. If our request relating to deferred tax asset is also approved, it would amount to a pretax benefit of about $750,000 in the first rate year that begins this quarter and about $1.1 million in the second rate year which begins in July 2012. 
Rate case regulatory ROE was 1.9% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11 but we expect that level to decline over the coming quarters as a result of the rate decision. 
Turning from our regulated businesses, NU parent and other companies, we have net expense of $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $14 million in the first half of 2011, compared with earnings of $2.9 million for the second quarter of '10 and $1.1 million in the first half of 2010. The 2011 results include $1.2 million of net expenses in the second quarter of '11 and $9.5 million of expenses in the first half of 2011 related to the pending merger with NSTAR. Excluding those items, we reported net expenses of $4 million in the second quarter of '11 or $0.03 per share. In the first half of 2011, excluding expenses, we reported net expense of $4.5 million also $0.03 a share. As I mentioned earlier, the lower returned earnings this year is largely due to the wind down of our wholesale business within our remaining competitive companies. 
As I noted earlier, we raised the full of our earnings guidance for 2011 with the first half of the year now behind us, we are comfortable narrowing our distribution and generation segment earnings guidance to be between $1.30 and $1.35 per share. We continue to project net expenses of $0.05 per share in the parent and other businesses, excluding merger costs. 
On a trailing 12-month basis, our earnings of $2.39 per share for a period ending June 30, 2011, excluding merger in 2010 NU parent tax settlement impact. As a heads-up, if there is a decline in trailing 12-month earnings over the balance of this year, we expect it will occur primarily in the third quarter. You may recall that in 2010, we and many other utilities in the Northeast, benefited from extremely warm third quarter temperatures. And while July 11 was indeed quite warm, we have now experienced -- we now expect to experience the same number of cooling 3 days we recorded in 2010. 
Turning from earnings to debt assurances. Balance sheet and cash flow. In May, we took advantage of strong demand for high-grade utility debt to sell $122 million of taxable PSNH mortgage funds, the tenure bonds carry a coupon of 4.05% and the proceeds were used to redeem about $120 million or 6% of tax-exempt bond. We continue to expect to issue another $160 million of taxable bonds later this year. And for AMECO to issue $100 million of senior unsecured notes. 
We expect the benefit from S&P's decision on May 16 to raise all NU debt deferred stock ratings by one notch. That ratings action was based solely on NU's improved standalone credit profile. As we have maintained this positive rating on NU and our 4 regulated subsidiaries, subject to confirmation with our pending merger with NSTAR. 
One key factor trading that credit upgrade is our improving cash flow. Cash from operations after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled approximately $652 million in the first half of 2011, compared with $405 million in the first half of 2010. Mostly as a result of that strong operating cash flow, our total debt level declined nearly $150 million in the first months of this year to a common equity levels rose by more than $100 million. 
Total debt represented about 54.5% of our consolidated capital structure at the end of June, well below the 60% level we have discussed for a number of years. Much of that improved and reflect the benefits from selling, depreciation or income tax purposes. 
We continue to project full year cash flows from operations of between $900 million and $950 million this year after retaining a fifth AMECO, bonds. Five years ago, we were generating less than half of that level of cash and we believe that improvement underscores the continued financial strengthening of our company."

And one of those is sales growth and we've said, general observation has been since 2005, we have seen demand disruption or negative load growth, if you will. This year, we actually had a little bit more optimistic going into the year. It's not that weather-adjusted sales would be flat. And we did see right off of the block some negative prints even though we have seen a little bit more favorable results maybe in the spring. Our actual observation now and what we said in the call is weather-normalized sales were down 0.5%. So certainly better than the last 3 or 5 years of trend but not based on what we thought going into the year around projection. That said, the delta between flat sales and being down 0.5% is not a major earnings driver for this year. And as you know, our Massachusetts utility now has revenue decoupling so it neutralizes that issue. I think it's no surprise that we're going to stop short of calling for a double dip for sure, but no surprise that the New England economy or our economies have not reaccelerated in terms of growth, in terms of job creation, in terms of housing and the like. So you have more economics sort of fundamentally more economic weakness than we might have hoped for 6 or 9 months ago. And  I think on top of that, you do see and Lee mentioned this, you do see pure switching which means customers who are going to DG, were losing electric load although we have a nice hedge. And now, we're picking up gas sales at Yankee Gas. So you're seeing that type of activity. And you are seeing policies that are trying to incent customers and move in that direction whether it's large commercial customers even smaller customers installing solar. And then I think second, another fundamental trend which I do not see by any means is to date, incenting utilities are providing more monies to fund conversation, load management and DR programs. In fact, you may know that throughout New England, these programs have not only funded rates by distribution companies by proceeds from the Reg E option and the proceeds by the FCM option. So there are monies flowing into demand response and the efficiency, they are also putting downward pressure on our sales."

And I'd like to thank all of the investors, who are listening to our call, for joining us this afternoon.Let me start by noting that NU had a good second quarter and a very strong first half of the year, both of which were consistent wi",1347,"Thank you, Jeff. And I'd like to thank all of the investors, who are listening to our call, for joining us this afternoon.
Let me start by noting that NU had a good second quarter and a very strong first half of the year, both of which were consistent with our full year 2011 earnings guidance. As you can see in our news release from last night, earnings per share were up 25% in the first half of 2011 over the first half of 2010, excluding merger-related costs. In light of the results of the first half of 2011 and our prospects for the full year, last night we raised the floor and, hence, the midpoint of our guidance for full year results. For 2011, we now project earning between $2.30 per share and $2.40 per share, excluding merger expenses.
As busy as the first half of the year has been, the next 6 months should see a number of very positive events. During the second half of the year, we expect to consummate our merger with NSTAR be in full construction mode on our Greater Springfield Reliability Project, bring key elements of PSNH's Clean Air Project into operation, announce a new route for the northern section of our Northern Pass project and achieve the financial performance that supports our updated earnings guidance. Our confidence in projecting near-term financial performance is enhanced by the fact that, for the first time in more than 2 years, we do not have either a distribution rate case pending or one that is about to be filed.
We continue to make good progress on the major event facing the company, our merger with NSTAR. In the past 3 months, we have achieved a number of milestones. In May, Maine regulators signed off on the merger, subject to FERC approval, which we obtained in July. If you have read the FERC decision, it fully authorized our merger as being consistent with the public interest, recognizing that the transaction would have no negative impact on competition in the New England energy marketplace. The FERC decision, when combined with the FCC approval and exploration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Justice Department review earlier in the year, means that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sign-off is the only federal approval we still require. As you know, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly endorsed the merger in March.
On a state regulatory side, the Connecticut DPUC issued a final decision on June 1, stating that it did not have jurisdiction over the merger because it did not involve the change of control of a Connecticut utility. While that decision has been appealed to the Connecticut Superior Court, we believe the DPUC's ruling is legally sound.
At the Massachusetts DPU, we have completed hearings on the merger, with final briefs in the case due to be filed on September 19. We believe that time schedule positions us to receive a final DPU decision and close the merger in the fourth quarter of this year. The DPU hearings have provided a platform to allow NU and NSTAR to demonstrate the very significant value our merger will bring to the region both in terms of cost savings and expanded environmental initiatives. We continue to be very comfortable with our projected $784 million of net benefits during the first 10 years after closing.
I know many of you have asked Jeff about the early July motion by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to extend the docket schedule significantly. We have opposed that motion vigorously and believe, if granted, it would be counterproductive to stakeholder's interest by delaying our ability to bring the benefits of this merger to NU and NSTAR customers, shareholders and employees. The DPU hearing officer overseeing the case has not yet ruled on the DOER's motion, and we are hopeful it will be rejected.
NSTAR is not only our merger partner, it is also our partner with the Northern Pass transmission project in New Hampshire where we continue to work through the regulatory approval process. Lee will provide you with more details, but we now believe that the project's schedule will need to be extended, with construction likely to take place from 2014 through 2016 rather than 2013 through 2015. Although we believe there is a widespread view that the project will bring very significant economic and environmental benefits to both New Hampshire and other New England states, we also recognized that there were significant concerns about the initial 40-mile route we proposed with the northern section of the line in New Hampshire where we do not currently own a right of way. We continue to listen to the different stakeholders involved in this process and to work with them to identify the best possible route for this line. As Lee will discuss in more detail, we expect to identify a new route for that northern section later this year so that regulatory review can continue.
Moving from New Hampshire to Connecticut. This year, the Connecticut legislature enacted Comprehensive Energy Legislation, which, among various provisions, restructured the energy functions within state government and brought them under a new Department of Energy Environmental Protection or DEEP. The new public utilities regulatory authority, led by 3 of the previous DPUC commissioners, assume responsibilities for most of the DPUC's regulatory roles including rate cases.
The more policy-driven responsibilities, such as the state's integrated resource plan, were assigned to a new energy division within DEEP. We are encouraged that, from a policy standpoint, many of the initiatives we have been navigating for years appear consistent with the views of both government lawyer and our first DEEP Commissioner, Dan Esty. We were also pleased that the new legislation will allow us to build 10 megawatts of regulated renewable generation in Connecticut.
In approving the budget for the new fiscal year, Connecticut lawmakers revoked another piece of legislation passed in 2010 that would have been harmful to our customers. That legislation had authorized the issuance of nearly $1 billion of new bonds that would have had been to be repaid through customers' electric bills. With the state's budget picture improving, the legislature revoked the authorization before the bonds could be issued, thereby effectively lowering rates for CL&P customers this summer. We have never believed that attempting to balance the state's budget in this manner was appropriate, and we congratulate the governor and the legislative leadership on this outcome.
On the regulatory front, while we were pleased with the PURA's decision on our merger, we were disappointed with its decision in the Yankee Gas rate case. We appreciate the commission's support for our capital program but agree with much of the commentary from the financial community, which has observed that the authorized ROE of 8.83% is a negative outlier for the industry nationwide.
We subsequently asked the PURA to reconsider 3 aspects of its final order. And yesterday, the authority agreed to reopen the case to consider one of them. David will discuss that in more detail shortly.
At FERC, we were encouraged by the recent ruling on transmission planning in cost allocation. We believe it reflects support for transportation development like our NEEWS and Northern Pass initiatives and respect the regional planning process in place in New England. Most importantly, the FERC commissioner has expressed deep support for continued investment in the nation's electric transmission infrastructure. This is a view with which we clearly agree.
Finally, we are quite pleased with the company's ongoing operations. Our customer service metrics continued to improve. Our reliability is sound even in the face of the record heat we experienced in the northeast 2 weeks ago, and the response of our employees to the extreme weather events, such as the June 1 tornado that struck Springfield, Massachusetts, has been very well-organized and carried out. We've received a number of positive comments from both state and municipal leaders on our response to these severe storms.
Lee will provide more details on our operations and on the progress of our major projects. And now, I will turn over the call to him."
292525,138386909,151811,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Chuck. Our operating performance was quite good in the first half of the year and has remained strong since the start of the summer. We had 2 major weather events in June, which caused significant damage and to which our organization responded",1930,"Thank you, Chuck. Our operating performance was quite good in the first half of the year and has remained strong since the start of the summer. We had 2 major weather events in June, which caused significant damage and to which our organization responded very well. On June 1, a damaging tornado tore through the city of Springfield. In the following week, 3 days of thunderstorms accompanied by high winds knocked out power to approximately 300,000 of our customers across 3 states. In both cases, the vast majority of customers had their power restored within the first 36 hours.
Our prompt response to outages, along with outstanding call center performance, mitigated long protracted service restorations and drew praise from state and local elected leaders. In total, we spent about $17.8 million in restoration activities following those storms. More than $15 million of that, which has either been capitalized or applied against our major storm funds. Pretax storm-related costs actually fell by about $5 million in the second quarter of 2011, as compared with 2010.
We believe our customers appreciate the improvements we have been serving them. In the most recent JD Power survey of utility customer satisfaction, all of our electric utility scores improved, and Yankee Gas remained the highest ranked mid-sized natural gas distribution company in the northeast. Our $430 million Clean Air Project, a wet scrubber being installed at our 2-unit Merrimack coal-fired station, is ahead of schedule and currently 86% complete. System tie-ins, startup and commissioning activities are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the scrubber itself could be operational by the end of the year.
The [indiscernible] project should be completed by mid-2012. You may recall that the scrubbers required -- is required under New Hampshire's mercury reduction law, which was enacted about 5 years ago. Two weeks ago, the New Hampshire Supreme Court dismissed an appeal that had been filed against the project, saying the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case. In Massachusetts, our first solar installation, a 1.8-megawatt facility in Pittsfield, has operated well; and our second facility, a 2.2-megawatt installation, was under construction at a brownfield site in Springfield and should be completed by the end of the year.
Turning to transmission. Our transmission capital expenditures totaled $164 million in the first 6 months of 2011, and we expect the pace of capital spending to accelerate in the second half of the year as we move into full construction mode on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. The GSRP is the largest of the 3 major projects we expect to undertake as part of the NEEWS family of projects. In Massachusetts, we commenced substation work on GSRP in December of 2010 and began site work on the overhead section in the first quarter of 2011. We recently began substation work in Connecticut, and we continue to expect full construction in Massachusetts to begin later this quarter after we receive the required Army Corps of Engineers and Massachusetts environmental permits. We need those permits to work in or near wetland areas, and we've made substantial progress working through the remaining environmental permit issues over the past 3 months. We expect to receive the permits by the end of this month or in the first part of September. The workforce and materials are available to start construction in the wetland areas immediately upon the receipt of the permits. In the meantime, we have accelerated our work on areas where we already have full permitting. As a result, we now estimate that the GSRP project is approximately 36% complete, and we remain on target to complete the project by the end of 2013. To date, we have spent $231 million on GSRP.
You may recall, during our May earnings call, I had mentioned that we had filed an application with FERC to recover in regional rates the financing cost of NEEWS during the construction period. That change has, in effect, reduces the AFUDC but increases cash flow from NEEWS during the construction period. This is related to the interplay between our local network rates and our regional network rates. FERC approved our application for our construction work in progress effective June 1, 2011, in regional rates, and as a result, we will be capitalizing less the financing cost for NEEWS during construction. This is good for New England customers because it will ultimately result in a lower-cost project to be supported in regional rates.
As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings discussion, this change reduces our total cost of NEEWS, net of the United Illuminating investment and the larger Connecticut projects to approximately $1.35 billion. For the Greater Springfield Project, it reduces costs from $795 million to $718 million. By the end of state, it reduces the costs from $251 million to $218 million. For the Central Connecticut project, it reduces the estimated costs from $338 million to $301 million. Those AFUDC-related changes were already factored into our rate base projections that we published in our in-report earlier this year. We do not believe it should have any impact on the NEEWS-related earnings estimates Street analysts have developed.
Turning to those other 2 major NEEWS projects. We at National Grid expect to file our siting applications in Connecticut and Massachusetts and Rhode Island late this year to build the Interstate Reliability Project. Last month, we began formal consultations with several municipalities in Eastern Connecticut, a requirement before we file our formal state application.
The Central Connecticut Reliability Project continues to be reviewed by ISO in New England as part of the overall review of transmission in Central Connecticut. We expect the review to be completed and need identified in late 2011 with specific projects identified in late 2012.
We received good news from Washington in late June when the FERC denied, in a 3:1 vote, reconsideration of the financial incentives for NEEWS that were approved in late 2008. To remind you, those incentives include recovery of abandoned cost, a cash return on construction work in progress while the projects are under construction and a 12.89% return on equity. Also, I should note that on July 22, electricity usage increased significantly when the temperatures hit an all-time record of 103 degrees at Bradwick Field north of Hartford.
The preliminary New England peak demand load of approximately 27,700 megawatts appeared to be the second highest ever recorded in New England. Fortunately, the region's generation transmission systems performed very well. The unanticipated increase in peak demand was would have been even higher if it -- if not the fact that it occurred on a Friday afternoon, when many in the workforce begin their weekend departures, underscores the likelihood that peak demand is rising again in the region.
Earlier, Chuck discussed some of the recent developments concerning the Northern Pass project. Recall that the project involves 180 miles of new transmission line in the state, including an AC section in Southern New Hampshire. Of those 180 miles, we currently have right of way for 140 miles. Our focus right now is on the 40 northernmost miles where we need new right-of-way. We continue with our outreach in New Hampshire stakeholders and communities as we identify and secure a route for those 40 miles and hope to announce such a route later this year. We are making solid progress in this effort. This process of identifying routes and providing stakeholders with time to review and comment has added about an additional 9 months to the siting process. That is why we now estimate that the construction will begin in early 2014.
As you may know, the U.S. Department of Energy environmental assessment process begins once a specific route is submitted. We applied last fall with the DOE, and they have left open the public comment period on the project so that the petition and the review process can comment on the route that we identified. The DOE will announce a consultant who will be working on the environmental data already collected for the lower 140 miles of the route. We expect this process to continue throughout this year and into 2012 as we advance through the siting process. Additionally, we will begin preparing our application for the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee once the northern 40 miles of the route are identified.
On June 28, we took another step forward on Northern Pass when we filed a special use application with the U.S. Forest Service to build approximately 10 miles of the Northern Pass project along our existing right-of-way corridor that runs through the White Mountain National Forest. 
PSNH developers corridor more than 60 years ago and currently operates a 115-kV line there that serves customers north of the national forest. We are proposing to relocate the existing line and build a new 350-kV DC line in this corridor. We look forward to working with the forest service as it participates as a cooperating agency in the overall review of the project's Environmental Impact Statement. 
As a reminder, the project has a number of benefits for New Hampshire and the region. It is expected to add more than $25 million a year in local property tax revenue and add 1,200 construction jobs. We estimate it will reduce the region's wholesale electric cost between $200 million and $300 million annually, including at least $30 million that would accrue to New Hampshire, and reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 5 million tons a year.
Despite the later projected start of the construction in 2014, we continue to estimate that the project will cost about $1.1 billion, including in-stores 25% share. At the EEI conference in November, we will update our year-by-year capital expenditures projections for the Northern Pass to reflect the 2014 to 2016 projected construction period.
Turning from electric transmission to natural gas distribution. Yankee has completed about 76% of its $57.6 million Waterbury-to-Wallingford project. We continue to expect the project to enter service by November 1. And the DPUC rate decision allowed  the entire project to be included in rates. In the rate decision, the DPUC also endorsed Yankee Gas's plan to significantly increase its capital spending by $25 million to $40 million annually to replace older cast iron and bare steel pipe. As Chuck noted earlier, we are not pleased with other aspects of the decision, and we will continue to focus on how we can more effectively manage the operation and maintain resources at Yankee Gas to mitigate the impact of this decision on financial performance.
Yankee Gas sales continue to be strong in the second quarter, some of it related to cooler temperatures in April and May. Firm retail sales rose 18.4% in the first half of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. On a weather-adjusted basis, firm sales rose 6.6%. With housing starts still relatively low, a great deal of unique resales is the result of new distributed generation coming online and fuel switching driven by high oil prices and low natural gas prices. Approximately 2/3 of this increase was a result of new distributed generation facilities coming at the service.
For the second quarter, weather-adjusted commercial and industrial sales rose 25.7% and 11.2%, respectively, over 2010, primarily driven by the same factors. We also continue to see convergence in residential space, as evidenced by a 7.8% weather-adjusted increase in residential sales over second quarter 2010. This can be primarily attributed to increases in master-needed multifamily buildings converting from oil to gas.
Now what I'd like to do is to turn the phone call over to David."
292525,138386909,151811,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee. Our results for the first half of 2011 reflect many of the same favorable trends we've seen since the middle of 2010.

Our results for the first half of 2011 reflect many of the same favorable trends we've seen since the middle of 2010. They include improving distribution results as rate increases and cost control measures have allowed our returns to recover from last year's low levels, favorable transmission earnings as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and a decline in the competitive business earnings as those businesses, particularly the Wholesale Marketing business, winds down in 2013. As a reminder, those results are now folded into our NU parent and other companies' business segments.
As Chuck noted earlier, we raised the lower end of the distribution segment guidance in the NU consolidated guidance by $0.05, effectively raising the midpoint of NU's earnings guidance for the year.
Our new range of $2.30 per share to $2.40, excluding merger costs, reflect the results we have experienced in the first half of 2011. The warmer temperatures and storm expense we have experienced in July and our prospects for the balance of the year, including the progress we are making on our major projects particularly the Greater Springfield Reliability Project and PSNH's Clean Air Project. In fact, the progress we are making on our transmission program this year is expected to result in us earning toward the upper end of our transmission guidance. I will discuss our updated guidance in more detail shortly.
Overall, we earned $77.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 or $0.44 per share compared with $71.9 million or $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Over the first 6 months of 2011, we earned $191.4 million or $1.08 per share compared with earnings of $158.2 million or $0.90 per share in the first half of 2010. Excluding charges related to our merger with NSTAR, we earned $200.9 million or $1.13 per share in the first half of 2011, up nearly 25% over 2010.
Although we believe we are well positioned for a successful year, and you can see that in our adjustments to guidance, I recognize our results for the quarter fell a little short of consensus, some of that may be due to the fact that, last year, our competitive business has added about $0.03 for the quarter versus breakeven this quarter. We believe other items are timing-related including PSNH rate case-related revenues and the pattern of transmission earnings where we see continued positive momentum for the second half of this year.
Our Transmission segment earned $42.4 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $41.9 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2010.
Over the first 6 months of 2011, our Transmission segment earned $86.9 million or $0.49 per share compared with earnings of $82.1 million or $0.46 per share in the first half of 2010.
Improved year-to-date transmission results reflect our ongoing investment in the high-voltage grid that serves the region as well as our forward-looking voice-routing transmission tariffs. We expect transmission earnings growth to accelerate over the coming quarters as we move into full construction mode on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project Lee mentioned a moment ago. Due to Greater Springfield and many smaller projects that are now under construction, our transmission rate base totaled $2.78 billion as of June 30, 2011, compared with $2.64 billion at June 30, 2010.
I know that some of you have noticed that CL&P's Transmission earnings were $2.1 million lower in the second quarter of 2011 than they were in the second quarter of 2010. This occurred even though CL&P's transmission rate base in the first half of '11 was about $2.15 billion, nearly 2% higher than it was in the first half of 2010. The reason for the decline in earnings is that we true up the many tracking features of our transmission tariff to coincide with the filing of our FERC Form 1 for the previous quarter, which is done in the second quarter each year. In 2011, that true-up resulted in a refund to our wholesale transmission customers, while in 2010, it resulted in incremental billings. That year-over-year change resulted in a decline in CL&P's second quarter Transmission earnings of $3.7 million from 2010 to 2011. We have no similar true-ups for the remainder of the year.
Overall, we remain very comfortable with our 2011 Transmission earnings guidance of 105 to 110. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we believe we'll earn toward the upper end of that range.
Turning to the Distribution business. We are in $40.3 million or $0.23 per share in the second quarter of '11 and $118 million -- excuse me, $118.5 million or $0.67 per share in the first half of 2011. This compared with earnings of $27.1 million or $0.15 per share in the second quarter of '10 and $75 million or $0.43 per share in the first half of 2010.
CL&P's Distribution segment earned $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $47.6 million in the first half of '11 compared with earnings of $8.4 million in the second quarter of '10 and $22.7 million in the first half of 2010. This improvement was due to a combination of strong cost controls and to the distribution rate decision we received last year, partially offset by higher pension and healthcare costs. That rate decision was approved -- approved a $63.4 million rate increase effective July 1, 2010, and an additional $38.5 million that was effective on July 1, 2011. As of June 30, 2011, CL&P's trailing 12-month distribution ROE was 9.8%. At this point in the year, we project a full regulatory ROE of about 9% for the year.
PSNH's Distribution/Generation segment earned $16 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $37.5 million in the first half of '11, compared with $16.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $28.1 million in the first half of 2010. PSNH benefited from this July 10 distribution rate increase in AFUDC earnings from the Clean Air Project, but those benefits were offset by higher pension and healthcare costs. Additionally, there were a number of relatively small onetime positive impacts in the second quarter of 2010 when PSNH concluded its rate case. Those positive impacts, which totaled about $3.85 million after tax, resulted from the fact that the final rate decision was retroactive as it targets August 2009.
While we have the benefit of higher rates in the second quarter of 2011, we lost the benefit of those 2010, onetime impacts. As a result, PSNH's second quarter 2011 Distribution earnings were down by about $1 million for 2010. PSNH Distribution regulatory ROE, including Generation earnings, was 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11. We expect that level to decline over the last 2 quarters of the year and for PSNH's Distribution regulatory ROE to be approximately 9% for the year. This is primarily due to the roll-off of the recruitment period associated with PSNH's decision from last year. From mid-2010 through mid-2011, we recovered approximately $13.7 million from customers to recruit revenues that we would otherwise would have recovered from customers from August 1, '09  to mid-2010. With those dollars now fully recovered as of June 30, '11, our distribution rates declined last month by about $2.3 million on an annualized net basis.
The Western Massachusetts Electric. The Distribution segment earned $4 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $9.7 million in the first half of 2011 compared with $2.3 million in the second quarter of '10 and $5.2 million in the first half of 2010. The improvement was primarily due to the resolution of WMECO's distribution rate case earlier this year, partially offset by higher operating costs. WMECO's Distribution regulatory ROE was 6.5% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11, compared with an authorized return of 9.6%. We expect Western MEC's distribution ROE to increase to approximately 9% for the calendar year of 2011. Recall that, due to the decoupling, which began 6 months ago, sales volumes have little impact on WMECO's earnings.
Overall, retail electric sales fell 1.3% in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. The first half retail electric sales rose 0.9% in '11 compared with 2010. Weather-adjusted retail sales were down 0.9% in the second quarter of '11 and down 0.5% for the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. This weather-adjusted sales decline, while somewhat more moderate than we have been experiencing in the past few years, is nevertheless a bit larger than the flat year-to-year weather-adjusted sale change we have projected at the start of the year. Within customer classes on a weather-adjusted basis, year-to-date residential and industrial sales were flat. The weakness we are seeing is in the commercial sector where sales were down 1.3%. 
It's a very different story on the natural gas side of the business, as Lee mentioned. For the year-to-date, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 18.4% and weather-adjusted firm sales were up 6.6%. Commercial industrial sales continue to benefit from increased migration of interruptible customers switching to firm rates. And just to be clear, these results and our views around sales for the balance of the year are incorporated into our updated guidance.
Yankee Gas earned $1.2 million in the second quarter of '11 and $23.7 million in the first half of '11 compared with a loss of $500,000 in the second quarter of 2010 and earnings of $19 million in the first half of '10. Yankee's sales increases were partially offset by higher operating costs, including higher pension and healthcare expenses.
Chuck mentioned earlier that, despite some constructive changes between the draft Yankee Gas rate decision and the final decision, the overall order was disappointing. The final decision resulted in a rate decrease of approximately $500,000, which was effective July 20, to be followed by a rate increase of about $6.7 million effective July 1, 2012.
While the PURA accepted our proposed capitalization ratio of 52.2% common equity and 47.8% debt, the authorized ROE of 8.83% is below what we think is a fair and reasonable return even in this economic environment. Also, the final decision disallowed firm rate base certain equipment that is now in-service, and serving customers has disallowed recovery of wage increases for non-union personnel. It also lowered rates by $1.5 million in rate year one and $3 million in rate year two to reflect expected savings from our merger with NSTAR, which still waits approval.
We've asked PURA to reconsider 3 specific issues contained in the final decision. One was the implication of merger savings; another, the inclusion of non-union wage increases in rates over the next 2 years; and the third, related to the correct regulatory treatment for deferred tax assets related to net operating losses associated with bonus depreciation. Together, these items totaled $3.6 million in rate year one and $6.1 million in rate year two.
On August 2, yesterday, the PURA issued a draft decision granting our request to reconsider the deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses but denied our request to reconsider the imputation of merger savings and the exclusion of wage increases. If our request relating to the deferred tax asset has also been approved, it would amount to a pretax benefit of about $750,000 in the first rate year that begins this quarter and about $1.1 million in the second rate year, which begins in July 2012.
Yankee's regulatory ROE was 9.9% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11, but we expect that level to decline over the coming quarters as a result of the rate decision.
Turning from our regulated businesses, NU parent and other companies, we had net expenses of $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $14 million in the first half of 2011 compared with earnings of $2.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $1.1 million in the first half of 2010. The 2011 results include $1.2 million of net expenses in the second quarter of '11 and $9.5 million of expenses in the first half of '11 related to the pending merger with NSTAR. Excluding those items, we recorded net expenses of $4 million in the second quarter of '11 or $0.03 per share. In the first half of '11, excluding expenses, we recorded net expense of $4.5 million, also $0.03 a share. As I mentioned earlier, the lower return in earnings this year are largely due to the wind-down of our wholesale business within our remaining competitive companies.
As I noted earlier, we raised the full of our earnings guidance for 2011. With the first half of the year now behind us, we are comfortable narrowing our Distribution and Generation segment earnings guidance to between $1.30 and $1.35 per share. We continue to project net expenses of about $0.05 per share in the parent and other businesses, excluding merger costs.
On a trailing 12-month basis, our earnings are $2.39 per share for the period ending June 30, 2011, excluding merger and 2010 NU parent tax settlement impact. As a heads-up, if there is a decline in trailing 12 months earnings over the balance of this year, we expect it will occur primarily in the third quarter. You may recall, that in 2010, we and many other utilities in the Northeast benefited from extremely warm third quarter temperatures. And while July '11 was indeed quite warm, we have not experienced and do not expect to experience the same number of cooling-free days we recorded in 2010.
Turning from earnings to debt assurances, balance sheet and cash flow. In May, we took advantage of strong demand for high-grade utility debt to sell $122 million of taxable PSNH first mortgage funds. The 10-year bonds carry a coupon of 4.05%, and the proceeds were used to redeem about $120 million or 6% tax-exempt bonds. We continue to expect PSNH to issue another $160 million of taxable bonds later this year and for WMECO to issue $100 million of senior unsecured notes.
We expect to benefit from S&P's decision on May 16 to raise all NU debt deferred stock ratings by one notch. That ratings action was based solely on NU's improved stand-alone credit profile. S&P maintained its credit watch positive rating on NU and our 4 regulated subsidiaries, subject to confirmation of our pending merger with NSTAR.
One key factor triggering that credit upgrade is our improving cash flow. Cash from operations after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled approximately $652 million in the first half of 2011 compared with $405 million in the first half of 2010. Mostly as a result of that strong operating cash flow, our total debt level declined nearly $150 million in the first months of this year so our common equity levels rose by more than $100 million.
Total debt represented about 54.5% of our consolidated capital structure at the beginning -- at the end of June, well below the 60% level we have discussed for a number of years. Much of that improve and reflect the benefits from bonus depreciation for income tax purposes.
We continue to project full year cash flows from operations of between $900 million and $950 million this year after repayment of PSNH and WMECO rate reduction bonds. Five years ago, we were generating less than half that level of cash, and we believe that improvement underscores the continued financial strengthening of our company.

We have made a statement when we set sort of direction for 2011, our guidance, that it was premised in a number of underlying assumptions that we try to bring current with the Street, and one of those is sales growth. And we have said general observation has been -- since 2005, we have seen demand disruption or negative load growth, if you will. This year, we actually had a little bit more optimism going into the year and thought that weather-adjusted sales would be flat. And we did see, right out of the block, some negative prints even though we had seen a little bit more favorable results, maybe in the spring. Our actual observation now and what we said in the call is weather-normalized sales were down 0.5%. So it's certainly better than the last 3 or 5 years of trend but not based on what we thought going into the year around projection. That said, the delta between flat sales and being down 0.5% is not a major earnings driver for this year. And as you know, our Massachusetts utility now has revenue decoupling, so it sort of neutralizes that issue. I think it's no surprise that we're going to stop short of calling for a double dip for sure, but no surprise that the New England economy and our economies have not reaccelerated in terms of growth, in terms of job creation, in terms of housing and the like. So you have more economic, sort of fundamentally more economic weakness than we might have hoped for 6 or 9 months ago. And I think, on top of that, you do see, and Lee mentioned this, you do see pure switching, which means customers who are going to DG were losing electric load, although we have a nice hedge, and that we're picking up gas sales at Yankee Gas. So you're seeing that type of activity. And you are seeing policies that are trying to incent customers and move in that direction, whether it's large commercial customers or even smaller customers who are installing solar. And then I think, second, another fundamental trend, which I do not see seizing by any means is states incenting utilities are providing more monies to fund conversation, load management and DR [ph] programs. In fact, you may know that, throughout New England, these programs have not only funded in rates by distribution companies but by proceeds from the Reg E option and proceeds by the FCM option. So there are monies flowing into demand response, and as to efficiency, there are also putting downward pressure on our sales."

And I'd like to thank all of the investors, who are listening to our call, for joining us this afternoon.Let me start by noting that NU had a good second quarter and a very strong first half of the year, both of which were consistent wi",1347,"Thank you, Jeff. And I'd like to thank all of the investors, who are listening to our call, for joining us this afternoon.
Let me start by noting that NU had a good second quarter and a very strong first half of the year, both of which were consistent with our full year 2011 earnings guidance. As you can see in our news release from last night, earnings per share were up 25% in the first half of 2011 over the first half of 2010, excluding merger-related costs. In light of the results of the first half of 2011 and our prospects for the full year, last night we raised the floor and, hence, the midpoint of our guidance for full year results. For 2011, we now project earning between $2.30 per share and $2.40 per share, excluding merger expenses.
As busy as the first half of the year has been, the next 6 months should see a number of very positive events. During the second half of the year, we expect to consummate our merger with NSTAR be in full construction mode on our Greater Springfield Reliability Project, bring key elements of PSNH's Clean Air Project into operation, announce a new route for the northern section of our Northern Pass project and achieve the financial performance that supports our updated earnings guidance. Our confidence in projecting near-term financial performance is enhanced by the fact that, for the first time in more than 2 years, we do not have either a distribution rate case pending or one that is about to be filed.
We continue to make good progress on the major events facing the company, our merger with NSTAR. In the past 3 months, we have achieved a number of milestones. In May, Maine regulators signed off on the merger, subject to FERC approval, which we obtained in July. If you have read the FERC decision, it fully authorized our merger as being consistent with the public interest, recognizing that the transaction would have no negative impact on competition in the New England energy marketplace. The FERC decision, when combined with the FCC approval and exploration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Justice Department review earlier in the year, means that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sign-off is the only federal approval we still require. As you know, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly endorsed the merger in March.
On the state regulatory side, the Connecticut DPUC issued a final decision on June 1, stating that it did not have jurisdiction over the merger because it did not involve the change of control of a Connecticut utility. While that decision has been appealed to the Connecticut Superior Court, we believe the DPUC's ruling is legally sound.
At the Massachusetts DPU, we have completed hearings on the merger, with final briefs in the case due to be filed on September 19. We believe that time schedule positions us to receive a final DPU decision and close the merger in the fourth quarter of this year. The DPU hearings have provided a platform to allow NU and NSTAR to demonstrate the very significant value our merger will bring to the region both in terms of cost savings and expanded environmental initiatives. We continue to be very comfortable with our projected $784 million of net benefits during the first 10 years after closing.
I know many of you have asked Jeff about the early July motion by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to extend the docket schedule significantly. We have opposed that motion vigorously and believe, if granted, it would be counterproductive to stakeholder's interest by delaying our ability to bring the benefits of this merger to NU and NSTAR customers, shareholders and employees. The DPU hearing officer overseeing the case has not yet ruled on the DOER's motion, and we are hopeful it will be rejected.
NSTAR is not only our merger partner, it is also our partner with the Northern Pass transmission project in New Hampshire where we continue to work through the regulatory approval process. Lee will provide you with more details, but we now believe that the project's schedule will need to be extended, with construction likely to take place from 2014 through 2016 rather than 2013 through 2015. Although we believe there is a widespread view that the project will bring very significant economic and environmental benefits to both New Hampshire and other New England states, we also recognized that there were significant concerns about the initial 40-mile route we proposed for the northern section of the line in New Hampshire where we do not currently own a right of way. We continue to listen to the different stakeholders involved in this process and to work with them to identify the best possible route for this line. As Lee will discuss in more detail, we expect to identify a new route for that northern section later this year so that regulatory review can continue.
Moving from New Hampshire to Connecticut. This year, the Connecticut legislature enacted Comprehensive Energy Legislation, which, among various provisions, restructured the energy functions within state government and brought them under a new Department of Energy Environmental Protection or DEEP. The new public utilities regulatory authority, led by 3 of the previous DPUC commissioners, assume responsibilities for most of the DPUC's regulatory roles including rate cases.
The more policy-driven responsibilities, such as the state's integrated resource plan, were assigned to a new energy division within DEEP. We are encouraged that, from a policy standpoint, many of the initiatives we have been advocating for years appear consistent with the views of both Governor Malloy and our first DEEP Commissioner, Dan Esty. We were also pleased that the new legislation will allow us to build 10 megawatts of regulated renewable generation in Connecticut.
In approving the budget for the new fiscal year, Connecticut lawmakers revoked another piece of legislation passed in 2010 that would have been harmful to our customers. That legislation had authorized the issuance of nearly $1 billion of new bonds that would have had been to be repaid through customers' electric bills. With the state's budget picture improving, the legislature revoked the authorization before the bonds could be issued, thereby effectively lowering rates for CL&P customers this summer. We have never believed that attempting to balance the state's budget in this manner was appropriate, and we congratulate the governor and the legislative leadership on this outcome.
On the regulatory front, while we were pleased with the PURA's decision on our merger, we were disappointed with its decision in the Yankee Gas rate case. We appreciate the commission's support for our capital program but agree with much of the commentary from the financial community, which has observed that the authorized ROE of 8.83% is a negative outlier for the industry nationwide.
We subsequently asked the PURA to reconsider 3 aspects of its final order. And yesterday, the authority agreed to reopen the case to consider one of them. David will discuss that in more detail shortly.
At FERC, we were encouraged by the recent ruling on transmission planning in cost allocation. We believe it reflects support for transportation development like our NEEWS and Northern Pass initiatives and respect for regional planning process in place in New England. Most importantly, the FERC commissioner has expressed deep support for continued investment in the nation's electric transmission infrastructure. This is a view with which we clearly agree.
Finally, we are quite pleased with the company's ongoing operations. Our customer service metrics continued to improve. Our reliability is sound even in the face of the record heat we experienced in the northeast 2 weeks ago, and the response of our employees to the extreme weather events, such as the June 1 tornado that struck Springfield, Massachusetts, has been very well-organized and carried out. We've received a number of positive comments from both state and municipal leaders on our response to these severe storms.
Lee will provide more details on our operations and on the progress of our major projects. And now, I will turn over the call to him."

Our operating performance was quite good in the first half of the year and has remained strong since the start of the summer. We had 2 major weather events in June, which caused significant damage and to which our organization responded",1928,"Thank you, Chuck. Our operating performance was quite good in the first half of the year and has remained strong since the start of the summer. We had 2 major weather events in June, which caused significant damage and to which our organization responded very well. On June 1, a damaging tornado tore through the city of Springfield. In the following week, 3 days of thunderstorms accompanied by high winds knocked out power to approximately 300,000 of our customers across 3 states. In both cases, the vast majority of customers had their power restored within the first 36 hours.
Our prompt response to outages, along with outstanding call center performance, mitigated long protracted service restorations and drew praise from state and local elected leaders. In total, we spent about $17.8 million in restoration activities following those storms. More than $15 million of that, which has either been capitalized or applied against our major storm funds. Pretax storm-related costs actually fell by about $5 million in the second quarter of 2011, as compared with 2010.
We believe our customers appreciate the improvements we have been serving them. In the most recent JD Power survey of utility customer satisfaction, all of our electric utility scores improved, and Yankee Gas remained the highest ranked mid-sized natural gas distribution company in the northeast. Our $430 million Clean Air Project, a wet scrubber being installed at our 2-unit Merrimack coal-fired station, is ahead of schedule and currently 86% complete. System tie-ins, startup and commissioning activities are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the scrubber itself could be operational by the end of the year.
The [indiscernible] project should be completed by mid-2012. You may recall that the scrubbers required -- is required under New Hampshire's mercury reduction law, which was enacted about 5 years ago. Two weeks ago, the New Hampshire Supreme Court dismissed, in an appeal that had been filed against the project, saying the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case. In Massachusetts, our first solar installation, a 1.8-megawatt facility in Pittsfield, has operated well; and our second facility, a 2.2-megawatt installation, was under construction at a brownfield site in Springfield and should be completed by the end of the year.
Turning to transmission. Our transmission capital expenditures totaled $164 million in the first 6 months of 2011, and we expect the pace of capital spending to accelerate in the second half of the year as we move into full construction mode on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. The GSRP is the largest of the 3 major projects we expect to undertake as part of the NEEWS family of projects. In Massachusetts, we commenced substation work on GSRP in December of 2010 and began site work on the overhead section in the first quarter of 2011. We recently began substation work in Connecticut, and we continue to expect full construction in Massachusetts to begin later this quarter after we receive the required Army Corps of Engineers and Massachusetts environmental permits. We need those permits to work in or near wetland areas, and we've made substantial progress working through the remaining environmental permit issues over the past 3 months. We expect to receive the permits by the end of this month or in the first part of September. The workforce and materials are available to start construction in the wetland areas immediately upon the receipt of the permits. In the meantime, we have accelerated our work on areas where we already have full permitting. As a result, we now estimate that the GSRP project is approximately 36% complete, and we remain on target to complete the project by the end of 2013. To date, we have spent $231 million on GSRP.
You may recall, during our May earnings call, I had mentioned that we had filed an application with FERC to recover in regional rates the financing cost of NEEWS during the construction period. That change has, in effect, reduces the AFUDC but increases cash flow from NEEWS during the construction period. This is related to the interplay between our local network rates and our regional network rates. FERC approved our application for our construction work in progress effective June 1, 2011, in regional rates, and as a result, we will be capitalizing less the financing cost for NEEWS during construction. This is good for New England customers because it will ultimately result in a lower-cost project to be supported in regional rates.
As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings discussion, this change reduces our total cost of NEEWS, net of the United Illuminating investment and the larger Connecticut projects to approximately $1.35 billion. For the Greater Springfield Project, it reduces costs from $795 million to $718 million. By the interstate, it reduces the costs from $251 million to $218 million. For the Central Connecticut project, it reduces the estimated costs from $338 million to $301 million. Those AFUDC-related changes were already factored into our rate base projections that we published in our in-report earlier this year. We do not believe it should have any impact on the NEEWS-related earnings estimates Street analysts have developed.
Turning to those other 2 major NEEWS projects. We at National Grid expect to file our siting applications in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island late this year to build the Interstate Reliability Project. Last month, we began formal consultations with several municipalities in Eastern Connecticut, a requirement before we file our formal state application.
The Central Connecticut Reliability Project continues to be reviewed by ISO New England as part of the overall review of transmission in Central Connecticut. We expect the review to be completed and needs identified in late 2011 with specific projects identified in late 2012.
We received good news from Washington in late June when the FERC denied, in a 3:1 vote reconsideration of the financial incentives for NEEWS that were approved in late 2008. To remind you, those incentives include recovery of abandoned cost, a cash return on construction work in progress while the projects are under construction and a 12.89% return on equity. Also, I should note that on July 22, electricity usage increased significantly when the temperatures hit an all-time record of 103 degrees at Bradley Field north of Hartford.
The preliminary New England peak demand load of approximately 27,700 megawatts appeared to be the second highest ever recorded in New England. Fortunately, the region's generation transmission systems performed very well. The unanticipated increase in peak demand which would have been even higher if it -- if not the fact that it occurred on a Friday afternoon, when many in the workforce begin their weekend departures, underscores the likelihood that peak demand is again rising in the region.
Earlier, Chuck discussed some of the recent developments concerning the Northern Pass project. Recall that the project involves 180 miles of new transmission line in the state, including an AC section in Southern New Hampshire. Of those 180 miles, we currently have right of way for 140 miles. Our focus right now is on the 40 northernmost miles where we need new right-of-way. We continue with our outreach in New Hampshire stakeholders and communities as we identify and secure a route for those 40 miles and hope to announce such a route later this year. We are making solid progress in this effort. This process of identifying routes and providing stakeholders with time to review and comment has added about an additional 9 months to the siting process. That is why we now estimate that the construction will begin in early 2014.
As you may know, the U.S. Department of Energy environmental assessment process begins once a specific route is submitted. We applied last fall with the DOE, and they have left open the public comment period on the project so that the participants in the review process can comment on the route that we identified. The DOE will announce a consultant who will be working on the environmental data already collected for the lower 140 miles of the route. We expect this process to continue throughout this year and into 2012 as we advance through the siting process. Additionally, we will begin preparing our application for the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee once the northern 40 miles of the route are identified.
On June 28, we took another step forward on Northern Pass when we filed a special use application with the U.S. Forest Service to build approximately 10 miles of the Northern Pass project along our existing right-of-way corridor that runs through the White Mountain National Forest. 
PSNH developed this corridor more than 60 years ago and currently operates a 115-kV line there that serves customers north of the national forest. We are proposing to relocate the existing line and build the new 350-kV DC line in this corridor. We look forward to working with the forest service as it participates as a cooperating agency in the overall review of the project's Environmental Impact Statement. 
As a reminder, the project has a number of benefits for New Hampshire and the region. It is expected to add more than $25 million a year in local property tax revenue and add 1,200 construction jobs. We estimate it will reduce the region's wholesale electric cost between $200 million and $300 million annually, including at least $30 million that would accrue to New Hampshire, and reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 5 million tons a year.
Despite the later projected start of the construction in 2014, we continue to estimate that the project will cost about $1.1 billion, including in-stores 25% share. At the EEI conference in November, we will update our year-by-year capital expenditures projections for the Northern Pass to reflect the 2014 to 2016 projected construction period.
Turning from electric transmission to natural gas distribution. Yankee has completed about 76% of its $57.6 million Waterbury-to-Wallingford project. We continue to expect the project to enter service by November 1. And the DPUC rate decision allowed the entire project to be included in rates. In the rate decision, the DPUC also endorsed Yankee Gas's plan to significantly increase its capital spending by $25 million to $40 million annually to replace older cast iron and bare steel pipe. As Chuck noted earlier, we are not pleased with other aspects of the decision, and we will continue to focus on how we can more effectively manage the operation and maintenance resources at Yankee Gas to mitigate the impact of this decision on financial performance.
Yankee Gas sales continue to be strong in the second quarter, some of it related to cooler temperatures in April and May. Firm retail sales rose 18.4% in the first half of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. On a weather-adjusted basis, firm sales rose 6.6%. With housing starts still relatively low, a great deal of the increase sales is the result of new distributed generation coming online and fuel switching driven by high oil prices and low natural gas prices. Approximately 2/3 of this increase was a result of new distributed generation facilities coming into service.
For the second quarter, weather-adjusted commercial and industrial sales rose 25.7% and 11.2%, respectively, over 2010, primarily driven by the same factors. We also continue to see convergence in residential space, as evidenced by a 7.8% weather-adjusted increase in residential sales over second quarter 2010. This can be primarily attributed to increases in master-needed multifamily buildings converting from oil to gas.
Now what I'd like to do is to turn the phone call over to David."
292525,138386909,151960,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Lee.

Our results for the first half of 2011 reflect many of the same favorable trends we've seen since the middle of 2010. They include improving distribution results as rate increases and cost control measures have allowed our returns to recover from last year's low levels, favorable transmission earnings as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and a decline in the competitive business earnings as those businesses, particularly the Wholesale Marketing business, winds down in 2013. As a reminder, those results are now folded into our NU parent and other companies' business segments.
As Chuck noted earlier, we have raised the lower end of the distribution segment guidance in the NU consolidated guidance by $0.05, effectively raising the midpoint of NU's earnings guidance for the year.
Our new range of $2.30 per share to $2.40, excluding merger costs, reflect the results we have experienced in the first half of 2011. The warmer temperatures and storm expense we have experienced in July and our prospects for the balance of the year, including the progress we are making on our major projects particularly the Greater Springfield Reliability Project and PSNH's Clean Air Project. In fact, the progress we are making on our transmission program this year is expected to result in us earning toward the upper end of our transmission guidance. I will discuss our updated guidance in more detail shortly.
Overall, we earned $77.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 or $0.44 per share compared with $71.9 million or $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Over the first 6 months of 2011, we earned $191.4 million or $1.08 per share compared with earnings of $158.2 million or $0.90 per share in the first half of 2010. Excluding charges related to our merger with NSTAR, we earned $200.9 million or $1.13 per share in the first half of 2011, up nearly 25% over 2010.
Although we believe we are well positioned for a successful year, and you can see that in our adjustments to guidance, I recognize our results for the quarter fell a little short of consensus, some of that may be due to the fact that, last year, our competitive businesses added about $0.03 for the quarter versus breakeven this quarter. We believe other items are timing-related including PSNH rate case-related revenues and the pattern of transmission earnings where we see continued positive momentum for the second half of this year.
Our Transmission segment earned $42.4 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $41.9 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2010.
Over the first 6 months of 2011, our Transmission segment earned $86.9 million or $0.49 per share compared with earnings of $82.1 million or $0.46 per share in the first half of 2010.
Improved year-to-date transmission results reflect our ongoing investment in a high-voltage grid that serves the region as well as our forward-looking fully-tracking transmission tariffs. We expect transmission earnings growth to accelerate over the coming quarters as we move into full construction mode on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project Lee mentioned a moment ago. Due to Greater Springfield and many smaller projects that are now under construction, our transmission rate base totaled $2.78 billion as of June 30, 2011, compared with $2.64 billion at June 30, 2010.
I know that some of you have noticed that CL&P's Transmission earnings were $2.1 million lower in the second quarter of 2011 than they were in the second quarter of 2010. This occurred even though CL&P's transmission rate base in the first half of '11 was about $2.15 billion, nearly 2% higher than it was in the first half of 2010. The reason for the decline in earnings is that we true up the many tracking features of our transmission tariff to coincide with the filing of our FERC Form 1 for the previous quarter, which is done in the second quarter each year. In 2011, that true-up resulted in a refund to our wholesale transmission customers, while in 2010, it resulted in incremental billings. That year-over-year change resulted in a decline in CL&P's second quarter Transmission earnings of $3.7 million from 2010 to 2011. We have no similar true-ups for the remainder of the year.
Overall, we remained very comfortable with our 2011 Transmission earnings guidance of 105 to 110. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we believe we'll earn toward the upper end of that range.
Turning to the Distribution business. We earned $40.3 million or $0.23 per share in the second quarter of '11 and $118 million -- excuse me, $118.5 million or $0.67 per share in the first half of 2011. This compared with earnings of $27.1 million or $0.15 per share in the second quarter of '10 and $75 million or $0.43 per share in the first half of 2010.
CL&P's Distribution segment earned $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $47.6 million in the first half of '11 compared with earnings of $8.4 million in the second quarter of '10 and $22.7 million in the first half of 2010. This improvement was due to a combination of strong cost controls and to the distribution rate decision we received last year, partially offset by higher pension and healthcare costs. That rate decision was approved a $63.4 million rate increase effective July 1, 2010, and an additional $38.5 million that was effective on July 1, 2011. As of June 30, 2011, CL&P's trailing 12-month distribution ROE was 9.8%. At this point in the year, we project a full regulatory ROE of about 9% for the year.
PSNH's Distribution/Generation segment earned $16 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $37.5 million in the first half of '11, compared with $16.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $28.1 million in the first half of 2010. PSNH benefited from this July 10 distribution rate increase in AFUDC earnings from the Clean Air Project, but those benefits were offset by higher pension and healthcare costs. Additionally, there were a number of relatively small onetime positive impacts in the second quarter of 2010 when PSNH concluded its rate case. Those positive impacts, which totaled about $3.85 million after tax, resulted from the fact that the final rate decision was retroactive since August 2009.
While we have the benefit of higher rates in the second quarter of 2011, we lost the benefit of those 2010, onetime impacts. As a result, PSNH's second quarter 2011 Distribution earnings were down by about $1 million from 2010. PSNH Distribution regulatory ROE, including Generation earnings, was 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11. We expect that level to decline over the last 2 quarters of the year and for PSNH's Distribution regulatory ROE to be approximately 9% for the year. This is primarily due to the roll-off of the recruitment period associated with PSNH's decision from last year. From mid-2010 through mid-2011, we recovered approximately $13.7 million from customers to recoup revenues that we would otherwise would have recovered from customers from August 1, '09  to mid-2010. With those dollars now fully recovered as of June 30, '11, our distribution rates declined last month by about $2.3 million on an annualized net basis.
The Western Massachusetts Electric. The Distribution segment earned $4 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $9.7 million in the first half of 2011 compared with $2.3 million in the second quarter of '10 and $5.2 million in the first half of 2010. The improvement was primarily due to the resolution of WMECO's distribution rate case earlier this year, partially offset by higher operating costs. WMECO's Distribution regulatory ROE was 6.5% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11, compared with an authorized return of 9.6%. We expect Western MEC's distribution ROE to increase to approximately 9% for the calendar year of 2011. Recall that, due to decoupling, which began 6 months ago, sales volumes have little impact on WMECO's earnings.
Overall, retail electric sales fell 1.3% in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. The first half retail electric sales rose 0.9% in '11 compared with 2010. Weather-adjusted retail sales were down 0.9% in the second quarter of '11 and down 0.5% for the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. This weather-adjusted sales decline, while somewhat more moderate than we have been experiencing in the past few years, is nevertheless a bit larger than the flat year-to-year weather-adjusted sale change we have projected at the start of the year. Within customer classes on a weather-adjusted basis, year-to-date residential and industrial sales were flat. The weakness we are seeing is in the commercial sector where sales were down 1.3%. 
It's a very different story on the natural gas side of the business, as Lee mentioned. For the year-to-date, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 18.4% and weather-adjusted firm sales were up 6.6%. Commercial industrial sales continue to benefit from increased migration of interruptible customers switching to firm rates. And just to be clear, these results and our views around sales for the balance of the year are incorporated into our updated guidance.
Yankee Gas earned $1.2 million in the second quarter of '11 and $23.7 million in the first half of '11 compared with a loss of $500,000 in the second quarter of 2010 and earnings of $19 million in the first half of '10. Yankee's sales increases were partially offset by higher operating costs, including higher pension and healthcare expenses.
Chuck mentioned earlier that, despite some constructive changes between the draft Yankee Gas rate decision and the final decision, the overall order was disappointing. The final decision resulted in a rate decrease of approximately $500,000, which was effective July 20, to be followed by a rate increase of about $6.7 million effective July 1, 2012.
While the PURA accepted our proposed capitalization ratio of 52.2% common equity and 47.8% debt, the authorized ROE of 8.83% is below what we think is a fair and reasonable return even in this economic environment. Also, the final decision disallowed firm rate base certain equipment that is now in-service, and serving customers, and disallowed recovery of wage increases for non-union personnel. It also lowered rates by $1.5 million in rate year one and $3 million in rate year 2 to reflect expected savings from our merger with NSTAR, which still awaits approval.
We've asked PURA to reconsider 3 specific issues contained in the final decision. One was the implication of merger savings; another, the inclusion of non-union wage increases in rates over the next 2 years; and the third, related to the correct regulatory treatment for deferred tax assets related to net operating losses associated with bonus depreciation. Together, these items totaled $3.6 million in rate year one and $6.1 million in rate year 2.
On August 2, yesterday, the PURA issued a draft decision granting our request to reconsider the deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses but denied our request to reconsider the imputation of merger savings and the exclusion of wage increases. If our request relating to the deferred tax asset is ultimately approved, it would amount to a pretax benefit of about $750,000 in the first rate year that begins this quarter and about $1.1 million in the second rate year, which begins in July 2012.
Yankee's regulatory ROE was 9.9% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11, but we expect that level to decline over the coming quarters as a result of the rate decision.
Turning from our regulated businesses, NU parent and other companies, we had net expenses of $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $14 million in the first half of 2011 compared with earnings of $2.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $1.1 million in the first half of 2010. The 2011 results include $1.2 million of net expenses in the second quarter of '11 and $9.5 million of expenses in the first half of '11 related to the pending merger with NSTAR. Excluding those items, we recorded net expenses of $4 million in the second quarter of '11 or $0.03 per share. In the first half of '11, excluding expenses, we recorded net expense of $4.5 million, also $0.03 per share. As I mentioned earlier, the lower return in earnings this year are largely due to the wind-down of our wholesale business within our remaining competitive companies.
As I noted earlier, we raised the full of our earnings guidance for 2011. With the first half of the year now behind us, we are comfortable narrowing our Distribution and Generation segment earnings guidance to between $1.30 and $1.35 per share. We continue to project net expenses of about $0.05 per share in the parent and other businesses, excluding merger costs.
On a trailing 12-month basis, our earnings are $2.39 per share for the period ending June 30, 2011, excluding merger and 2010 NU parent tax settlement impact. As a heads-up, if there is a decline in trailing 12 months earnings over the balance of this year, we expect it will occur primarily in the third quarter. You may recall, that in 2010, we and many other utilities in the Northeast benefited from extremely warm third quarter temperatures. And while July '11 was indeed quite warm, we have not experienced and do not expect to experience the same number of cooling-free days we recorded in 2010.
Turning from earnings to debt assurances, balance sheet and cash flow. In May, we took advantage of strong demand for high-grade utility debt to sell $122 million of taxable PSNH first mortgage funds. The 10-year bonds carry a coupon of 4.05%, and the proceeds were used to redeem about $120 million or 6% tax-exempt bonds. We continue to expect PSNH to issue another $160 million of taxable bonds later this year and for WMECO to issue $100 million of senior unsecured notes.
We expect to benefit from S&P's decision on May 16 to raise all NU debt deferred stock ratings by one notch. That ratings action was based solely on NU's improved stand-alone credit profile. S&P maintained its credit watch positive rating on NU and our 4 regulated subsidiaries, subject to confirmation of our pending merger with NSTAR.
One key factor triggering that credit upgrade is our improving cash flow. Cash from operations after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled approximately $652 million in the first half of 2011 compared with $405 million in the first half of 2010. Mostly as a result of that strong operating cash flow, our total debt level declined nearly $150 million in the first months of this year so our common equity levels rose by more than $100 million.
Total debt represented about 54.5% of our consolidated capital structure at the beginning -- at the end of June, well below the 60% level we have discussed for a number of years. Much of that improvement reflects the benefits from bonus depreciation for income tax purposes.
We continue to project full year cash flows from operations of between $900 million and $950 million this year after repayment of PSNH and WMECO rate reduction bonds. Five years ago, we were generating less than half that level of cash, and we believe that improvement underscores the continued financial strengthening of our company.

Or do they have to make a separate independent ruling on his motion at some point between now and when they make a final decision?"

We had made a statement when we set sort of direction for 2011, our guidance, that it was premised on a number of underlying assumptions that we try to bring current with the Street, and one of those is sales growth. And we have said general observation has been -- since 2005, we have seen demand disruption or negative load growth, if you will. This year, we actually had a little bit more optimism going into the year and thought that weather-adjusted sales would be flat. And we did see, right out of the blocks, some negative prints even though we had seen a little bit more favorable results, maybe in the spring. Our actual observation now and what we said in the call is weather-normalized sales were down 0.5%. So it's certainly better than the last 3 to 5 years of trend but not based on what we thought going into the year around projection. That said, the delta between flat sales and being down 0.5% is not a major earnings driver for this year. And as you know, our Massachusetts utility now has revenue decoupling, so it sort of neutralizes that issue. I think it's no surprise that we're going to stop short of calling for a double dip for sure, but no surprise that the New England economy and our economies have not reaccelerated in terms of growth, in terms of job creation, in terms of housing and the like. So you have more economic, sort of -- fundamentally more economic weakness than we might have hoped for 6 or 9 months ago. And I think, on top of that, you do see, and Lee mentioned this, you do see fuel switching, which means customers who are going to DG were losing electric load, although we have a nice hedge, and now we're picking up gas sales at Yankee Gas. So you're seeing that type of activity. And you are seeing policies that are trying to incent customers to move in that direction, whether it's large commercial customers or even smaller customers who are installing solar. And then I think, second, another fundamental trend, which I do not see sort of seizing by any means is states incenting utilities and providing more monies to fund conversation, load management and DR [ph] programs. In fact, you may know that, throughout New England, these programs have not only funded in rates by distribution companies but by proceeds from the Reg E option and proceeds by the FCM option. So there are monies flowing into demand response, and as the efficiency that are also putting downward pressure on our sales."

And even if you look at some of the trouble spots, Chris, around, say, on collectibles, we have a very good trend there. And that's pretty much in check at this point, although it continues to get a lot of attention."

And I'd like to thank all of the investors, who are listening to our call, for joining us this afternoon.Let me start by noting that NU had a good second quarter and a very strong first half of the year, both of which were consistent wi",1347,"Thank you, Jeff. And I'd like to thank all of the investors, who are listening to our call, for joining us this afternoon.
Let me start by noting that NU had a good second quarter and a very strong first half of the year, both of which were consistent with our full year 2011 earnings guidance. As you can see in our news release from last night, earnings per share were up 25% in the first half of 2011 over the first half of 2010, excluding merger-related costs. In light of the results of the first half of 2011 and our prospects for the full year, last night we raised the floor and, hence, the midpoint of our guidance for full year results. For 2011, we now project earning between $2.30 per share and $2.40 per share, excluding merger expenses.
As busy as the first half of the year has been, the next 6 months should see a number of very positive events. During the second half of the year, we expect to consummate our merger with NSTAR be in full construction mode on our Greater Springfield Reliability Project, bring key elements of PSNH's Clean Air Project into operation, announce a new route for the northern section of our Northern Pass project and achieve the financial performance that supports our updated earnings guidance. Our confidence in projecting near-term financial performance is enhanced by the fact that, for the first time in more than 2 years, we do not have either a distribution rate case pending or one that is about to be filed.
We continue to make good progress on the major events facing the company, our merger with NSTAR. In the past 3 months, we have achieved a number of milestones. In May, Maine regulators signed off on the merger, subject to FERC approval, which we obtained in July. If you have read the FERC decision, it fully authorized our merger as being consistent with the public interest, recognizing that the transaction would have no negative impact on competition in the New England energy marketplace. The FERC decision, when combined with the FCC approval and exploration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Justice Department review earlier in the year, means that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sign-off is the only federal approval we still require. As you know, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly endorsed the merger in March.
On the state regulatory side, the Connecticut DPUC issued a final decision on June 1, stating that it did not have jurisdiction over the merger because it did not involve the change of control of a Connecticut utility. While that decision has been appealed to the Connecticut Superior Court, we believe the DPUC's ruling is legally sound.
At the Massachusetts DPU, we have completed hearings on the merger, with final briefs in the case due to be filed on September 19. We believe that time schedule positions us to receive a final DPU decision and close the merger in the fourth quarter of this year. The DPU hearings have provided a platform to allow NU and NSTAR to demonstrate the very significant value our merger will bring to the region both in terms of cost savings and expanded environmental initiatives. We continue to be very comfortable with our projected $784 million of net benefits during the first 10 years after closing.
I know many of you have asked Jeff about the early July motion by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources to extend the docket schedule significantly. We have opposed that motion vigorously and believe, if granted, it would be counterproductive to stakeholder's interest by delaying our ability to bring the benefits of this merger to NU and NSTAR customers, shareholders and employees. The DPU hearing officer overseeing the case has not yet ruled on the DOER's motion, and we are hopeful it will be rejected.
NSTAR is not only our merger partner, it is also our partner with the Northern Pass transmission project in New Hampshire where we continue to work through the regulatory approval process. Lee will provide you with more details, but we now believe that the project's schedule will need to be extended, with construction likely to take place from 2014 through 2016 rather than 2013 through 2015. Although we believe there is a widespread view that the project will bring very significant economic and environmental benefits to both New Hampshire and other New England states, we also recognized that there were significant concerns about the initial 40-mile route we proposed for the northern section of the line in New Hampshire where we do not currently own a right of way. We continue to listen to the different stakeholders involved in this process and to work with them to identify the best possible route for this line. As Lee will discuss in more detail, we expect to identify a new route for that northern section later this year so that regulatory review can continue.
Moving from New Hampshire to Connecticut. This year, the Connecticut legislature enacted Comprehensive Energy Legislation, which, among various provisions, restructured the energy functions within state government and brought them under a new Department of Energy Environmental Protection or DEEP. The new public utilities regulatory authority, led by 3 of the previous DPUC commissioners, assume responsibilities for most of the DPUC's regulatory roles including rate cases.
The more policy-driven responsibilities, such as the state's integrated resource plan, were assigned to a new energy division within DEEP. We are encouraged that, from a policy standpoint, many of the initiatives we have been advocating for years appear consistent with the views of both Governor Malloy and our first DEEP Commissioner, Dan Esty. We were also pleased that the new legislation will allow us to build 10 megawatts of regulated renewable generation in Connecticut.
In approving the budget for the new fiscal year, Connecticut lawmakers revoked another piece of legislation passed in 2010 that would have been harmful to our customers. That legislation had authorized the issuance of nearly $1 billion of new bonds that would have had been to be repaid through customers' electric bills. With the state's budget picture improving, the legislature revoked the authorization before the bonds could be issued, thereby effectively lowering rates for CL&P customers this summer. We have never believed that attempting to balance the state's budget in this manner was appropriate, and we congratulate the governor and the legislative leadership on this outcome.
On the regulatory front, while we were pleased with the PURA's decision on our merger, we were disappointed with its decision in the Yankee Gas rate case. We appreciate the commission's support for our capital program but agree with much of the commentary from the financial community, which has observed that the authorized ROE of 8.83% is a negative outlier for the industry nationwide.
We subsequently asked the PURA to reconsider 3 aspects of its final order. And yesterday, the authority agreed to reopen the case to consider one of them. David will discuss that in more detail shortly.
At FERC, we were encouraged by the recent ruling on transmission planning in cost allocation. We believe it reflects support for transportation development like our NEEWS and Northern Pass initiatives and respect for regional planning process in place in New England. Most importantly, the FERC commissioner has expressed deep support for continued investment in the nation's electric transmission infrastructure. This is a view with which we clearly agree.
Finally, we are quite pleased with the company's ongoing operations. Our customer service metrics continued to improve. Our reliability is sound even in the face of the record heat we experienced in the northeast 2 weeks ago, and the response of our employees to the extreme weather events, such as the June 1 tornado that struck Springfield, Massachusetts, has been very well-organized and carried out. We've received a number of positive comments from both state and municipal leaders on our response to these severe storms.
Lee will provide more details on our operations and on the progress of our major projects. And now, I will turn over the call to him."
292525,138386909,152342,"Northeast Utilities, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2011",2011-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Chuck. Our operating performance was quite good in the first half of the year and has remained strong since the start of the summer. We had 2 major weather events in June, which caused significant damage and to which our organization responded",1928,"Thank you, Chuck. Our operating performance was quite good in the first half of the year and has remained strong since the start of the summer. We had 2 major weather events in June, which caused significant damage and to which our organization responded very well. On June 1, a damaging tornado tore through the city of Springfield. In the following week, 3 days of thunderstorms accompanied by high winds knocked out power to approximately 300,000 of our customers across 3 states. In both cases, the vast majority of customers had their power restored within the first 36 hours.
Our prompt response to outages, along with outstanding call center performance, mitigated long protracted service restorations and drew praise from state and local elected leaders. In total, we spent about $17.8 million in restoration activities following those storms. More than $15 million of that, which has either been capitalized or applied against our major storm funds. Pretax storm-related costs actually fell by about $5 million in the second quarter of 2011, as compared with 2010.
We believe our customers appreciate the improvements we have been serving them. In the most recent JD Power survey of utility customer satisfaction, all of our electric utility scores improved, and Yankee Gas remained the highest ranked mid-sized natural gas distribution company in the northeast. Our $430 million Clean Air Project, a wet scrubber being installed at our 2-unit Merrimack coal-fired station, is ahead of schedule and currently 86% complete. System tie-ins, startup and commissioning activities are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2011, and the scrubber itself could be operational by the end of the year.
The [indiscernible] project should be completed by mid-2012. You may recall that the scrubbers required -- is required under New Hampshire's mercury reduction law, which was enacted about 5 years ago. Two weeks ago, the New Hampshire Supreme Court dismissed, in an appeal that had been filed against the project, saying the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case. In Massachusetts, our first solar installation, a 1.8-megawatt facility in Pittsfield, has operated well; and our second facility, a 2.2-megawatt installation, was under construction at a brownfield site in Springfield and should be completed by the end of the year.
Turning to transmission. Our transmission capital expenditures totaled $164 million in the first 6 months of 2011, and we expect the pace of capital spending to accelerate in the second half of the year as we move into full construction mode on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project. The GSRP is the largest of the 3 major projects we expect to undertake as part of the NEEWS family of projects. In Massachusetts, we commenced substation work on GSRP in December of 2010 and began site work on the overhead section in the first quarter of 2011. We recently began substation work in Connecticut, and we continue to expect full construction in Massachusetts to begin later this quarter after we receive the required Army Corps of Engineers and Massachusetts environmental permits. We need those permits to work in or near wetland areas, and we've made substantial progress working through the remaining environmental permit issues over the past 3 months. We expect to receive the permits by the end of this month or in the first part of September. The workforce and materials are available to start construction in the wetland areas immediately upon the receipt of the permits. In the meantime, we have accelerated our work on areas where we already have full permitting. As a result, we now estimate that the GSRP project is approximately 36% complete, and we remain on target to complete the project by the end of 2013. To date, we have spent $231 million on GSRP.
You may recall, during our May earnings call, I had mentioned that we had filed an application with FERC to recover in regional rates the financing cost of NEEWS during the construction period. That change has, in effect, reduces the AFUDC but increases cash flow from NEEWS during the construction period. This is related to the interplay between our local network rates and our regional network rates. FERC approved our application for our construction work in progress effective June 1, 2011, in regional rates, and as a result, we will be capitalizing less the financing cost for NEEWS during construction. This is good for New England customers because it will ultimately result in a lower-cost project to be supported in regional rates.
As I mentioned during the first quarter earnings discussion, this change reduces our total cost of NEEWS, net of the United Illuminating investment and the larger Connecticut projects to approximately $1.35 billion. For the Greater Springfield Project, it reduces costs from $795 million to $718 million. By the interstate, it reduces the costs from $251 million to $218 million. For the Central Connecticut project, it reduces the estimated costs from $338 million to $301 million. Those AFUDC-related changes were already factored into our rate base projections that we published in our in-report earlier this year. We do not believe it should have any impact on the NEEWS-related earnings estimates Street analysts have developed.
Turning to those other 2 major NEEWS projects. We at National Grid expect to file our siting applications in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island late this year to build the Interstate Reliability Project. Last month, we began formal consultations with several municipalities in Eastern Connecticut, a requirement before we file our formal state application.
The Central Connecticut Reliability Project continues to be reviewed by ISO New England as part of the overall review of transmission in Central Connecticut. We expect the review to be completed and needs identified in late 2011 with specific projects identified in late 2012.
We received good news from Washington in late June when the FERC denied, in a 3:1 vote reconsideration of the financial incentives for NEEWS that were approved in late 2008. To remind you, those incentives include recovery of abandoned cost, a cash return on construction work in progress while the projects are under construction and a 12.89% return on equity. Also, I should note that on July 22, electricity usage increased significantly when the temperatures hit an all-time record of 103 degrees at Bradley Field north of Hartford.
The preliminary New England peak demand load of approximately 27,700 megawatts appeared to be the second highest ever recorded in New England. Fortunately, the region's generation transmission systems performed very well. The unanticipated increase in peak demand which would have been even higher if it -- if not the fact that it occurred on a Friday afternoon, when many in the workforce begin their weekend departures, underscores the likelihood that peak demand is again rising in the region.
Earlier, Chuck discussed some of the recent developments concerning the Northern Pass project. Recall that the project involves 180 miles of new transmission line in the state, including an AC section in Southern New Hampshire. Of those 180 miles, we currently have right of way for 140 miles. Our focus right now is on the 40 northernmost miles where we need new right-of-way. We continue with our outreach in New Hampshire stakeholders and communities as we identify and secure a route for those 40 miles and hope to announce such a route later this year. We are making solid progress in this effort. This process of identifying routes and providing stakeholders with time to review and comment has added about an additional 9 months to the siting process. That is why we now estimate that the construction will begin in early 2014.
As you may know, the U.S. Department of Energy environmental assessment process begins once a specific route is submitted. We applied last fall with the DOE, and they have left open the public comment period on the project so that the participants in the review process can comment on the route that we identified. The DOE will announce a consultant who will be working on the environmental data already collected for the lower 140 miles of the route. We expect this process to continue throughout this year and into 2012 as we advance through the siting process. Additionally, we will begin preparing our application for the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee once the northern 40 miles of the route are identified.
On June 28, we took another step forward on Northern Pass when we filed a special use application with the U.S. Forest Service to build approximately 10 miles of the Northern Pass project along our existing right-of-way corridor that runs through the White Mountain National Forest. 
PSNH developed this corridor more than 60 years ago and currently operates a 115-kV line there that serves customers north of the national forest. We are proposing to relocate the existing line and build the new 350-kV DC line in this corridor. We look forward to working with the forest service as it participates as a cooperating agency in the overall review of the project's Environmental Impact Statement. 
As a reminder, the project has a number of benefits for New Hampshire and the region. It is expected to add more than $25 million a year in local property tax revenue and add 1,200 construction jobs. We estimate it will reduce the region's wholesale electric cost between $200 million and $300 million annually, including at least $30 million that would accrue to New Hampshire, and reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 5 million tons a year.
Despite the later projected start of the construction in 2014, we continue to estimate that the project will cost about $1.1 billion, including in-stores 25% share. At the EEI conference in November, we will update our year-by-year capital expenditures projections for the Northern Pass to reflect the 2014 to 2016 projected construction period.
Turning from electric transmission to natural gas distribution. Yankee has completed about 76% of its $57.6 million Waterbury-to-Wallingford project. We continue to expect the project to enter service by November 1. And the DPUC rate decision allowed the entire project to be included in rates. In the rate decision, the DPUC also endorsed Yankee Gas's plan to significantly increase its capital spending by $25 million to $40 million annually to replace older cast iron and bare steel pipe. As Chuck noted earlier, we are not pleased with other aspects of the decision, and we will continue to focus on how we can more effectively manage the operation and maintenance resources at Yankee Gas to mitigate the impact of this decision on financial performance.
Yankee Gas sales continue to be strong in the second quarter, some of it related to cooler temperatures in April and May. Firm retail sales rose 18.4% in the first half of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. On a weather-adjusted basis, firm sales rose 6.6%. With housing starts still relatively low, a great deal of the increase sales is the result of new distributed generation coming online and fuel switching driven by high oil prices and low natural gas prices. Approximately 2/3 of this increase was a result of new distributed generation facilities coming into service.
For the second quarter, weather-adjusted commercial and industrial sales rose 25.7% and 11.2%, respectively, over 2010, primarily driven by the same factors. We also continue to see convergence in residential space, as evidenced by a 7.8% weather-adjusted increase in residential sales over second quarter 2010. This can be primarily attributed to increases in master-needed multifamily buildings converting from oil to gas.
Now what I'd like to do is to turn the phone call over to David."

Our results for the first half of 2011 reflect many of the same favorable trends we've seen since the middle of 2010. They include improving distribution results as rate increases and cost control measures have allowed our returns to recover from last year's low levels, favorable transmission earnings as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and a decline in the competitive business earnings as those businesses, particularly the Wholesale Marketing business, winds down in 2013. As a reminder, those results are now folded into our NU parent and other companies' business segments.
As Chuck noted earlier, we have raised the lower end of the distribution segment guidance in the NU consolidated guidance by $0.05, effectively raising the midpoint of NU's earnings guidance for the year.
Our new range of $2.30 per share to $2.40, excluding merger costs, reflect the results we have experienced in the first half of 2011. The warmer temperatures and storm expense we have experienced in July and our prospects for the balance of the year, including the progress we are making on our major projects particularly the Greater Springfield Reliability Project and PSNH's Clean Air Project. In fact, the progress we are making on our transmission program this year is expected to result in us earning toward the upper end of our transmission guidance. I will discuss our updated guidance in more detail shortly.
Overall, we earned $77.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 or $0.44 per share compared with $71.9 million or $0.41 per share in the second quarter of 2010. Over the first 6 months of 2011, we earned $191.4 million or $1.08 per share compared with earnings of $158.2 million or $0.90 per share in the first half of 2010. Excluding charges related to our merger with NSTAR, we earned $200.9 million or $1.13 per share in the first half of 2011, up nearly 25% over 2010.
Although we believe we are well positioned for a successful year, and you can see that in our adjustments to guidance, I recognize our results for the quarter fell a little short of consensus, some of that may be due to the fact that, last year, our competitive businesses added about $0.03 for the quarter versus breakeven this quarter. We believe other items are timing-related including PSNH rate case-related revenues and the pattern of transmission earnings where we see continued positive momentum for the second half of this year.
Our Transmission segment earned $42.4 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2011 compared with earnings of $41.9 million or $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2010.
Over the first 6 months of 2011, our Transmission segment earned $86.9 million or $0.49 per share compared with earnings of $82.1 million or $0.46 per share in the first half of 2010.
Improved year-to-date transmission results reflect our ongoing investment in a high-voltage grid that serves the region as well as our forward-looking fully-tracking transmission tariffs. We expect transmission earnings growth to accelerate over the coming quarters as we move into full construction mode on the Greater Springfield Reliability Project Lee mentioned a moment ago. Due to Greater Springfield and many smaller projects that are now under construction, our transmission rate base totaled $2.78 billion as of June 30, 2011, compared with $2.64 billion at June 30, 2010.
I know that some of you have noticed that CL&P's Transmission earnings were $2.1 million lower in the second quarter of 2011 than they were in the second quarter of 2010. This occurred even though CL&P's transmission rate base in the first half of '11 was about $2.15 billion, nearly 2% higher than it was in the first half of 2010. The reason for the decline in earnings is that we true up the many tracking features of our transmission tariff to coincide with the filing of our FERC Form 1 for the previous quarter, which is done in the second quarter each year. In 2011, that true-up resulted in a refund to our wholesale transmission customers, while in 2010, it resulted in incremental billings. That year-over-year change resulted in a decline in CL&P's second quarter Transmission earnings of $3.7 million from 2010 to 2011. We have no similar true-ups for the remainder of the year.
Overall, we remained very comfortable with our 2011 Transmission earnings guidance of 105 to 110. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we believe we'll earn toward the upper end of that range.
Turning to the Distribution business. We earned $40.3 million or $0.23 per share in the second quarter of '11 and $118 million -- excuse me, $118.5 million or $0.67 per share in the first half of 2011. This compared with earnings of $27.1 million or $0.15 per share in the second quarter of '10 and $75 million or $0.43 per share in the first half of 2010.
CL&P's Distribution segment earned $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $47.6 million in the first half of '11 compared with earnings of $8.4 million in the second quarter of '10 and $22.7 million in the first half of 2010. This improvement was due to a combination of strong cost controls and to the distribution rate decision we received last year, partially offset by higher pension and healthcare costs. That rate decision was approved a $63.4 million rate increase effective July 1, 2010, and an additional $38.5 million that was effective on July 1, 2011. As of June 30, 2011, CL&P's trailing 12-month distribution ROE was 9.8%. At this point in the year, we project a full regulatory ROE of about 9% for the year.
PSNH's Distribution/Generation segment earned $16 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $37.5 million in the first half of '11, compared with $16.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $28.1 million in the first half of 2010. PSNH benefited from this July 10 distribution rate increase in AFUDC earnings from the Clean Air Project, but those benefits were offset by higher pension and healthcare costs. Additionally, there were a number of relatively small onetime positive impacts in the second quarter of 2010 when PSNH concluded its rate case. Those positive impacts, which totaled about $3.85 million after tax, resulted from the fact that the final rate decision was retroactive since August 2009.
While we have the benefit of higher rates in the second quarter of 2011, we lost the benefit of those 2010, onetime impacts. As a result, PSNH's second quarter 2011 Distribution earnings were down by about $1 million from 2010. PSNH Distribution regulatory ROE, including Generation earnings, was 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11. We expect that level to decline over the last 2 quarters of the year and for PSNH's Distribution regulatory ROE to be approximately 9% for the year. This is primarily due to the roll-off of the recruitment period associated with PSNH's decision from last year. From mid-2010 through mid-2011, we recovered approximately $13.7 million from customers to recoup revenues that we would otherwise would have recovered from customers from August 1, '09  to mid-2010. With those dollars now fully recovered as of June 30, '11, our distribution rates declined last month by about $2.3 million on an annualized net basis.
The Western Massachusetts Electric. The Distribution segment earned $4 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $9.7 million in the first half of 2011 compared with $2.3 million in the second quarter of '10 and $5.2 million in the first half of 2010. The improvement was primarily due to the resolution of WMECO's distribution rate case earlier this year, partially offset by higher operating costs. WMECO's Distribution regulatory ROE was 6.5% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11, compared with an authorized return of 9.6%. We expect Western MEC's distribution ROE to increase to approximately 9% for the calendar year of 2011. Recall that, due to decoupling, which began 6 months ago, sales volumes have little impact on WMECO's earnings.
Overall, retail electric sales fell 1.3% in the second quarter of 2011 compared with the same period in 2010. The first half retail electric sales rose 0.9% in '11 compared with 2010. Weather-adjusted retail sales were down 0.9% in the second quarter of '11 and down 0.5% for the first half of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. This weather-adjusted sales decline, while somewhat more moderate than we have been experiencing in the past few years, is nevertheless a bit larger than the flat year-to-year weather-adjusted sale change we have projected at the start of the year. Within customer classes on a weather-adjusted basis, year-to-date residential and industrial sales were flat. The weakness we are seeing is in the commercial sector where sales were down 1.3%. 
It's a very different story on the natural gas side of the business, as Lee mentioned. For the year-to-date, Yankee Gas firm sales were up 18.4% and weather-adjusted firm sales were up 6.6%. Commercial industrial sales continue to benefit from increased migration of interruptible customers switching to firm rates. And just to be clear, these results and our views around sales for the balance of the year are incorporated into our updated guidance.
Yankee Gas earned $1.2 million in the second quarter of '11 and $23.7 million in the first half of '11 compared with a loss of $500,000 in the second quarter of 2010 and earnings of $19 million in the first half of '10. Yankee's sales increases were partially offset by higher operating costs, including higher pension and healthcare expenses.
Chuck mentioned earlier that, despite some constructive changes between the draft Yankee Gas rate decision and the final decision, the overall order was disappointing. The final decision resulted in a rate decrease of approximately $500,000, which was effective July 20, to be followed by a rate increase of about $6.7 million effective July 1, 2012.
While the PURA accepted our proposed capitalization ratio of 52.2% common equity and 47.8% debt, the authorized ROE of 8.83% is below what we think is a fair and reasonable return even in this economic environment. Also, the final decision disallowed firm rate base certain equipment that is now in-service, and serving customers, and disallowed recovery of wage increases for non-union personnel. It also lowered rates by $1.5 million in rate year one and $3 million in rate year 2 to reflect expected savings from our merger with NSTAR, which still awaits approval.
We've asked PURA to reconsider 3 specific issues contained in the final decision. One was the implication of merger savings; another, the inclusion of non-union wage increases in rates over the next 2 years; and the third, related to the correct regulatory treatment for deferred tax assets related to net operating losses associated with bonus depreciation. Together, these items totaled $3.6 million in rate year one and $6.1 million in rate year 2.
On August 2, yesterday, the PURA issued a draft decision granting our request to reconsider the deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses but denied our request to reconsider the imputation of merger savings and the exclusion of wage increases. If our request relating to the deferred tax asset is ultimately approved, it would amount to a pretax benefit of about $750,000 in the first rate year that begins this quarter and about $1.1 million in the second rate year, which begins in July 2012.
Yankee's regulatory ROE was 9.9% for the 12 months ended June 30, '11, but we expect that level to decline over the coming quarters as a result of the rate decision.
Turning from our regulated businesses, NU parent and other companies, we had net expenses of $5.2 million in the second quarter of 2011 and $14 million in the first half of 2011 compared with earnings of $2.9 million in the second quarter of '10 and $1.1 million in the first half of 2010. The 2011 results include $1.2 million of net expenses in the second quarter of '11 and $9.5 million of expenses in the first half of '11 related to the pending merger with NSTAR. Excluding those items, we recorded net expenses of $4 million in the second quarter of '11 or $0.03 per share. In the first half of '11, excluding expenses, we recorded net expense of $4.5 million, also $0.03 per share. As I mentioned earlier, the lower return in earnings this year are largely due to the wind-down of our wholesale business within our remaining competitive companies.
As I noted earlier, we raised the full of our earnings guidance for 2011. With the first half of the year now behind us, we are comfortable narrowing our Distribution and Generation segment earnings guidance to between $1.30 and $1.35 per share. We continue to project net expenses of about $0.05 per share in the parent and other businesses, excluding merger costs.
On a trailing 12-month basis, our earnings are $2.39 per share for the period ending June 30, 2011, excluding merger and 2010 NU parent tax settlement impact. As a heads-up, if there is a decline in trailing 12 months earnings over the balance of this year, we expect it will occur primarily in the third quarter. You may recall, that in 2010, we and many other utilities in the Northeast benefited from extremely warm third quarter temperatures. And while July '11 was indeed quite warm, we have not experienced and do not expect to experience the same number of cooling-free days we recorded in 2010.
Turning from earnings to debt assurances, balance sheet and cash flow. In May, we took advantage of strong demand for high-grade utility debt to sell $122 million of taxable PSNH first mortgage funds. The 10-year bonds carry a coupon of 4.05%, and the proceeds were used to redeem about $120 million or 6% tax-exempt bonds. We continue to expect PSNH to issue another $160 million of taxable bonds later this year and for WMECO to issue $100 million of senior unsecured notes.
We expect to benefit from S&P's decision on May 16 to raise all NU debt deferred stock ratings by one notch. That ratings action was based solely on NU's improved stand-alone credit profile. S&P maintained its credit watch positive rating on NU and our 4 regulated subsidiaries, subject to confirmation of our pending merger with NSTAR.
One key factor triggering that credit upgrade is our improving cash flow. Cash from operations after retirement of rate reduction bonds totaled approximately $652 million in the first half of 2011 compared with $405 million in the first half of 2010. Mostly as a result of that strong operating cash flow, our total debt level declined nearly $150 million in the first months of this year so our common equity levels rose by more than $100 million.
Total debt represented about 54.5% of our consolidated capital structure at the beginning -- at the end of June, well below the 60% level we have discussed for a number of years. Much of that improvement reflects the benefits from bonus depreciation for income tax purposes.
We continue to project full year cash flows from operations of between $900 million and $950 million this year after repayment of PSNH and WMECO rate reduction bonds. Five years ago, we were generating less than half that level of cash, and we believe that improvement underscores the continued financial strengthening of our company.

And at that time, they also directed us to propose various rate design mechanisms that could potentially address some of these migration issues. So that's really our next step, is to begin to work with the commission and make some proposals in the fall of this year."

We had made a statement when we set sort of direction for 2011, our guidance, that it was premised on a number of underlying assumptions that we try to bring current with the Street, and one of those is sales growth. And we have said general observation has been -- since 2005, we have seen demand disruption or negative load growth, if you will. This year, we actually had a little bit more optimism going into the year and thought that weather-adjusted sales would be flat. And we did see, right out of the blocks, some negative prints even though we had seen a little bit more favorable results, maybe in the spring. Our actual observation now and what we said in the call is weather-normalized sales were down 0.5%. So it's certainly better than the last 3 to 5 years of trend but not based on what we thought going into the year around projection. That said, the delta between flat sales and being down 0.5% is not a major earnings driver for this year. And as you know, our Massachusetts utility now has revenue decoupling, so it sort of neutralizes that issue. I think it's no surprise that we're going to stop short of calling for a double dip for sure, but no surprise that the New England economy and our economies have not reaccelerated in terms of growth, in terms of job creation, in terms of housing and the like. So you have more economic, sort of -- fundamentally more economic weakness than we might have hoped for 6 or 9 months ago. And I think, on top of that, you do see, and Lee mentioned this, you do see fuel switching, which means customers who are going to DG were losing electric load, although we have a nice hedge, and now we're picking up gas sales at Yankee Gas. So you're seeing that type of activity. And you are seeing policies that are trying to incent customers to move in that direction, whether it's large commercial customers or even smaller customers who are installing solar. And then I think, second, another fundamental trend, which I do not see sort of seizing by any means is states incenting utilities and providing more monies to fund conversation, load management and DR [ph] programs. In fact, you may know that, throughout New England, these programs have not only funded in rates by distribution companies but by proceeds from the Reg E option and proceeds by the FCM option. So there are monies flowing into demand response, and as the efficiency that are also putting downward pressure on our sales."

Un",1335,"Thanks, Jeff, and thank you all for coming this morning. My job is to officially welcome you. And I was supposed to be welcoming you with Chuck. He and I were going to do a tag team and tell you how excited we are to be in the red zone with our merger. Unfortunately, I don't feel like using both analogies today since our patriots got beat by the Giants last night. I also was going to apologize for getting you up so early in the morning, but if you have a room like I did with 7 screaming kids who are excited to see Mickey at 5:00 in the morning, you'll probably have been awake for a while also, but this is the way it goes. We do appreciate you sharing a little bit of your schedule with us today. We appreciate your interest. 
Chuck and I do appreciate not only your interest in, but your investment in our companies because in a couple of months, there will only be one. We will all be one happy family. The NSTAR investors will become part of that NU family, and so we're both looking forward to that day. So today, our team is going to talk to you on where we are, the status of our merger proceedings. I said we're in the red zone, we're getting close. And also I mention to you how our companies are doing at this stage. 
You've all heard us say this before, unfortunately, we said that a year ago and we hope that -- I think a year ago, I predicted that the merger would be complete by now. So we're a little disappointed it has taken us so long, but we all are very excited about this, and we believe that this is a compelling combination of 2 very successful companies. We think it's a little bit like peanut butter and jelly, or like 1+ 1 equals 3. We have a tremendously complementary strengths that are going to fit together very nicely. And most importantly, we're going to have the size and scale to achieve our goals. I'm really also excited about leading this new management team into the future. I think we all believe that our future is even brighter than our pasts.
And speaking about our pasts, both companies have a very strong history of earnings and dividend growth, and I think we all agree that that's very important in these days of turbulence that we've been going through in the marketplace. To have steady consistent growth is a key to making sure that we continue to have an attractive stock. Since this, hopefully, is the last time that I get to brag about NSTAR, I guess we'll be retiring that name and the New York Stock Exchange listing, which we've had for about 125 years, and I as its CEO for the last 18 years, I'd just like to say that we have operated on a very simple model. You probably all heard me say this before. We're focused on great service to our customers. We believe that translates into good, strong regulatory relationships. And you all know that relate regulatory relationships are the key to financial success on the long term.  We, at NSTAR, have enjoyed 20 consecutive years now of operating earnings growth, and we're quite proud of that. 
Our earnings picture for both companies has translated into great results for our shareholders. We've consistently outperformed our peers and the broader markets in general. For NSTAR, I know these numbers, they translate on a 10-year basis, an 11.8% annual average return, and while it's not on this chart, our 50-year return is 12.5% average annual return, which is the best in our industry or in industry for the last 15 years. Both management teams have consistently delivered for our shareholders. And so you can just imagine what this new team is going to do for you in the future. 
The merger approvals that we've been pursuing are falling in place. I won't go through all the elaborate list of all approvals we have. But we just have 2 left, the NRC and the Mass Public of Utilities. The NRC signoff we expect to occur later this month, and the DPU process will be the last one that we have left. We have finished our and reply briefs on Halloween, October 31. A little ironic, I guess. If the Commission were to deliberate and decide the case in a normal 60-day period, we could have an approval by year end. However, we do have one additional item to deal with there. There has been a DOER, Department of Energy Resource, an intervener in the proceedings that have asked the commission to consider a motion to stay the proceedings. It suggests, I guess, that the commission delay their decision on approving the merger and instead turn the merger proceedings into a proceedings. We will argue. All intervenors to get the chance to argue on November 17. We will argue that rate matters are beyond the scope of these proceedings and that we will agree to file for new rates next year when our current 7-year rate deal expires. We don't believe that the commission can actually turn a merger proceeding into a rate proceeding, but we will make our strong case on November 17. 
We present a very strong case for this merger. As you are probably aware, during the proceedings, the department changed the standard from a no-net harm standard to a net benefit standard. We presented a very strong case. David and Jim were our witnesses. So we expected the information they provide, they answered 1,000-data requests, which if I were to stack the books up, are but 10 feet tall. So there's a complete record and a very impressive record on the benefits to consumers and the environment that they will be extensive.
So before I turn it over to them, let me reiterate how excited I am about this combination and about our future. David McHale has been heading up our transition integration work and has done a great job. He tells me that our people are still excited. It's been very unique. I've never experienced anything quite like this, whether they're line men or people who are in our call centers or executives. They all stop me and congratulate me. And here it is a year later, and they're excited to be getting on what they like and moving forward. Throughout this integration process, we have gained lots of information on how each of the company does business. And David tells me that we can see lots of opportunities both to improve our service levels and reduce our costs. So we want to get on with the show. 
The combination, as I'm sure you all are aware, will strengthen our financial position and it will allow us to seamlessly on our vast infrastructure investments in capital plans. To date, the rating agencies have responded very, very well to this transaction. And as energy policy in the region, think we're larger, stronger. And we're going to be better able to help our regulators and state politicians to implement all the changes that are going to come with this new requirement of Massachusetts, the Green Communities Act. 
Before I turn it over to David and Jim, I would just like to tell you that we will not be providing guidance for the combined company today. We are, as I said earlier, in the final stages of our DPU approval process. When that's complete, I then will let the 2 of them get together and put the 2012 and further year plans together. At that time, we promise to hold an analyst day, and that will be shortly after the closing. And we will rollout our future and answer all the questions that I'm sure you want us to answer today instead. So with that, let me turn it over to David."

Now let me add my welcome and also a little bit of welcome from Lee and Chuck. I'm sure you can appreciate that. Job number one, remain storm restoration.

I'm sure you can appreciate that. Job number one, remain storm restoration. I know you appreciate that from Chuck's standpoint and from Lee's. They will commit to finishing the restoration effort and go every customer we still have a number of communities and a number of customers who have not been restored as of this morning. And perhaps, I would add also my household remains one of those, but that will be critically important that that's a major focus over the coming hours and coming days. But what I would like to do is provide the information that you're accustomed to seeing here both the Lee and Chuck. But I would tell you that echoing on some of Tom's comments, it's becoming increasingly outdated, if you will, to talk about the NU stand-alone story. We are on the eve of this merger, and there will be no NU standalone. there will be no NSTAR standalone. But what we have done here is to provide you the type of visibility into our capital and into our investment plan that you'll become accustomed to, but we will stop short NU standalone and what we talk about the prospects are for this company. And as Tom said, we are already looking at integrating these 2 companies operationally, strategically and thinking about how this management and leadership team come together. Now with that said, the capital plan that we have in front of you runs out through 2016, and so it's sort of a 5-year view. The cornerstone of that plan remains, for the large part, our Transmission business. And we've given the updated you not only by year, by segment but also in many respects, by project. so it's available to you and it's available by the book. It's about a $5.7 billion program overall, about $2.6 billion of which is our transmission program. I'm pleased to announce that we've added about $400 million investment spending to our transition plan and continue to invest in our distribution business. The distribution business is also very, very critical to the investment platform of this company. We will continue to invest in distribution, in the business making it as reliable as we can. We'll invest in our maintenance programs. We'll invest in the O&M and the like to drive the highest levels of that we can. There are a couple of the elements as well in the plan including some renewable spend in the Connecticut. I think you've seen earlier in the year where Connecticut pass legislation, Public Act 1180, that allows in up to 10 megawatts of renewables. it's not with respect to what technology. So I'll talk about that in a moment. 
We just drove down just a little bit with respect to transmission. These are the projects that you know and you've been following with respect to NEEWS. We are now aggressively into the first phase, as we'll talk. Northern Pass becomes and is a very, very key focus for us as well. I mentioned this earlier, $400 million of new spending driven by reliability and both on standard security, cyber security and the like, very, very critical not only for Northeast Utilities and we continue to focus on the policymaking at the FERC. We think the FERC is very supportive of transmission investment coming off the Energy Policy act of 2005. We do not see that changing. You all have seen FERC 1000. We think when ISO has done business and the way we plan to do business going forward. We are very encouraged by what we've seen from them in terms of new changes on resource allocation, on cost allocation, on transmission planning. you know talking with us in the past the ISO has a very open and very transparent planning process, the stakeholder process around cost allocation and transmission planning. We do not think that FERC 1000 will have profound impact in the way that we do business. We think it's supportive of the way we do business. 
Increasingly, you're also seeing the FERC being passed around ROEs, not so much incentives, but on the base ROE. And you may, as you follow this NU story, you may have seen recently, on September 30, a number of have filed a section 20026 complaint as the FERC challenging the base ROE, which is currently 11.14%. It dated back to about the 2006 timeframe. We feel very, very firmly that when that debate is over, which essentially will be a test of the FERC methodology that established the base ROE, that we will demonstrate, counter to the that New England rates, not only for NU and NSTAR, but all the on what that base ROE will, should be alike and inventor and in many, it's going to come down to the debate that you've seen unfold with other companies around what is the appropriate range of reasonableness and how do you measure the central tendency within that range of once you select a group of proxy companies. The has suggested that the number should not be 11.14% as it is today. It should be closer to 9.2%. we have filed sitting isn't that, you really use what is fairly FERC methodology, 11.14% as appropriate and that rates are just reasonable. 
In terms of the products themselves some, we have made tremendous, tremendous strides on the first leg of the NEEWS project, the greater Springfield reliability project is now almost 30% complete. We will drive that project through completion by the year 2013 and of the entire families here of opportunity projects, this represents more than half. So it's critically important to the driving 2012 growth into 2013, but that project now is in full swing. You'll hear us talk more and more about the second leg of this. The second leg is shown here in blue is Interstate Reliability Project. As it hits that Rhode Island, Connecticut Board our partner there is National Grid. But we plan to later this year, file citing applications in Connecticut and you will see us become more and more granular about that process that will unfold so that we can move forward and drive those investments and continue to support the reliability sites here of new England and the region. 
Following on that of course is the third leg which still needs a little bit more confirmation by the New England ISO in terms of specific projects, the specific year of NEEWS. We know that these suite of projects will be required. We are working with the New England ISO right now to confirm that data and once that date is confirmed, we'll translate that into specifically what we are building and when we are building, but we see that project which is roughly a $300 million project being required in the year 2017. I would tell you that all these projects, as we process through the course of the year with you in varies earnings calls after the change in their timing in the change in their timing and their cash patterns in terms of investments year by year it is all then refreshed and it is in your appendix right now. So if you're looking through your appendix, you will find those and sort of rebenchmark for you, including the Northern Pass project, which remains a $1.1 billion project. But as we push the timing for in-service out to 2016, we kept you current now on when year-by-year those moneys were being presented. We remain incredibly optimistic about this project. You know from conversations in the past, we feel about this is one of the most innovative ideas that we put in front of this 
[Audio Gap] 
remain very focused on the economic benefits and environmental benefits of this project, which we think is very, very carbon reduction and building a project that brings in low carbon power at market that will clear out that the mass some price, no subsidies and provide very, very attractive overall economics for the region and our customers. 
Moving on, here's both historic and a perspective view of what we stand on our transmission program. You'll recognize this chart certainly in terms of the historic perspective. A lot of that where we showed here in goal. This is southwest Connecticut projects. As you know, they're up and running, they're in service, they're generating cash flow but they are benefiting customers in a huge way with respect to the amount of congestion that our customers are no longer subjected to. hundreds of million of dollars of savings each and every day, each and every month in our customer bill. It's a very, very powerful project. Going forward, you can see that it's shift now in blue here, the non-NEEWS NEEWS and NPT project. I'm including the $400 million project of new and here is a recount policy will of the NEEWS project and of the the overall Northern Pass perspective $2.6 million going forward. And we show you later on in the appendix and some how that translates into rate base growth. 
You haven't seen this slide before, to give you a little bit more context on where we're spending capital on this plan said that New Hampshire is becoming increasingly an area of spend, strategically important to us. you can see where we have labored those in the in northern central area. And the southern areas of New Hampshire, the pockets of investment, whether it's new 115kV investment in phases, very critical that we get the reliability equation right there. Same is true of course, Berkshire and Massachusetts so we have this out for you separately. Again more detail on the appendix. Of these areas are receiving a lot of focus and a lot of attention as well in order to make sure that the system is robust, it's reliable and it is the backbone for moving wholesale power around New England as efficient as possible so that our customers are paying the best rates as possible. 
On the distribution side of the business, still very significant expenditures there. A couple of new items perhaps. One, you know from the past that we've had in our forecast investments in advanced metering, the AMI programs in Connecticut. Connecticut part of there's a new administration in Connecticut that I want to spend time understanding how AMI will benefit customers in the future and what time frame will make those investments happen. I think that likely those investments are still going to be made, but have taken them out of the forecast because I think there's more work to do. That's about the $217 million bell that. What we've also done, in part because of economic conditions, is look very carefully at the amount of new investments needed to meet new service, new customer growth and the like and no surprise, it's less. We don't see the level of customer growth that we've seen in fact, we're running under budget this year intentionally on the amount of new customer hookups and the like. I think what's most profoundly here is the amount of work we've done over the last of the year at how we're spending our money, how to optimize those money, how much technology can invest in the business to get the most return operational return off of our business. We've made great strides around reliability. We've made great strides around customer service by introducing technology. Even with respect to looking at now how those investments translated into customer favorability ratings. And I know that's going to tested by the storms both Irene and this snowstorm. but I think fundamentally, we've made making good progress there but then you year-over-year what we've said last year or even the prior versus now, you would see less distribution capital because of those reasons. Also because of extension, possibilities as we look at things like the vehicle and aging infrastructure. We think there's a very strong possibility that we'll get more life out of those assets if we are very protective of our maintenance programs, our corrective action programs and that we see as the big focus on our part day in and day out. 
Looking to the future as well, I think we see some exciting things there. This is not going to be an NU standalone future. This is going to be NU NSTAR combined company future. We are looking at the main things. On the renewable side, you know that we've investing in solar in Massachusetts. we've gone live with now with a 1.8-megawatt project. We're about to get live with our second 2.25 megawatt project, an Indian orchard. We're going to continue to invest in that phase and you'll see some capital in our plan allocated towards WMECO renewables. That's nothing you. What is new though is on the Republic Act 1180 in Connecticut, we will and have the ability to invest up to 10 megawatts. Some of that will look a lot like potentially the Massachusetts model. You'll see us shortly file a plan with the PURA and you can follow that as we proceed. But I think some of that will be in solar. Some of
 [Audio Gap] 
The past. But we still look to the future there about building additional transmission to bring renewables into the region. that has been our critical day-to-day focus over the last several months The merger has been a focus more recently of course the focus, but we're not taking our eye off our ability to really have an impact going forward, helping the region meet its renewable portfolio standard needs. 
In the middle of this page is our story around natural gas. It's a great story from an investment standpoint and from an economic standpoint. It's really a great story from our customers  There are a couple of graphics that I think demonstrates this. In terms of penetration, only about 31% of the homes in Connecticut were with natural gas. and If you stack that up against other New England states, New York and the New Jersey, it is by far the lowest degree of penetration. And we think our customers of some very, very attractive economics in front of them. And under some analysis, we suggest that it cost twice as much to heat your homes these days on fuel oil as natural gas. We are working with state policymakers on the energy side and even the federal policymakers to be thinking about driving policies towards making it easier for our customers to do the changeover. And we think that depending on those economics, we can pick up 50,000 55,000 customers, for Yankee. In fact, we could some level of expansion double the customer base of Yankee Gas alone. When you look at economics for household of say, 2,500 square feet. They spend about $3,300 a year on heating their homes. You could spend less than half of that if you converted to natural gas. Those customers who have natural gas now in their homes nut they're not heating on that, we think that's an out-of-pocket cost of $4,00 or $5,000. It's not a small amount money, but we think it's a 4 or 5-year payback. we are looking at ways to get more supply to the state. We've done that recently by the completion of our Waterbury to Wallingford project, that will bring more gas to more homes and more businesses. but we think there is the potential for that hundreds of million of dollars throughout to get natural gas to our customers. Now that said, even though we're bullish on this, we have not built that into the plan that you have in your book. So there's no vast expansion plan worked for Yankee Gas, but it's going to be a focus of ours because we think that this is a very compelling time for customers be looking to convert the natural gas. 
Let me turn our attention to now the financial. And the slide talks a little bit about NU's standalone. Obviously, we're reporting earnings as of last Friday as well. And we're very pleased with the NU financials. Our earnings year-to-date are up 12%. We continue to invest in our dividend. We continue to have a standalone ratio of about 50%. The credit conditions of this company is right now stellar and I think still improving. All that really is going to be brought to bear with the new company. So all of what you've began to understand and know about NU is still in great position, the cash flow of this company in terms of the cash flow being generated by our investment, as well as a casual being generated by bonus tracks appreciation. That will all accrue to the new company going forward and that kind of underlying strength from the capital program and the rate base program, the new you shareholders inherit all that as well. I won't dwell on this point, but when you looking at how we're doing year-to-date, and you'll hear me affirm our overall guidance 230 to 240, we are right on track. Earnings for year-to-date are up about 12.3%. Interestingly, not driven by transmission this year but driven by the distribution businesses. Even as we continue to invest in rate base growth, we have seen year-over-year increases across the board. If you peel back the onion here behind the scenes, our utilities have better now on average ROE performance than they've had in years. And that's up and down all these utilities including Connecticut. Massachusetts lag that a little bit, but if you look at the trajectory going forward a very positive story. Further behind the scene, we can have an interesting inflection point, maybe too early to tell in the third quarter around sales, whether normalized sales for the 9 months are actually half 0.5%. When we had our conference call around Q2, I shared with you that whether normalized sales were actually down about 0.5%. Our guidance was premised on flat sales, somebody asked me do see a reversal in trend normal negative or positive, absolutely not. I was wrong. It's positive and I'm not suggesting that we're seeing a trend here, but when you look at growth of the same point of growth on a non-manufacturing side in Massachusetts, we see some modest growth. in the New Hampshire, we see some positive growth. Even in New Hampshire kind of average hourly, workweek expanding little bit. We see good export growth in the Connecticut market. So there's a glimmer here and I'll be careful not to say trend wise because we are looking for longer term we still see about 0.5% load growth over the coming a half decade. 
On the guidance side, again, we'll reaffirm $230 million to $240 million consistent with Tom's remarks. We're not going to look forward as last year and share with you the standalone-s of 2012. I will affirm what we said earlier in the year about transmission. I think that's going to be on the higher side of this 105 to 110 but looking pretty good. And that's despite the fact, by the way that Hurricane Irene did take a bite of the financials just a little bit. We lost about 90 gigawatt hours of sales and there were some secondary impact including financing that storm that have taken a couple of pennies off of our earnings. 
I just want to update you quickly on the financing front. We have, every couple of months, you see us sending out a note on financing activities, but wanted to summarize this for you both on new money so you see at the top of the page and as we built our rate base and investment program has issued collectively over a $250 million of new money, I was pleased to see that the western map 10-year 3.5% coupon is as one financial Newswire reported the second lowest ever BBB category bond issuance. So I haven't scrubbed every single one of those, but I've seen at least one of the newswires report that. Either way, this is quite beneficial for our customers as we take advantage of this low-coupon environment. Also have some opportunities on the financing side as well, specifically for our around some of the tax money. As you can see we have taken out the 5.85% coupon, refied that some long dated, some short but that should set us up for; $6 million to $7 million of interest savings next year alone. So a really good play and looking forward a little bit, we got the maturity coming up for NU parent if we're to refi that today or out today, you see 7.25 % coupon could get down at substantially less. And with NU on an upward trajectory with a ratings endpoint, we are quite that NU parent has an interest savings down the road as well. 
Let me just kind of finish up by summarizing the capital program. we've shown you pieces and parts. This is not only a summary of distribution and transmission stock on top of each other, to $5.7 billion. But we compared to last year. The program in total is down from last year. It's a different time frame as 2011 is going to roll off and we introduced the 2012. A lot of that explained by distribution, a lot of that's explained by AMI. But the very focused with what's happening on the transmission space still a very good story. I want to give you some comfort that in your appendix, you have a lot of your detail to show you year-by-year how this all plays out for those of you who don't want to run back to your desk modeling. And then lastly, when you look at the rate base equivalent of that, here rate base that continues to grow to north of $11 billion. When you look at the overall compounded annual growth rate of let's say transmission as an example, that's still quite robust at 10% even updating for the year 2007 -- 2010. So I think it gives you a very good prospect and perspective on what type of growth we're going to bring to this combined company going forward and one of sort of the ankle points of this business of this merger is our ability to invest capital on behalf of our customers. At this point, let me turn the podium over to my colleague and partner Jim Judge."
292525,142111965,187243,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2011",2011-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, David. Good morning. I'm thrilled to see the crowd here. It looks like standing room only. I appreciate you showing up especially at such an early hour. As Bob both Tom and David indicated. Chuck and Lee are taking care of priority number one,",2057,"Thank you, David. Good morning. I'm thrilled to see the crowd here. It looks like standing room only. I appreciate you showing up especially at such an early hour. As Bob both Tom and David indicated. Chuck and Lee are taking care of priority number one, which is the final storm cleanup and restoration is in place. David did a great job  Chuck and the side which they normally cover. I'm not going to touch on 4 areas fairly briefly. The first is the third quarter results, year-to-date results for NSTAR. Second, I'm going to talk about transition projects that NSTAR has in progress. Third, most of a lot of familiar faces here, most of you are familiar with the NSTAR story, but I have 2 slides that will give you the perspective that we have on the job that we've been doing for our investors and customers. And finally, I'll wrap up with a few more insights on the merger proceeding in Massachusetts.
Earnings for the third quarter excluding merger related costs and there were actually 2 onetime items last year at NSTAR, we've excluded them. So an apples-to-apples comparison, we are $0.94 in the third quarter. That's $0.01 higher than we were in last year, it's higher than S&P liquid expectations. Despite the unfavorable weather in the third quarter, we actually had some very positive items that has an impact. Transmission revenues, contributed $0.04. We will continue to invest in that aspect of our business. We are recovering lost based revenue since we increased our spending on energy efficiency, we're entitled to recoup the revenues that are lost, spread them around the customer base. Those lost base revenues actually contributed $0.03 to the quarter, and $0.01 came from our unregulated telecommunications operations. A couple of factors that offset most positive items. We did see a 2.1% decline in sales in the third quarter, largely driven by weather. The cooling degree days were down 3% from a year ago, and so that cost is about $0.05.
And finally, interest, property taxes and higher O&M, each of those 3 items negative impact our earnings by $0.01 for the quarter. So I'm pleased with the results for the quarter, as I am with our year-to-date results, which we live on the next slide.
For 9 months, earnings for the company were to $2.12 compared to $2.07, $0.05. Several positive items, again transition revenue continues to contribute to the bottom line, gave us $0.07 year-to-date. We also experienced $0.04 pickup from the gas business, driven by a very cold first quarter. I guess sales were up 11% year-to-date. As I mentioned, this recovery of lost base revenues contributed $0.04 year-to-date to earnings, and then we have 4 letter items, each of them is worth $0.03 year-to-date. We've seen a decline in interest costs, take advantage, as David mentioned, we've advantage of the low-cost interest environment as well. Got some refinancings. We also had a lower share count this year. We had a buyback a year ago and so that contributed about $0.03 to the comparison. In 2010, we had a onetime item. That had to do with the regulatory true up of our transition charge. That was a item that we don't have this year. Again, the unregulated telecommunications business gave us $0.03. So a lot of moving pieces in there. The bottom line is earnings up $0.05 for the 3-quarter point. Those are the items. Negatively impacting them, we sold the District Energy business a year ago, so those operating earnings are no longer in the mix. O&M cost of $0.07 year-to-date and then the modest decline that we have in sales year-to-date, which is really 0.3% and depreciation of property tax combined, they cost is about $0.08. So on a combined basis, we're very -- through 9 months, we're pleased with where we are. We continue to be confident and comfortable with our standalone guidance, which is between $2.60 and $2.75 for the year. 
I want to make a couple of comments about the Massachusetts economy. When we were here a year ago, the unemployment in Massachusetts was 8.4%. Today, it's down to 4% -- 7.4%. Nationally, the trend has been positive as well, it's far less significant. The national number a year ago was 9.6%, down to 9.1% today. So and continues to improve. So recent numbers came out in terms of GDP growth, Massachusetts growth on an annual basis for the last quarter was just under 4% compared to the national numbers, which are 2.5%. I think that's the fifth consecutive quarter actually Massachusetts has outpaced the rest of the country. 
A couple of comments on transmission projects at NSTAR, we have actually doubled our transmission rate base over the last 5 years. If you look at the projects that we have on the horizon for the next 5 years, it would double again. We spent on average about $100 million a year on baseline reliability and capacity investments. We have a significant project, the Cape Cod Line that's 31-mile line, 345 kV line over the Cape Cod Canal. and hearing at the concluded back in July. In fact the briefing period has been to conclude as well in the August, so we do anticipate a decision a decision board by the end of this year or certainly early next year. Project cost is about $120 million, and again, assuming timely approval from the state, we do think that we can bring the project in by year end 2012. 
Other major projects we have is a mid-Cape project, which basically will extend the benefits of that line further down the Cape. There's some upgrading and constructing of 115 kV lines that will reduce really the load risk in the mid-Cape area. And that project is also in the regional plan. We have a new project, the Boston 345 kV connection, which basically bridges the north and south parts of the city, really to address some circuit limitations that we can foresee occurring in the near future. So that project could be in the mix over the next 2 years, and obviously, our share of the Hydro-Qu√©bec Northern Pass project that David talked about earlier, our share of that is $280 million. 
I mentioned in my comments that there's really  2 sides I want to get some perspective on NSTAR. This is on the customer's perspective. We are really a company that's driven by metrics. We have been for years. When you look at the key customer performance metrics, in the areas of reliability in things like number at length of outages, when you look at the customer service measures around meter reading, round billing, around call center performance, NSTAR has really consistently, for several years now, be a top quartile performer in our industry in every one of those measures. So it is nice to see the customer satisfaction scores really validating that strong performance. As you know, J.D. Powers conducts these customer satisfaction surveys every year, and we start improvements this year, again, on both NSTAR Electric and NSTAR gas. For NSTAR Electric, the ranking has actually improved now for consecutive year. we may be the only utility in the country that can make that claim. We ow the highest ranking of any major utility from Boston all the way down to Washington, D.C. area. NSTAR Gas, we are ranked number one in the east mid-sized utility region, kind of a similar story of steady climb since 2006. In fact the last 3 years, we've ranked number three, number two, number one. So customer demand and expectations are always increasing storms that we've experienced. But it's rewarding to see that these high scores, really reflects those strong customer commitment that we have among our 3,000 employees everyday. Well the one side on the customer story from an investor perspective is the one slide. The left slide really deals with financial performance, the right side financial condition. Our financial performance over this 15-year time period is really number one in the industry for 1.5 decade that actually reflects as CEO. Certainly, a challenging 15 years when you think back, industry restructuring 2 mergers in here, certainly several economic downturn, but we have consistently outperformed the group and outperformed the market overall. The right side shows financial conditions. Also number one in the industry, that strong credit quality is obviously allowed is continuous access to low-cost capital low-cost borrowing costs that really benefit our customers every day. This merger provides a great opportunity for us to continue that commitment to excellent customer service, to strong financial performance and to a very healthy credit quality. 
Both Northeast Utilities and NSTAR have very active energy efficiency development and implementation programs. For many years, at NSTAR, we'd spend about $50 million on energy efficiency. That stepped up to $75 million in 2009, and actually, it's been $180 million this year and over $200 million next year. Just last month, Massachusetts took the number 1 spot in the country really in terms of rankings on energy efficiency efforts. This is a national energy efficiency counsel that ranks the states and Massachusetts actually surpassed California now. We have made progress on addressing the state's renewable portfolio standards. We've executed 3 contracts at very low cost, approved by DPU, for over 100 megawatts and NU has made the commitment the merger proceedings to advance the climate change agenda. We have agreed to target increased energy efficiency. We've agreed to own and contract additional solar and to build on an electrical vehicle pilot initiative that NU has in and introduce it to the Boston area. As Tom indicated, only 2 approvals spending. We have the NRC approval, which we anticipate this month. The DPU, the hearings were completed in July. The briefing period was completed at the end of October. Typically, it's a 2-month process. We would hope for an order so we do anticipate an order within the next couple of months. The merits of our filing address these environment of concessions that we mentioned, but also get into some details in terms of those savings for customers. We have a mid-benefit analysis that anticipate customers will save $784 million over 10 years. That number goes to $5.7 billion over 40 years. That 40-year horizon is a that in the past DPU has looked at to asses the merits of merger benefits. In July, as Tom mentioned, the state agency, called Department of Energy Resources, this filed a motion to the merger proceedings. Basically, looking for supplemental information in 3 areas. Progress on the merger integration, any rate changes from the merger and more on potential climate change impacts. We trust that the DPU will deny the DOER have motion. We will have an opportunity to comment on it. Certainly, a stay would jeopardize, minimum delay today, the mini merger benefits that we've discuss with the state, benefits to our customers benefits for the states, benefits for the region. Tom indicated all arguments have now been put up to November 17th. That will allow the companies and intervenors to try to resolve issue, limit some of the issues that are pending a that motion. And after those oral arguments, we do anticipate an order out of the DPU within a couple of months. 
So some final thoughts on this last slide before we open it up for questions. We have 2 highly successful companies, very similar strategies and expertise and great opportunities ahead of us. I think we have made a very clear record before the department that demonstrates our compliance with the net benefit standard that is the rule in Massachusetts now. We have evidence, significant customer savings, significant environmental accretion and the building PATH project alone is a project -- when that project is completed, it is the equivalent of removing 800,000 vehicles off the road on a daily basis. So it's great environmental advantages of this transaction moving forward to invest if you think is combined entity combine investment opportunity. And I would like to reiterate other close that we are very enthusiastic about the merger, very confident that we will have the approvals in here over the next couple of months. We do have time for some questions. I think Jeff Kotkin should come out and join us."

This year, the reverse trend was not to be so optimistic as to think that the economy was coming around that we didn't predict a double dip recession either. And for the first 6 months of the year, maybe the first 7 months of the year, we were sort of seeing a little disappointment relative to that. We were seeing sort of declines, whether normalize across all the classes of customers. And again, this inflection point that I discussed, we saw coming out of August and September, even in the troughs of Tropical Storm Irene is some growth and the growth was among all of our companies, all 3 customers companies and then also within each of the classes difficult into each of this quarter-by-quarter or thereabout, but when we look at this, what we say is we know there continues to be a drag on sales because of energy efficiency. So there are good things, we'll doo it the right answer to customers but it is evident more and more client organic sales. Also distributed generation. We know too that, that is moving the middle of a little bit. I saw some statistics that sort of going forward just sort of out 500,00 megawatt hours every year typically as customers are installing solar and the like. So what's driving that needle. When we looked at it, we saw that there was neutralizing for that maybe about 1% to 1.5% real growth because of economic factors that is you are seeing a little bit more manufacturing. You are seeing a little bit more consumer confidence. there was actually a tick up in New England consumer confidence. I'm not suggesting that customers as ready to start spending off their moneys but we saw that as a metric. We also prices are substantially lower from customers look at a standard offer rate right now that for many of our company including NSTAR have at a 7 handle it versus a $0.10 and $0.11 product. And that is going to put the drives on sales. So we're seeing those combination. Whether it's sustainable or not, not so sure. I said to you to the group that we look forward and look at maybe 0.05% electric growth, maybe 2.5% to 3% natural gas growth. We'll look at his pretty closely, but we do know that from a fundamental standpoint, we're going to see we're going to continue to invest in NSTAR in energy efficiency, but we will see some economic growth over the next 2 to 3 years. I don't want to get widely optimistic on that, but we do see growth emerging there."

My job is to officially welcome you. And I was supposed to be welcoming you with Chuck. He and I were going to do a tag team and tell you how excited we are to be in the red zone with our merger. Unfortunately, I don't feel like using both analogies today since our Patriots got beat by the Giants last night. I also was going to apologize for getting you up so early in the morning, but if you had a room like I did with 7 screaming kids, who are excited to see Mickey at 5:00 in the morning, you'll probably have been awake for a while also, but this is the way it goes. We do appreciate you sharing a little bit of your schedule with us today. We appreciate your interest. 
Chuck and I do appreciate not only your interest in, but your investment in our companies because in a couple of months, there will only be one. We will all be one happy family. The NSTAR investors will become part of the NU family, and so we are both looking forward to that day. So today, our team is going to talk to you about where we are, the status of our merger proceedings. I said we're in the red zone, we're getting close. And also I mentioned to you how our companies are doing at this stage. 
You've all heard us say this before, unfortunately, we said that a year ago and we hope that -- I think a year ago, I predicted that the merger would be complete by now. So we're a little disappointed it has taken us so long but we all are very excited about this, and we believe that this is a compelling combination of 2 very successful companies. We think it's a little bit like peanut butter and jelly, or like 1+ 1 equals 3. We have a tremendously complementary strengths that are going to fit together very nicely. And most importantly, we're going to have the size and scale to achieve our goals. I'm really also excited about leading this new management team into the future. I think we all believe that our future is even brighter than our pasts.
And speaking about our pasts, both companies have a very strong history of earnings and dividend growth, and I think we all agree that that's very important in these days of turbulence that we've been going through in the marketplace. To have steady consistent growth is a key to making sure that we continue to have an attractive stock. Since this, hopefully, is the last time that I get to brag about NSTAR, again, we'll be retiring that name in the New York Stock Exchange listing, which we've had for about 125 years, and I as its CEO for the last 18 years, I'd just like to say that we have operated on a very simple model. You probably all heard me say this before. We're focused on great service to our customers. We believe that translates into good, strong regulatory relationships. And you all know that regulatory relationships are the key to financial success on the long term.  We, at NSTAR, have enjoyed 20 consecutive years now of operating earnings growth, and we're quite proud of that. 
Our earnings picture for both companies has translated into great results for our shareholders. We've consistently outperformed our peers and the broader markets in general. For NSTAR, I know these numbers, they translate to, on a 10-year basis, an 11.8% average annual return, and while it's not on this chart, our 50-year return is 12.5% average annual return, which is the best in our industry or any industry for the last 15 years. Both management teams have consistently delivered for our shareholders. And so you can just imagine what this new team is going to do for you in the future. 
The merger approvals that we've been pursuing are falling in place. I won't go through this elaborate list of all the approvals we have. But we just have 2 left, the NRC and the Mass Department of Public Utilities. The NRC sign-off we expect to occur later this month and the DPU process will be the last one that we have left. We have finished our briefs and reply briefs on Halloween, October 31, a little ironic, I guess. If the Commission were to deliberate and decide the case in a normal 60-day period, we could have an approval by year end. 
However, we do have one additional item to deal with there. There has been a DOER, Department of Energy Resource, an intervener in the proceedings that has asked the Commission to consider a motion to stay the proceedings. It suggests, I guess, that the Commission delay their decision on approving the merger and instead turn the merger proceedings into a rate proceedings. We will argue, all intervenors get the chance to argue on November 17. We will argue that rate matters are beyond the scope of these proceedings and that we will agree to file for new rates next year when our current 7-year rate deal expires. So we don't believe that the Commission can actually turn a merger proceeding into a rate proceeding but we will make our strong case on November 17. 
We present a very strong case for this merger. As you are probably aware during the proceedings, the department changed the standard from a no-net harm standard to a net benefit standard. We presented a very strong case. David and Jim were our witnesses. So we expected the information they provided, they answered 1,000 data requests, which if I were to stack the books up are about 10 feet tall. So there is a complete record and a very impressive record on the benefits to consumers and the environment that they will be extensive.
So before I turn it over to them, let me reiterate how excited I am about this combination and about our future. David McHale has been heading up our transition integration work and has done a great job. He tells me that our people are still excited. It's been very unique. I've never experienced anything quite like this, whether they're line men or people who are in our call centers or executives. They all stop me and congratulate me. And here it is a year later, and they're excited to be getting on with their life and moving forward. Throughout this integration process, we have gained lots of information on how each of the companies does business. And David tells me that we can see lots of opportunities both to improve our service levels and reduce our costs. So we want to get on with the show. 
The combination, as I'm sure you all are aware, will certainly strengthen our financial position and it will allow us to seamlessly implement on our vast infrastructure investments and capital plans. To date, the rating agencies have responded very, very well to this transaction. And as energy policy abounds in the region, I think we're larger, stronger. And we are going to be better able to help our regulators and state politicians to implement all the changes that are going to come with the new requirements of Massachusetts, the Green Communities Act. 
Before I turn it over to David and Jim, I would just like to tell you that we will not be providing guidance for the combined company today. We are, as I said earlier, in the final stages of our DPU approval process. When that's complete, I then will let the 2 of them get together and put the 2012 and further year plans together. At that time, we promise to hold an analyst day and that will be shortly after the closing. And we will roll out our future and answer all the questions that I'm sure you want us to answer today instead. So with that, let me turn it over to David."
292525,142111965,187244,"Northeast Utilities, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 07, 2011",2011-11-07,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Tom. Now let me add my welcome and also a little bit of welcome from Lee and Chuck. I'm sure you can appreciate that. Job number one remain storm restoration.

I'm sure you can appreciate that. Job number one remain storm restoration. I know you appreciate it from Chuck's standpoint and from Lee's. They will commit to finishing the restoration effort until every customer remains on. We still have a number of communities and a number of customers who have not been restored as of this morning. And perhaps, I would sort of that add also my household remains among one of those but it'll be critically important that, that remains our focus over the coming hours and the coming days. 
But what I'd like to do is provide the information that you're accustomed to seeing here both with Lee and Chuck. But I would tell you that echoing on some of Tom's comments, it's becoming increasingly outdated, if you will, to talk about the NU standalone story. We are on the eve of this merger, and there will be no NU standalone. there will be no NSTAR standalone. But what we have done here is to provide you the type of visibility into our capital and into our investment plan that you've become accustomed to but we will stop short of talking about NU standalone. We will, at length, talk to you about what we think the prospects are for this company. And as Tom said, we are already looking at integrating these 2 companies operationally, strategically and thinking about how this management and leadership team come together in the future.
Now that said, the capital plan that we have in front of you runs out through 2016. It's a sort of a 5-year view. The cornerstone of that plan remains, for the large part, our Transmission business. And we've given you, and updated you, not only by year, by segment but also in many respects, by project. So that is available to you and it's available in the book. It's about a $5.7 billion program overall, about $2.6 billion of which is our Transmission program. 
I'm pleased to announce that we've added about $400 million of investment spending to our Transmission plan and continue to invest in our Distribution business. The Distribution business is also very, very critical to the investment platform of this company. We will continue to invest in Distribution, in the business, making it as reliable as we can. We'll invest in our maintenance programs. We'll invest in O&M and the like, to drive the highest levels of reliability that we can. There are a couple of new elements as well in the plan, including some renewable spend in the Connecticut. I think you've seen earlier in the year where Connecticut passed a new energy legislation, Public Act 11-80, that allows us to invest in up to 10 megawatts of renewables. It's not pre-scripted with respect to what technology, so I'll talk about that in a moment. 
We drove down just a little bit with respect to Transmission. These are the projects, of course, that you know and you've been following with respect to NEEWS. We are now moving very aggressively into the first phase, as we'll talk about in a moment. Northern Pass becomes and is a very, very key focus for us as well. I mentioned this earlier, $400 million of new spending driven by reliability and both on a New York standard security, cyber security and the like, very, very critical not only for Northeast Utilities but all utilities that are in this transmission state. And we continue to focus on the policymaking at the FERC as well.
We think the FERC is very supportive of transmission investment coming off the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We do not see that changing. You all have seen the FERC Order 1000. We think that is very supportive of the way the New England ISO has done business and the way we plan to do business going forward. We are very encouraged by what we've seen from them in terms of new changes on resource allocation, on cost allocation, on transmission planning. You know from talking with us in the past that the ISO has a very open and transparent planning process, the stakeholder process around cost allocation and transmission planning. We do not think that FERC Order 1000 will have a real profound impact in the way that we do business. We think it's supportive of the way we do business. 
Increasingly, you're also seeing the FERC being pressed around ROEs, not so much incentives, but on the base ROE. And you may, as you follow this NU story, you may have seen where recently, on September 30, a number of complainants have filed a Section 206 complaint at the FERC, challenging the base ROE, which is currently 11.14%. It dates back to about the 2006 timeframe. We feel very, very firmly that when that debate is over, which essentially will be a test of the FERC methodology that establishes the base ROE, that we will demonstrate, counter to the complainants that New England rates, not only for NU and NSTAR, but for all transmission owners are, in fact, just and reasonable.
But there will be a protracted discussion and debate, if you will, on what that base ROE will be, should be, is going to be like, and in many respect, it is going to come down to a debate that you've seen unfold with other companies around what is the appropriate range of reasonableness and how do you measure the central tendency within that range of reasonableness once you select a group of proxy companies. The complainants has suggested that the number should not be 11.14% as it is today. It should be closer to 9.2%. We have filed testimonies saying it's in fact, you really use what is fairly codified FERC methodology, 11.14% is appropriate and that rates are just and reasonable. 
In terms of the products themselves, we have made tremendous, tremendous strides on the first leg of the NEEWS projects. The Greater Springfield Reliability Project is now almost 30% complete. We will drive that project through completion by the year 2013, and of the entire family of companies here or opportunity [ph] projects, this represents more than half. So it's critically important for driving 2012 growth into 2013, but that project now is in full swing. You'll hear us, by the way, talk more and more about the second leg of this. The second leg is shown here in blue it's the Interstate Reliability Project. As it hits that Rhode Island, Connecticut border [ph] our partner there is National Grid. But we plan to, later this year, file citing applications in Connecticut and you'll see us getting more and more granular about that process that will unfold, so that we can move forward and drive those investments and continue to support the reliability criteria of New England and the region. 
Following on that, of course, is the third leg which still needs a little bit more confirmation by the New England ISO in terms of specific projects, the specific year of NEEWS. We know that these suite of projects will be required. We are working with the New England ISO right now to confirm that day and then once that date is confirmed, we'll translate that into specifically what are we building and when are we building, but we see that project which is roughly a $300 million project being required in the year 2017. 
I would tell you that all these projects, as we process through the course of the year with you on various earnings calls, as for the change in their timing and their cash patterns and in terms of the investments year-by-year, it is all then refreshed and it's in your appendix right now. So if you're looking through your appendix, you will find those and sort of we benchmark for you, including the Northern Pass project, which remains a $1.1 billion project. But as we push the timing for in-service out to 2016, we've kept you current now on when year-by-year those moneys were being spent. We remain incredibly optimistic about this project. You know from conversations in the past, we feel as though this is one of the most innovative ideas that we put in front of this 
[Audio Gap] 
remain very focused on the economic benefits and the environmental benefits of this project, which we think are really tremendous in terms of carbon reduction and building a project that brings in low carbon power at market that will clear out a mass sub-price, no subsidy and provide very, very attractive overall economics for the region and our customers. 
Moving on, here's a both the historic and a perspective view of what we spend on our Transmission program. You'll recognize this chart certainly in terms of the historic perspective, a lot of that where we showed here in gold, this is Southwest Connecticut projects. As you know, they're up and running, they're in service, they're generating cash flow but they are benefiting customers in a huge way with respect to the amount of congestion that our customers are no longer subjected to. Hundreds of million of dollars of savings each and every day, each and every month in our customer bills. It's a very, very powerful project. Going forward, you can see that it's shift to in blue here, the non-NEEWS and NPT project. I'm including the $400 million of new project and here is the re-cash flow, if you will, of the NEEWS project and of the the overall Northern Pass perspective $2.6 billion going forward. And we show you later on, I think, in the appendix and in somewhat magnitude [ph] how that translates into rate base growth. 
You haven't seen this slide before, but to give you a little bit more context on where we're spending capital on this plan, and we said to you that New Hampshire is becoming increasingly an area of spend, strategically important to us, you can see where we have labeled both in the northern and central area, and in the southern areas of New Hampshire, the pockets of investment, whether it's new 115kV investment in single phases, and like, very critical that we get the reliability equation right there, same is true of course, in the Berkshire of Massachusetts, so we have carved this out for you separately. Again more detail in the appendix. But these areas are receiving a lot of focus and a lot of attention as well in order to make sure that the system is robust, it's reliable and it is the backbone for moving wholesale power around New England as efficiently as possible so that our customers are paying the best rates possible. 
On the distribution side of the business, still very significant expenditures there. A couple of new items perhaps. One, you know from the past that we've had, in our forecast, investments in advanced metering, the AMI programs in Connecticut. Connecticut's put a little bit of a pause under that, on that. There's a new administration in Connecticut that I think wants to spend time understanding how AMI will benefit customers in the future. In what time frame will we make those investments, I believe it is likely those investments are still going to be made, but we have taken them out of the forecast because I think there's more work to do. That's about a $217 million delta. 
What we've also done, in part because of the economic conditions, is look very carefully at the amount of new investments needed to meet new service, new customer growth and the like and no surprise, it's less. We don't see the level of customer growth that we've seen in fact, we're running under budget this year intentionally on the amount of new customer hookups and the like. But really, I think what's most profound here is the amount of work we've done over the last year to look at how we're spending our money, how to optimize those moneys, how much technology to invest in the business to get the most return, operational return, off of our business. 
We've made great strides around reliability. We've made great strides around customer service by introducing technology. Even with respect to looking at now how those investments have translated into customer favorability ratings, and I know that's going to tested by the storms both Irene and this snowstorm, but I think fundamentally, we've been making great progress there but when you peer in to year-over-year of what we've said last year or even the prior versus now, you'll see less distribution capital because of those reasons. Also because of life extension, possibilities, as we look at things like vehicle and aging infrastructure. We think there's a very strong possibility that we'll get more life out of those assets if we are very protective of our maintenance programs, our corrective action programs and that we see as the big focus on our part day in and day out. 
Looking to the future as well, I think we see some exciting things there. But this is not going to be an NU standalone future. This is going to be an NU NSTAR combined company future. We are looking at many of the same things. But on the renewable side, you know that we've been investing in solar in Massachusetts. We've gone live with a 1.8-megawatt project. We're about to go live with our second 2.2  megawatt project, which is referred to as Indian Orchard. We're excited about that. We're going to continue to invest in that phase and you'll see some capital in our plan allocated towards WMECo renewables. That's nothing new. What is new, though, is on the Republic Act 11-80 in Connecticut, we will and have the ability to invest up to 10 megawatts. Some of that will look a lot like, potentially, the Massachusetts tool [ph] model. You'll see us shortly file a plan with the Connecticut PURA and you can follow that as we proceed. But I think some of that will be certainly be in solar. Some of that will be
 [Audio Gap] 
the past. But we still look to the future there about building additional transmission to bring renewables into the region. And arguably that hasn't been our critical day-to-day focus over the last several months. The merger has been a focus more recently, of course, this [indiscernible] has been the focus, but we're not taking our eye off our ability to really have an impact going forward, helping the region meet its renewable portfolio standard needs. 
In the middle of this page is our story around natural gas. It's a great story from an investment standpoint and from an economic standpoint, it's a really great story from our customers' standpoint. There are a couple of graphics here that I think demonstrates this. In terms of just penetration, only about 31% of the homes in Connecticut heat with natural gas. And If you stack that up against other New England states, New York and New Jersey, it is by far the lowest degree of penetration. And we think that our customers have some very, very attractive economics in front of them. And under some analysis, we suggest that it cost twice as much to heat your home these days on fuel oil as natural gas. 
We are working with state policymakers on the energy side, on even the federal policymakers to be thinking about driving policies towards making it easier for our customers to do the changeover. And we think that depending on those economics, we could pick up 50,000 55,000 customers, for Yankee. In fact we could, under some level of expansion double the customer base of Yankee Gas alone. When you look at the economics for household of, let's say, 2,500 square feet. They spend about $3,300 a year on heating their homes. You could spend less than half of that if you converted to natural gas. So those customers who have natural gas now in their homes but are not heating on that, we think that's an out-of-pocket cost of $4,00 or $5,000. It's not a small amount money, but we think it's a 4 or 5-year payback. We are looking at ways to get more supply into the state. We've done that recently by the completion of our Waterbury to Wallingford project, that will bring more gas to more homes and more businesses. But we think there is the potential for hundreds of million of dollars of investment throughout Connecticut to get natural gas to our customers. 
Now that said, even though we're very bullish on this, we have not built that into the plan that you have in your book. So there's not this, this really vast expansion plan for Yankee Gas, but it's going to be a focus of ours because we think that this is a very compelling time for customers to be looking to convert to natural gas. 
Let me turn our attention to now the financials. And this slide does talk a little bit about NU standalone. Obviously, we're reporting earnings as of last Friday as well. And we're very pleased with the NU financials. Our earnings year-to-date are up 12%. We continue to invest in our dividend. We continue to have a standalone payout ratio of about 50%. The credit conditions of the company is right now is stellar and I think still improving. All that really is going to be brought to bear with the new company. So all of what you've began to understand and know about NU is still in great position, the cash flow of this company in terms of the cash flow being generated by our investment, as well as the cash flow being generated by bonus tax appreciation, that will all accrue to the new company going forward and that kind of underlying strength on capital program and the rate base program, the new shareholders inherit all that as well. 
I won't dwell on this point, but when you look at how we're doing year-to-date, I mean you'll hear me affirm our overall guidance $2.30 to $2.40, we are right on track. Earnings for year-to-date are up about 12.3%. Interestingly, not driven by Transmission this year but driven by the Distribution businesses. Even as we continue to invest in rate base growth, we have seen year-over-year increases across the board. If you peel back the onion here behind the scenes, our utilities have better now on-average ROE performance than they've had in years. And that's up and down all the utilities, including Connecticut. 
Massachusetts lags that a little bit, but if you look at the trajectory going forward, a very positive story. Further behind the scenes, we had a kind of an interesting inflection point, maybe too early to tell in the third quarter around sales, weather normalized sales for the 9 months are actually up 0.5%. 
When we had our conference call around Q2, I shared with you that weather normalized sales were actually down about 0.5%. Our guidance was premised on flat sales, somebody asked me, ""Do you ever see a reversal in trend, where you can actually go normalized, normal negative or positive?"" I said, ""Absolutely not."" Okay, I was wrong. It's positive and I'm not suggesting that we're seeing a trend here but when you look at growth of the same point of growth on the non-manufacturing side in Massachusetts, we see some positive growth. In New Hampshire, we see some positive growth. We see even in New Hampshire kind of average hourly, workweek expanding a little bit. We see good export growth in the Connecticut market. So there's a glimmer here but I'll be careful not to say trend wise, this is what we're looking for, longer term we still see about 0.5% load growth over the coming half decade. 
On the guidance side, again, we'll reaffirm $2.30 to $2.40. Consistent with Tom's remarks we are not going to look forward, as last year, and share with you the standalones of 2012. I will affirm what we said earlier in the year about Transmission. I think that's going to be on the higher side of this 105 to 110 but looking pretty good. And that's despite the fact, by the way that Hurricane Irene did take a bite out of the financials, just a little bit. We lost about 90 gigawatt hours of sales and there were some secondary impact, including financing that storm that have taken a couple of pennies off of our earnings. 
[Audio Gap]
I just want to update you quickly on the financing front. We have, every couple of months, we've been sending out a note on some financing activities but wanted to summarize this for you both on new money. So you see at the top of the page PSNH and what amount as we built out rate base and the investment program, has issued collectively over $250 million of new money, I was pleased to see that the Western Mass 10-year 3.5% coupon is, as one financial newswire reported, the second lowest ever BBB category bond issuance. So I haven't scrubbed every single one of those, but I've seen at least one of the newswires report that. Either way, this is really quite beneficial for our customers, as we take advantage of this low-coupon environment. 
Also have some opportunities on the refinancing side as well, specifically for Connecticut around some of our tax-exempt money. As you can see we have taken out a 5.85% coupon, re-fi that some long dated, some short but that should set us up for $6 million to $7 million of interest savings next year alone. So a really good play and looking forward a little bit, we've got the maturity coming up for NU parent if we're to re-fi that today or hedge that out today, you can see that 7.25 % coupon can get down at substantially less. And with NU on an upward trajectory with a ratings standpoint, we are quite optimistic  that NU parent has an interest savings down the road as well. 
Let me just kind of finish up by summarizing the capital program. We've shown you pieces and parts. This is really a summary of not only Distribution and Transmission stack on top of each other, the $5.7 billion program. But we compared it to last year. As I've said, the program in total is down from last year. It's a different time frame as 2011 is going to roll off and we introduced the 2012. A lot of that explained by distribution, a lot of that's explained by AMI. But be very focused on what's happening within the transmission space, still a very good story. And I want to give you some comfort that in your appendix, you have a lot of the detail to show you year-by-year how this all plays out for those of you who want to run back to your desk and do some modeling. 
And then lastly, when you look at the rate base equivalent of that, here's a rate base that continues to grow to north of $11 million. When you look at the overall compounded annual growth rate of, let's say, Transmission as an example, that's still quite robust at 10% even updating for the year 2010. So I think it gives you a very good prospect and perspective on what type of growth we're going to bring to this combined company going forward and that one of the real sort of anchor point of our program and of this merger is our ability to invest capital on behalf of our customers. At this point, let me turn the podium over to my colleague and partner, Jim Judge."

I appreciate you showing up especially at such an early hour. As both Tom and David indicated. Chuck and Lee are taking care of priority number one, which is the final storm cleanup and restoration is sort of taking place. I thought David did a great job pitching in for Chuck and David -- for Chuck and Lee on the slides that they normally cover. 
I'm going to really touch on 4 areas fairly briefly. The first is the third quarter results, year-to-date results for NSTAR. Second, I'm going to talk about Transmission projects that NSTAR has in progress. Third, most, a lot of familiar faces here, most of you are familiar with the NSTAR story, but I have 2 slides that will briefly give you the perspective that we have on the job that we've been doing for our investors and customers. And finally, I'll wrap up with a few more insights on the merger proceeding in Massachusetts.
Earnings for the third quarter with excluding merger-related costs and there were actually 2 onetime items last year at NSTAR, we've excluded them. So an apples-to-apples comparison, we are $0.94 in the third quarter. That's $0.01 higher than we were last year, it's been higher than the Street's expectations. Despite the unfavorable weather in the third quarter, we actually had some very positive items that had an impact. Transmission revenues, contributed $0.04. We will continue to invest in that aspects of our business. 
We are recovering lost based revenue since we increased our spending on energy efficiency, we're entitled to recoup the revenues that are lost, spread them around the rest of the customer base. Those lost base revenues actually contributed $0.03 to the quarter, and $0.01 came from our unregulated telecommunications operations. A couple of factors that offset most positive items. We did see a 2.1% decline in sales in the third quarter, largely driven by weather. The cooling degree days was down 3% from a year ago, and so that cost us about $0.05.
And finally, interest, property taxes and higher O&M, each of those 3 items negatively impacted our earnings by $0.01 for the quarter. So I'm pleased with the results for the quarter, as I am with our year-to-date results, which we have on the next slide.
For 9 months, our earnings for the company were $2.12 compared to $2.07, 1 year ago, up $0.05. Several positive items, again Transmission revenue continues to contribute to the bottom line, gave us $0.07 year-to-date. We also experienced a $0.04 pick-up from the Gas business, Gas driven by a very cold first quarter, I guess, sales were up 11% year-to-date. As I mentioned, this recovery of lost base revenues contributed $0.04 year-to-date to earnings, and then we have 4 other items, each of them were worth $0.03 year-to-date. We've seen a decline in interest costs, taken advantage, as David mentioned, we've taken advantage of the low-cost interest environment as well. We've done some refinancings. We also have a lower share count this year. We did a share buyback 1 year ago and so that contributed about $0.03 to the comparison. 
In 2010, we had a onetime item that had to do with a regulatory true up of our transition charge. That was a [indiscernible] item that we don't have this year. Again, the unregulated Telecommunications business gave us $0.03. So a lot of moving pieces in there. The bottom line is earnings up $0.05 at the 3-quarter point. Those for the pricing of items, negatively impacting them, we sold the district energy business a year ago. So those operating earnings are no longer in the mix, O&M cost of $0.07 year-to-date and then the modest decline that we have in sales year-to-date, which is only 0.3% and depreciation of property tax combined, they cost us about $0.08. So on a combined basis, we're very -- through 9 months, we're pleased with where we are. We continue to be confident and comfortable with our standalone guidance, which is between $2.60 and $2.75 for the year. 
I want to make a couple of comments about the Massachusetts economy. When we were here 1 year ago, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts was 8.4%. Today, it's down to 4% -- 7.4%. Nationally, the trend has been positive as well, it's far less significant. The national numbers 1 year ago was 9.6%, down to 9.1% today. So Massachusetts is faring well and continues to improve. Some recent numbers came out in terms of GDP growth, Massachusetts' growth on an annual basis for the last quarter was just under 4% compared to the national numbers, which are 2.5%. I think that's the fifth consecutive quarter actually Massachusetts has outpaced the rest of the country. 
A couple of comments on Transmission projects at NSTAR, we have actually doubled our Transmission rate base in the last 5 years. And if you look at the projects that we have on the horizon for the next 5 years, it would double again. We spent, on average, about $100 million a year on baseline reliability and capacity investments. We have a significant project, the Cape Cod Line that's a plan, that's a 31-mile line, 345 kV line over the Cape Cod Canal, and evidentiary hearings at the Siting Board in Massachusetts concluded back in July. In fact the briefing period has been concluded as well in August. So we do anticipate, hope for, a decision from the Siting Board by the end of this year or certainly early next year. Project cost is about $120 million and again, assuming timely approval from the state, we do think that we can bring the project in by year end 2012. 
Other major projects we have is a Mid Cape project, which basically will extend the benefits of that line further down the Cape. There's some upgrading and constructing of 115 kV lines that will reduce really the load risk in the Mid Cape area. And that project is also in the regional plan. We have a new project, the Boston 345kV connection, which basically bridges the north and south parts of the city, really to address some circuit limitations that we can foresee occurring in the near future. So that project could be in the mix over the next 2 years. And obviously, our share of the Hydro-Qu√©bec Northern Pass project that David talked about earlier, our share of that is $280 million. 
I mentioned in my comments that there's really  2 sides I want to give a perspective on NSTAR. This is the one on the customers' perspective. We are really a company that's driven by metrics, we have been for years. When you look at the key customer performance metrics, in the areas of reliability and things like number of outages and length of outages, when you look at the customer service measures around meter reading, around billing, around call center performance, NSTAR has really consistently, for several years now, been a top quartile performer in our industry, in every one of those measures. 
So it is nice to see the customer satisfaction scores really validating that strong performance. As you know, J.D. Power conducts these customer satisfaction surveys every year, and we start improvements this year, again, on both NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas. For NSTAR Electric, the ranking has actually improved now for 6 consecutive years. We may be the only utility in the country that can make that claim. We have now the highest ranking really of any major utility from Boston all the way down to Washington, D.C. area. 
NSTAR Gas, we are ranked number one in the east mid-sized utility region, kind of a similar story of steady climb since 2006. In fact the last 3 years, we've ranked Number 3, Number 2, Number 1. So customer demands and expectations are always increasing, no more evidenced than with the more recent storms that we've experienced. But it is rewarding to see that these high scores, which really reflects the strong customer commitment that we have among our 3,000 employees everyday. 
Well, the one slide on the customer story from an investor perspective is the one slide. The left side really deals with financial performance, the right side financial condition. Our financial performance over this 15-year time period is really number one in the industry for 1.5 decade, a fact that actually reflects Tom's tenure as CEO. Certainly, a challenging 15 years when you think back, industry restructuring, there's 2 mergers in here, certainly several economic downturns, but we have consistently outperformed the group and outperforms the market overall. 
The right side shows financial condition. Also number one in the industry, that strong credit quality has obviously allowed us continuous access to low-cost, capital low-cost borrowing costs that really benefit our customers every day. This merger provides a great opportunity for us to continue that commitment to excellent customer service, to strong financial performance and to a very healthy credit quality. 
Both Northeast Utilities and NSTAR have very active energy efficiency development and implementation programs. For many years, at NSTAR, we'd spend about $50 million a year on energy efficiency. That stepped up to $75 million in 2009, and actually, we'll spend $180 million this year and over $200 million next year. Just last month, Massachusetts took the number 1 spot in the country, really, in terms of rankings on energy efficiency efforts. This is a national energy efficiency counsel that ranks the states and Massachusetts actually surpassed California now. 
We have made progress on addressing the state's renewable portfolio standards. We've executed 3 contracts at very low cost, it's been approved by DPU for over 100 megawatts and NU and NSTAR are making commitments to this merger proceedings, to advance the climate change agenda. We have agreed to target increased energy efficiency. We've agreed to own and contract additional solar and to build on an electrical vehicle pilot initiative that NU has in Connecticut, basically they introduce it into the Boston area. 
As Tom indicated, only 2 approvals pending. We have the NRC approval, which we anticipate this month. The DPU, the hearings were completed in July. The briefing period was completed at the end of October. Typically, it's a 2-month process. We would hope for an order so we do anticipate an order within the next couple of months. The merits of our filing address these environmental concessions that we mentioned, but also get into some details in terms of the savings for customers. We have a mid-benefit analysis that anticipate at the cost, customers will save $784 million over 10 years. That number grows to $5.7 billion over 40 years. That 40-year horizon is a time frame that's in the past the Mass DPU has looked at to asses the merits of merger benefits. 
In July, as Tom mentioned, the state agency called Department of Energy Resources, they filed a motion to stay the merger proceedings. Basically, looking for supplemental information in 3 areas: progress on the merger integration; any rate changes from the merger; and more on potential climate change impacts. We trust that the DPU will deny the DOER motion. We will have an opportunity to comment on it. Certainly, a stay would jeopardize, or at a minimum delay the many merger benefits that we've discussed with the state, benefits to our customers, benefits for our state and benefits for the region. Tom indicated all arguments have now been put up to November 17. That will allow the companies and the intervenors to try to resolve or issue, or limit some of the issues that are pending in that motion. And after those oral arguments, we do anticipate an order out of the DPU within a couple of months. 
So some final thoughts on this last slide before we open it up to questions. We have here 2 highly successful companies, very similar strategies and expertise, it's a great opportunities ahead of us. I think we have made a very clear record before the department that demonstrates our compliance with the net benefit standard that is the rule in Massachusetts now. We have evidence, significant customer savings, significant environmental accretion and the currently building path project alone is a project -- when that project is completed, it is the equivalent of removing 800,000 vehicles off the road on a daily basis. So there's great environmental advantages of this transaction moving forward for investments, we think, this combined entity provides great investment opportunity. And I like to -- I'd just reiterate as I close, that we are very enthusiastic about the merger, very confident that we will have the approvals in here over the next couple of months. We do have time for some questions. I think Jeff Kotkin should come up and join us."

This year, the reverse trend was not to be so optimistic as to think that the economy was coming around that we didn't predict a double dip recession either. And for the first 6 months of the year, maybe the first 7 months of the year, we were sort of seeing a little disappointment relative to that. We were seeing sort of declines weather normalized across all classes of customers. And then, this inflection point that I discussed, we saw coming out of August and September, even in the troughs of Tropical Storm Irene is some growth and the growth was among all of our companies, all 3 customers, companies and then also within each of the classes and it's difficult, it's appeared into each of this factors, quarter-by-quarter or thereabout, so when we look at this, what we'd say is we know there continues to be a drag on sales because of energy efficiency program. Those are good things, we'll do, it's the right answer to the customers but it is having off more and more client organic sales. Also distributed generation. We know too that, that is moving the needle a little bit. I saw some statistics today that talks about going forward, just sort of cost out 500,00 megawatt hours every year, typically, as customers are installing solar and the like. So what's driving that needle? When we looked at it we saw that there was about neutralizing for that, there was about maybe 1% to 1.5% real growth because of the economic factors that is you are seeing a little bit more manufacturing. You are seeing even a little bit more consumer confidence. There was actually a pick-up in New England consumer confidence. I'm not suggesting that customers are ready to go out and start spending off their moneys but we saw that as a metric. We also know that prices are substantially lower from and that from an elasticity standpoint, customers look at a standard offer right now that for many of our companies, including NSTAR, had a 7 handle, versus a $0.10 and $0.11 product. And that is going to put the drives on sales. So we're seeing that combination. Whether it's sustainable or not, not so sure. I said to the group that we look forward and look at maybe 0.05% electric growth, maybe 2.5% to 3% natural gas growth. We'll look at this pretty closely, but we do know that from a fundamental standpoint, we're going to continue to see DG, we're going to continue to invest in energy efficiency, until we see some economic growth over the next 2 to 3 years. I don't want to get widely optimistic on that, but we do see some growth emerging there."

Un",1345,"Thanks, Jeff, and thank you all for coming this morning. My job is to officially welcome you. And I was supposed to be welcoming you with Chuck. He and I were going to do a tag team and tell you how excited we are to be in the red zone with our merger. Unfortunately, I don't feel like using both analogies today since our Patriots got beat by the Giants last night. I also was going to apologize for getting you up so early in the morning, but if you had a room like I did with 7 screaming kids who were excited to see Mickey at 5:00 in the morning, you'll probably have been awake for a while also, but this is the way it goes. We do appreciate you sharing a little bit of your schedule with us today. We appreciate your interest. 
Chuck and I do appreciate not only your interest in, but your investment in our companies, because in a couple of months, there will only be one. We will all be one happy family. The NSTAR investors will become part of the NU family, and so we are both looking forward to that day. So today, our team is going to talk to you about where we are, the status of our merger proceedings. As I said, we're in the red zone, we're getting close. And also I mentioned to you how our companies are doing at this stage. 
You've all heard us say this before.  Unfortunately, we said it a year ago, and we hope that -- I think a year ago, I predicted that the merger would be complete by now. So we're a little disappointed it's taken us so long, but we all are very excited about this, and we believe that this is a compelling combination of 2 very successful companies. We think it's a little bit like peanut butter and jelly, or like 1 + 1 equals 3. We have tremendously complementary strengths that are going to fit together very nicely. And most importantly, we're going to have the size and scale to achieve our goals. I'm really also excited about leading this new management team into the future. I think we all believe that our future is even brighter than our pasts.
And speaking about our pasts, both companies have a very strong history of earnings and dividend growth, and I think we all agree that that's very important in these days of turbulence that we've been going through in the marketplace. To have steady, consistent growth is a key to making sure that we continue to have an attractive stock. Since this, hopefully, is the last time that I get to brag about NSTAR, again, we'll be retiring that name in the New York Stock Exchange listing, which we've had for about 125 years, and I as its CEO for the last 18 years.  I'd just like to say that we have operated on a very simple model. You've probably all heard me say this before. We're focused on great service to our customers. We believe that translates into good, strong regulatory relationships. And you all know that regulatory relationships are the key to financial success on the long term.  We at NSTAR have enjoyed 20 consecutive years now of operating earnings growth, and we're quite proud of that. 
Our earnings picture for both companies has translated into great results for our shareholders. We've consistently outperformed our peers and the broader markets in general. For NSTAR, I know these numbers, they translate to, on a 10-year basis, an 11.8% average annual return, and while it's not on this chart, our 15-year return is 12.5% average annual return, which is the best in our industry, or any industry, for the last 15 years. Both management teams have consistently delivered for our shareholders. And so you can just imagine what this new team is going to do for you in the future. 
The merger approvals that we've been pursuing are falling in place. I won't go through this elaborate list of all the approvals we have. But we just have 2 left, the NRC and the Mass Department of Public Utilities. The NRC sign-off we expect to occur later this month, and the DPU process will be the last one that we have left. We have finished our briefs and reply briefs on Halloween, October 31, a little ironic, I guess. If the Commission were to deliberate and decide the case in a normal 60-day period, we could have an approval by year end. 
However, we do have one additional item to deal with there. There has been a DOER, Department of Energy Resource, an intervener in the proceedings, that has asked the Commission to consider a motion to stay the proceedings. It suggests, I guess, that the Commission delay their decision on approving the merger and instead turn the merger proceedings into a rate proceedings. We will argue, all intervenors get the chance to argue on November 17, we will argue that rate matters are beyond the scope of these proceedings and that we will agree to file for new rates next year when our current 7-year rate deal expires. So we don't believe that the Commission can actually turn a merger proceeding into a rate proceeding, but we will make our strong case on November 17. 
We present a very strong case for this merger. As you are probably aware during the proceedings, the department changed the standard from a no-net-harm standard to a net-benefit standard. We presented a very strong case. David and Jim were our witnesses. So we expect that the information they provided -- they answered 1,000 data requests, which, if I were to stack the books up, are about 10 feet tall. So there is a complete record and a very impressive record on the benefits to consumers and the environment that they will be extensive.
So before I turn it over to them, let me reiterate how excited I am about this combination and about our future. David McHale has been heading up our transition integration work and has done a great job. He tells me that our people are still excited. It's been very unique. I've never experienced anything quite like this.  Whether they're linemen or people who are in our call centers or executives, they all stop me and congratulate me. And here it is a year later, and they're excited to be getting on with their life and moving forward. Throughout this integration process, we have gained lots of information on how each of the companies does business. And David tells me that we can see lots of opportunities both to improve our service levels and reduce our costs. So we want to get on with the show. 
The combination, as I'm sure you all are aware, will certainly strengthen our financial position, and it will allow us to seamlessly implement on our vast infrastructure investments and capital plans. To date, the rating agencies have responded very, very well to this transaction. And as energy policy avowals [ph] in the region, I think we're larger, stronger. And we are going to be better able to help our regulators and state politicians to implement all the changes that are going to come with the new requirements of Massachusetts, the Green Communities Act. 
Before I turn it over to David and Jim, I would just like to tell you that we will not be providing guidance for the combined company today. We are, as I said earlier, in the final stages of our DPU approval process. When that's complete, I then will let the 2 of them get together and put the 2012 and further-year plans together. At that time, we promise to hold an analyst day, and that will be shortly after the closing. And we will roll out our future and answer all the questions that I'm sure you want us to answer today instead. 
So with that, let me turn it over to David."

I'm sure you can appreciate that. Job number one remain storm restoration. I know you appreciate that from Chuck's standpoint and from Lee's, they will commit to finishing the restoration effort until every customer remains on. We still have a number of communities and a number of customers who have not been restored as of this morning. And perhaps, I would sort of that add that also my household remains among one of those, but it'll be critically important that, that remains our focus over the coming hours and the coming days. 
But what I'd like to do is provide the information that you're accustomed to seeing here, both with Lee and Chuck. But I would tell you that echoing on some of Tom's comments, it's becoming increasingly outdated, if you will, to talk about the NU standalone story. We are on the eve of this merger, and there will be no NU standalone. There will be no NSTAR standalone. But what we have done here is to provide you the type of visibility into our capital and into our investment plan that you've become accustomed to.  But we will stop short of talking about NU standalone. We will, at length, talk to you about what we think the prospects are for this company. And as Tom said, we are already looking at integrating these 2 companies operationally, strategically and thinking about how this management and leadership team come together in the future.
Now that said, the capital plan that we have in front of you runs out through 2016. It's a sort of a 5-year view. The cornerstone of that plan remains, for the large part, our Transmission business. And we've given you and updated you not only by year, by segment, but also in many respects by project. So that is available to you, and it's available in the book. It's about a $5.7 billion program overall, about $2.6 billion of which is our Transmission program. 
I'm pleased to announce that we've added about $400 million of investment spending to our Transmission plan and continue to invest in our Distribution business. The Distribution business is also very, very critical to the investment platform of this company. We will continue to invest in Distribution, in the business, making it as reliable as we can. We'll invest in our maintenance programs. We'll invest in O&M and the like to drive the highest levels of reliability that we can. There are a couple of new elements as well in the plan, including some renewable spend in Connecticut. I think you've seen earlier in the year where Connecticut passed a new energy legislation, Public Act 11-80, that allows us to invest in up to 10 megawatts of renewables. It's not pre-scripted [ph] with respect to what technology, so I'll talk about that in a moment. 
We drove down just a little bit with respect to Transmission. These are the projects, of course, that you know and you've been following with respect to NEEWS. We are now moving very aggressively into the first phase, as we'll talk about in a moment. Northern Pass becomes and is a very, very key focus for us as well. I mentioned this earlier, $400 million of new spending driven by reliability and both on New York [ph] standard security, cyber-security and the like.  Very, very critical not only for Northeast Utilities, but all utilities that are in this transmission state. And we continue to focus on the policymaking at the FERC as well.
We think the FERC is very supportive of transmission investment coming off the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We do not see that changing. You all have seen the FERC Order 1000. We think that is very supportive of the way the New England ISO has done business and the way we plan to do business going forward. We are very encouraged by what we've seen from them in terms of new changes on resource allocation, on cost allocation, on transmission planning. You know from talking with us in the past that the ISO has a very open and transparent planning process, the stakeholder process around cost allocation and transmission planning. We do not think that FERC Order 1000 will have a real profound impact in the way that we do business. We think it's supportive of the way we do business. 
Increasingly, you're also seeing the FERC being pressed around ROEs, not so much incentives, but on the base ROE. And you may, as you follow this NU story, you may have seen where recently, on September 30, a number of complainants have filed a Section 206 complaint at the FERC challenging the base ROE, which is currently 11.14%. It dates back to about the 2006 timeframe. We feel very, very firmly that when that debate is over, which essentially will be a test of the FERC methodology that establishes the base ROE, that we will demonstrate, counter to the complainants, that New England rates, not only for NU and NSTAR, but for all transmission owners are, in fact, just and reasonable.
But there will be a protracted discussion and debate, if you will, on what that base ROE will be, should be, is and the like, and in many respects, it is going to come down to a debate that you've seen unfold with other companies around what is the appropriate range of reasonableness in how do you measure the central tendency within that range of reasonableness once you select a group of proxy companies. The complainants have suggested that the number should not be 11.14% as it is today. It should be closer to 9.2%. We have filed testimony saying if, in fact, you really use what is a fairly codified FERC methodology, 11.14% is appropriate and that rates are just and reasonable. 
In terms of the products themselves, we have made tremendous, tremendous strides on the first leg of the NEEWS projects. The Greater Springfield Reliability Project is now almost 30% complete. We will drive that project to completion by the year 2013, and of the entire family of companies here, or, excuse me, projects, this represents more than half. So it's critically important for driving 2012 growth into 2013.  But that project now is in full swing. You'll hear us, by the way, talk more and more about the second leg of this. The second leg is shown here in blue.  It's the Interstate Reliability Project. As it hits that Rhode Island, Connecticut border, our partner there is National Grid. But we plan to, later this year, file siting applications in Connecticut, and you'll see us getting more and more granular about that process that will unfold so that we can move forward and drive those investments and continue to support the reliability criteria of New England and the region. 
Following on that, of course, is the third leg, which still needs a little bit more confirmation by the New England ISO in terms of the specific projects, the specific year of NEEWS. We know that these suite of projects will be required. We are working with the New England ISO right now to confirm that date, and then once that date is confirmed, we'll translate that into specifically what are we building and when are we building?  But we see that project, which is roughly a $300 million project, being required in the year 2017. 
I would tell you that all these projects, as we've talked through the course of the year with you on various earnings calls, as for the change in their timing and their cash patterns in terms of the investments year-by-year, it is all then refreshed and it's in your appendix right now. So if you're looking through your appendix, you will find those, then, sort of re-benchmarked for you, including the Northern Pass project, which remains a $1.1 billion project. But as we push the timing for in-service out to 2016, we've kept you current now on when, year-by-year, those moneys will being spent. We remain incredibly optimistic about this project. You know from conversations in the past we feel as though this is one of the most innovative ideas that we put in front of this 
[Audio Gap] 
remain very focused on the economic benefits and the environmental benefits of this project, which we think are really tremendous in terms of carbon reduction and building a project that brings in low carbon power at market that will clear out a mass sub-price, no subsidy and provide very, very attractive overall economics for the region and our customers. 
Moving on, here's a both a historic and a prospective view of what we spent on our Transmission program. And you'll recognize this chart.  Certainly in terms of the historic perspective, a lot of that, what we show here in gold, is the Southwest Connecticut projects. As you know, they're up and running, they're in service, they're generating cash flow but they are benefiting customers in a huge way with respect to the amount of congestion that our customers are no longer subjected to. Hundreds of million of dollars of savings each and every day, each and every month in our customer bills. It's a very, very powerful project. Going forward, you can see that a shift to, in blue here, the non-NEEWS and NPT projects. I'm including the $400 million of new projects.  In here is the re-cash-flow, if you will, of the NEEWS project and of the overall Northern Pass perspective.  $2.6 billion going forward. And we show you later on, I think, in the appendix and in some of my materials how that translates into rate-base growth. 
You haven't seen this slide before, but to give you a little bit more context on where we're spending capital on this plan, and we said to you that New Hampshire is becoming increasingly an area of spend, strategically important to us, you can see where we have labeled both in the northern and central area, and in the southern areas of New Hampshire, the pockets of investment, whether it's new 115kV, investment in synchrophasers and the like, very critical that we get the reliability equation right there.  Same is true, of course, in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, so we have carved this out for you separately. Again, more detail in the appendix. But these areas are receiving a lot of focus and a lot of attention as well in order to make sure that the system is robust, is reliable and it is the backbone for moving wholesale power around New England as efficiently as possible so that our customers are paying the best rates possible. 
On the distribution side of the business, still very significant expenditures there. A couple of new items, perhaps. One, you know from the past that we've had in our forecast investments in advanced metering, the AMI programs, in Connecticut. Connecticut's put a little bit of a pause under that, on that. There's a new administration in Connecticut that I think wants to spend time understanding how AMI will benefit customers in the future. In what time frame will we make those investments?  I believe it is likely those investments are still going to be made, but we have taken them out of the forecast because I think there's more work to do. That's about a $217 million delta. 
What we've also done, in part because of the economic conditions, is look very carefully at the amount of new investments needed to meet new service, new customer growth and the like.  And no surprise, it's less. We don't see the level of customer growth that we've seen.  In fact, we're running under budget this year intentionally on the amount of new-customer hookups and the like. But really, I think what's most profound here is the amount of work we've done over the last year to look at how we're spending our money, how to optimize those moneys, how much technology to invest in the business to get the most return, operational return, off of our business. 
We've made great strides around reliability. We've made great strides around customer service by introducing technology. Even with respect to looking at now how those investments have translated into customer favorability ratings, and I know that's going to tested by the storms, both Irene and this snowstorm.  But I think fundamentally, we've been making great progress there.  But when you peer in to, year-over-year, what we've said last year or even the prior versus now, you'll see less distribution capital because of those reasons. Also because of life extension possibilities, as we look at things like vehicle and aging infrastructure, we think there's a very strong possibility that we'll get more life out of those assets if we are very protective of our maintenance programs, our corrective action programs, and that we see as a big focus on our part, day in and day out. 
Looking to the future as well, I think we see some exciting things there. But this is not going to be an NU standalone future. This is going to be an NU NSTAR combined company future. We are looking at many of the same things. But on the renewables side, you know that we've been investing in solar in Massachusetts. We've gone live now with a 1.8-megawatt project. We're about to go live with our second 2.2 megawatt project, which is referred to as Indian Orchard. We're excited about that. We're going to continue to invest in that space, and you'll see some capital in our plan allocated towards WMECo renewables. That's nothing new. What is new, though, is under Public Act 11-80 in Connecticut, we will and have the ability to invest up to 10 megawatts. Some of that will look a lot like, potentially, the Massachusetts solar model. You'll see us shortly file a plan with the Connecticut PURA, and you can follow that as we proceed. But I think some of that will be certainly be in solar. Some of that will be
 [Audio Gap] 
the past. But we still look to the future there about building additional transmission to bring renewables into the region. And arguably, that hasn't been our critical day-to-day focus over the last several months. The merger has been a focus.  More recently, of course, this storm has been a focus.  But we're not taking our eye off our ability to really have an impact going forward helping the region meet its renewable portfolio standard needs. 
In the middle of this page is our story around natural gas. It's a great story from an investment standpoint and from an economic standpoint.  It's a really great story from our customers' standpoint. There are a couple of graphics here that I think demonstrate this. In terms of just penetration, only about 31% of the homes in Connecticut heat with natural gas. And if you stack that up against other New England states, New York and New Jersey, it is by far the lowest degree of penetration. And we think that our customers have some very, very attractive economics in front of them. And under some analysis, we suggest that it costs twice as much to heat your home these days on fuel oil as natural gas. 
We are working with state policymakers on the energy side, on -- and even the federal policymakers to be thinking about driving policies towards making it easier for our customers to do the changeover. And we think that, depending on those economics, we could pick up 50,000, 55,000 customers for Yankee. In fact, we could, under some level of expansion double the customer base of Yankee Gas alone. When you look at the economics for a household of, let's say, 2,500 square feet. They spend about $3,300 a year on heating their homes. You could spend less than half of that if you converted to natural gas. So those customers who have natural gas now in their homes but are not heating on that, we think that's an out-of-pocket cost of $4,000 or $5,000. It's not a small amount of money, but we think it's a 4- or 5-year payback. We are looking at ways to get more supply into the state. We've done that recently by the completion of our Waterbury to Wallingford project that will bring more gas to more homes and more businesses. But we think there is the potential for hundreds of million of dollars of investment throughout Connecticut to get natural gas to our customers. 
Now that said, even though we're very bullish on this, we have not built that into the plan that you have in your book. So there's not this really vast expansion plan for Yankee Gas, but it's going to be a focus of ours, because we think that this is a very compelling time for customers to be looking to convert to natural gas. 
Let me turn our attention to now the financials. And this slide does talk a little bit about NU standalone. Obviously, we're reporting earnings as of last Friday as well. And we're very pleased with the NU financials. Our earnings year-to-date are up 12%. We continue to invest in our dividend. We continue to have a standalone payout ratio of about 50%. The credit conditions of the company is right now is stellar and, I think, still improving. All that really is going to be brought to bear with the new company. So all of what you've began to understand and know about NU is still in great position.  The cash flow of this company in terms of the cash flow being generated by our investment as well as the cash flow being generated by bonus tax appreciation, that will all accrue to the new company going forward.  And that kind of underlying strength on the capital program and the rate base program, the new shareholders inherit all that as well. 
I won't dwell on this point, but when you look at how we're doing year-to-date, I mean, you'll hear me affirm our overall guidance $2.30 to $2.40, we are right on track. Earnings for year-to-date are up about 12.3%. Interestingly, not driven by Transmission this year but driven by the Distribution businesses. Even as we continue to invest in rate-base growth, we have seen year-over-year increases across the board. If you peel back the onion here, behind the scenes, our utilities have better now on-average ROE performance than they've had in years. And that's up and down all the utilities including Connecticut.  Massachusetts lags that a little bit, but if you look at the trajectory going forward, a very positive story. 
Further behind the scenes, we had a kind of an interesting inflection point, maybe too early to tell, in the third quarter around sales, weather normalized sales for the 9 months are actually up 0.5%.  When we had our conference call around Q2, I shared with you that weather normalized sales were actually down about 0.5%. Our guidance was premised on flat sales.  Somebody asked me, ""Do you ever see a reversal in trend, where you can actually go weather-ized normal negative to positive?"" I said, ""Absolutely not."" Okay, I was wrong. It's positive.  And I'm not suggesting that we're seeing a trend here but when you look at growth of the same point of growth on the non-manufacturing side in Massachusetts, we see some positive growth. In New Hampshire, we see some positive growth. We see even in New Hampshire kind of average hourly workweek expanding a little bit. We see good export growth in the Connecticut market. So there's a glimmer here, but I'll be careful not to say trend-wise, this is what we're looking for.  Longer term, we still see about 0.5% load growth over the coming half-decade. 
On the guidance side, again, we'll reaffirm $2.30 to $2.40, consistent with Tom's remarks.  We are not going to look forward, as last year, and share with you the standalones of 2012. I will affirm what we said earlier in the year about Transmission. I think that's going to be on the higher side of this 105 to 110 but looking pretty good. And that's despite the fact, by the way, that Hurricane Irene did take a bite out of the financials, just a little bit. We lost about 90 gigawatt hours of sales, and there are some secondary impacts, including financing that storm, that have taken a couple of pennies off of our earnings. 
[Audio Gap]
I just want to update you quickly on the financing front. We have, every couple of months, we've been sending out a note on some financing activities but wanted to summarize this for you, both on new money, so you see at the top of the page PSNH and what amount as we've built out rate base and the investment program, has issued collectively over $250 million of new money.  I was pleased to see that the Western Mass 10-year 3.5% coupon is, as one financial newswire reported, the second-lowest-ever BBB category bond issuance. So I haven't scrubbed every single one of those, but I've seen at least one of the newswires report that. Either way, this is really quite beneficial for our customers as we take advantage of this low-coupon environment. 
Also have some opportunities on the refinancing side as well, specifically for Connecticut around some of our tax-exempt money. As you can see, we have taken out a 5.85% coupon, re-fi-ed that, some long dated some short, but that should set us up for $6 million to $7 million of interest savings next year alone. So a really good play, and looking forward a little bit, we've got a maturity coming up for NU parent.  If we were to re-fi that today or hedge that out today, you can see that 7.25 % coupon can get down at substantially less. And with NU on an upward trajectory with a ratings standpoint, we are quite optimistic that NU parent has an interest savings down the road as well. 
Let me just kind of finish up by summarizing the capital program. We've shown you pieces and parts. This is really a summary of not only Distribution and Transmission stacked on top of each other, it's the $5.7 billion program, but we compare it to last year. As I've said, the program in total is down from last year. It's a different time frame, as 2011 is going to roll off and we introduce the 2012, a lot of that explained by distribution, a lot of that's explained by AMI. But be very focused on what's happening within the transmission space.  Still a very good story. And I want to give you some comfort that in your appendix, you have a lot of the detail to show you, year-by-year, how this all plays out for those of you who want to run back to your desk and do some modeling. 
And then, lastly, when you look at the rate-base equivalent of that, here's a rate base that continues to grow to north of $11 billion. When you look at the overall compounded annual growth rate of, let's say, Transmission as an example, that's still quite robust at 10%, even updating for the year 2010. So I think it gives you a very good prospect and perspective on what type of growth we're going to bring to this combined company going forward in that one of the real sort of anchor point of our program and of this merger is our ability to invest capital on behalf of our customers. 
At this point, let me turn the podium over to my colleague and partner, Jim Judge."

I appreciate you showing up, especially at such an early hour. As both Tom and David indicated, Chuck and Lee are taking care of priority number one, which is the final storm cleanup and restorations that are taking place. I thought David did a great job pinch-hitting for Chuck and David -- for Chuck and Lee on the slides that they normally cover. 
I'm going to really touch on 4 areas fairly briefly. The first is the third quarter results, year-to-date results for NSTAR. Second, I'm going to talk about Transmission projects that NSTAR has in progress. Third, most -- a lot of familiar faces here.  Most of you are familiar with the NSTAR story, but I have 2 slides that will briefly give you the perspective that we have on the job that we've been doing for our investors and our customers. And finally, I'll wrap up with a few more insights on the merger proceeding in Massachusetts.
Earnings for the third quarter with excluded merger-related costs, and there were actually 2 onetime items last year at NSTAR, we've excluded them. So an apples-to-apples comparison, we are $0.94 in the third quarter. That's $0.01 higher than we were last year, it's $0.01 higher than the Street's expectations. Despite the unfavorable weather in the third quarter, we actually had some very positive items that had an impact. Transmission revenues contributed $0.04 as we continue to invest in that aspect of our business. 
We are recovering loss-based revenue since we increased our spending on energy efficiency, we're entitled to recoup the revenues that are lost, spread them around the rest of the customer base. Those loss-based revenues actually contributed $0.03 to the quarter, and $0.01 came from our unregulated telecommunications operations. A couple of factors that offset most positive items. We did see a 2.1% decline in sales in the third quarter, largely driven by weather. The cooling degree days were down 3% from a year ago, and so that cost us about $0.05.
And finally, interest, property taxes and higher O&M, each of those 3 items negatively impacted our earnings by $0.01 for the quarter. So I'm pleased with the results for the quarter, as I am with our year-to-date results, which we have on the next slide.
For 9 months, our earnings for the company were $2.12 compared to $2.07 a year ago, up $0.05. Several positive items, again, Transmission revenue continues to contribute to the bottom line, gave us $0.07 year-to-date. We also experienced a $0.04 pickup from the Gas business, Gas driven by a very cold first quarter, I guess.  Sales were up 11% year-to-date. As I mentioned, this recovery of loss-based revenues contributed $0.04 year-to-date to earnings, and then we have 4 other items.  Each of them were worth $0.03 year-to-date. We've seen a decline in interest costs, taken advantage, as David mentioned, we've taken advantage of the low-cost interest environment as well. We've done some refinancings. We also have a lower share count this year. We did a share buyback a year ago, and so that contributed about $0.03 to the comparison. 
In 2010, we had a onetime item that had to do with a regulatory true-up of our transition charge. That was a $0.03 item that we don't have this year. Again, the unregulated Telecommunications business gave us $0.03. So a lot of moving pieces in there. The bottom line is earnings up $0.05 at the 3-quarter point. 
Those were the positive items.  Negatively impacting them, we sold that district energy business a year ago. So those operating earnings are no longer in the mix, O&M cost of $0.07 year-to-date, and then the modest decline that we had in sales year-to-date, which is only 0.3%, and depreciation of property tax combined, they cost us about $0.08. So on a combined basis, we're very -- through 9 months, we're pleased with where we are. We continue to be confident and comfortable with our standalone guidance, which is between $2.60 and $2.75 for the year. 
I want to make a couple of comments about the Massachusetts economy. When we were here a year ago, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts was 8.4%. Today, it's down to 4% -- 7.4%. While nationally, the trend has been positive as well, it's far less significant. The national numbers a year ago were at 9.6%, down to 9.1% today. So Massachusetts is faring well and continues to improve. Some recent numbers came out in terms of GDP growth.  Massachusetts' growth on an annual basis for the last quarter was just under 4% compared to the national numbers, which are 2.5%. I think that's the fifth consecutive quarter, actually, Massachusetts has outpaced the rest of the country. 
A couple of comments on Transmission projects at NSTAR.  We have actually doubled our Transmission rate base in the last 5 years. And if you look at the projects that we have on the horizon for the next 5 years, it will double again. We spend, on average, about $100 million a year on baseline reliability and capacity investments. We have a significant project, the Cape Cod Line, that's planned plan.  That's a 31-mile line, 345 kV line over the Cape Cod Canal, and evidentiary hearings at the Siting Board in Massachusetts concluded back in July. In fact, the briefing period has been concluded as well in August. So we do anticipate, hope for, a decision from the Siting Board by the end of this year or certainly early next year. Project cost is about $120 million, and again, assuming timely approval from the state, we do think that we can bring the project in by year end 2012. 
Other major projects we have is a Mid Cape project, which basically will extend the benefits of that line further down the Cape. There's some upgrading and constructing of 115 kV lines that will reduce, really, the load risk in the Mid Cape area. And that project is also in the regional plan. We have a new project, the Boston 345kV connection, which basically bridges the north and south parts of the city, really to address the circuit limitations that we can foresee occurring in the near future. So that project could be in the mix over the next 2 years. And obviously, our share of the Hydro-Qu√©bec Northern Pass project that David talked about earlier, our share of that is $280 million. 
I mentioned in my comments that there's really 2 slides I wanted to give a perspective on NSTAR. This is the one on the customers' perspective. We are really a company that's driven by metrics, we have been for years. When you look at the key customer performance metrics, in the areas of reliability and things like number of outages and length of outages, when you look at the customer service measures around meter reading, around billing, around call center performance, NSTAR has really consistently, for several years now, been a top-quartile performer in our industry in every one of those measures. 
So it is nice to see the customer satisfaction scores really validating that strong performance. As you know, J.D. Power conducts these customer satisfaction surveys every year, and we start improvements this year, again, on both NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas. For NSTAR Electric, the ranking has actually improved now for 6 consecutive years. We may be the only utility in the country that can make that claim. We have now the highest ranking, really, of any major utility from Boston all the way down to Washington, D.C. area. 
NSTAR Gas, we are ranked number one in the east, mid-sized utility region, kind of a similar story, a steady climb since 2006. In fact, the last 3 years, we've ranked Number 3, Number 2, Number 1. So customer demands and expectations are always increasing, no more evidence than with the more recent storms that we've experienced. But it is rewarding to see that these high scores, which really reflect the strong customer commitment that we have among our 3,000 employees every day. 
Well, the one slide on the customer story from an investor perspective is the one slide. The left side really deals with financial performance; the right side, financial condition. Our financial performance over this 15-year time period is really number one in the industry for 1.5 decades.  That actually reflects Tom's tenure as CEO. Certainly, a challenging 15 years when you think back, industry restructuring, there's 2 mergers in here, certainly several economic downturns, but we have consistently outperformed the group and outperformed the market overall. 
The right side shows financial condition. Also number one in the industry, that strong credit quality has obviously allowed us continuous access to low-cost capital, low-cost borrowing costs that really benefit our customers every day. This merger provides a great opportunity for us to continue that commitment to excellent customer service, to strong financial performance and to a very healthy credit quality. 
Both Northeast Utilities and NSTAR have very active energy efficiency development and implementation programs. For many years, at NSTAR, we'd spend about $50 million a year on energy efficiency. That stepped up to $75 million in 2009, and actually, we'll spend $180 million this year and over $200 million next year. Just last month, Massachusetts took the number 1 spot in the country, really, in terms of rankings on energy efficiency efforts. This is a national energy efficiency counsel that ranks the states, and Massachusetts has actually surpassed California now. 
We have made progress on addressing the state's renewable portfolio standards. We've executed 3 contracts at a very low cost.  It's been approved by DPU for over 100 megawatts.  And NU and NSTAR are making commitments to this merger proceedings to advance the climate change agenda. We have agreed to target increased energy efficiency. We've agreed to own and contract additional solar and to build on an electrical vehicle pilot initiative that NU has in Connecticut, basically to introduce it into the Boston area. 
As Tom indicated, only 2 approvals pending. We have the NRC approval, which we anticipate this month. The DPU, the hearings were completed in July. The briefing period was completed at the end of October. Typically, it's a 2-month process, we would hope, for an order, so we do anticipate an order within the next couple of months. The merits of our filing address these environmental concessions that we mentioned but also get into some detail in terms of the savings for customers. We have a mid-benefit analysis that anticipates at the cost, customers will save $784 million over 10 years. That number grows to $5.7 billion over 40 years. That 40-year horizon is a time frame that's, in the past, the Mass DPU has looked at to assess the merits of merger benefits. 
In July, as Tom mentioned, the state agency called Department of Energy Resources, they filed a motion to stay the merger proceedings. Basically, looking for supplemental information in 3 areas: progress on the merger integration, any rate changes from the merger and more on potential climate change impacts. We trust that the DPU will deny the DOER motion. We will have an opportunity to comment on it. Certainly, a stay would jeopardize or, at a minimum, delay the many merger benefits that we've discussed with the state, benefits to our customers, benefits for our state and benefits for the region. Tom indicated all arguments have now been put off to November 17. That will allow the companies and the intervenors to try to resolve or issue -- or at least limit some of the issues that are pending in that motion. And after those oral arguments, we do anticipate an order out of the DPU within a couple of months. 
So some final thoughts on this last slide before we open it up to questions. We have here 2 highly successful companies, very similar strategies and expertise, some great growth opportunities ahead of us. I think we have made a very clear record before the department that demonstrates our compliance with the net benefit standard that is the rule in Massachusetts now. We have evidenced significant customer savings, significant environmental accretion, and the building path project alone, if that project -- when that project is completed, it is the equivalent of removing 800,000 vehicles off the road on a daily basis. So there's great environmental advantages of this transaction moving forward.  For investments, we think this combined entity provides great investment opportunity. And I like to, I guess, reiterate as I close that we are very enthusiastic about the merger, very confident that we will have the approvals in here over the next couple of months. 
We do have time for some questions. I think Jeff Kotkin is going to come up and join us."

We went into the year thinking that we would really reverse trends that we've seen over the last 3 to 4 years, which has really been demand destruction, just outright year-over-year",509,"I think Travis is just echoing some of our comments earlier in the year.  We went into the year thinking that we would really reverse trends that we've seen over the last 3 to 4 years, which has really been demand destruction, just outright year-over-year decline. This year, the reverse trend was not to be so optimistic as to think that the economy was coming around that we didn't predict a double-dip recession either. And for the first 6 months of the year, maybe the first 7 months of the year, we were sort of seeing a little disappointment relative to that. We were seeing sort of declines, weather-normalized, across all classes of customers. And then, this inflection point that I discussed, we saw coming out of August and September, even in the throes of Tropical Storm Irene, some growth.  And the growth was among all of our companies, all 3 customers -- companies and then also within each of the classes.  And it's difficult to kind of peer into each of the sectors quarter-by-quarter or thereabouts, so when we look at this, what we'd say is we know there continues to be a drag on sales because of energy efficiency program. Those are good things, we'll do it, it's the right answer for customers, but it is having [ph] off more and more client [ph] organic sales. Also distributed generation. We know, too, that, that is moving the needle a little bit. I saw some statistics today that talks about, going forward, just sort of calls out [ph] 500,000 megawatt hours every year, particularly as customers are installing solar and the like. So what's driving that needle? When we looked at it, we saw that there was about -- neutralizing for that, there was about maybe 1% to 1.5% real growth because of the economic factors.  That is, you are seeing a little bit more manufacturing. You are seeing even a little bit more consumer confidence. There was actually a pickup in New England consumer confidence. I'm not suggesting that customers are ready to go out and start spending lots of money, but we saw that as a metric. We also know that prices are substantially lower from and that from an elasticity standpoint, customers look at a standard offer rate now that for many of our companies, including NSTAR, had a 7 handle versus a $0.10 and $0.11 product. And that is going to put a drive on sales. So we're seeing that combination. Now whether it's sustainable or not, not so sure. I said to the group that we look forward and look at maybe 0.05% electric growth, maybe 2.5% to 3% natural gas growth. We'll look at this pretty closely, but we do know that from a fundamental standpoint, we're going to continue to see DG, we're going to continue to invest in energy efficiency, but we see some economic growth over the next 2 to 3 years. I don't want to get wildly optimistic on that, but we do see some growth emerging there."
