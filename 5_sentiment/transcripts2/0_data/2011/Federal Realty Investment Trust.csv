In trying to decide how to talk about 2010 and then set expectations for 2011 with you all today, its helpful for me to step back a bit and look top-down.
I jotted down a list of some of the things we have done this year and on reflection for our recent view. But here's what happened.
In this economy, we grew top line revenue 2.5% to a record $543 million. We grew same store, same-center property operating income 2.1% to a record $350 million.
We grew FFO per share of 2.6% to a record $388 million, with no easy prior period comparable. We grew 2010 fourth quarter FFO to $1.1 per share, first time any quarter ever had $1. We negotiated 312 new and renewal releases at positive leasing spreads, 8% cash, 18% straight line.
Maintained occupancy levels year-over-year at 93.2%. We made our first investments in Newberry Street and are performing above our underwriting.
We accretively bought up a land on the Pentagon Row on Bethesda Row. We delivered our hand in laying at Bethesda project on time, on budget, and fully leased. We increased our footprint at Escondido in San Diego, at Huntington in Long Island and recently in our third property in Florida just outside of Fort Lauderdale.
We completed and leased up most of our office building in Santana, we broke around on our 108-unit residential building there and we've accelerated our plans to build the next one. 
We signed our deal with AvalonBay as square. we negotiated deal on which is loosely amnesty approved by the MBTA. We hope to break ground on this project late 2011 or early 2012.
The overall White Flint sector plan and our Mid-Pike messing plan was approved. Making way for first phase construction at Mid-Pike which is tentatively to begin in, 2012. And we did increase our dividend rate of common shares for the 43rd year in a row.
The 2010 was a very good year for us and 2011 should be too. Even though we'll be hit pretty badly in the short-term by the Borders bankruptcy, along with some of the other non-recurring lease termination fees that we'll talk about.
We've got a lot done in 2010 and while we didn't deploy as much capital as we would have liked to big acquisitions, we created a lot of value in what we did do and we clearly saw a pick up under our product as the year progressed.
We're able to close on our Tower Shops in Florida last month and expect a more active 2011 from that perspective. Though at the moment, I'd stay more optimistic even about the future value creation redevelopment we've identified.
I went back and look at the forward-looking comments I made on this call back in August and then again, in November, concerning our view of the major market, as well as the leasing and operating environment. And I've got to say, it all still applies and is generally moving in the right direction. Retailers want to get deals done in virtually all the markets we have business in but with a tough conscious mentality that's here to stay.
Basically its harder for us to create a more valuable company simply by raising rents. Having said that, Washington D.C. remains the steadiest and strongest of our markets with California improving the fastest, particularly at Santana Row and 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica. Lot's more value for us to add for both of those California properties.
I mentioned Borders a minute ago, let me put a finer point on that. The troubles at Borders booked will defer us in 2011, no doubt. We have 4 Borders locations paying a total of $3 million in rent, about $0.05 a share and they stop paying rent in February. 
Certainly, that income stream is a risk in the short run. When you think about it in the longer-term, Borders has effective drug to the shopping centers that they're in for a number of years now and I can imagine that's going to change anytime soon no matter how the situation gets resolved.
So if you're us, you can understand why we would be anxious to work through these deals as quickly as possible so that we can really look at those prime locations to help your TATs. An intense effort to uncover additional value creative opportunities throughout the portfolio, has beefing up in our leasing and redevelopment staff. Additional residential opportunities on our existing land look very possible at places like Congressional Plaza, like Bethesda, like Charlie Dent, like Barracks Road and others not to mention our large developments in Mid-Pike and Assembly and still more to come at Santana Row. Lots of optimism around here on that potential.
In summary, despite we remain a very challenging economic environment, it is improving one. And our path of future real estate value creation is becoming clearer and clearer. That value will be led by retail and nonretail redevelopment and refinancing opportunities along with new raw material in the form of some pretty good acquisitions that we're making progress on, tower Shops in Davie, Florida is a good start.
That's all I got for my prepared remarks this morning. Let me turn it over to Andy and look forward to your questions after that."
271305,117545138,103635,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now I really have sentiments and I continue to be impressed by how solid our performance has been over the past three years of this and how we're positioned for the future.Think about this. 2008 property operatin",1007,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now I really have sentiments and I continue to be impressed by how solid our performance has been over the past three years of this and how we're positioned for the future.
Think about this. 2008 property operating income was higher than 2007. 2009 was higher than 2008, 2010 was higher than 2009. We're expecting 2011 to be higher than 2010.
We avoided material impairments, we achieved positive lease roll over every year and in fact every quarter, maintained strong and steady occupancy, maintained a conservative balance sheet with no significant equity delusion, we've paid an increasing all cash dividend on our common shares.  There are few of any public real estate companies that can match that performance over the prior three years.
Turning now to our results, let's start with the quarter. Same-store property operating income came in at a positive 0.8% including redevelopments and positive 1.1% excluding redevelopments for the quarter. This was despite the negative impact we've discussed before from the loss of the Home Depot lease termination fee in Flourtown in Philly. The drivers of this growth were continued steady occupancy and an increase in minimum rent by 3.8%, driven by the consistency of our operating portfolio and supported by redevelopment impacts of properties like in Bethesda and London Square.
The full impact of this increase in minimum rent doesn't show up in the rental income line because it was all set by recoveries, which were down 11% for the quarter. Largely driven by significantly lower snow removal cost in this year's fourth quarter compared to 2009.
Along the operating line we saw decreases in interest expense as we held significant cash balances at the end of 2009 before repaying the last of our term loan in the third quarter of 2010. 
G&A increased $1.33 million through increases in acquisition, development and personnel costs. All in, FFO per share clips the dollar mark for the first time ever at $1.1 for the quarter. 
Moving now to the full-year 2010. As Don mentioned, we produced record topline revenue in 2010 on flat 93.2% year-over-year occupancy. 
Once again, bullied by positive full year lease roll overs of 8%. Same-store property operating income grew 2.3% including redevelopment, and 2.1% excluding redevelopment. 
Continued growth in property operating income, G&A control and balance sheet management, not just not but throughout the past several years, contributed to our record FFO of $239 million or $3.88 per share, and that bulk fee considering the operating environment over that period.
Another item to note in our 2010 financials. You may have seen in our disclosure that we received a final judgment relating to our appeal of 350 Winchester litigation at Santana Row. We're disappointed in losing our appeal with the associated $60.2 million payment of the matter. However, the full amount have been accrued in '09, there's no significant new earnings impact related to this final roll in fourth quarter results, we do not expect any related earnings to our existing 2011.
You need to expand and redevelopment disclosure in the 8-K. Our goal is to provide more detail on value creation opportunities we'll be pursuing over the next several years. Including that were increases discussion of larger project, Assembly Row and Mid-Pike. 
Last quarter, Don gave an update on Assembly Row in a recent agreement with AvalonBay. And at that time, we are still working through final approvals for our new Orange Line T station at the site. . 
Last week, we announced the MBTA had unanimously devoted in support of the interim of understanding with Federal Realty for the construction of the T station.
This marks a big step forward with respect to the T-Stop at Assembly Row becoming our value. Phase one of Assembly Row, which we done partnership with AvalonBay, will include three buildings, totaling 419 residential units, plus 280,000 square feet of retail, all in addition to the existing 337,000 square-foot power center at The Assembly Square marketplace.
AvalonBay will build the two residential buildings with 110,000 square feet of retail on the ground form. Buy back the retail shells, similar to what we did at Rockville Town Square. 
Federal will build the remaining 180,000 square foot retail building. We began actively leasing the project with the opening of our marketing center late last year, and are already seeing interest from users. Total Phase One costs are expect to be about $100 million to $125 million range.
In North Bethesda, our overall sketch plans for the redevelopment of Mid-Pike Plaza was approved on January 20, allowing us to move forward on submitting a plan for that project's first phase in April, with the anticipated approval later this year. With all approvals in place, we may be able to begin construction in mid-2012, on the approximately $200 million first phase to include 240,000 square feet of retail and office space, and approximately 400 residential units and appropriate parking.
The phasing of the project means the remainder of the center will be open and operating during construction, which allows us to continue receiving a steady stream of income through stabilization of the first phase.
Future phases of the project will be timed according to the success of the first phase, but the total project is anticipated to include over 3 million square feet of Commercial Real Estate with filled out over the next 10 to 15 years.
Moving on to guidance. We're leaving our 2011 FFO per share guidance of $3.95 to $4.02 unchanged. Obviously, the news out of Borders this morning with $3 million or $0.05 per share of contribution makes it more difficult for us. And as a result, we'd certainly guided to the lower end of the range.
Having said that, it's only February and there are many positives or negatives that can happen throughout the year. We certainly believe any hit in the near term will be longer-term opportunity to create value going forward, as Don said. Operator, we will now turn the call over for your question."

But let me give you a point of view on this. It is just crazy to pay some of the numbers that are being required on very flat, very hopefully stable, basic core assets without really any potential to add value to them. We all know what our cost capital is and it's just a lot of the stuff we're seeing won't allow that to happen. When you talk about the opportunity to put six to seven acres together and effectively carry it, the sixth is going in and then stabilize the seventh, with a bunch of acreage left, that looks attractive to us. That we can see it pass the value creation. So we got to be able to see that path whether it's on the form of larger properties, which we always like, because I do believe you can do a lot more comes up down the road when you've got the acreage there, or whether it is in the few of the places where you have some undervalued acres or in terms of rent that are being pay, either one that works for us. But yes, I think it's reasonable to assume that you should expect to see bigger type of assets generally on the acquisition side for us because there's got to be a way to create value added for us to do with."

If there's an asset today that comes to the market that's institutional quality and one of the better trade areas in the East and West Coast, that's relatively easy to underwrite, that doesn't have any existing debt attached to it, the pricing is spectacular. We're back down into the cap rate range of significantly below six. And with reasonable assumptions going forward, IRR is, in some cases, are below even 7% or maybe, slightly above 7%. So clearly, chasing those assets and paying those prices when they're so value-added proposition does really makes no sense. So we're focused on things where we think we can generate returns exceed our longer-term cost of capital. Like Don said, those are generally going to be bigger deals."

And it sits in a very important part of the project yet the project continues to get better. So this is a real opportunity for us at Santana to be able to kind of re-merchandise that with the 2011, '12, '13 type of tenant that will be great for the future. Friendship Center, down Maryland, great thought. In fact, Chris, I know we have a bunch of things working on that spot already.

It's a completely different world than it is outside of Washington D.C. At Santana and the northern California for us, a very strong recovery, vis-à-vis where they were.

There'll be some but it's not going to be a strong growth here for the reasons we enumerated. The valuation stuff that we're working on won't benefit '11 yet. I think it's wonderful for the future. The acquisitions so far won't benefit '11, I think it's wonderful for the future. The absence of the termination fees from '10 and '09 won't be there this year and we're certainly don't having an issue at least with Borders and maybe a little bit of Barnes in '11. So when you put all that together, I think it's amazing, frankly, that you'll see some growth in '11 versus '10, versus '09 versus '08.

In trying to decide how to talk about 2010 and then set expectations for 2011 with you all today, it's helpful for me to step back a bit and look top-down.
I jotted down a list of some of the things we have done this year and on reflection for our recent view. But here's what happened.
In this economy, we grew top line revenue 2.5% to a record $543 million. We grew same store, same-center property operating income 2.1% to a record $350 million.
We grew FFO per share of 2.6% to a record $388 million, with no easy prior period comparable. We grew 2010 fourth quarter FFO to $1.1 per share, first time any quarter ever hit a $1. We negotiated 312 new and renewal releases at positive leasing spreads, 8% cash, 18% straight line.
Maintained occupancy levels year-over-year at 93.2%. We made our first investments in Newberry Street and are performing above our underwriting.
We accretively bought up a land on the Pentagon Row on Bethesda Row. We delivered our hand in laying at Bethesda project on time, on budget, fully leased. We increased our footprint at Escondido in San Diego, at Huntington in Long Island and recently in our third property in Florida just outside of Fort Lauderdale.
We completed and leased up most of our office building in Santana, we broke around on our 108-unit residential building there and we've accelerated our plans to build the next one. 
We signed our deal with AvalonBay at Assembly Square. We negotiated a deal on T-Stop which is recently unanimously approved by the MBTA. We hope to break ground on this project late 2011 or early 2012.
The overall White Flint sector plan and our Mid-Pike messing plan was approved. Making way for first phase construction at Mid-Pike which is tentatively planned to begin in, 2012. And we did increase our dividend rate of common shares for the 43rd year in a row.
The 2010 was a very good year for us and 2011 should be too. Even though we'll be hit pretty badly in the short-term by the Borders bankruptcy, along with some of the other non-recurring lease termination fees that we'll talk about.
We've got a lot done in 2010 and while we didn't deploy as much capital as we would have liked to big acquisitions, we created a lot of value in what we did do and we clearly saw a pickup in desirable products as the year progressed.
We were able to close on our Tower Shops in Florida last month and expect a more active 2011 from that perspective. Though at the moment, I'd say I'm more optimistic even about the future value creation through redevelopment we've identified.
I went back and look at the forward-looking comments I made on this call back in August and then again, in November, concerning our view of the major market, as well as the leasing and operating environment. And I've got to say, it all still applies and is generally moving in the right direction. Retailers want to get deals done in virtually all the markets we have business in but with a tough cost-conscious mentality that's here to stay.
Basically its harder for us to create a more valuable company simply by raising rents. Having said that, Washington D.C. remains the steadiest and strongest of our markets with California improving the fastest, particularly at Santana Row and 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica. Lots more value for us to add for both of those California properties.
I mentioned Borders a minute ago, let me put a finer point on that. The troubles at Borders booked will defer us in 2011, no doubt. We have 4 Borders locations paying a total of $3 million in rent and extras, about $0.05 a share, and they stopped paying rent in February. 
Certainly, that income stream is at risk in the short run. But when you think about it in the longer-term, Borders hasn't really been an effective draw to the shopping centers that they're in for a number of years now. I can't imagine how that's going to change anytime soon no matter how the situation gets resolved.
So if you're us, you can understand why we'd be anxious to work through these deals as quickly as possible so that we can really look at those prime locations to help your TATs. An intense effort to uncover additional value creative opportunities throughout the portfolio, has been beefing up on our leasing and redevelopment staff. Additional residential opportunities on our existing land look very possible at places like Congressional Plaza, like Bethesda, like Shirlington, like Barracks Road and others, not to mention our large developments in Mid-Pike and Assembly and still more to come at Santana Row. Lots of optimism around here on that potential.
In summary, despite what remains a very challenging economic environment, it is an improving one. And our path of future real estate value creation is becoming clearer and clearer. That value will be lead by retail and non-retail redevelopment and retenanting opportunities, along with new raw material in the form of some pretty good acquisitions that we're making progress on, Tower Shops in Davie, Florida is a good start.
That's all I got for my prepared remarks this morning. Let me now turn it over to Andy and I look forward to your questions after that."
271305,117545138,103790,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now I really have Don's sentiments and I continue to be impressed by how solid our performance has been over the past three years of this [Audio Gap] and how we're positioned for the future.Think about this. 2008",1018,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now I really have Don's sentiments and I continue to be impressed by how solid our performance has been over the past three years of this [Audio Gap] and how we're positioned for the future.
Think about this. 2008 property operating income was higher than 2007. 2009 was higher than 2008, 2010 was higher than 2009. We're expecting 2011 to be higher than 2010.
We avoided material impairments, we achieved positive lease roll over every year and in fact every quarter, maintained strong and steady occupancy, maintained a conservative balance sheet with no significant equity delusion, we've paid an increasing all cash dividend on our common shares.  There are few, if any, public real estate companies that can match that performance over the prior three years.
Turning now to our results, let's start with the quarter. Same-store property operating income came in at a positive 0.8% including redevelopments and positive 1.1% excluding redevelopments for the quarter. This was despite the negative impact we've discussed before from the loss of the Home Depot lease termination fee in Flourtown in Philly. The drivers of this growth were continued steady occupancy and an increase in minimum rent by 3.8%, driven by the consistency of our operating portfolio and supported by redevelopment impacts of properties like Hampden Lane in Bethesda and Linden Square.
The full impact of this increase in minimum rent doesn't show up in the rental income line because 'twas offset by recoveries, which were down 11% for the quarter. Largely driven by significantly lower snow removal cost in this year's fourth quarter compared to 2009
Along the operating line, we saw decreases in interest expense as we held significant cash balances at the end of 2009 before repaying the last of our term loan in the third quarter of 2010. 
G&A increased $1.3 million through increases in acquisition, development and personnel costs. All in, FFO per share clips the dollar mark for the first time ever at $1.1 for the quarter. 
Moving now to the full year 2010. As Don mentioned, we produced record topline revenue in 2010 on flat 93.2% year-over-year occupancy. 
Once again, buoyed by positive full year lease roll overs of 8%. Same-store property operating income grew 2.3% including redevelopment, and 2.1% excluding redevelopment. 
Continued growth in property operating income, G&A control and balance sheet management, not just not now, but throughout the past several years, contributed to our record FFO of $239 million or $3.88 per share, and that bulk fee considering the operating environment over that period.
Another item to note in our 2010 financials. You may have seen in our disclosure that we received a final judgment relating to our appeal of 350 Winchester litigation at Santana Row. We're disappointed in losing our appeal with the associated $16.2 million payment on the matter. However, the full amount have been accrued in '09, there is no significant new earnings impact related to this final roll in fourth quarter results, we do not expect any related earnings towards this in 2011.
You need to expand and redevelopment disclosure in the 8-K. Our goal is to provide more detail on value creation opportunities we'll be pursuing over the next several years. Including that, were increased discussion of two of our larger projects, Assembly Row and Mid-Pike. 
Last quarter, Don gave an update on Assembly Row in a recent agreement with AvalonBay. And at that time, we are still working through final approvals for our new Orange Line T station at the site. . 
Last week, we announced the MBTA had unanimously voted in support of a memorandum of understanding with Federal Realty for the construction of the T station.
This marks a big step forward with respect to the T-Stop at Assembly Row becoming our value. Phase one of Assembly Row, which should be done in partnership with AvalonBay, will include three buildings, totaling 419 residential units, plus 280,000 square feet of retail, all in addition to the existing 337,000 square-foot power center at The Assembly Square marketplace.
AvalonBay will build the two residential buildings with 110,000 square feet of retail on the ground form. Buy back the retail shells, similar to what we did at Rockville Town Square. 
Federal will build the remaining 180,000 square foot retail building. We began actively leasing the project with the opening of our marketing center late last year, and are already seeing interest from users. Total Phase One costs are expected to be about $100 million to $125 million range.
In North Bethesda, our overall sketch plans for the redevelopment of Mid-Pike Plaza was approved on January 20, allowing us to move forward on submitting a plan for that project's first phase in April, with the anticipated approval later this year. With all approvals in place, we may be able to begin construction in mid-2012, on the approximately $200 million first phase to include 240,000 square feet of retail and office space, and approximately 400 residential units and appropriate parking.
The phasing of the project means the remainder of the center will be open and operating during construction, which allow us to continue receiving a steady stream of income through stabilization of the first phase.
Future phases of the project will be timed according to the success of the first phase, but the total project is anticipated to include over 3 million square feet of Commercial Real Estate with filled out over the next 10 to 15 years.
Moving on to guidance. We're leaving our 2011 FFO per share guidance of $3.95 to $4.02 unchanged. Obviously, the news out of Borders this morning with $3 million or $0.05 per share of contribution makes it more difficult for us. And as a result, we'd certainly guided to the lower end of the range.

But let me give you a point of view on this. It is just crazy to pay some of the numbers that are being required on very flat, very hopefully stable, basic core assets without really any potential to add value to them. We all know what our cost capital is and it's just a lot of the stuff we're seeing won't allow that to happen. When you talk about the opportunity to put six to seven acres together and effectively carry it, the sixth is going in and then stabilize the seventh, with a bunch of acreage left, that looks attractive to us. That we can see it pass the value creation. So we got to be able to see that path. Now whether it's on the form of larger properties, which we always like, because I do believe you can do a lot more -- a lot more comes up down the road when you've got the acreage there, or whether it is in the few of the places where you do have some undervalued acres or acreage in terms of rent that are being pay, either one that works for us. But yes, I think it's reasonable to assume that you should expect to see bigger type of assets generally on the acquisition side for us because there's got to be a way to create value at it for us to do with."

If there's an asset today that comes to the market that's institutional quality and one of the better trade areas on the East and West Coast, that's relatively easy to underwrite, that doesn't have any existing debt attached to it, the pricing is spectacular. We're back down into the cap rate range of significantly below six. And with reasonable assumptions going forward, IRR is, in some cases, are below even 7% or maybe, slightly above 7%. So clearly, chasing those assets and paying those prices when they're so value-added proposition does really makes no sense. So we're focused on things where we think we can generate returns that exceed our longer-term cost of capital. Like Don said, those are generally going to be bigger deals."

One of the reasons we made that acquisition or we were in a position to make that acquisition, is because we are in a position to absorb the outstanding debt on a number of these shopping centers. In a lot of cases, that debt is above market. That's the case at Tower. What I think our due diligence and our process kind of laid out though was we've got the ability to refinance that debt. I'm not sure if you knew that frankly, I'm looking at that property. And so the ability to buy it at $68 million, which if it didn't have above market data, that property would have gotten a lot higher than that. And so with the ability to buy at that price and then to refinance out of the above market debt and something more in line with Federal's cost of capital or cost of debt capital is really value-additive. So add that to conversation at Tower."

In trying to decide how to talk about 2010 and then set expectations for 2011 with you all today, it's helpful for me to step back a bit and look top-down.
I jotted down a list of some of the things we got done this year and on reflection before I read them to you. But here's what happened.
In this economy, we grew top line revenue 2.5% to a record $543 million. We grew same store, same-center property operating income 2.1% to a record $350 million.
We grew FFO per share 2.6% to a record $388 million, with no easy prior period comparable. We grew 2010 fourth quarter FFO to $1.01 per share, first time any quarter to ever hit a $1. We negotiated 312 new and renewal releases at positive leasing spreads, 8% cash, 18% straight line.
Maintained occupancy levels year-over-year at 93.2%. We made our first investments on Newbury Street, and they’re performing above our underwriting.
We accretively bought out the land on the Pentagon Row and Bethesda Row. We delivered our hand in lane and Bethesda project on time, on budget, fully leased. We increased our footprint at Escondido in San Diego, at Huntington in Long Island and recently added our third property in Florida just outside of Fort Lauderdale.
We completed and leased up most of our office building in Santana, we broke ground on our 108-unit residential building there and we've accelerated our plans to build the next one. 
We signed our deal with AvalonBay at Assembly Square. We negotiated a deal on T-Stop funding which is recently unanimously approved by the MBTA. We hope to break ground on this project late 2011 or early 2012.
The overall White Flint sector plan and our Mid-Pike masting [ph] plan was approved, making way for first phase construction at Mid-Pike which is tentatively planned to begin in 2012. And we did increase our dividend rate on common shares for the 43rd year in a row.
So 2010 was a very good year for us, and 2011 should be too, even though we'll be hit pretty badly in the short-term by the Borders bankruptcy, along with some of the other non-recurring lease termination fees that we'll talk about.
But we've got a lot done in 2010, and while we didn't deploy as much capital as we would have liked to big acquisitions, we created a lot of value in what we did do and we clearly saw a pick up on desirable products as the year progressed.
We were able to close on our Tower Shops in Florida last month and expect a more active 2011 from that perspective. Though at the moment, I'd say I'm more optimistic even about the future value creation through redevelopment that we've identified.
I went back and looked at the forward-looking comments I made on this call back in August and then again, in November, concerning our view of the major markets do business in, as well as the leasing and operating environment. And I've got to say, it all still applies and is generally moving in the right direction. Retailers want to get deals done in virtually all the markets we do business in but with a tough cost-conscious mentality that's certainly here to stay.
Basically it’s harder for us to create a more valuable company simply by raising rents. Having said that, Washington D.C. remains the steadiest and the strongest of our markets with California improving the fastest, particularly at Santana Row and Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica. Lots more value for us to add at both of those California properties.
I mentioned Borders a minute ago. Let me put a finer point on that. The troubles at Borders Books will hurt us in 2011, no doubt. We have four Borders locations paying a total of $3 million in rent and extras, about $0.05 a share, and they stopped paying rent in February. 
Certainly, that income stream is at risk in the short run. But when you think about it in the longer-term, Borders hasn't really been an effective draw to the shopping centers that they're in for a number of years now. I can't imagine that's going to change anytime soon, no matter how their situation gets resolved.
So if you're us, you can understand why we'd be anxious to work through these deals as quickly as possible so that we can release those prime locations to healthier tenants. An intense effort to uncover additional value creative opportunities throughout the portfolio has us beefing up on our leasing and redevelopment staff. Additional residential opportunities on our existing land look very possible at places like Congressional Plaza, like Bethesda, like Shirlington, like Barracks Road and others, not to mention our large developments at Mid-Pike and Assembly and still more to come at Santana Row. Lots of optimism around here on that potential.
In summary, despite what remains a very challenging economic environment, it is an improving one. And our path to future real estate value creation is becoming clearer and clearer. That value will be led by retail and non-retail redevelopment and re-tenanting opportunities, along with new raw material in the form of some pretty good acquisitions that we're making progress on. Tower Shops in Davie, Florida is a good start.
That's all I got for my prepared remarks this morning. Let me now turn it over to Andy, and I look forward to your questions after that."
271305,117545138,103831,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2011",2011-02-16,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now I really echo Don's sentiments, and I continue to be impressed by how solid our performance has been over the past three years of this [Audio Gap] and how we're positioned for the future.Think about this. 200",1029,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. Now I really echo Don's sentiments, and I continue to be impressed by how solid our performance has been over the past three years of this [Audio Gap] and how we're positioned for the future.
Think about this. 2008 property operating income was higher than 2007. 2009 was higher than 2008, 2010 was higher than 2009. We're expecting 2011 to be higher than 2010.
We avoided material impairments. We achieved positive lease roll over every year and, in fact, every quarter, maintained strong and steady occupancy, we maintained a conservative balance sheet with no significant equity dilution, and we've paid an increasing all cash dividend on our common shares.  There are few, if any, public real estate companies that can match that performance over the prior three years.
Turning now to our results, let's start with the quarter. Same-store property operating income came in at a positive 0.8% including redevelopments and positive 1.1% excluding redevelopments for the quarter. This was despite the negative impact we've discussed before from the loss of the Home Depot lease termination fee in Flourtown in Philly. The drivers of this growth were continued steady occupancy and an increase in minimum rent by 3.8%, driven by the consistency of our operating portfolio and supported by redevelopment impacts of properties like Hampden Lane in Bethesda and Linden Square.
The full impact of this increase in minimum rent doesn't show up in the rental income line because it was offset by recoveries, which were down 11% for the quarter. Largely driven by significantly lower snow removal costs in this year's fourth quarter compared to 2009.
Below the operating line, we saw decreases in interest expense as we held significant cash balances at the end of 2009 before repaying the last of our term loan in the third quarter of 2010. 
G&A increased $1.3 million through increases in acquisition, development and personnel costs. All in, FFO per share eclipsed the dollar mark for the first time ever at $1.01 for the quarter. 
Turning now to the full year 2010. As Don mentioned, we produced record top line revenue in 2010 on flat 93.2% year-over-year occupancy, once again, buoyed by positive full year lease roll overs of 8%. Same-store property operating income grew 2.3% including redevelopment and 2.1% excluding redevelopment. 
Continued growth in property operating income, G&A control and balance sheet management, not just not now, but throughout the past several years, contributed to our record FFO of $239 million or $3.88 per share, an admirable feat considering the operating environment over that period.
One other item to note in our 2010 financials. You may have seen in our disclosure that we received a final judgment relating to our appeal of 350 Winchester litigation at Santana Row. We're disappointed in losing our appeal and the associated $16.2 million payment on the matter. However, the full amount had been accrued in '09, there was no significant new earnings impact related to this final ruling in fourth quarter results. We do not expect any related earnings charges in 2011.
I hope that you saw our expanded redevelopment disclosure in the 8-K. Our goal is to provide more detail on value creation opportunities we'll be pursuing over the next several years. Including that were increased discussions of two of our larger projects, Assembly Row and Mid-Pike. 
Last quarter, Don gave an update on Assembly Row in a recent agreement with AvalonBay. And at that time, we were still working through final approvals for our new Orange Line T station at the site. Last week, we announced the MBTA had unanimously voted in support of a memorandum of understanding with Federal Realty for the construction of the T station.
This marks a big step forward with respect to the T-Stop at Assembly Row becoming a reality. Phase one of Assembly Row, which will be done in partnership with AvalonBay, will include three buildings, totaling 419 residential units, plus 280,000 square feet of retail, all in addition to the existing 337,000 square-foot power center at The Assembly Square marketplace.
AvalonBay will build the two residential buildings with 110,000 square feet of retail on the ground floor. And we’ll buy back the retail shells [ph], similar to what we did at Rockville Town Square. 
Federal will build the remaining 180,000 square foot retail building. We began actively leasing the project with the opening of our marketing center late last year, and are already seeing interest from retail users. Total Phase One costs are expected to be in the $100 million to $125 million range.
In North Bethesda, our overall sketch plan for the redevelopment of Mid-Pike Plaza was approved on January 20, allowing us to move forward on submitting a plan for that project's first phase in April, with the anticipated approval later this year. With all approvals in place, we may be able to begin construction in mid-2012, on the approximately $200 million first phase to include 230,000 square feet of retail and office space and approximately 400 residential units and appropriate parking.
The phasing of the project means the remainder of the center will be open and operating during construction, which will allow us to continue receiving a steady stream of income through stabilization of the first phase.
Future phases of the project will be timed according to the success of the first phase, but the total project is anticipated to include over 3 million square feet of Commercial Real Estate with filled out over the next 10 to 15 years.
Moving on to guidance. We're leaving our 2011 FFO per share guidance of $3.95 to $4.02 unchanged. Obviously, the news out of Borders this morning with $3 million or $0.05 per share of contribution makes it more difficult for us. And as a result, we'd certainly guide you to the lower end of the range.
Having said that, it's only February, and there are many positives or negatives that can happen throughout the year. We certainly believe any hit in the near term will be longer-term opportunity to create value going forward, as Don said.

But let me give you a point of view on this. It is just crazy to pay some of the numbers that are being required on very flat, very hopefully stable, basic core assets without really any potential to add value to them. We all know what our cost to capital is, and it's just a lot of the stuff we're seeing won't allow that to happen. When you talk about the opportunity to put 67 acres together and effectively carry it at the sixes going in and then stabilize in the sevens, with a bunch of acreage left, that looks attractive to us. That we can see a path to value creation. So we got to be able to see that path. Now whether it's in the form of larger properties, which we always like, because I do believe you can do a lot more -- a lot more comes up down the road when you've got the acreage there, or whether it is in a few of the places where you do have some undervalued acres or anchors in terms of rents that are being pay, either one works for us. But yes, I think it's reasonable to assume that you should expect to see bigger type of assets generally on the acquisition side for us because there's got to be a way to create value at it for us to do it."

If there's an asset today that comes to the market that's institutional quality and one of the better trade areas on the East and West Coast that's relatively easy to underwrite, that doesn't have any existing debt attached to it, the pricing is spectacular. We're back down into the cap rate range of significantly below six. And with reasonable assumptions going forward, the IRRs, in some cases, are below even 7% or maybe, slightly above 7%. So clearly, chasing those assets and paying those prices when there’s no value-add proposition to us really makes no sense. So we're focused on things where we think we can generate returns that exceed our long-term cost of capital. Like Don said, those are generally going to be bigger deals."

So this is a real opportunity for us at Santana to be able to re-tenant, re-merchandise that with a 2011, '12, '13 type of tenant that will be great for the future.

I'm not sure everybody knew that, frankly, in looking at that property. And so the ability to buy it at $68 million, which if it didn't have above market data, that property would have gone a lot higher than that.

First 3 months of 2011 were really quite strong at Federal, with reported FFO per share of $0.99 compared with $0.94 in the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. If you remember back in last year's first quar",1044,"Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. First 3 months of 2011 were really quite strong at Federal, with reported FFO per share of $0.99 compared with $0.94 in the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. If you remember back in last year's first quarter, we took about $0.05 a share hit for an early extinguishment of debt charge, but we also booked about $0.05 per share benefit from the end of the large lease termination fees from Home Depot. Those 2 transactions more or less were offset last year. And so with or without them, we'd still reporting a 5% increase this quarter.
Now let's did into the quarter a bit, 91 leases executed for 340,000 space and new average rents of $30.52, 11% higher than the $27.55 per foot that they replaced, Michael's replacing Foot Locker at Shopping Center and LA Fitness replacing Toys R Us at Shopping Center along with a couple of bank renewals led the increase. 
There are certainly still deals that we're making where rental rates are moving down. And in my opinion, there will continue to be deals like that for the foreseeable future, but those deals are making up a smaller and smaller percentage. For example in this first quarter, of the 91 comparable leases signed, 19 of them rolled rent down. Thus, 21% of all deals done resulted in lower rent going forward. Now when you go back and look at the past couple of years, however, we note that in 2009, 34% of the deals that we did rolled rent down and in 2010, 29% of them rolled rent down. That's a good trend. I'm hopeful that it will continue, although of course not necessarily in every quarter.
Occupancy the quarter remained flat with last year at 93.5%. It was up 30 basis points from year end at 93.2%. Wish I can say it's all positive from hereon out, but that's not the case as Borders closed 3 locations after the first quarter ended and Blockbuster closed the remaining 5 that they had with us. Together, that's over 100,000 square feet of vacancies that will be reflected in the next quarterly closing. And even with some pretty active new leasing going on within the portfolio, we'll almost certainly bring occupancy below 93% at June 30. On top of that, we still have one more operating Borders store in Pennsylvania and a couple of A&P Supermarkets whose future is questionable and will depend on the bankruptcy proceedings of those companies, so there is potential for additional pressure on occupancy.
Having said that, we've got some pretty positive leasing momentum under way portfolio-wise, but particularly on the West Coast. We believe that looking forward from the second quarter on, that we'll have more upside potential than downside risk in terms of occupancy.
The other important measure to look at is same-center growth, and those metrics are pretty good too. the quarter, same-center growth was 1.8% without redevelopment, and shows a negative 1.1% including redevelopment. we dig a little deeper, you'll see that, that negative 1.1% reflects a Home Depot lease termination fee last year that I mentioned earlier. Without it, same-store growth was 2.5%, pretty darn strong. 
let me talk about capital deployment a bit and give you an update on development and opportunities on the acquisition front. Let me start out west and tell you that at Santana, our ability to create significant value largely on the residential side is looking particularly promising. As Jeff noted out that 8 years after we opened the property, it has become a social and shopping hub in San Jose. As you may recall, we have entitlements to build 1,200 residential units on the site, the first 200 of which we converted to condos years ago, the next 300 we currently operate at luxury apartment, where upward pressure on rents brings future growth, leaving roughly 700 units left to build. Construction continues on budget, on time for the next 108 rental units -- rental apartments and we'll begin leasing over the summer with the first move in this fall. what we initially expected to be a 7% going-in yield is looking more like an 8% at that $34 million project. We're 1 month or 2 away from bringing plans for the next 200 units to the investment committee, with construction starting within the year. After that, we still have nearly 300 units to add.
We're also closing -- close to nailing down the contract for a sizable property acquisition on the West Coast, and redevelopment plans at West Gate Mall in Hollywood are taking shape. All in all, I feel very good about the future of our West Coast portfolio.
Coming back East, we closed on the acquisition of Tower Shops outside of Fort Lauderdale in the first quarter and an early indications of tenant interest is exceeding our expectations. That's going to be a good one. The real opportunities on the East Coast lies in the prospective development of Mid-Pike Plaza and Assembly Row in the next couple of years, both of which are progressing well at this point. Mid-Pike will of course provide better yield in the early phases, but longer-term possibility to Assembly are encouraging. First things first and that means the T Stop needs to be under construction under terms that we can live it. Earlier this week ago, the Massachusetts Transportation Authority officially put the T up for bid, another important step in a very critical process of getting public transportation to the site. would hope to have a strong indication of costs, terms and schedule on that in the next 90 days.  Plus the smaller redevelopment projects, many of them with a residential component, are moving well to the planning stages. 
In summary, despite what remains a very challenging retail leasing environment, it is an improving one and our path to future real estate value creation is becoming clearer and clearer. It will be Led by retail and nonretail development and retenanting opportunities, along with new raw material in the form of some powerful acquisitions.
That's all I've got for my prepared remarks this morning. I'd now turn the call  over to Andy and I look forward to your questions after that."

Federal Realty had a very solid first quarter based on steady occupancy a solid rent starts coming from strong lease rollover throughout economic downturn. I'll go through results, lay out the anticipated financial impact of the Borders and Blockbuster bankruptcies, talk a little bit about the balance sheet and then provide a few comments on our outlook and guidance.
Turning to our quarterly results. Rental income grew a solid 3% in the quarter, roughly half of which came from the same-center pool, with the rest coming from acquisition of Huntington Square last August and Tower Shops in January. Same-center rental income growth was driven by the year-over-year impact of redevelopment stabilizations including Hampden Lane in and rents starts including Neiman Marcus Last Call Studio and Matchbox at Congressional, strong quarter rental growth once again demonstrating the quality of our properties. 
Other property income declined by $3.8 million, largely coming from the final Home Depot lease term fee at Shopping Center at Philadelphia in the first quarter 2010. expenses were flat year-over-year, as lower expenses associated with snow were offset by smaller increases in real estate taxes. As Don discussed, same-center property operating income grew 1.8% excluding redevelopment, and was 2.5% including redevelopment after adjusting for the lease term fee in first quarter 2010.
Below the operating line, we saw decreases in net interest expense driven by the repayment of our term loan in the first quarter of 2010 and the associated $2.8 million charge for early extinguishment of debt as well as the repayment of our $75 million 4.5% notes in February 2011 utilizing our line of credit. First quarter 2011 results also include a positive $300,000 debt extinguishment impact associated with the early repayment of the mortgage debt assumed in the acquisition of Tower Shop.
G&A increased $600,000 through increases in acquisition and personnel costs, as we DID preliminary work in getting a number of future redevelopment opportunities up for execution. All in, FFO per share was $0.99 per share, up 5.3% versus first quarter 2010.
First quarter operating results included full rent and recovery charges at all 4 of our Borders and our 5 Blockbuster locations, totaling about $1 million in the quarter. With 3 of our 4 Borders locations and all 5 Blockbuster locations now closed, we'll have an incremental 103,000 square feet of vacancies starting in the second quarter and anticipate rent and recoveries totaling 600,000 for the remainder of 2011 from those spaces. These negatives will certainly be offset by positive impacts including year-over-year improvements from Hampden Lane and the Santana Row, most Dick's and Ross coming online in Escondido as well as a slew of other core lease deals. While we reaffirmed our 2011 guidance, we expect some lumpiness in our quarters to achieve the full year result.
With respect to the balance sheet, we implemented an aftermarket equity program in March and successfully issued 48 million of common equity in the quarter. We believe the ATM provides cost-effective access to capital, to fluid lease funds' smaller capital needs and we utilized that program to permanently fund a significant portion of the Tower Shops acquisition in the first quarter. 
Over the course of the quarter, we repaid $75 million 4 1/2% unsecured notes at maturity and we paid a $32 million federal deposit loan on April 29. We remain on track to recast the upsized credit facility in June and have been encouraged by the strong positive momentum in the pricing of credit facilities over the past few months.  The balance sheet remains in great shape, with strong leverage and coverage metrics and significant debt capacity, especially with respect to secured debt providing a competitive advantage when sourcing acquisition opportunities. 
With another quarter behind us, we're feeling more and more confident that our 2011 FFO per share growth will be comparable to what we saw in 2010, despite the negative impact of the bankruptcies that Don and I mentioned. As a result, we've are leaving our FFO per share guidance unchanged. Key drivers include: We continue to call for positive full year same-store property operating income growth, despite near-term declines in occupancy and an over $5 million decline in expected lease term fees. G&A will be higher in 2011 that in 2010, call it $0.5 million resulting from increased acquisition costs, personnel costs and early stage redevelopment expenses. 
Finally, we're calling for improvements in year-over-year net interest expense. largest portion of this results from the $3 million swing in early extinguishment of debt that we saw in the first quarter, but also anticipates the repayment of our notes and secured debt throughout the year. Operator, I'll now turn the call over to questions."

And that's -- all of that is kind of natural in a company that really focuses on the infill locations that we have. So yes, you look forward at over the next 5 to 7 years, and certainly the residential opportunities in terms of mixed-use and things like that, make some sense. But we're not going to go out there and -- we're not gonna go compete with the residential companies by buying purely residential projects. The difference is you'll see us maybe more willing to invest our capital in the residential component of the retail projects that we already have. I think the best way to say it is today, the residential income stream within the total rent stream of Federal is 7% or so. can certainly see that going up 10% or 11% or 12%, but we will always be a retail company."

Now our portfolio, as you know, it's very unique. It is infill. It does have some good demographics. And it does have a big advantage in that our and our are demonstrably lower than the comparable mall. Now they're higher in a lot of the other shopping centers companies, but it's a lot lower than the comparable mall. So from my perspective, to the extent we can truly use Michael's 26 years of history with General Growth and with Ralph's and with those relationships in the malls to make that pitch, whether you're talking about depending on compared to depending on city or White Marsh compared to the White Marsh Mall or a dozen other places like that throughout the country, having somebody with those relationships that we just don't have at the depth that Michael does, has to be able to create additional demand. And even if we don't pull those tenants out of the mall, we'll be creating more demand for our existing tenant against our existing tenants and may very well impact, should very well impact, our ability to renew existing tenants. So demand's a good, thing and we absolutely made, took a definitive step here With looking at our properties, looking at the advantages of our properties compared to the corresponding malls and we're going to try to create demand."

That really has been where we've seen a real change in the last 2.5 years. There were far more deals that were rolling down than are now. It's moderate. now on the other side, it's not like we're seeing big increases like we saw. Before, those increases are still lower.

Everything that we're building, and let's talk about Santana because that is biggest piece is being built at condo spec, and these are nice units. And I agree because we have costs back or land costs back in 1997, '98, 2000. You've got an advantage. We plan on certainly the units that we're building now, the 108 and probably the next set too at the appropriate time, monetizing and get paid for it. And when we started this, what we knew is that you can't time that exactly right. You never can. So to the extent we can rent them and even earn a 5.5% or 6% return until we can monetize with condos, we would. It's turning out that our timing is particularly good for once in Santana and we're able to get better rental yields. But the long-term plan is exactly as you had laid out. Secondly, with respect to NOI volatility, absolutely right. And one of the things that we pride ourselves on is taking this entire portfolio and running it for the purpose of creating a steadily growing income stream. And that means not relying too much on any one type, and that's apartment rentals stream falls right into that line. It will not be a huge part of the company. It will be a little bit bigger than it is today, but still small and the same applies to our retail. We do have lifestyle centers in here. We have grocery-anchored shopping centers in here. We have basically every kind of retail, other than malls, in here. And that diversity really does help us create the stability that we have, and we are very, very honed to make sure that in all of our business plans that, that's the product that we continue to offer.

First 3 months of 2011 were really quite strong at Federal, with reported FFO per share of $0.99 compared with $0.94 in the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. If you remember back in last year's first quar",1070,"Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. First 3 months of 2011 were really quite strong at Federal, with reported FFO per share of $0.99 compared with $0.94 in the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. If you remember back in last year's first quarter, we took about $0.05-a-share hit for an early extinguishment of debt charge, but we also booked a about $0.05-per-share benefit from the end of the large -- end of a large lease termination fee from Home Depot. Those 2 transactions, more or less, offset last year. And so, with or without them, we'd still be reporting about a 5% increase this quarter.
Now let's dig into the quarter a bit. 91 leases executed for 340,000 feet of space, and new average rents of $30.52, 11% higher than the $27.55 per foot that they replaced. Michaels is replacing Foot Locker at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center, and LA Fitness is replacing Toys R Us at Laurel Shopping Center, along with a couple of bank pad renewals led the increase. 
There are, certainly, still deals that we're making, where rental rates are moving down. And in my opinion, there will continue to be deals like that for the foreseeable future. But those deals are making up smaller and smaller percentage. 
For example, in this first quarter, of the 91 comparable leases signed, 19 of them rolled rent down. Thus, 21% of all deals done resulted in lower rent going forward. Now when you go back and look at the past couple of years, however, we note that in 2009, 34% of the deals that we did rolled rent down. And in 2010, 29% of them rolled rent down. 
That's a good trend. I'm hopeful that it will continue, although, of course, not necessarily in every quarter.
Occupancy in the quarter remained flat with last year at 93.5%. It was up 30 basis points from year-end at 93.2%. Wish I could say that it's all positive from hereon out, but that's not the case as Borders closed 3 locations after the first quarter ended and Blockbuster closed the remaining 5 that they had with us. 
Together, that's over 100,000 square feet of vacancies that will be reflected in the next quarterly closing. And even with some pretty active new leasing going on within the portfolio, we'll almost certainly bring occupancy below 93% at June 30. 
On top of that, we'd still have one more operating Borders store win in Pennsylvania and a couple of A&P Supermarkets, whose future is questionable, and will depend on the bankruptcy proceedings of those companies. And so, there is potential for additional pressure on occupancy.
But having said that, we've got some pretty positive leasing momentum under way, portfolio-wide, particularly on the West Coast. We believe that looking forward from the second quarter on, that we'll have more upside potential than downside risk in terms of occupancy.
The other important measure to look at is same-center growth, and those metrics are pretty good, too. The quarter, same-center growth was 1.8% without redevelopment and shows a negative 1.1% including redevelopment. If we dig a little deeper, you'll see that, that negative 1.1% reflects a Home Depot lease termination fee last year that I mentioned earlier. Without it, same-store growth was 2.5%, pretty darn strong.
Okay. Let me talk about capital deployment a bit and give you an update on development and opportunities on the acquisition front. Let me start out west and tell you that at Santana [Santana Row], our ability to create significant value, largely on the residential side, is looking particularly promising.  As Jeff noted out that 8 years after we opened the property, it has become the social and shopping hub of San Jose. 
As you may recall, we have entitlements to build 1,200 residential units on this site, the first 200 of which we converted to condos years ago. The next 300, we currently operate at as terrific luxury apartments, where upward pressure on rents brings great future growth, leaving roughly 700 units left to build. 
Construction continues on budget, on time for the next 108 rental units -- rental apartments, and we'll begin leasing over the summer, with the first move in this fall. What was initially expected to be a 7% going-in yield is looking more like an 8% at that $34 million project. 
We're 1 month or 2 away from bringing plans for the next 200 units set to investment committee, with construction starting within the year. After that, we still have nearly 300 units to add.
We're also closing -- close to nailing down the contract for a sizable property acquisition on the West Coast, and redevelopment plans at Westgate Mall in Hollywood are taking shape. All in all, I feel very good about the future of our West Coast portfolio.
Coming back East, we closed on the acquisition of Tower Shops outside of Fort Lauderdale in the first quarter and early indications of tenant interest is exceeding our expectations. That's going to be a good one. 
The real opportunities on the East Coast lies in the prospective development of Mid-Pike Plaza and Assembly Row in the next couple of years, both of which are progressing well at this point. Mid-Pike will, of course, provide better yields in the early phases, but longer-term possibility to Assembly are encouraging. 
Of course, first things first, and that means the T-Stop needs to get under construction under terms that we can live it. Earlier this week though, the Massachusetts Transportation Authority [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority] officially puts the T [T-Stop] out for bid, another important step in a very critical process of getting public transportation to the site. 
We would hope to have a strong indication of costs, terms and schedule on that in the next 90 days.  
Lots of smaller redevelopment projects. Many of them with a residential component are moving well to the planning stages, too.
In summary, despite what remains a very challenging retail leasing environment, it is an improving one and our path to future real estate value creation is becoming clearer and clearer. It will be led by retail and nonretail development and retenanting opportunities, along with new raw material in the form of some powerful acquisitions.
That's all I've got for my prepared remarks this morning. I'd now turn the call over to Andy, and I'll look forward to your questions after that."

Federal Realty had a very solid first quarter based on steady occupancy and solid rent starts coming from strong lease rollovers throughout the economic downturn. I'll go through results, lay out the anticipated financial impact of the Borders and Blockbuster bankruptcies, talk a little bit about the balance sheet and then, provide a few comments on our outlook and guidance.
Turning to our quarterly results. Rental income grew a solid 3% in the quarter, roughly half of which came from the same-center pool, with the rest coming from acquisition of Huntington Square last August and Tower Shops in January. 
Same-center rental income growth was driven by the year-over-year impact of redevelopment stabilizations including Hampden Lane in Bethesda and rents starts including Neiman Marcus Last Call Studio and Matchbox at Congressional [Congressional Plaza], strong quarter rental growth, once again, demonstrating the quality of our properties.
Other property income declined by $3.8 million, largely coming from the final Home Depot lease term fee at Flourtown Shopping Center at Philadelphia in first quarter 2010. 
Property expenses were flat year-over-year, as lower expenses associated with snow were offset by smaller increases in real estate taxes. As Don discussed, same-center property operating income grew 1.8%, excluding redevelopment, and was 2.5% including redevelopment after adjusting for the lease term fee in first quarter 2010.
Below the operating line, we saw decreases in net interest expense driven by the repayment of our term loan in first quarter 2010 and the associated $2.8 million charge for early extinguishment of debt, as well as the repayment of our $75 million 4.5% notes in February 2011, utilizing our line of credit. 
First quarter 2011 results also include a positive $300,000 debt extinguishment impact associated with the early repayment of the mortgage debt assumed in the acquisition of Tower Shop.
G&A increased $600,000 through increases in acquisition and personnel costs, as we did preliminary work in getting a number of those future redevelopment opportunities tuned up for execution. 
All in, FFO per share was $0.99 per share, up 5.3% versus first quarter 2010.
First quarter operating results included full rent and recovery charges at all 4 of our Borders and our 5 Blockbuster locations, totaling about $1 million in the quarter. With 3 of our 4 Borders locations and all 5 Blockbuster locations now closed, we'll have an incremental 103,000 square feet of vacancies starting in the second quarter and anticipate rent and recoveries totaling 600,000 for the remainder of 2011 from those spaces. 
These negatives will certainly be offset by positive impacts including year-over-year improvements from Hampden Lane in Bethesda and the 300 Santana Row, both most Dick's [Dick's Sporting Goods] and Ross coming online at Escondido, as well as a slew of other core lease deals. 
While we reaffirmed our 2011 guidance, we expect some lumpiness in our quarters to achieve the full year result.
With respect to the balance sheet, we implemented an aftermarket equity program in March and successfully issued 48 million of common equity in the quarter. We believe the ATM provides cost-effective access to capital, to fluid lease funds' smaller capital needs, and we utilized that program to permanently fund a significant portion of the Tower Shops acquisition in the first quarter.
Over the course of the quarter, we repaid $75 million 4 1/2% unsecured notes at maturity, and we paid the $32 million Federal Deposit loan on April 29. 
We remain on track to recast the upsized credit facility in June and have been encouraged by the strong positive momentum in the pricing of credit facilities over the past few months. 
The balance sheet remains in great shape, with strong leverage and coverage metrics and significant debt capacity, especially with respect to secured debt, providing a competitive advantage when sourcing acquisition opportunities. 
With another quarter behind us, we're feeling more and more confident that our 2011 FFO per share growth will be comparable to what we saw in 2010, despite the negative impact of the bankruptcies both Don and I mentioned. As a result, we're leaving our FFO per share guidance unchanged. 
Key drivers include: We continue to call for positive full year same-store property operating income growth, despite near-term declines in occupancy and an over $5 million decline in expected lease term fees; G&A will be higher in 2011 that in 2010, call it $500,000, resulting from increased acquisition costs, personnel costs and early stage redevelopment expenses. 
Finally, we're calling for improvements in year-over-year net interest expense. The largest portion of this results from the $3 million swing in early extinguishment of debt that we saw in the first quarter, but also anticipates the repayment of our notes and secured debt throughout the year. 
Operator, I'll now turn the call over to questions."

And that's -- all of that is kind of natural in a company that really focuses on the infill location sets that we have. So yes, you look forward at over the next 5 to 7 years, and certainly, the residential opportunities in terms of mixed-use and things like that, make some sense. But we're not going to go out there and -- we're not gonna go compete with the residential companies by buying purely residential projects. The difference is, you'll see us maybe more willing to invest our capital in the residential component of the retail projects that we already have. I think the best way to say it is today, our -- the residential income stream within the total rent stream of Federal is 7% or so. You can certainly see that going up 10% or 11% or 12%, but we will always be a retail company."

And it does have a big advantage in that tax, and our extras demonstrably lower than the comparable mall. Now they're higher, it's higher in a lot of the other shopping centers companies, so it's a lot lower than a comparable mall. So from my perspective, to the extent we can truly use Michael's 26 years of history with General Growth and with Ralph's and with those relationships in the malls to make that pitch, whether you're talking about depending on compared to depending on city or White Marsh compared to the White Marsh Mall or a dozen other places like that throughout the country, having somebody with those relationships that we just don't have to the depth that Michael does, thus to be able to create additional demand. And even if we don't pull those tenants out of the mall, we'll be creating more demand for our existing tenant against our existing tenants and may very well impact -- should very well impact our ability to renew existing tenants. So demand's a good thing and we absolutely made -- took a definitive step here.

That really has been where we've seen a real, the most of change in the last 2.5 years. There were far more deals that were rolling down than there are now. It's moderate. Now on the other side, it's not like we're seeing big increases like we saw before. Those increases are still lower.

Everything that we're building -- and let's talk about Santana because there is -- that is the biggest piece of -- that's being built at condo spec. And these are nice units. And I agree, because we have costs back or land costs back to 2000 -- 1997, '98, 2000. You've got -- we're on advantage. We plan on, certainly, the units that we're building now, the 108 and probably, the next set, too, at the appropriate time, monetize and get paid for it. And when we started this, what we knew is that you can't time that exactly right. You never can. So to the extent we can rent them and even earn a 5.5% or 6% return until we can monetize with condos, we would. It's turning out that our timing is particularly good, for once, in Santana, and we're able to get better rental yields. But the long-term plan is exactly as you had laid out. Secondly, with respect to NOI volatility, you're absolutely right. And one of the things that we pride ourselves on is taking this entire portfolio and running it for the purpose of creating a steadily growing income stream. And that means not relying too much on any one type, and that apartment rentals stream falls right into that line. It will not be a huge part of the company. It will be a little bit bigger than it is today, but still small. And the same applies to our retail side. We do have lifestyle centers in here. We have grocery-anchored shopping centers in here. We have basically every kind of retail, other than malls, in here. And that diversity really does help us create the stability that we have, and we're very, very honed to make sure that in all of our business plans that, that's the product that we continue to offer.

And I suspect if you talked to others that you would see a really big difference based on the demographics of the location of a particular property with respect to my comments. I suggest that I don't believe applies in those secondary and tertiary, where I don't think it's much better at all."

First 3 months of 2011 were really quite strong at Federal, with reported FFO per share of $0.99 compared with $0.94 in the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. If you remember back in last year's first quar",1071,"Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. First 3 months of 2011 were really quite strong at Federal, with reported FFO per share of $0.99 compared with $0.94 in the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. If you remember back in last year's first quarter, we took about $0.05-a-share hit for an early extinguishment of debt charge, but we also booked at about $0.05-per-share benefit from the end of the large -- end of a large lease termination fee from Home Depot. Those 2 transactions, more or less, offset last year. And so, with or without them, we'd still be reporting about a 5% increase this quarter.
Now let's dig into the quarter a bit. 91 leases executed for 340,000 feet of space, and new average rents of $30.52, 11% higher than the $27.55 per foot that they replaced. Michaels is replacing Foot Locker at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center, and LA Fitness is replacing Toys R Us at Laurel Shopping Center, along with a couple of bank pad renewals led the increase. 
There are, certainly, still deals that we're making, where rental rates are moving down. And in my opinion, there will continue to be deals like that for the foreseeable future. But those deals are making up smaller and smaller percentage. 
For example, in this first quarter, of the 91 comparable leases signed, 19 of them rolled rent down. Thus, 21% of all deals done resulted in lower rent going forward. Now when you go back and look at the past couple of years, however, we note that in 2009, 34% of the deals that we did rolled rent down. And in 2010, 29% of them rolled rent down. 
That's a good trend. I'm hopeful that it will continue, although, of course, not necessarily in every quarter.
Occupancy in the quarter remained flat with last year at 93.5%. It was up 30 basis points from year-end at 93.2%. Wish I could say that it's all positive from here on out, but that's not the case as Borders closed 3 locations after the first quarter ended and Blockbuster closed the remaining 5 that they had with us. 
Together, that's over 100,000 square feet of vacancies that will be reflected in the next quarterly closing. And even with some pretty active new leasing going on within the portfolio, we'll almost certainly bring occupancy below 93% at June 30. 
On top of that, we'd still have one more operating Borders store Winwood, Pennsylvania and a couple of A&P Supermarkets, whose future is questionable, and will depend on the bankruptcy proceedings of those companies. And so, there is potential for additional pressure on occupancy.
But having said that, we've got some pretty positive leasing momentum under way, portfolio-wide, particularly on the West Coast. We believe that looking forward from the second quarter on, that we'll have more upside potential than downside risk in terms of occupancy.
The other important measure to look at is same-center growth, and those metrics are pretty good, too. The quarter, same-center growth was 1.8% without redevelopment and shows a negative 1.1% including redevelopment. Or if we dig a little deeper, you'll see that, that negative 1.1% reflects a Home Depot lease termination fee last year that I mentioned earlier. Without it, same-store growth was 2.5%, pretty darn strong.
Okay. Let me talk about capital deployment a bit and give you an update on development and opportunities on the acquisition front. Let me start out west and tell you that at Santana [Santana Row], our ability to create significant value, largely on the residential side, is looking particularly promising.  As Jeff noted out that 8 years after we opened the property, it has become the social and shopping hub of San Jose. 
As you may recall, we have entitlements to build 1,200 residential units on this site, the first 200 of which we converted to condos years ago. The next 300, we currently operate at as terrific luxury apartments, where upward pressure on rents brings great future growth, leaving roughly 700 units left to build. 
Construction continues on budget, on time for the next 108 rental units -- rental apartments, and we'll begin leasing over the summer, with the first move ins this fall. What was initially expected to be a 7% going-in yield is looking more like an 8% at that $34 million project. 
We're 1 month or 2 away from bringing plans for the next 200 units set to investment committee, with construction starting within the year. After that, we still have nearly 300 units to add.
We're also closing -- close to nailing down the contract for a sizable property acquisition on the West Coast, and redevelopment plans at Westgate Mall in Hollywood are taking shape. All in all, I feel very good about the future of our West Coast portfolio.
Coming back East, we closed on the acquisition of Tower Shops outside of Fort Lauderdale in the first quarter and early indications of tenant interest is exceeding our expectations. That's going to be a good one. 
The real opportunities on the East Coast lie in the prospective development of Mid-Pike Plaza and Assembly Row in the next couple of years, both of which are progressing well at this point. Mid-Pike will, of course, provide better yields in the early phases, but longer-term possibilities at Assembly are encouraging. 
Of course, first things first, and that means the T-Stop needs to get under construction under terms that we can live it. Earlier this week though, the Massachusetts Transportation Authority [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority] officially puts the T [T-Stop] out for bid, another important step in a very critical process of getting public transportation to the site. 
We would hope to have a strong indication of costs, terms and schedule on that in the next 90 days.  
Lots of smaller redevelopment projects. Many of them with a residential component are moving well through the planning stages, too.
In summary, despite what remains a very challenging retail leasing environment, it is an improving one and our path to future real estate value creation is becoming clearer and clearer. It will be led by retail and nonretail development and retenanting opportunities, along with new raw material in the form of some powerful acquisitions.
That's all I've got for my prepared remarks this morning. I'd now turn the call over to Andy, and I'll look forward to your questions after that."
271305,129299528,124181,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 06, 2011",2011-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don.

Federal Realty had a very solid first quarter based on steady occupancy and solid rent starts coming from strong lease rollovers throughout the economic downturn. I'll go through results, lay out the anticipated financial impact of the Borders and Blockbuster bankruptcies, talk a little bit about the balance sheet and then, provide a few comments on our outlook and guidance.
Turning to our quarterly results. Rental income grew a solid 3% in the quarter, roughly half of which came from the same-center pool, with the rest coming from acquisition of Huntington Square last August and Tower Shops in January. 
Same-center rental income growth was driven by the year-over-year impact of redevelopment stabilizations including Hampden Lane in Bethesda and rents starts including Neiman Marcus Last Call Studio and Matchbox at Congressional [Congressional Plaza], strong core rental growth, once again, demonstrating the quality of our properties.
Other property income declined by $3.8 million, largely coming from the final Home Depot lease term fee at Flourtown Shopping Center at Philadelphia in first quarter 2010. 
Property expenses were flat year-over-year, as lower expenses associated with snow were offset by smaller increases in real estate taxes. As Don discussed, same-center property operating income grew 1.8%, excluding redevelopment, and was 2.5% including redevelopment after adjusting for the lease term fee in first quarter 2010.
Below the operating line, we saw decreases in net interest expense driven by the repayment of our term loan in first quarter 2010 and the associated $2.8 million charge for early extinguishment of debt, as well as the repayment of our $75 million 4.5% notes in February 2011, utilizing our line of credit. 
First quarter 2011 results also include a positive $300,000 debt extinguishment impact associated with the early repayment of the mortgage debt assumed in the acquisition of Tower Shop.
G&A increased $600,000 through increases in acquisition and personnel costs, as we did preliminary work in getting a number of those future redevelopment opportunities tuned up for execution. 
All in, FFO per share was $0.99 per share, up 5.3% versus first quarter 2010.
First quarter operating results included full rent and recovery charges at all 4 of our Borders and our 5 Blockbuster locations, totaling about $1 million in the quarter. With 3 of our 4 Borders locations and all 5 Blockbuster locations now closed, we'll have an incremental 103,000 square feet of vacancies starting in the second quarter and anticipate rent and recoveries totaling 600,000 for the remainder of 2011 from those spaces. 
These negatives will certainly be offset by positive impacts including year-over-year improvements from Hampden Lane in Bethesda and the 300 Santana Row, both most Dick's [Dick's Sporting Goods] and Ross coming online at Escondido, as well as a slew of other core lease deals. 
While we reaffirmed our 2011 guidance, we expect some lumpiness in our quarters to achieve the full year result.
With respect to the balance sheet, we implemented an at-the-market equity program in March and successfully issued 48 million of common equity in the quarter. We believe the ATM provides cost-effective access to capital, to fluid lease funds' smaller capital needs, and we utilized that program to permanently fund a significant portion of the Tower Shops acquisition in the first quarter.
Over the course of the quarter, we repaid the $75 million 4 1/2% unsecured notes at maturity, and repaid the $32 million Federal Deposit loan on April 29. 
We remain on track to recast the upsized credit facility in June and have been encouraged by the strong positive momentum in the pricing of credit facilities over the past few months. 
The balance sheet remains in great shape, with strong leverage and coverage metrics and significant debt capacity, especially with respect to secured debt, providing a competitive advantage when sourcing acquisition opportunities. 
With another quarter behind us, we're feeling more and more confident that our 2011 FFO per share growth will be comparable to what we saw in 2010, despite the negative impact of the bankruptcies both Don and I mentioned. As a result, we're leaving our FFO per share guidance unchanged. 
Key drivers include: We continue to call for positive full year same-store property operating income growth, despite near-term declines in occupancy and an over $5 million decline in expected lease term fees; G&A will be higher in 2011 than in 2010, call it $500,000, resulting from increased acquisition costs, personnel costs and early stage redevelopment expenses. 
Finally, we're calling for improvements in year-over-year net interest expense. The largest portion of this results from the $3 million swing in early extinguishment of debt that we saw in the first quarter, but also anticipates the repayment of our notes and secured debt throughout the year. 
Operator, I'll now turn the call over to questions."

So yes, you look forward at over the next 5 to 7 years, and certainly, the residential opportunities in terms of mixed-use and things like that, make some sense. But we're not going to go out there and -- we're not going to go compete with the residential companies by buying purely residential projects. The difference is, you'll see us maybe more willing to invest our capital in the residential component of the retail projects that we already have. I think the best way to say it is today, our -- the residential income stream within the total rent stream of Federal is 7% or so. You can certainly see that going up 10% or 11% or 12%, but we will always be a retail company."

And if you're over-retailed, the first thing -- you can't just hit the supply side, you got to hit the demand side. And Michael is all about creating demand within our portfolio. Now our portfolio, as you know, was very unique. It is infill. It does have to have some good demographics. And it does have a big advantage in that our--tax, and our extras are demonstrably lower than the comparable mall. Now they're higher, it's higher in a lot of the other shopping centers companies, so it's a lot lower than a comparable mall. So from my perspective, to the extent we can truly use Michael's 26 years of history with General Growth and with Ralph's and with those relationships in the malls to make that pitch, whether you're talking about Pentagon Row compared to Pentagon City or White Marsh compared to the White Marsh Mall or a dozen other places like that throughout the country, having somebody with those relationships that we just don't have to the depth that Michael does, thus to be able to create additional demand. And even if we don't pull those tenants out of the mall, we'll be creating more demand for our existing tenant against our existing tenants and may very well impact -- should very well impact our ability to renew existing tenants. So demand's a good thing and we absolutely made -- took a definitive step here. With looking at our properties, looking at the advantage of our properties compared to the corresponding malls and we're going to try to create demand."

That really has been where we've seen a real, demonstrable change in the last 2.5 years. There were far more deals that were rolling down than there are now. It's moderate. Now on the other side, it's not like we're seeing big increases like we saw before. Those increases are still lower.

Everything that we're building -- and let's talk about Santana because there is -- that is the biggest piece of -- that's being built at condo spec. And these are nice units. And I agree, because we have costs back or land costs back to 2000 -- 1997, '98, 2000. You've got -- we're at an advantage. We plan on, certainly, the units that we're building now, the 108 and probably, the next set, too, at the appropriate time, monetize and get paid for it. And when we started this, what we knew is that you can't time that exactly right. You never can. So to the extent we can rent them and even earn a 5.5% or 6% return until we can monetize with condos, we would. It's turning out that our timing is particularly good, for once, in Santana, and we're able to get better rental yields. But the long-term plan is exactly as you had laid out. Secondly, with respect to NOI volatility, you're absolutely right. And one of the things that we pride ourselves on is taking this entire portfolio and running it for the purpose of creating a steadily growing income stream. And that means not relying too much on any one type, and that apartment rentals stream falls right into that line. It will not be a huge part of the company. It will be a little bit bigger than it is today, but still small. And the same applies to our retail side. We do have lifestyle centers in here. We have grocery-anchored shopping centers in here. We have basically every kind of retail, other than malls, in here. And that diversity really does help us create the stability that we have, and we're very, very honed to make sure that in all of our business plans that, that's the product that we continue to offer.

So we are having a much better set of circumstances in being able to renew them. Now most of them, as I was saying before, are not being renewed at anywhere near the increases that they were last year, in the good old days if you will. But they are much less likely to go away.

First 3 months of 2011 were really quite strong at Federal, with reported FFO per share of $0.99 compared with $0.94 in the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. If you remember back in last year's first quar",1071,"Thanks, Gina, and good morning, everyone. First 3 months of 2011 were really quite strong at Federal, with reported FFO per share of $0.99 compared with $0.94 in the first quarter of last year, a 5% increase. If you remember back in last year's first quarter, we took about $0.05-a-share hit for an early extinguishment of debt charge, but we also booked at about $0.05-per-share benefit from the end of the large -- end of a large lease termination fee from Home Depot. Those 2 transactions, more or less, offset last year. And so, with or without them, we'd still be reporting about a 5% increase this quarter.
Now let's dig into the quarter a bit. 91 leases executed for 340,000 feet of space, and new average rents of $30.52, 11% higher than the $27.55 per foot that they replaced. Michaels is replacing Foot Locker at Bala Cynwyd Shopping Center, and LA Fitness is replacing Toys R Us at Laurel Shopping Center, along with a couple of bank pad renewals led the increase. 
There are, certainly, still deals that we're making, where rental rates are moving down. And in my opinion, there will continue to be deals like that for the foreseeable future. But those deals are making up smaller and smaller percentage. 
For example, in this first quarter, of the 91 comparable leases signed, 19 of them rolled rent down. Thus, 21% of all deals done resulted in lower rent going forward. Now when you go back and look at the past couple of years, however, we note that in 2009, 34% of the deals that we did rolled rent down. And in 2010, 29% of them rolled rent down. 
That's a good trend. I'm hopeful that it will continue, although, of course, not necessarily in every quarter.
Occupancy in the quarter remained flat with last year at 93.5%. It was up 30 basis points from year-end at 93.2%. Wish I could say that it's all positive from here on out, but that's not the case as Borders closed 3 locations after the first quarter ended and Blockbuster closed the remaining 5 that they had with us. 
Together, that's over 100,000 square feet of vacancies that will be reflected in the next quarterly closing. And even with some pretty active new leasing going on within the portfolio, we'll almost certainly bring occupancy below 93% at June 30. 
On top of that, we'd still have one more operating Borders store Winwood, Pennsylvania and a couple of A&P Supermarkets, whose future is questionable, and will depend on the bankruptcy proceedings of those companies. And so, there is potential for additional pressure on occupancy.
But having said that, we've got some pretty positive leasing momentum under way, portfolio-wide, particularly on the West Coast. We believe that looking forward from the second quarter on, that we'll have more upside potential than downside risk in terms of occupancy.
The other important measure to look at is same-center growth, and those metrics are pretty good, too. The quarter, same-center growth was 1.8% without redevelopment and shows a negative 1.1% including redevelopment. Or if we dig a little deeper, you'll see that, that negative 1.1% reflects a Home Depot lease termination fee last year that I mentioned earlier. Without it, same-store growth was 2.5%, pretty darn strong.
Okay. Let me talk about capital deployment a bit and give you an update on development and opportunities on the acquisition front. Let me start out west and tell you that at Santana [Santana Row], our ability to create significant value, largely on the residential side, is looking particularly promising.  As Jeff noted out that 8 years after we opened the property, it has become the social and shopping hub of San Jose. 
As you may recall, we have entitlements to build 1,200 residential units on this site, the first 200 of which we converted to condos years ago. The next 300, we currently operate at as terrific luxury apartments, where upward pressure on rents brings great future growth, leaving roughly 700 units left to build. 
Construction continues on budget, on time for the next 108 rental units -- rental apartments, and we'll begin leasing over the summer, with the first move ins this fall. What was initially expected to be a 7% going-in yield is looking more like an 8% at that $34 million project. 
We're 1 month or 2 away from bringing plans for the next 200 units set to investment committee, with construction starting within the year. After that, we still have nearly 300 units to add.
We're also closing -- close to nailing down the contract for a sizable property acquisition on the West Coast, and redevelopment plans at Westgate Mall in Hollywood are taking shape. All in all, I feel very good about the future of our West Coast portfolio.
Coming back East, we closed on the acquisition of Tower Shops outside of Fort Lauderdale in the first quarter and early indications of tenant interest is exceeding our expectations. That's going to be a good one. 
The real opportunities on the East Coast lie in the prospective development of Mid-Pike Plaza and Assembly Row in the next couple of years, both of which are progressing well at this point. Mid-Pike will, of course, provide better yields in the early phases, but longer-term possibilities at Assembly are encouraging. 
Of course, first things first, and that means the T-Stop needs to get under construction under terms that we can live it. Earlier this week though, the Massachusetts Transportation Authority [Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority] officially puts the T [T-Stop] out for bid, another important step in a very critical process of getting public transportation to the site. 
We would hope to have a strong indication of costs, terms and schedule on that in the next 90 days.  
Lots of smaller redevelopment projects. Many of them with a residential component are moving well through the planning stages, too.
In summary, despite what remains a very challenging retail leasing environment, it is an improving one and our path to future real estate value creation is becoming clearer and clearer. It will be led by retail and nonretail development and retenanting opportunities, along with new raw material in the form of some powerful acquisitions.
That's all I've got for my prepared remarks this morning. I'd now turn the call over to Andy, and I'll look forward to your questions after that."
271305,129299528,124381,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q1 2011 Earnings Call, May 06, 2011",2011-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don.

Federal Realty had a very solid first quarter based on steady occupancy and solid rent starts coming from strong lease rollovers throughout the economic downturn. I'll go through results, lay out the anticipated financial impact of the Borders and Blockbuster bankruptcies, talk a little bit about the balance sheet and then, provide a few comments on our outlook and guidance.
Turning to our quarterly results. Rental income grew a solid 3% in the quarter, roughly half of which came from the same-center pool, with the rest coming from acquisition of Huntington Square last August and Tower Shops in January. 
Same-center rental income growth was driven by the year-over-year impact of redevelopment stabilizations including Hampden Lane in Bethesda and rents starts including Neiman Marcus Last Call Studio and Matchbox at Congressional [Congressional Plaza], strong core rental growth, once again, demonstrating the quality of our properties.
Other property income declined by $3.8 million, largely coming from the final Home Depot lease term fee at Flourtown Shopping Center at Philadelphia in first quarter 2010. 
Property expenses were flat year-over-year, as lower expenses associated with snow were offset by smaller increases in real estate taxes. As Don discussed, same-center property operating income grew 1.8%, excluding redevelopment, and was 2.5% including redevelopment after adjusting for the lease term fee in first quarter 2010.
Below the operating line, we saw decreases in net interest expense driven by the repayment of our term loan in first quarter 2010 and the associated $2.8 million charge for early extinguishment of debt, as well as the repayment of our $75 million 4.5% notes in February 2011, utilizing our line of credit. 
First quarter 2011 results also include a positive $300,000 debt extinguishment impact associated with the early repayment of the mortgage debt assumed in the acquisition of Tower Shop.
G&A increased $600,000 through increases in acquisition and personnel costs, as we did preliminary work in getting a number of those future redevelopment opportunities tuned up for execution. 
All in, FFO per share was $0.99 per share, up 5.3% versus first quarter 2010.
First quarter operating results included full rent and recovery charges at all 4 of our Borders and our 5 Blockbuster locations, totaling about $1 million in the quarter. With 3 of our 4 Borders locations and all 5 Blockbuster locations now closed, we'll have an incremental 103,000 square feet of vacancies starting in the second quarter and anticipate rent and recoveries totaling 600,000 for the remainder of 2011 from those spaces. 
These negatives will certainly be offset by positive impacts including year-over-year improvements from Hampden Lane in Bethesda and the 300 Santana Row, both most Dick's [Dick's Sporting Goods] and Ross coming online at Escondido, as well as a slew of other core lease deals. 
While we reaffirmed our 2011 guidance, we expect some lumpiness in our quarters to achieve the full year result.
With respect to the balance sheet, we implemented an at-the-market equity program in March and successfully issued 48 million of common equity in the quarter. We believe the ATM provides cost-effective access to capital, to fluid lease funds' smaller capital needs, and we utilized that program to permanently fund a significant portion of the Tower Shops acquisition in the first quarter.
Over the course of the quarter, we repaid the $75 million 4 1/2% unsecured notes at maturity, and repaid the $32 million Federal Deposit loan on April 29. 
We remain on track to recast the upsized credit facility in June and have been encouraged by the strong positive momentum in the pricing of credit facilities over the past few months. 
The balance sheet remains in great shape, with strong leverage and coverage metrics and significant debt capacity, especially with respect to secured debt, providing a competitive advantage when sourcing acquisition opportunities. 
With another quarter behind us, we're feeling more and more confident that our 2011 FFO per share growth will be comparable to what we saw in 2010, despite the negative impact of the bankruptcies both Don and I mentioned. As a result, we're leaving our FFO per share guidance unchanged. 
Key drivers include: We continue to call for positive full year same-store property operating income growth, despite near-term declines in occupancy and an over $5 million decline in expected lease term fees; G&A will be higher in 2011 than in 2010, call it $500,000, resulting from increased acquisition costs, personnel costs and early stage redevelopment expenses. 
Finally, we're calling for improvements in year-over-year net interest expense. The largest portion of this results from the $3 million swing in early extinguishment of debt that we saw in the first quarter, but also anticipates the repayment of our notes and secured debt throughout the year. 
Operator, I'll now turn the call over to questions."

And even some of the redevelopment projects that we have in our shopping centers like Congressional Plaza, we're looking hard now at adding another residential component to the back at Congressional Plaza. And that's -- all of that is kind of natural in a company that really focuses on the infill location sites that we have. So yes, you look forward at over the next 5 to 7 years, and certainly, the residential opportunities in terms of mixed-use and things like that, make some sense. But we're not going to go out there and -- we're not going to go compete with the residential companies by buying purely residential projects. The difference is, you'll see us maybe more willing to invest our capital in the residential component of the retail projects that we already have. I think the best way to say it is today, our -- the residential income stream within the total rent stream of Federal is 7% or so. You can certainly see that going up 10% or 11% or 12%, but we will always be a retail company."

And it does have a big advantage in that our--tax, and our extras are demonstrably lower than the comparable mall. Now they're higher, it's higher in a lot of the other shopping centers companies, so it's a lot lower than a comparable mall. So from my perspective, to the extent we can truly use Michael's 26 years of history with General Growth and with Ralph's and with those relationships in the malls to make that pitch, whether you're talking about Pentagon Row compared to Pentagon City or White Marsh compared to the White Marsh Mall or a dozen other places like that throughout the country, having somebody with those relationships that we just don't have to the depth that Michael does, thus to be able to create additional demand. And even if we don't pull those tenants out of the mall, we'll be creating more demand for our existing tenant against our existing tenants and may very well impact -- should very well impact our ability to renew existing tenants. So demand's a good thing and we absolutely made -- took a definitive step here.

That really has been where we've seen a real, demonstrable change in the last 2.5 years. There were far more deals that were rolling down than there are now. It's moderate. Now on the other side, it's not like we're seeing big increases like we saw before. Those increases are still lower.

We plan on, certainly, the units that we're building now, the 108 and probably, the next set, too, at the appropriate time, monetize and get paid for it. And when we started this, what we knew is that you can't time that exactly right. You never can. So to the extent we can rent them and even earn a 5.5% or 6% return until we can monetize with condos, we would. It's turning out that our timing is particularly good, for once, in Santana, and we're able to get better rental yields. But the long-term plan is exactly as you had laid out. Secondly, with respect to NOI volatility, you're absolutely right. And one of the things that we pride ourselves on is taking this entire portfolio and running it for the purpose of creating a steadily growing income stream. And that means not relying too much on any one type, and that apartment rentals stream falls right into that line. It will not be a huge part of the company. It will be a little bit bigger than it is today, but still small. And the same applies to our retail side. We do have lifestyle centers in here. We have grocery-anchored shopping centers in here. We have basically every kind of retail, other than malls, in here. And that diversity really does help us create the stability that we have, and we're very, very honed to make sure that in all of our business plans that, that's the product that we continue to offer.

At $1.2 of FFO per share reported during the second quarter, compared with $0.98 last year, we are very pleased with our operating performance thus far in 2011. That bodes well for the rest of the year, as I will touch on in a minute. The reported FFO per share would have been $0.03 higher but for the accounting requirement to treat over $2 million of interest income that we received in the quarter as a gain reported in discontinued operations and therefore not part of FFO. That interest income represented past earnings on our Norwalk, Connecticut loan to a Shopping Center development partner that we thought was uncollectible in the depths of the recession. Turns out it was collectible. As a new capital partner brought us current. That's a good sign for the overall commercial real estate development market and was certainly good for federal. Not only was FFO per share strong but so is our internal growth at 1.5% excluding redevelopment and 1.6% including it. What's particularly noteworthy given the amount of space that's out of service is developments in our increasingly full pipeline gear up. Lease rollover growth on comparable spaces was solid at 6% on a cash basis with 16% straight line. In all, we signed 86 new or renewal leases for a total of 370,000 feet and averaged first year cash rents of $28.21 compared with $26.64 for the last year of the expiring lease. I'll note a new grocery deal to replace an underperforming safely at Westgate Mall in Northern California and a strong LA fitness deal replacing our last remaining Circuit City box at [indiscernible] shopping center underpin the quarter. We did report a decrease in occupancy but that was expected given the 100,000 square feet of Borders and blockbuster closings that were inevitable. As I said in my remarks last quarter, the closing of 3 Borders locations and all of our remaining Blockbuster video stores in 2Q couldn't help but bring down occupancy at June 30. We came in at 93.4% leased, down 40 from bps from the 93.8% that we reported in the first quarter, all due to those retailers. I also said last quarter that I believe that June 30 would likely be at or near the watermark for the unleased space in the portfolio and that we have more upside potential than downside risk at this point. That's still the case. I think you'll start to see increases to the lease percentage by year end. On Borders locations, Rockwell Pike in Chevy Chase, Maryland, Santana Row and Old Town, Los Gatos, California are all A+ locations and won't be hard to release at stronger rents than Borders weren't paying. We're pretty far down the road in tenant discussions in all of them. A final Borders location on Philadelphia's MainLine in Winwood, Pennsylvania will also close the next couple of months and we need to get moving on replacing them but also expect strong interest there. Operationally, the second quarter was quite strong and that bodes well for the guidance we're going to provide for the rest of the year. Let's Talk about that for a minute. We have increased/raised our guidance, our 2011 guidance, to a range of $3.99 to $4.04 from the existing guidance of $3.95 to $4.02 and with that, we'll also raise our dividend rates for the 44th consecutive year. I couldn't be more thrilled than to be able to raise guidance and the dividend based primarily on favorable results and trends in tenant leasing and reduced bad debt exposure. Andrew will go through a rationale and more specifics on that in a few minutes. But the point that I think is critical for investors to understand is that the increase in earnings guidance is possible, despite very heavy investment and acquisition and development projects that hit the current P&L for the benefit of future periods. 
Let me explain. For the last couple of years, with  the emphasis primarily on maintaining tenancy and trying to figure out where future rents were going to fallout, it's been hard to make developments and redevelopments pencil. And as you know, new acquisition opportunities that made any financial sense far between. It's been particularly deployed capital but that's changing a bit, particularly on the development side and we currently got a lot in the pipeline. For illustrative purposes, let's assume that Federal reports an even $4 per share of FFO in 2011, which by the way would be an all-time record. On its face, that would compare favorably to the record $3.88 that we reported last year, 3% growth, even know last year was held by nearly $0.05 per share Home Depot lease termination fees that we talked about ad nauseaum for the past 5 quarters. If we dig a little deeper, you'd see that our current results include lots of hits to the P&L, reflecting the dramatic increase in productive acquisition and development activity in 2011 versus 2010. The overall improvement in the commercial real estate landscape and strong locations has allowed us to make financial sense of future projects like Assembly Square, like Mid-Pike Plaza, the Malling of Little Lawn in Richmond and residential department at Santana Row. All of those development projects have either broken around or will shortly and necessitate the requisite tenant downtime demolition and our expensive marketing initiatives to get them properly established. Expense acquisition costs like those at Tower Shops early in the year and a bunch more potential acquisition in Southern California hit us today but don't benefit us till the future. Also, between the expense acquisition costs that dramatically increase marketing costs in Assembly Mid-Pike, Santana Residential and others, along with demo costs and lost rent at projects like Will a lawn and Bala Cynwyd hit or will hit FFO for the quarter and the full year by $0.02 and $0.06, respectively, more than the comparable 2010 periods. Yet despite this, we're still reporting FFO growth that takes us to record numbers. 2012 will still include heavy upfront costs and as Mid-Pike and Assembly get under way but the future looks very bright to us. 
Finally, let me bring you up to speed on where we're deploying capital these days. At Santana Row, leasing is underway on our $34 million 108-unit luxury rental building and our expected 7% yield will more likely be an 8% maybe even a 9% at the end of the day. Residential rents are that strong at Santana. Earlier in the week, our board approved a new $70 million investment in the next 216 residential units there at an expected stabilized yield of 7%. After both of those projects are complete, we still hope to build an additional 150 or so apartments, as well as additional 80,000 square feet of retail and 200,000 square feet of office at Santana. We would hope to have Santana Row nearly fully built out in the next 4 years, market conditions permitting of course. 
In addition, we're close to approving another project for an additional 132-unit residential building costing an estimated $30 million to $34 million at Congressional Plaza in Rockville, a land adjacent to our headquarters. Progress at Assembly continues on all fronts with P stop bids expected back shortly. I think actually August 10 is when they're due back in. We hope to announce a strong theater deal as our first signed lease in the coming months and we expect to be able to announce cost, yield and timing expectations also in the coming months. For preliminary planning purposes though, assume the first phase requiring $120 million to $130 million from Federal, not including of course Avalon Base's apartment investment. Similarly, planning work at Mid-Pike continues unabated. We'll have to come up with a name for the project before long, where the first phase construction start plan for about a year from now. We are refining cost, yield and timing assumptions now but again, for planning purposes, assume a first phase capital requirements of $225 million to $250 million. Lots of other redevelopment projects, either underway like Little Lawn and Bala Cynwyd or in the planning stages but it's certainly clear that we've got a strong pipeline of value creative opportunities that certainly depress accounting earnings in the short term debt but add long-term, strong long-term value to this portfolio. On the acquisition front, just a few Ts to cross and Is to dot before we acquire a controlling interest in the Southern California retail center called Plaza El Segundo, along with an adjacent retail development opportunity. Plaza El Segundo and a redevelopment partial make up 45 acres at the corner of Rosecrans and Sepulveda Boulevard in El Segundo, California and currently comprise 380,000 square feet of great retail anchored by tenants like Whole Foods, Anthropology and coming soon, H&M. I can't really provide more specifics at this point because we're not fully there yet on the deal but the prospect of a West Coast presence that includes such icons as Santana Row, Third Street Promenade, Westgate Mall and Plaza El Segundo, very exciting to us. So that's it for my prepared remarks. We're Really happy with the way the portfolio is performing and with a potential to grow and create more value. Things are certainly not great in every shopping center and every market. And frankly, i can't remember a time when there has been as much separation as there is today in the outlook of specific retail destinations. Location and a proven track record doesn't take a backseat to anything. Look forward to answering your questions following Andy's remarks."

I'll put a little finer point in our results, talk about our recent line of credit recast, discuss the increase in the dividend and then provide a few comments in our improved guidance. Before doing that, I want to point to our expanded redevelopment disclosure in the supplement. We've added clarity in a few of the bigger projects that Don discussed to stabilize after 2012, specifically Assembly Row and the new residential project at Santana Row. These projects have been approved internally and are being actively pursued by the trust. We will add additional larger projects as we work through the approval process and these will be an addition to regular flow of smaller redevelopment and those out years as well. We believe this disclosure provides a better roadmap for modeling future value creation for the trust. Turning to results. Rental income increased 2.6% from last year's second quarter coming from the core same-center portfolio, from a redevelopment property, specifically hand lane at 300 Santana Row at Escondido and also from our acquisitions of hunting and square and Tower Shops. We also saw pretty significant uptick in percentage rent this quarter as a result of better sales performance from a number of tenants, specifically at Santana, and Shirlington. This is a great demonstration of how the economy isn't hitting all retail people equally and the highest quality locations, while not immune, certainly continue to demonstrate their strength. We expect this trend to continue. Other property income remained soft on a comparative basis due to lower lease term fees. Comparisons on a year-to-date basis are very tough as other property income is down over $4 million to a level half of our year-to-date 2010 results. Recall, that we do include lease termination fees and our same-center property operating income comparison. So that was a drag on the same-store growth of positive 1.5%, excluding redevelopment and positive 1.6%, including redevelopment that we reported in the quarter. X the lease termination fees, our same-store NOI growth would have been 2.3% for the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. day basis. Rental expenses were essentially flat as we recorded 1.4 million less in bad debt expense versus second quarter 2010. Bad debt was at the lowest level we've seen since 2007 with no significant new tenant additions to our allowance and collections from a number of tenants that we had previously deemed uncollectible. In addition, rental expense benefited from the bio  to ground leases under Pentagon in late 2010, a portion of this benefit is offset by higher interest expense when you get. As Don discussed, these rental expense improvements were offset by increased demolition costs, as well as increased marketing expenses at assembly. Interest expense declined $1.5 million versus second quarter tab, benefiting from a 60 basis points year-over-year decline in weighted average rate, partially offset by higher weighted average balances. Capital expenditures in the quarter included the retirement of $37 million of higher cost mortgage debt at a 6.8% weighted average rate on Federal Plaza in Tyson Station. An redevelopment spending at the 18 unit residential building at Santana Row and a variety of other redevelopment projects, which were funded with accommodation of additional line usage and equity issued through the ATM. Turning to balance sheet for a moment, we issued another $42.2 million of equity under the ATM at a net price of $85.51 per share in the quarter, bringing your total for the year to $90.1 million. We continue to believe in maintaining a consistent approach to debt versus equity to keep our balance sheet metrics in line. In early July, we recast our expiring $300 million credit facility with the new 4-year $400 million credit facility with-year extension option. The quality of Federal Realty's property, strategy and management drove $700 million of demand and this significant oversubscription allowed us to tighten pricing to LIBOR plus 115 basis points at our Baa 1 BBB+ rating. This pricing represents a new tightening in the recent REIT market as demonstrated by pricing levels for us at BBB+, which were equal to or through A- minus pricing levels for high-quality REIT deals that had been executed in the prior month. 
With no additional debt maturities until mid- 2012, enviable credit metrics and significant debt capacity, we remain in great shape to fund appropriate acquisition, redevelopment and development activities through both a fixed income and equity markets at attractive pricing levels. Based on the quality of our results, our improving outlook and the strength of our balance sheet, the Board of Trustees voted to raise the quarterly dividend by $0.02 this year as opposed to the $0.01 that we raised in both '09 and 10. 2011 represents the 44th consecutive year that Federal Realty has been able to raise a dividend, a record in the REIT sector and amongst the longest such streaks of all publicly traded companies in the United States. We've raised every year since 1967. We've always paid in cash and our dividend record is certainly a point of significant pride for our employees, management and our Board. I think this record is the greatest indicator of the quality of what we own, the dedicated focus on how we operate it and long-term consistency that comes with our disciplined approach. 
Finally, we raised our 2011 FFO per share guidance from $3.95 to $4.02 to a new range of $3.99 to $4.04, based on our strong performance and improving outlook. Some key points to note in our improved guidance include: despite increased vacancy in the portfolio: we are calling for 2011 same center property operating income growth in the 1% to 1.5% range, which includes a year-over-year decline in lease termination fees of $5 million and over $2 million more in demolition costs and marketing expenses associated with development activities at Santana Row, Mid-Pike, as well as a slew of other smaller pre-development projects in the same center pool. These decreases will be more than offset by increases in minimum percentage rent coming from the same center pool redevelopments and acquisitions. We're calling for $1 million increase in G&A. The change relative to the $0.5 million we talked about in last quarter's guidance comes from increased payroll associated with additions to our West Coast team, Assembly Row and Mid-Pike teams, net of capitalization. With increased use of ATM to permanently fund our acquisition and development expenditures and term out a portion of our line of credit, as well as a credit facility recast to favorable rates, will mean about a $4 million improvement in year-over-year net interest expense. The portion of the savings in interest expense associated with the ATM usage relative to the line is offset by an increase in share count where clalin for 1 million more shares in our 2011 weighted average share count versus 2010, predominantly associated with the ATM. Finally, 2011 compared to results will include the $3 million year-over-year benefit associated with the early extinguishment of debt, largely coming from the early termination of our term loan in 2010. To sum it all up, we produced record quarterly results based on strong same center operations. We increased our full year guidance. We raised our dividend for the 44th consecutive year and we're gearing up our development and redevelopment pipelines to enhance future growth. Operator, we will now turn the call over to questions."

There's talk much more here in the East Coast and then certainly than in California. But now when you kind of dig down into that a little bit, I got to tell you, short Washington DC at your own peril. That's all I would say. Because I mean, a big reason we've been able to raise this dividend for 44 years in a row, imagine what happened in Washington DC and the portfolio even then a bigger piece of the company it's only 30% or so now it probably was half or more back then. But think about 1976, 1992 and all the things that have happened over the period of time when we had that dividend every single year. So with all the discussion of cutting back in Washington a lot of it has to do with cutting back on growth rates, which I completely agree are not sustainable with respect to Washington. But in the suburbs, where we're operating, it is -- all I would say is, short it at your own peril. I remain very, very bullish on this market."

At $1.2 of FFO per share reported during the second quarter compared with $0.98 last year, we're very pleased with our operating performance thus far in 2011. That bodes well for the rest of the year, as I'll touch on in a minute. 
The reported FFO per share would have been $0.03 higher but for the accounting requirement to treat over $2 million of interest income that we received in the quarter as a gain reported in discontinued operations and, therefore, not part of FFO. That interest income represented past earnings on our Norwalk, Connecticut loan to a Shopping Center development partner that we thought was uncollectible in the depths of the recession. Turns out it was collectible, as a new capital partner brought us current. That's a good sign for the overall commercial real estate development market and was certainly good for federal. 
Not only was FFO per share strong but so is our internal growth at 1.5%, excluding redevelopment and 1.6% including it. What's particularly noteworthy given the amount of space that's out of service is developments in our increasingly full pipeline gear up. Lease rollover growth on comparables basis was solid at 6% on a cash basis with 16% straight-line. In all, we signed 86 new or renewal leases for a total of 370,000 feet at average first year cash rents of $28.21 compared with $26.64 for the last year of the expiring lease. 
I'll note new grocery deal to replace an underperforming Safeway at Westgate Mall in Northern California and a strong L.A. Fitness deal replacing our last remaining Circuit City box at Consortium shopping center underpin the quarter. We did report a decrease in occupancy but that was expected given the 100,000 square feet of Borders and Blockbuster closings that were inevitable. As I said in my remarks last quarter, the closing of 3 Borders locations and all of our remaining Blockbuster Video stores in 2Q couldn't help but bring down occupancy at June 30. We came in at 93.4% leased, down 40 bps from the 93.8% that we reported in the first quarter, all due to those retailers. I also said last quarter that I believe that June 30 would likely be at or near the low watermark for the unleased space in the portfolio and that we have more upside potential than downside risks at this point. That's still the case. I think you'll start to see increases to the lease percentage by year end. 
On Borders locations, Rockville Pike in Chevy Chase, Maryland, Santana Row and Old Town, Los Gatos, California are all A+ locations and won't be hard to release at stronger rents than Borders were paying. We're pretty far down the road in tenant discussions and all of them. Our final Borders location on Philadelphia's Main Line in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania will also close in the next couple of months and we need to get moving on replacing them but also expect strong interest there. 
Operationally, the second quarter was quite strong and that bodes well for the guidance we're going to provide for the rest of the year. Let's talk about that for a minute. We've increased --  we raised our guidance, our 2011 guidance, to a range of $3.99 to $4.04 from the existing guidance of $3.95 to $4.02. And with that, we'll also raise our dividend rate for the 44th consecutive year. I couldn't be more thrilled than to be able to raise guidance in the dividend based primarily on favorable results and trends in tenant leasing and reduced bad debt exposure. Andrew will go through our rationale and more specific on that in a few minutes. But the point that I think is critical for investors to understand is that the increase in earnings guidance is possible despite very heavy investment and acquisition and development projects that hit the current P&L for the benefit of future periods. 
Let me explain. For the last couple of years with the emphasis primarily on maintaining tenancy and trying to figure out where future rents were going to fallout, it's been hard to make developments and redevelopment pencil. And as you know, new acquisition opportunities that made any financial sense have been fueled far between. It's been particularly hard to deploy capital but that's changing a bit, particularly on the development side, and we currently got a lot in the pipeline. 
For illustrative purposes, let's assume that Federal reports an even $4 per share of FFO in 2011, which by the way would be an all-time record. On its face, that would compare favorably to the record $3.88 that we reported last year, 3% growth, even though last year was held by nearly $0.05 per share Home Depot lease termination fees that we've talked about ad nauseaum for the past 5 quarters. If you dig a little deeper, you'd see that our current results include lots of hits to the P&L, reflecting the dramatic increase in productive acquisition and development activity in 2011 versus 2010. The overall improvement in the commercial real estate landscape in strong locations has allowed us to make financial sense of future projects like Assembly Square, like Mid-Pike Plaza, the de-malling of Willow Lawn in Richmond and a residential development at Santana Row. All of those development projects have either broken ground or will shortly and necessitate the requisite tenant downtime demolition and our expensive marketing initiatives to get them properly established.
Expensed acquisition costs like those at Tower Shops early in the year and a bunch more of the potential acquisition in Southern California hit us today but don't benefit us until the future. Also, between the expensed acquisition costs, the dramatically increased marketing costs in Assembly, Mid-Pike, Santana Residential and others, along with demo costs and lost rent at projects like Willow Lawn and Bala Cynwyd hit or will hit FFO for the quarter and the full year by $0.02 and $0.06, respectively, more than the comparable 2010 periods. Yet despite this, we're still reporting FFO growth that takes us to record absolute. 2012 will still include heavy upfront costs and as Mid-Pike and Assembly get under way but the future looks very bright to us. 
Finally, let me bring you up to speed on where we're deploying capital these days. At Santana Row, leasing is underway on our $34 million 108-unit luxury rental building, and our expected 7% yield will more likely be an 8%, maybe even a 9%, at the end of the day. Residential rents are that strong at Santana. Earlier in the week, our board approved a new $70 million investment in the next 216 residential units there at an expected stabilized yield of 7%. After both of those projects are complete, we still hope to build an additional 150 or so apartments as well as an additional 80,000 square feet of retail and 200,000 square feet of office dealing at Santana. We would hope to have Santana Row nearly fully built out in the next 4 years, market conditions permitting of course. 
In addition, we're close to approving another project for an additional 132-unit residential building, costing an estimated $30 million to $34 million at Congressional Plaza in Rockville, a land adjacent to our headquarters. Progress at Assembly road continues on all fronts with T-Stop bids expected back shortly. I think actually August 10 is when they're due back in. 
We hope to announce a strong theater deal as our first signed lease in the coming months, and we expect to be able to announce cost, yield and timing expectations also in the coming months. For preliminary planning purposes though, assume the first phase requiring $120 million to $130 million from Federal, not including of course AvalonBay's apartment investment. 
Similarly, planning work at Mid-Pike continues unabated. We'll have to come up with a name for that project before long, with a first phase construction start plan for about 1 year from now. We were refining cost, yield and timing assumptions now, but again, for planning purposes, assume a first phase capital requirement of $225 million to $250 million. 
Lots of other redevelopment projects either underway, like Little Lawn and Bala Cynwyd or in the planning stages, but it is certainly clear that we've got a strong pipeline of value creative opportunities that certainly depress accounting earnings in the short term debt but add long-term, strong long-term value to this portfolio. On the acquisition front, just a few Ts to cross and Is to dot before we acquire a controlling interest in the Southern California retail center called Plaza El Segundo, along with an adjacent retail development opportunity. Plaza El Segundo and a redevelopment partial make up 45 acres at the corner of Rosecrans and Sepulveda Boulevard in El Segundo, California and currently comprise 380,000 square feet of great retail anchored by tenants like Whole Foods, Anthropology and coming soon, H&M. I can't really provide more specifics at this point because we're not fully there yet on the deal, but the prospect of a West Coast presence that includes such icons as Santana Row, Third Street Promenade, Westgate Mall and Plaza El Segundo, very exciting to us. 
So that's it for my prepared remarks. We're really happy with the way the portfolio is performing and with our potential to grow and create more value. Things are certainly not great in every shopping center and every market. And frankly, I can't remember a time when there's been as much separation as there is today in the outlook of specific retail destinations. Location and a proven track record doesn't take a backseat to anything. Look forward to answering your questions following Andy's remarks."
271305,133642706,153782,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don.

Before doing that, I wanted to p",1233,"Thanks, Don. Good morning, everyone. I'll put a little finer point in our results, talk about our recent line to credit recast, discuss the increase in the dividend and then provide a few comments in our improved guidance. Before doing that, I wanted to point to our expanded redevelopment disclosure in the supplement. We've added clarity in a few of the bigger projects that Don discussed to stabilize after 2012, specifically Assembly Row and the new residential project at Santana Row. These projects have been approved internally and are being actively pursued by the trust. We will add additional larger projects as we work through the approval process and these will be an addition to a regular flow of smaller redevelopments and those out-years as well. We believe this disclosure provides a better roadmap for modeling future value creation for the trust. 
Turning to results. Rental income increased 2.6% from last year second quarter coming from the core same-center portfolio from a redevelopment property, specifically Hampden Lane in Bethesda, 300 Santana Row and Escondido and also from our acquisitions of Huntington Square and Tower Shops. We also saw a pretty significant uptick in percentage rent this quarter as a result of better sales performance from a number of tenants, specifically at Santana, Bethesda and Shirlington. This is a great demonstration of how the economy isn't hitting all retail equally. And the highest quality locations, while not immune, certainly continue to demonstrate their strength. We expect this trend to continue. 
Other property income remained soft on a comparative basis due to lower lease term fees. Comparisons on a year-to-date basis are very tough as other property income is down over $4 million to a level half of our year-to-date 2010 result. Recall, that we do include lease termination fees in our same-center property operating income comparisons. So that was a drag on the same-store growth of positive 1.5%, excluding redevelopment and positive 1.6%, including redevelopment that we reported in the quarter. X the lease termination fees, our same-store NOI growth would have been 2.3% for the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. 
Rental expenses were essentially flat as we recorded $1.4 million less in bad debt expense versus second quarter 2010. Bad debt was at the lowest level we've seen since 2007 with no significant new tenant additions to our allowance and collections from a number of tenants that we had previously deemed uncollectible. In addition, rental expense benefited from the bio to ground leases under [indiscernible] in Pentagon in late 2010. A portion of this benefit is offset by higher interest expense when you get to FFO. As Don discussed, these rental expense improvements were offset by increased demolition costs, as well as increased marketing expenses at Assembly. 
Interest expense declined $1.5 million versus second quarter tab, benefiting from a 60-basis-point year-over-year decline in weighted average rate, partially offset by higher weighted average balances. Capital expenditures in the quarter included the retirement of $37 million of higher cost mortgage debt at a 6.8% weighted average rate on Federal Plaza in Tyson Station. An additional redevelopment spending at 108-unit residential building at Santana Row and a variety of other redevelopment projects, which were funded with accommodation of additional line usage and equity issued through the ATM. 
Turning to balance sheet for a moment. We issued another $42.2 million of equity under the ATM at a net price of $85.51 per share in the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $90.1 million. We continue to believe in maintaining a consistent approach to debt versus equity to keep our balance sheet metrics in line. In early July, we recast our expiring $300 million credit facility with the new 4-year $400 million credit facility with a 1-year extension option. The quality of Federal Realty's property, strategy and management drove $700 million of demand, and this significant oversubscription allowed us to tighten pricing to LIBOR plus 115 basis points at our Baa 1 BBB+ rating. This pricing represents a new tight in the recent REIT market as demonstrated by pricing levels for us at BBB+, which were equal to or through A- minus pricing levels for high-quality REIT deals that had been executed in the prior month. 
With no additional debt maturities until mid- 2012, enviable credit metrics and significant debt capacity, we remain in great shape to fund appropriate acquisition, redevelopment and development activities through both a fixed income and equity markets at attractive pricing levels. Based on the quality of our results, our improving outlook and the strength of our balance sheet, our Board of Trustees voted to raise the quarterly dividend by $0.02 this year as opposed to the $0.01 that we raised in both '09 and 10. 2011 represents the 44th consecutive year that Federal Realty has been able to raise a dividend, a record in the REIT sector and amongst the longest such streaks of all publicly traded companies in the United States. We've raised every year since 1967. We've always paid in cash, and our dividend record is certainly a point of significant pride for our employees, management and our Board. I think this record is the greatest indicator of the quality of what we own, the dedicated focus on how we operate it and the long-term consistency that comes with our disciplined approach. 
Finally, we raised our 2011 FFO per share guidance from $3.95 to $4.02 to a new range of $3.99 to $4.04 based on our strong performance and improving outlook. Some key points to note in our improved guidance include despite increased vacancy in the portfolio, we're calling for 2011 same-center property operating income growth in the 1% to 1.5% range, which includes a year-over-year decline in lease termination fees of $5 million and over $2 million more in demolition costs and marketing expenses associated with development activities at Santana Row, Mid-Pike, as well as a slew of other smaller pre-development projects in the same center pool. These decreases will be more than offset by increases in minimum, a percentage rent coming from our same-center pool redevelopments and acquisitions. 
We're calling for $1 million increase in G&A. The change relative to the $0.5 million we talked about in last quarter's guidance comes from increased payroll associated with additions to our West Coast team, Assembly Row and Mid-Pike teams, net of capitalization. With increased use of ATM to permanently fund our acquisition and development expenditures, the term out a portion of our line of credit as well as a credit facility recast to favorable rates, we're looking at about a $4 million improvement in year-over-year net interest expense. The portion of the savings in interest expense associated with the ATM usage relative to the line is offset by an increase in share count where calling for 1 million more shares in our 2011 weighted average share count versus 2010, predominantly associated with the ATM. 
Finally, 2011, the results will include the $3 million year-over-year benefit associated with the early extinguishment of debt, largely coming from the early termination of our term loan in 2010. To sum it all up, we produced record quarterly results based on strong same center operations. We increased our full year guidance. We raised our dividend for the 44th consecutive year and we're gearing up our development and redevelopment pipelines to enhance future growth. Operator, we'll now turn the call over to questions."

It's really because of NRDC buying Lord & Taylor back a few years ago. I mean, you go back, it's Lord & Taylor that's on that site and they were paying a very low rent and it was a crummy store and the future of Lord & Taylor was not clear. NRDC and Richard Green buys that company. They do a beautiful job in kind of repositioning them and they really want that site. We have adjusted the lease, so we've gotten a big piece of value from a big ramp up on that store. And they're going to put a few million dollars into the store. So we look at that and say ""Gosh, can we get paid for the site basically from the existing tenant and supplement it with additional pads around it for the next 5, 7, 10 years?"" I'd do that all day long, way lower risk and great economics. So that's why that's happened much more so than zoning related. I mean, Zoning's a piece, it's -- that's timing.

But now when you kind of dig down into that a little bit, I got to tell you, short Washington D.C. at your own peril. That's all I would say because, I mean, a big reason we've been able to raise this dividend for 44 years in a row, imagine what happened in Washington D.C. And the portfolio even then -- even a bigger piece of the company, it's only 30% or so. Now it probably was half or more back then. But think about 1976, 1992 and all the things that have happened over the period of time when we raise that dividend every single year. So with all the discussion of cutting back in Washington, a lot of it has to do with cutting back on growth rates, which I completely agree are not sustainable with respect to Washington. But in the suburbs, where we're operating, it is -- all I would say is, short it at your own peril. I remain very, very bullish on this market."

The reported FFO per share would have been $0.03 higher but for the accounting requirement to treat over $2 million of interest income that we received in the quarter as a gain reported in discontinued operations and, therefore, not part of FFO. That interest income represented past earnings on our Norwalk, Connecticut loan to a Shopping Center development partner that we thought was uncollectible in the depths of the recession. Turns out it was collectible, as a new capital partner brought us current. That's a good sign for the overall commercial real estate development market and was certainly good for Federal. 
Not only was FFO per share strong but so is our internal growth at 1.5%, excluding redevelopment and 1.6% including it. What's particularly noteworthy given the amount of space that's out of service is developments in our increasingly full pipeline gear up. Lease rollover growth on comparable spaces was solid at 6% on a cash basis and 16% straight-line. In all, we signed 86 new or renewal leases for a total of 370,000 feet at average first year cash rents of $28.21 compared with $26.64 for the last year of the expiring lease. 
A note new grocery deal to replace an underperforming Safeway at Westgate Mall in Northern California and a strong L.A. Fitness deal replacing our last remaining Circuit City box at Quince Orchard Shopping Center underpin the quarter. We did report a decrease in occupancy but that was expected given the 100,000 square feet of Borders and Blockbuster closings that were inevitable. As I said in my remarks last quarter, the closing of 3 Borders locations and all of our remaining Blockbuster Video stores in 2Q couldn't help but bring down occupancy at June 30. We came in at 93.4% leased, down 40 bps from the 93.8% that we reported in the first quarter, all due to those retailers. I also said last quarter that I believe that June 30 would likely be at or near the low watermark for the unleased space in the portfolio and that we had more upside potential than downside risks at this point. That's still the case. I think you'll start to see increases to the lease percentage by year end. 
On Borders locations, Rockville Pike in Chevy Chase, Maryland, Santana Row and Old Town, Los Gatos, California are all A+ locations and won't be hard to re-lease at stronger rents than Borders was paying. We're pretty far down the road in tenant discussions on all of them. Our final Borders location on Philadelphia's Main Line in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania will also close in the next couple of months and we need to get moving on replacing them, but also expect strong interest there. 
Operationally, the second quarter was quite strong and that bodes well for the guidance we're going to provide for the rest of the year. Let's talk about that for a minute. We've increased --  we raised our guidance, our 2011 guidance, to a range of $3.99 to $4.04 from the existing guidance of $3.95 to $4.02. And with that, we'll also raise our dividend rate for the 44th consecutive year. I couldn't be more thrilled than to be able to raise guidance in the dividend based primarily on favorable results and trends in tenant leasing and reduced bad debt exposure. Andy will go through our rationale and more specifics on that in a few minutes. But the point that I think is critical for investors to understand is that the increase in earnings guidance is possible despite very heavy investment and acquisition and development projects that hit the current P&L for the benefit of future periods. 
Let me explain. For the last couple of years with the emphasis primarily on maintaining tenancy and trying to figure out where future rents were going to fallout, it's been hard to make developments and redevelopments pencil. And as you know, new acquisition opportunities that made any financial sense have been few and far between. It's been particularly hard to deploy capital but that's changing a bit, particularly on the development side, and we currently got a lot in the pipeline. 
For illustrative purposes, let's assume that Federal reports an even $4 per share of FFO in 2011, which by the way would be an all-time record. On its face, that would compare favorably to the record $3.88 that we reported last year, 3% growth, even though last year was helped by nearly $0.05 per share of Home Depot lease termination fees that we've talked about ad nauseaum for the past 5 quarters. If you dig a little deeper, you'd see that our current results include lots of hits to the P&L, reflecting the dramatic increase in productive acquisition and development activity in 2011 versus 2010. The overall improvement in the commercial real estate landscape in strong locations has allowed us to make financial sense of future projects like Assembly Square, like Mid-Pike Plaza, the de-malling of Willow Lawn in Richmond and a residential development at Santana Row. All of those development projects have either broken ground or will shortly and necessitate the requisite tenant downtime demolition and our expensive marketing initiatives to get them properly established.
Expensed acquisition costs like those at Tower Shops early in the year and a bunch more of the potential acquisition in Southern California hit us today but don't benefit us until the future. Also, between the expensed acquisition costs, the dramatically increased marketing costs in Assembly, Mid-Pike, Santana Residential and others, along with demo costs and lost rent at projects like Willow Lawn and Bala Cynwyd hit or will hit FFO for the quarter and the full year by $0.02 and $0.06, respectively, more than the comparable 2010 periods. Yet despite this, we're still reporting FFO growth that takes us to record absolute numbers. 2012 will still include heavy upfront costs and as Mid-Pike and Assembly get under way but the future looks very bright to us. 
Finally, let me bring you up to speed on where we're deploying capital these days. At Santana Row, leasing is underway on our $34 million, 108-unit luxury rental building, and our expected 7% yield will more likely be an 8%, maybe even a 9%, at the end of the day. Residential rents are that strong at Santana. Earlier in the week, our board approved a new $70 million investment in the next 216 residential units there at an expected stabilized yield of 7%. After both of those projects are complete, we still hope to build an additional 150 or so apartments as well as an additional 80,000 square feet of retail and 200,000 square feet of office GLA at Santana. We would hope to have Santana Row nearly fully built out in the next 4 years, market conditions permitting of course. 
In addition, we're close to approving another project for an additional 132-unit residential building, costing an estimated $30 million to $34 million at Congressional Plaza in Rockville, on land adjacent to our headquarters. Progress at Assembly Road continues on all fronts with T-Stop bids expected back shortly. I think actually August 10 is when they're due back in. 
We hope to announce a strong theater deal as our first signed lease in the coming months, and we expect to be able to announce cost, yield and timing expectations also in the coming months. For preliminary planning purposes though, assume the first phase requiring $120 million to $130 million from Federal, not including of course AvalonBay's apartment investment. 
Similarly, planning work at Mid-Pike continues unabated. We'll have to come up with a name for that project before long, with a first phase construction start plan for about 1 year from now. We were refining cost, yield and timing assumptions now, but again, for planning purposes, assume a first phase capital requirement of $225 million to $250 million. 
Lots of other redevelopment projects either underway, like Willow Lawn and Bala Cynwyd or in the planning stages, but it is certainly clear that we've got a strong pipeline of value creative opportunities that certainly depress accounting earnings in the short term, but add long-term, strong long-term value to this portfolio. On the acquisition front, just a few Ts to cross and Is to dot before we acquire a controlling interest in the Southern California retail center called Plaza El Segundo, along with an adjacent retail development opportunity. Plaza El Segundo and a redevelopment parcel make up 45 acres at the corner of Rosecrans and Sepulveda Boulevard in El Segundo, California and currently comprise 380,000 square feet of great retail anchored by tenants like Whole Foods, Anthropology and coming soon, H&M. I can't really provide more specifics at this point because we're not fully there yet on the deal, but the prospect of a West Coast presence that includes such icons as Santana Row, Third Street Promenade, Westgate Mall and Plaza El Segundo, very exciting to us. 
So that's it for my prepared remarks. We're really happy with the way the portfolio is performing and with our potential to grow and create more value. Things are certainly not great in every shopping center and every market. And frankly, I can't remember a time when there's been as much separation as there is today in the outlook of specific retail destinations. Location and a proven track record doesn't take a backseat to anything. Look forward to answering your questions following Andy's remarks."

Before doing that, I wanted to p",1237,"Thanks, Don. Good morning, everyone. I'll put a little finer point in our results, talk about our recent line to credit recast, discuss the increase in the dividend and then provide a few comments on our improved guidance. Before doing that, I wanted to point to our expanded redevelopment disclosure in the supplement. We've added clarity in a few of the bigger projects that Don discussed to stabilize after 2012, specifically Assembly Row and the new residential project at Santana Row. These projects have been approved internally and are being actively pursued by the Trust. We will add additional larger projects as we work through the approval process and these will be an addition to a regular flow of smaller redevelopments in those out-years as well. We believe this disclosure provides a better roadmap for modeling future value creation for the Trust. 
Turning to results. Rental income increased 2.6% from last year second quarter coming from the core same-center portfolio from a redevelopment property, specifically Hampden Lane in Bethesda, 300 Santana Row and Escondido and also from our acquisitions of Huntington Square and Tower Shops. We also saw a pretty significant uptick in percentage rent this quarter as a result of better sales performance from a number of tenants, specifically at Santana, Bethesda and Shirlington. This is a great demonstration of how the economy isn't hitting all retail equally. And the highest quality locations, while not immune, certainly continue to demonstrate their strength. We expect this trend to continue. 
Other property income remained soft on a comparative basis due to lower lease term fees. Comparisons on a year-to-date basis are very tough as other property income is down over $4 million to a level half of our year-to-date 2010 result. Recall, that we do include lease termination fees in our same-center property operating income comparisons. So that was a drag on the same-store growth of positive 1.5%, excluding redevelopment and positive 1.6%, including redevelopment that we reported in the quarter. X the lease termination fees, our same-store NOI growth would have been 2.3% for the quarter and 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. 
Rental expenses were essentially flat as we recorded $1.4 million less in bad debt expense versus second quarter 2010. Bad debt was at the lowest level we've seen since 2007 with no significant new tenant additions to our allowance and collections from a number of tenants that we had previously deemed uncollectible. In addition, rental expense benefited from the buy-outted [ph] ground leases under Bethesda Row and  Pentagon in late 2010. A portion of this benefit is offset by higher interest expense when you get to FFO. As Don discussed, these rental expense improvements were offset by increased demolition costs, as well as increased marketing expenses at Assembly. 
Interest expense declined $1.5 million versus second quarter tab, benefiting from a 60-basis-point year-over-year decline in weighted average rate, partially offset by higher weighted average balances. Capital expenditures in the quarter included the retirement of $37 million of higher cost mortgage debt at a 6.8% weighted average rate on Federal Plaza in Tyson Station. An additional redevelopment spending at 108-unit residential building at Santana Row and a variety of other redevelopment projects, which were funded with accommodation of additional line usage and equity issued through the ATM. 
Turning to balance sheet for a moment. We issued another $42.2 million of equity under the ATM at a net price of $85.51 per share in the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $90.1 million. We continue to believe in maintaining a consistent approach to debt versus equity to keep our balance sheet metrics in line. In early July, we recast our expiring $300 million credit facility with the new 4-year $400 million credit facility with a 1-year extension option. The quality of Federal Realty's property, strategy and management drove $700 million of demand, and this significant oversubscription allowed us to tighten pricing to LIBOR plus 115 basis points at our Baa 1 BBB+ rating. This pricing represents a new tight in the recent REIT market as demonstrated by pricing levels for us at BBB+, which were equal to or through A- minus pricing levels for high-quality REIT deals that had been executed in the prior month. 
With no additional debt maturities until mid- 2012, enviable credit metrics and significant debt capacity, we remain in great shape to fund appropriate acquisition, redevelopment and development activities through both a fixed income and equity markets at attractive pricing levels. Based on the quality of our results, our improving outlook and the strength of our balance sheet, our Board of Trustees voted to raise the quarterly dividend by $0.02 this year as opposed to the $0.01 that we raised in both '09 and '10. 2011 represents the 44th consecutive year that Federal Realty has been able to raise the dividend, a record in the REIT sector and amongst the longest such streaks of all publicly traded companies in the United States. We've raised it every year since 1967. We've always paid it in cash, and our dividend record is certainly a point of significant pride for our employees, management and our Board. I think this record is the greatest indicator of the quality of what we own, the dedicated focus on how we operate it and the long-term consistency that comes with our disciplined approach. 
Finally, we raised our 2011 FFO per share guidance from $3.95 to $4.02 to a new range of $3.99 to $4.04 based on our strong performance and improving outlook. Some key points to note in our improved guidance include: despite the increased vacancy in the portfolio, we're calling for 2011 same-center property operating income growth in the 1% to 1.5% range, which includes a year-over-year decline in lease termination fees of $5 million and over $2 million more in demolition costs and marketing expenses associated with development activities at Santana Row, Mid-Pike, as well as a slew of other smaller pre-development projects in the same center pool. These decreases will be more than offset by increases in minimum, a percentage rent coming from our same-center pool redevelopments and acquisitions. 
We're calling for $1 million increase in G&A. The change relative to the $0.5 million we talked about in last quarter's guidance comes from increased payroll associated with additions to our West Coast team, Assembly Row and Mid-Pike teams, net of capitalization. With increased use of ATM to permanently fund our acquisition and development expenditures, the term out a portion of our line of credit as well as a credit facility recast to favorable rates, we're looking at about a $4 million improvement in year-over-year net interest expense. The portion of the savings in interest expense associated with the ATM usage relative to the line is offset by an increase in share count. We're calling for 1 million more shares in our 2011 weighted average share count versus 2010, predominantly associated with the ATM. 
Finally, 2011 comparative results will include a $3 million year-over-year benefit associated with the early extinguishment of debt, largely coming from the early termination of our term loan in 2010. To sum it all up, we produced record quarterly results based on strong same center operations. We increased our full year guidance. We raised our dividend for the 44th consecutive year and we're gearing up our development and redevelopment pipelines to enhance future growth. Operator, we'll now turn the call over to questions."

Good morning, everyone. At $1 of FFO per share reported during the second quarter compared with $0.95 last year, 6% growth, we're very pleased with our operating performance thus far in 2011. In fact, when you look at the 9 months ended",1848,"Thanks, Christina. Good morning, everyone. At $1 of FFO per share reported during the second quarter compared with $0.95 last year, 6% growth, we're very pleased with our operating performance thus far in 2011. In fact, when you look at the 9 months ended September 30, compared with that same period last year, FFO per share of $3.02 this year compared to $2.87 last year, 5.2% growth. That comes without any occupancy gains. In fact, comes with occupancy decline because of the Borders and Blockbuster liquidations, it comes with a weighted average interest rates largely fixed portfolio wide of 5.9%. That rate is above today's long term rates with a well-added maturity schedule over the next decade providing strong coaching against rising rates, when that eventually comes someday, but also some shorter term upside as we continue to find refinancing opportunities. The FFO growth that we've experienced this year is encouraging and suggest that we should hit or beat the $4 shared mark for the full year in 2011 for the first time in our history. 
Let me say a few things about the 3 other key operating metrics in the portfolio: Internal growth, lease rollovers and occupancy. Not only was FFO per share strong, but so is our internal growth at 2.4% excluding redevelopment and 3.7% including it. Continued and steady overall rent increases, portfolio wide, supplemented by what we've seen as a continuing trend of favorable bad debt expenses year-over-year, with the 2 biggest factor affecting the same-store growth. We particularly hope that the bad debt experience continues since to this point, we don't see any overly worry-some signs since the debt selling de-buckle over 90 days ago. Also benefiting the quarter's internal growth were tenant deliveries at properties formally under development of places like 300 Santana Row, Hampden Lane Bethesda, The Village of Sherlington and Escondido Promenade. These rollover growth on comparable spaces was solid at 8% on a cash basis, 18% straight-line. In all, we signed 88 new renewal leases for a total of 353,000 feet at an average first-year cash rents of $31.62 compared with $29.24 for the last year of the expiring leases. Couple of CVS drugstore renewals at Gettysburg Square in Laurel Shopping Center in suburban Maryland, and a strong leasing quarter of Bethesda Row and 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, underpinned our leasing for the quarter. 
On a year-over-year basically, we once again reported decrease in occupancy given the 130,000 square feet of Borders and Blockbuster closings that were inevitable. As I said in my remarks last quarter, the closing of all 4 Borders locations in all of our remaining Blockbuster Video stores in the second and third quarters couldn't help but bring down occupancy. We came in at 93.3% leased, roughly the same as at the end of the second quarter but down 60 basis points from the 93.9% leased that we reported in the comparable period last year, virtually all due to those retailers. The border's locations was Constant Avenue, Washington, D.C., Santana Row, Old Town los Gatos, California and Wynnewood, Pennsylvania until Main Line are all A+ locations and we won't be -- it won't be hard to release them at strong rents. Pretty far down the road in tenant discussions and most of them don't undersign at this point. 
Physical occupancy trailed percentage leased by 110 basis points reflecting the significant tenant buildout activity that we have underway. For a new supermarkets are under construction. The Fresh Market at Congressional Plaza, Boston's Market at Rockville Town Square and a new great grocery at Westgate Mall. As a 2 new LA Fitness gyms at Queens Orchard and Laurel Shopping Center. Rent starts on these and other build outs will provide strong new rental income streams with residual benefits on the respect of shopping centers beginning in 2012. 
All in all, portfolio is performing beautifully and we've got a lot of going on trying to strengthen our merchandising by transitioning important spaces throughout the portfolio and tenants on the past, to those that we generate a higher sales level for many years to come. The right grocer, the right health club, the right soft goods merchant has always meant a lot when it comes to shopping center performance and that's sure today than it ever has been before. 
Okay. Given it somewhere we're allocating capital these days, and let's start with the 3 big development opportunities. We've got more than $100 million of residential development at Santana Row, roughly $150 million at retail development in the first phase of Assembly Row, not including of course, AvalonBay's apartment investment and $250 million in mixed-use development at Mid-Pike, primarily residential. From here on in -- by the way, we're calling Mid-Pike, Pike and Rose. 
All in, $500 million worth of capital to be expended between today and 2014, earning a blended return somewhere between 7 or 8, expected upon stabilization. We're finding continues in each specific property, but these are the numbers we're going to use for planning purposes at this point. 
Santana Row. The first smaller building is completed with the first tenants moving in last month. At this point, 60 of the 108 units are leased at average rents of $2.76 a foot and hopefully, will be fulled leased by the first quarter of 2012, approximately the same time that we'll begin construction on the next and larger buildings. That building, known as 8B internally, across approximately $70 million include 250 new units and a 360 sold parking garage. 
Assembly Row, we have a very real and approved project. It's for the new tenant -- new transit station came in within the required funding range and the MBTA board approved the contract for construction of the Assembly Square T Station. Construction of both the station and the mixed-use project is expected to commence in a few months and deliver, in late 2013, and more likely early 2014 with the T-stop opening about a year later. Retail interest for our 315,000 square-foot first phase from both outlet tenants and restaurants is particularly strong and a great feeder deal is well on its way. We have very high hopes for the first of its mixed used outlet in entertainment destination. 
And finally, at Mid-Pike, we expect to begin construction of the summer of 2012 on the first space of mixed-use development. First phase will transform a portion of existing center into 156,000 square feet of retail, 87,000 square feet of office and 484 round units and a rebrand, and all be rebranded as Pike & Rose in defining it's well known location at the corner of Rockville Pike in Montrose Parkway. Pike & Rose will be developed in at least 4 phases over the next 10 years and while we likely to bring in office and perhaps residential partners for future phases, we intend to the entire $250 million first phase without partners. 
Let's move on to acquisitions. But first, small but significant disposition. You might remember that we acquired 3 small buildings on Newberry Street in Boston within the last 18 months and hopes to growing our presence there dramatically by getting the opportunity to own a large portfolio there controlled by Anglo-Irish bank. We had hoped to deal with Anglo-Irish directly and avoid having the portfolio go through a broad public marketing process, and we're at that way. The portfolio was market publicly and not surprisingly, found lots of interest. Portfolio sold to a foreign back fund at a price we're unwilling to pay. Accordingly, we have little interest in maintaining our 3 small buildings on Newberry Street and sold them to same buyer as a larger portfolio. Sales price was nearly double our cost 18 months ago and you'll see the $12 million gain on sale in a future quarter. Cap rate paid was well below 4% on 2011 trailing NOI and barely 4% at 2012 forecasted NOI. Just another example of a growing number of investors view of the potential for great mixed-use real estate in the country's best markets. 
Let's spend my final minutes here on our Plaza El Segundo acquisition and in an adjacent development site. With one of the most complicated and time-consuming deals we've ever made, Federal was able to agree to acquire controlling interest in a 381,000 square-foot landmark retail property and a 100% interest in an adjacent development site at the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue in El Segundo, California, just 2 miles south of LAX. Operating serves the affluent communities of Manhattan Beach, El Segundo and Hermosa Beach among others. The big deal for our West Coast presence and for our leasing which now includes such trophy properties at Santana Row, The Assets on Third Street Promenade, Old Town Los Gatos, and now Plaza El Segundo. Those are high-profile destinations are complimented by strong necessity base West Coast properties like Escondido Promenade, Westgate Mall and the Galaxy building in Hollywood, among others. 
Okay, let's start at Plaza El Segundo with the development site since it's easier to understand. 8 acres on the hard corner of Rosecrans Sepulveda, existing entitlements for 70,000 square feet of retail and restaurants are in place and make us optimistic that we can make -- make a development deal of $40 million or so depends along the side. We would expect to be in a position to get started on that development within the year from now. 
Next door on the 37 Acres Housing Plaza El Segundo there's 3 distinct sections in this asset, the 273,000 square foot community center called The Plaza, anchored by Whole Foods, Best Buy, HomeGoods and Dick's, and there's a 53,000 square-foot lifestyle center called The Collection featuring Anthropology, H&M, J.Crew and others. And finally, a 55,000 square-foot specialty center, called The Edge, including small shops, restaurants and other service users. Together, this is a definition of a dominant retail mistake district that will get all that much better with the redevelopment of the adjacent hard corner. 
Of the deal structure is complex, and we're not closed yet, we expect to close by the end of the year, we understand that we'll be entitled roughly 75% of the cash flow thrown out by Plaza El Segundo in exchange for the assumption of $175 million secured loan on the property with an above average market rate of 6.4% that matures in 6 years along with our equity investment of $8 million or $9 million. The deal will be slightly accretive to earnings in 2012. It will be more so in 2013. We expect at least an 8% tenure unlevered IRR on this property. This is the kind of deal we've been looking for. One where we can use the strength of our balance sheet and work on a deal structure that go forward for the current orders and give us control and true A+ real state where we can really add value over time. As I said, the deal is expected to close by year end. Now, we'll line for your questions once we go to Andy's remarks."

Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone.First of all, I hope you all will welcome Christina to our team when you see her in a couple of weeks over at REIT. I'm going to put a final point on our third quarter results. Talked to you about how we're positioned to pay for all the acquisition and development activities as Don discussed, provide a few comments on our improved guidance for '11 and our initial guidance for '12 before turning the call over to your questions. 
But first, I want to point you to Page 16 of our supplemental where we once again expanded our future redevelopment pipeline disclosure. As one of the very few retail REITs, with a significant near term development pipeline, this disclosure should help you to better understand the scope, timing, cost, returns and potential value creation for your models. We have $0.5 billion of projects and process that we expect to stabilize between now and 2015 at Pike & Rose, Santana Row and Assembly Row, including expanded first space scope for Assembly Row for what we disclosed last quarter. Entitlements at properties will allow for additional investments beyond the current scope outlined in our disclosure, which together with our bread-and-butter new developments and cooperations are all key components for the future value creation for the trust. 
Turning to results. FFO was up 8.6% on an absolute basis and 6.3% on a per share basis. Same-center property operating income growth came in at 2.4% excluding redevelopments and 3.7%, including redevelopment, one of the highest levels of internal growth we have experienced since the start of the downturn despite the occupancy declines that Don mentioned. We've been able to post strong same center FFO per share growth as a result to solid leasing, execution of our redevelopment projects and appropriate focus on collections and expense control. All in the straightforward quarter, with no adjustments are accounting wise. 
Getting few with the details. Rental income increased 3.5% from last year's third question. Similar to our last quarter, rental income increases came from the core same center portfolio from a redevelopment properties and also from our acquisitions of Huntington Square and Tower Shops, offset somewhat by the sale of. Other property income declined about $0.5 million versus third quarter 2010 from continued lower lease term fees. On a year-to-date basis, other property income was off over $4 million largely from the significant leased term fee from Home Depot at Flourtown as recognize on the first quarter 2010. I promise next quarter's last time we'll bring up the Home Depot leased term fee. 
Rental expenses again benefited from better year-over-year bad debt expenses to the tune of about $0.01 per share this quarter as well as from the buyout of the ground leases under Bethesda Row and Pentagon in 2010, a portion of this ground rent benefit is offset by higher interest expense when you get to FFO. 
Interest expense declined $1.5 million versus third quarter '10, benefiting from a 35 basis points year-over-year decline in weighted average rate partially offset by higher weighted average balances. G&A was up $1.3 million versus third quarter '10 coming from personnel costs including new leasing acquisition hires as well as expensed acquisition and development cost. Our solid year-to-date results and positive fourth quarter outlook allowed us to increase our 2011 FFO per share guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.04. 
Turning to the balance sheet for a moment. We issued another $49.2 million of equity under the ATM at a net price of $85.35 per share in the third quarter, bringing our total for the year to $139.3 million. We remain a very strong shape to fund appropriate acquisitions, redevelopment and development activities through the fixed income, bank and equity markets at attractive pricing levels. We've recently agreed on terms for a new $200 million 7-year unsecured term loan with PNC and Capital One as lead banks but we hope to close in the late November. We expect to rate in the 3.5% range on this financing. Proceeds will be utilized to term out our current line of credit exposure and to support future development and acquisition spent. We hope to bring in additional lenders through a syndication to potentially upsize the deal but a secured commitments for the full $200 million from our leads, which really limits our execution risk. This term loan at execution provides an attractive alternative to the 7-year unsecured notes market with a better rate to the tune of about 75 to 100 basis points, greater prepayment flexibility and also the ability to fill a hole in our current debt maturity schedule for 2018. 
Upon closing, we do anticipate swapping our LIBOR exposure on this deal to fixed rates, eliminating our interest rate risk on that transaction. While we currently have the deal sized to $200 million, to the extent we can grow that size, we'd expect to upsize to take advantage of this very attractively price capital. After executing the term loan, we'll have full of availability on our $400 million revolver with great access to other forms of capital and no debt maturities until mid-2012. This type of financing, combined with our steady use of equity proceeds, provides an appropriate balance of long-term capital to fund the right long-term assets at appealing loan rates. We're keeping our balance sheet metrics at conservative levels, providing a capacity to take on additional leverage to support the right future acquisition opportunities, just like we're doing with Plaza El Segundo and allowing us to be opportunistic with respect to the timing and form of future capital raising. 
Some key points to note in our increased '11 guidance include: we're revising our full-year same-store property operating income guidance up to 1.5%, previously we had been at 1% to 1.5%. We're assuming at December 2011 closed on Plaza El Segundo and have already expensed about $800,000 in closing costs throughout year through the third quarter. Remaining closing cost will be recognized in the fourth quarter are included in our '11 guidance range. With the exception of the new term loan to pay down the revolver, all of our previous assumptions remain generally unchanged. 
We do have another big acquisition opportunity that isn't quite tied up yet that has a potential to close before the end. Any acquisitions cost which could be material could absolutely cause us to miss our estimate if that was to happen, but once again, a great long-term deal. 
As for 2012, we feel pretty good that we can give you some decent visibility based on the quality of our portfolio and the stability of our business. As a result, we established 2012 FFO per share guidance of $4.16 to $4.22, representing solid 4% FFO per diluted share growth at the mid-point. 
Here are a couple of things to consider when updating your models. Major contributors to 2012 same center growth include: stabilization of the 108 unit residential development at Santana Row, 6B; and the impact from the lease-up at 300 Santana Row; the 3 new grocers and 2 new health clubs as Don discussed. These positives are somewhat offset by a portion of Mid-Pike being taken out of the service to make way for the Pike & Rose development, as well some vacancy at Dedham at the Huntington Square Shopping Center associated with the strong re-tenanting opportunity. These major drivers, combined with occupancy in the flat up 50 basis point range, as well as our bread-and-butter rollover provides the basis for expectation of same center growth in the 3% range for 2012. 
Plaza El Segundo add about a penny or 2 will benefit to 2012 FFO per share results. Lease-up some vacancy at Plaza El Segundo will provide additional accretion in 2013 as will the future development of the adjacent parcel further in the future. 
Being Asia relatively flat in '12 compared to 11. Interest expense will reflect the $175 million of debt assumed in the PES acquisition as well is the new $200 million term loan at a rate in the 3.5% range, as I said earlier. The extent that we're able to upside to turn load, the increase interest expense is not contemplated in our guidance nor is additional usage of the ATM throughout the year. Interest expense increased was to be somewhat offset by increased capitalized interest as we progress at Santana Row, Assembly Row and Pike & Rose. 
Consistent with prior years, we're not including any acquisition activity other than Plaza El Segundo i guidance. Thought as I said earlier, we have a couple of potential opportunities in the pipeline. Based on the timing of these acquisitions and the magnitude of the closing cost, this acquisitions could benefit or hurt our 2012 guidance. Another strong quarter. Great opportunities for both internal and external growth and outlook for another year of record FFO per share in 2012. Operator, we'll now take questions."

I mean, the capital lease talking about raising on the term loan, the lease deals that we're doing and the rolls, even the development on some of the markets that we're in is so completely 180 degrees from what's happening broadly as you put in the macro market for all of good reasons of online sale, online store sales, smaller footprints, smarter business operations.

What I was curious -- and that -- there's a lag to that find its way into the guidance wind those things is that being will and a just a gut feeling and that's what happened in 2011. It's why when we started with the whole debt ceiling debate, federally in July, August and September, the way things were pulling through, I mean, I'm worried or at least, worry is not wide. I'm looking hard at whether and it of those, any of that time period is going to affect anybody's future plans. And so far, we don't see signs of that. It still seems pretty good. Pretty strong but that's the stuff changes quarter-over-quarter in terms of outlook. So I don't want you to look at that and say they just send back over time. I mean, we don't eventually send that.

At $1.01 of FFO per share reported during the second quarter compared with $0.95 last year, 6% growth, we're very pleased with our operating performance thus far in 2011. In fact, when you look at the 9 months",1864,"Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. At $1.01 of FFO per share reported during the second quarter compared with $0.95 last year, 6% growth, we're very pleased with our operating performance thus far in 2011. In fact, when you look at the 9 months ended September 30, compared with that same period last year, below the FFO per share of $3.02 this year compared with $2.87 last year, 5.2% growth. That comes without any occupancy gains. In fact, it comes with occupancy decline because of the Borders and Blockbuster liquidations, and it comes with a weighted average interest rate largely fixed, portfolio wide of 5.9%. That rate is above today's long-term rates with a well-added maturity schedule over the next decade providing strong cushion against rising rates, when that eventually comes someday, but also some shorter-term upside as we continue to find refinancing opportunities. The FFO growth that we've experienced this year is encouraging and suggests that we should hit or beat the $4 share mark for the full year in 2011 for the first time in our history. 
Let me say a few things about the 3 other key operating metrics in the portfolio: internal growth, lease rollovers and occupancy. Not only was FFO per share strong, but so is our internal growth at 2.4% excluding redevelopment and 3.7% including it. Continued and steady overall rent increases, portfolio-wide, supplemented by what we've seen as a continuing trend of favorable bad debt expenses year-over-year, with the 2 biggest factors affecting the same-store growth. We particularly hope that the bad debt experience continues since to this point, we don't see any overly worry-some signs since the debt-ceiling debacle of 90 days ago. Also benefiting the quarter's internal growth were tenant deliveries at properties formally under development at places like 300 Santana Row, Hampden Lane in Bethesda, The Village of Shirlington and Escondido Promenade. These rollover growth on comparable spaces was solid at 8% on a cash basis, 18% straight-lined. In all, we signed 88 new renewal leases for a total of 353,000 feet at an average first-year cash rent of $31.62 compared with $29.24 for the last year of the expiring leases. A couple of CVS drugstore renewals at Gettysburg Square in Laurel Shopping Center in suburban Maryland, and a strong leasing quarter of Bethesda Row and Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, underpinned our leasing for the quarter. 
On a year-over-year basically, we once again reported decrease in occupancy given the 130,000 square feet of Borders and Blockbuster closings that were inevitable. And as I said in my remarks last quarter, the closing of all 4 Borders locations in all of our remaining Blockbuster Video stores in the second and third quarters couldn't help but bring down occupancy. We came in at 93.3% leased, roughly the same as at the end of the second quarter, but down 60 basis points from the 93.9% leased that we reported in the comparable period last year, virtually all due to those retailers. The Borders' locations was Constant Avenue in Washington, D.C., Santana Row, Old Town Los Gatos, California and Wynnewood, Pennsylvania on Philadelphia's Main Line are all A+ locations and we won't be -- it won't be hard to release them at rents. Pretty far down the road in tenant discussions and most of them don't undersign at this point. 
Physical occupancy trailed percentage leased by 110 basis points reflecting the significant tenant buildout activity that we have under way. Three new supermarkets are under construction. The Fresh Market at Congressional Plaza, Boston's Market at Rockville Town Square and a new great grocery at Westgate Mall. As our 2 new LA Fitness gyms at Quince Orchard and Laurel Shopping Center. Rent starts on these and other buildouts will provide strong new rental income streams with residual benefits on the respect of shopping centers beginning in 2012. 
All in all, portfolio is performing beautifully and we've got a lot going on trying to strengthen our merchandising by transitioning important spaces throughout the portfolio from the tenants of the past, to those that will generate new and higher sales level for many years to come. The right grocer, the right health club, the right soft-goods merchant has always meant a lot when it comes to shopping center performance and that's sure today than it ever has been before. 
Okay. Given that somewhere we're allocating capital these days, and let's start with the 3 big development opportunities. A bit more than $100 million of residential development at Santana Row, roughly $150 million at retail development in the first phase of Assembly Row, not including of course, AvalonBay's apartment investment and $250 million in mixed-use development at Mid-Pike, primarily residential. From here on in -- by the way, we're calling Mid-Pike, Pike & Rose. 
All in, $500 million worth of capital to be expended between today and 2015, earning a blended return somewhere between 7 and 8, expected upon stabilization. We're finally continuous in each specific property, but these are the numbers we're going to use for planning purposes at this point. 
Santana Row. The first smaller building is completed with the first tenants moving in last month. At this point, 60 of the 108 units are leased at average rents of $2.76 a foot and hopefully, will be fulled leased by the first quarter of 2012, approximately the same time that we'll begin construction on the next and larger building. That building, known as 8B internally, will cost approximately $70 million, include 215 new units and a 360-stall parking garage. 
Assembly Row, we have a very real and a prudent project. Bids for the new tenant -- new transit station came in within the required funding range and the MBTA board approved the contract for construction of the Assembly Square T Station. Construction of both the station and the mixed-use project is expected to commence in a few months and deliver, in late 2013 or more likely early 2014 with the T-stop opening about a year later. Retail interest for our 315,000-square foot first phase from both outlet tenants and restaurants is particularly strong and a great feeder deal is well on its way. We have very high hopes for the first of its mixed-used outlet in entertainment destination. 
And finally, at Mid-Pike, we expect to begin construction in the summer of 2012 on the first phase of mixed-use development. First phase will transform a portion of the existing center into a 156,000 square feet of retail, 87,000 square feet of office and 484 round units and a rebrand, and all be rebranded as Pike & Rose in defining it's well known location at the corner of Rockville Pike in Montrose Parkway. Pike & Rose will be developed in at least 4 phases over the next 10 years and while we're likely to bring in office and perhaps residential partners for future phases, we intend to the entire $250 million first phase without partners. 
Let's move on to acquisitions. But first, small but significant disposition. You might remember that we acquired 3 small buildings on Newbury Street in Boston within the last 18 months and hopes of growing our presence there dramatically by getting the opportunity to own a large portfolio there controlled by Anglo Irish Bank. We had hoped to deal with Anglo Irish directly and avoid having the portfolio go through a broad public marketing process, and we're at that way. The portfolio was market publicly and not surprisingly, found lots of interest. Portfolio sold to a foreign back fund at a price we're unwilling to pay. Accordingly, we have little interest in maintaining our 3 small buildings on Newbury Street and sold them to the same buyer as a larger portfolio. Sales price was nearly double our cost 18 months ago and you'll see the $12 million gain on sale in a future quarter. Cap rate paid was well below 4% on 2011 trailing NOI and barely 4% at 2012 forecasted NOI. Just another example of a growing number of investors' view of the potential for great mixed-use real estate in the country's best markets. 
Let me spend on -- spend my final minutes here on our Plaza El Segundo acquisition and in an adjacent development site. With one of the most complicated and time-consuming deals we've ever made, Federal was able to agree to acquire a controlling interest in a 381,000-square foot landmark retail property and a 100% interest in an adjacent development site at the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue in El Segundo, California, just 2 miles south of LAX. The property serves the affluent communities of Manhattan Beach, El Segundo and Hermosa Beach, among others, a big deal for our West Coast presence and for our leasing, which now includes such trophy properties at Santana Row, The Assets [ph] on Third Street Promenade, Old Town Los Gatos, and now Plaza El Segundo. Those are high-profile destinations are complemented by strong necessity base West Coast properties like Escondido Promenade, Westgate Mall and the Galaxy Building in Hollywood, among others. 
Okay, let's start at Plaza El Segundo with the development site since it's easier to understand. 8 acres on the hard corner of Rosecrans, Sepulveda, existing entitlements for 70,000 square feet of retail and restaurants are in place and make us optimistic that we can make -- make a development deal of $40 million or so depends along the side. We would expect to be in a position to get started on that development within the year from now. 
Next door, on the 37 acres housing, Plaza El Segundo, there's 3 distinct sections in this asset: a 273,000-square foot community center called The Plaza, anchored by Whole Foods, Best Buy, HomeGoods and Dick's; then there's a 53,000-square foot lifestyle center called The Collection featuring Anthropologie, H&M, J. Crew and others; and finally, a 55,000-square foot specialty center, called The Edge, featuring small shops, restaurants and other service users. Together, this is the definition of a dominant retail district that will get all that much better with the redevelopment of the adjacent hard corner. 
While the deal structure is complex -- and we're not closed yet, we expect to close by the end of the year -- understand that we'll be entitled roughly 75% of the cash flow thrown out by Plaza El Segundo in exchange for the assumption of $175 million secured loan on the property with an above average market rate of 6.4% that matures in 6 years along with our equity investment of $8 million or $9 million. The deal will be slightly accretive to earnings in 2012. It will be more so in 2013. We expect at least an 8% tenure unlevered IRR on this property. This is the kind of deal we've been looking for. One where we can use the strength of our balance sheet and work out a deal structure that go forward for the current owners and give us control in true A+ real state, where we can really add value over time. As I said, the deal is expected to close by year end. Now, we'll line for your questions once we go through Andy's remarks."

Talked to you about how we're",1507,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I hope you all will welcome Kristina to our team when you see her in a couple of weeks over at NAREIT. I'm going to put a little finer point on our third quarter results. Talked to you about how we're positioned to pay for all the acquisition and development activities that Don discussed, provide a few comments on our improved guidance for '11 and our initial guidance for '12 before turning the call over to your questions. 
But first, I want to point you to Page 16 of our supplemental where we once again expanded our future redevelopment pipeline disclosure. As one of the very few retail REITs, with a significant near term development pipeline, this disclosure should help you to better understand the scope, timing, cost, returns and potential value creation for your models. We have a $0.5 billion of projects and process that we expect to stabilize between now and 2015 at Pike & Rose, Santana Row and Assembly Row, including expanded first phase scope for Assembly Row from what we disclosed last quarter. Entitlements at these properties will allow for additional investments beyond the current scope of work outlined in our disclosure, which together with our bread-and-butter redevelopments and core operations are all key components of future value creation for the trust. 
Turning to results. FFO was up 8.6% on an absolute basis and 6.3% on a per share basis. Same-center property operating income growth came in at 2.4% excluding redevelopments and 3.7%, including redevelopments, one of the highest levels of internal growth we have experienced since the start of the downturn despite the occupancy declines that Don mentioned. We've been able to post strong same center net FFO per share growth as a result to solid leasing, execution of our redevelopment projects and appropriate focus on collections and expense control. All in the straightforward quarter, with no adjustments or accounting noise. 
Getting into a few of the details. Rental income increased 3.5% from last year's third quarter. Similar to last quarter, rental income increases came from the core same-center portfolio from a redevelopment properties and also from our acquisitions of Huntington Square and Tower Shops, offset somewhat by the sale of Feasterville. Other property income declined about $0.5 million versus third quarter 2010 from continued lower lease term fees. On a year-to-date basis, other property income was off over $4 million largely from the significant leased term fee from Home Depot at Flourtown recognized in the first quarter 2010. I promise next quarter is the last time I'll bring up the Home Depot leased term fee. 
Rental expenses again benefited from better year-over-year bad debt expenses to the tune of about $0.01 per share this quarter, as well as from the buyout of the ground leases under Bethesda Row and Pentagon in late 2010, a portion of this ground rent benefit is offset by higher interest expense when you get to FFO. 
Interest expense declined $1.5 million versus third quarter '10, benefiting from a 35 basis points year-over-year decline in weighted average rate, partially offset by higher weighted average balances. G&A was up $1.3 million versus third quarter '10 coming from personnel costs including new leasing and acquisition hires as well as expensed acquisition and development cost. Our solid year-to-date results and positive fourth quarter outlook allowed us to increase our 2011 FFO per share guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.04. 
Turning to balance sheet for a moment. We issued another $49.2 million of equity under the ATM at a net price of $85.35 per share in the third quarter, bringing our total for the year to $139.3 million. We remain in very solid shape to fund appropriate acquisition, redevelopment and development activities through the fixed income, bank and equity markets at attractive pricing levels. We've recently agreed on terms for a new $200 million, 7-year unsecured term loan with PNC and Capital One as lead banks that we hope to close i the late November. We expect to rate in the 3.5% range on this financing. Proceeds will be utilized to term out our current line of credit exposure and to support future development and acquisition spend. We hope to bring in additional lenders through a syndication to potentially upsize the deal without secured commitments for the full $200 million from our leads, which really limits our execution risk. This term loan at execution provides an attractive alternative to the 7-year unsecured notes market with a better rate to the tune of about 75 to 100 basis points, greater prepayment flexibility and also the ability to fill a hole in our current debt maturity schedule for 2018. 
Upon closing, we do anticipate swapping our LIBOR exposure on this deal to fix the rates, eliminating our interest rate risk on the transaction. While we currently have the deal sized to $200 million, to the extent we can grow that size, we'd expect to upsize to take advantage of this very attractively priced capital. After executing the term loan, we'll have full of availability on our $400 million revolver with great access to other forms of capital and no debt maturities until mid-2012. This type of financing, combined with our steady use of equity proceeds, provides an appropriate balance of long-term capital to fund the right long-term assets that appealing all on the rates. We're keeping our balance sheet metrics at conservative levels, providing the capacity to take on additional leverage to support the right future acquisition opportunities, just like we're doing with Plaza El Segundo and allowing us to be opportunistic with respect to the timing and form of future capital raising. 
Some key points to notes in our increased '11 guidance include: we're revising our full year, same-store property operating income guidance up to 1.5%, previously we had been at 1% to 1.5%. We're assuming a December 2011 close on Plaza El Segundo and have already expensed about $800,000 in closing costs throughout the year through the third quarter. Remaining closing cost will be recognized in the fourth quarter are included in our '11 guidance range. With the exception of the new term loan to pay down the revolver, all of our previous assumptions remain generally unchanged. 
We do have another big acquisition opportunity that isn't quite tied up yet that has a potential to close before year end. Any acquisitions cost which could be material could absolutely cause us to miss our estimate if that was to happen, but once again, a great long-term deal. 
As for 2012, we feel pretty good that we can give you some decent visibility based on the quality of our portfolio and the stability of our business. As a result, we established 2012 FFO per share guidance at $4.16 to $4.22, representing solid 4% FFO per diluted share growth at the mid-points. 
Here are a couple of things to consider when updating your models. Major contributors to 2012 same-center growth include: stabilization of the 108-unit residential development at Santana Row, 6B; and the impact from the lease-up at 300 Santana Row; the 3 new grocers and 2 new health clubs that Don discussed. These positives are somewhat offset by a portion of Mid-Pike being taken out of service to make way for the Pike & Rose development, as well as some vacancy in Dedham at the Huntington Square Shopping Center -- I'm sorry, at the Huntington Shopping Center associated with the strong re-tenanting opportunity. These major drivers, combined with occupancy in the flat to up 50 basis point range, as well as our bread-and-butter rollover provides the basis for expectation of same-center growth in the 3% range for 2012. 
Plaza El Segundo add about a $0.01 or $0.02 of benefit to 2012 FFO per share results. Lease-up of some vacancy at Plaza El Segundo will provide additional accretion in 2013 as will the future development of the adjacent parcel further in the future. 
Being Asia relatively flat in '12 compared to '11. Interest expense will reflect $175 million of debt assumed in the PES acquisition as well is the new $200 million term loan at a rate in the 3.5% range, as I said earlier. The extent that we're able to upsize the term loan, the increase interest expense is not contemplated in our guidance nor is additional usage of the ATM throughout the year. Interest expense increase was to be somewhat offset by increased capitalized interest as we progress at Santana Row, Assembly Row and Pike & Rose. 
Consistent with prior years, we're not including any acquisition activity other than Plaza El Segundo in guidance. Though as I said earlier, we have a couple of potential opportunities in the pipeline. Based on the timing of these acquisitions and the magnitude of the closing cost, these acquisitions could benefit or hurt our 2012 guidance. Another strong quarter, great opportunities for both internal and external growth and an outlook for another year of record FFO per share in 2012. Operator, we'll now take questions."

I mean, the capital lease we're talking about raising on the term loan, the lease deals that we're doing and the rolls, even the development on some of the markets that we're in is so completely 180 degrees from what's happening broadly as you put in the macro market for all of good reasons of online sale, online store sales, smaller footprints, smarter business operations.

It's why when we started with the whole debt ceiling debate, federally in July, August and September, the way things were pulling through, I mean, I'm worried or at least, worry is not right. I'm looking hard at whether any of those, any of that time period is going to affect anybody's future plans. And so far, we don't see signs of that. It still seems pretty good. Pretty strong but that's the stuff changes quarter-to-quarter in terms of outlook. So I don't want you to look at that and say they just sandbag all the time. I mean, we don't intentionally sandbag. Sometimes it turns out that we sandbag, but certainly in '11, it was because of a better economy than we thought it would be."

At $1.01 of FFO per share reported during the second quarter compared with $0.95 last year, 6% growth, we're very pleased with our operating performance thus far in 2011. In fact, when you look at the 9 months",1866,"Thanks, Kristina, and good morning, everyone. At $1.01 of FFO per share reported during the second quarter compared with $0.95 last year, 6% growth, we're very pleased with our operating performance thus far in 2011. In fact, when you look at the 9 months ended September 30, compared with that same period last year, below the FFO per share of $3.02 this year compared with $2.87 last year, 5.2% growth. That comes without any occupancy gains. In fact, it comes with occupancy decline because of the Borders and Blockbuster liquidations, and it comes with a weighted average interest rate largely fixed, portfolio wide of 5.9%. That rate is above today's long-term rates with a well-added maturity schedule over the next decade providing strong cushion against rising rates, when that eventually comes someday, but also some shorter-term upside as we continue to find refinancing opportunities. The FFO growth that we've experienced this year is encouraging and suggests that we should hit or beat the $4 share mark for the full year in 2011 for the first time in our history. 
Let me say a few things about the 3 other key operating metrics in the portfolio: internal growth, lease rollovers and occupancy. Not only was FFO per share strong, but so is our internal growth at 2.4% excluding redevelopment and 3.7% including it. Continued and steady overall rent increases, portfolio-wide, supplemented by what we've seen as a continuing trend of favorable bad debt expenses year-over-year, with the 2 biggest factors affecting the same-store growth. We particularly hope that the bad debt experience continues since to this point, we don't see any overly worry-some signs since the debt-ceiling debacle of 90 days ago. Also benefiting the quarter's internal growth were tenant deliveries at properties formally under development at places like 300 Santana Row, Hampden Lane in Bethesda, The Village of Shirlington and Escondido Promenade. These rollover growth on comparable spaces was solid at 8% on a cash basis, 18% straight-lined. In all, we signed 88 new renewal leases for a total of 353,000 feet at an average first-year cash rent of $31.62 compared with $29.24 for the last year of the expiring leases. A couple of CVS drugstore renewals at Gettysburg Square in Laurel Shopping Center in suburban Maryland, and a strong leasing quarter of Bethesda Row and Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, underpinned our leasing for the quarter. 
On a year-over-year basically, we once again reported decrease in occupancy given the 130,000 square feet of Borders and Blockbuster closings that were inevitable. And as I said in my remarks last quarter, the closing of all 4 Borders locations and all of our remaining Blockbuster Video stores in the second and third quarters couldn't help but bring down occupancy. We came in at 93.3% leased, roughly the same as at the end of the second quarter, but down 60 basis points from the 93.9% leased that we reported in the comparable period last year, virtually all due to those retailers. The Borders' locations Wisconsin Avenue in Washington, D.C., Santana Row, Old Town Los Gatos, California and Wynnewood, Pennsylvania on Philadelphia's Main Line are all A+ locations and we won't be -- it won't be hard to release them at rents. Pretty far down the road in tenant discussions and most of them though none are signed at this point. 
Physical occupancy trailed percentage leased by 110 basis points reflecting the significant tenant buildout activity that we have under way. Three new supermarkets are under construction. The Fresh Market at Congressional Plaza, Boston's Market at Rockville Town Square and a new great grocery at Westgate Mall. As our 2 new LA Fitness gyms at Quince Orchard and Laurel Shopping Center. Rent starts on these and other buildouts will provide strong new rental income streams with residual benefits on the respect of shopping centers beginning in 2012. 
All in all, portfolio is performing beautifully and we've got a lot going on trying to strengthen our merchandising by transitioning important spaces throughout the portfolio from the tenants of the past, to those that will generate new and higher sales level for many years to come. The right grocer, the right health club, the right soft-goods merchant has always meant a lot when it comes to shopping center performance and that's truer today than it ever has been before. 
Okay. Given that somewhere we're allocating capital these days, and let's start with the 3 big development opportunities. A bit more than $100 million of residential development at Santana Row, roughly $150 million at retail development in the first phase of Assembly Row, not including of course, AvalonBay's apartment investment and $250 million in mixed-use development at Mid-Pike, primarily residential. From here on in -- by the way, we're calling Mid-Pike, Pike & Rose. 
All in, $500 million worth of capital to be expended between today and 2015, earning a blended return somewhere between 7 and 8, expected upon stabilization. We're finally continuous in each specific property, but these are the numbers we're going to use for planning purposes at this point. 
Santana Row. The first smaller building is completed with the first tenants moving in last month. At this point, 60 of the 108 units are leased at average rents of $2.76 a foot and hopefully, will be fulled leased by the first quarter of 2012, approximately the same time that we'll begin construction on the next and larger building. That building, known as 8B internally, will cost approximately $70 million, include 215 new units and a 360-stall parking garage. 
Assembly Row, we have a very real and approved project. Bids for the new tenant -- new transit station came in within the required funding range and the MBTA board approved the contract for construction of the Assembly Square T Station. Construction of both the station and the mixed-use project is expected to commence in a few months and deliver, in late 2013 or more likely early 2014 with the T-stop opening about a year later. Retail interest for our 315,000-square foot first phase from both outlet tenants and restaurants is particularly strong and a great theater deal is well on its way. We have very high hopes for the first of its kind mixed-used outlet in entertainment destination. 
And finally, at Mid-Pike, we expect to begin construction in the summer of 2012 on the first phase of mixed-use development. First phase will transform a portion of the existing center into a 156,000 square feet of retail, 87,000 square feet of office and 484 round units and a rebrand, and all be rebranded as Pike & Rose in defining it's well known location at the corner of Rockville Pike in Montrose Parkway. Pike & Rose will be developed in at least 4 phases over the next 10 years and while we're likely to bring in office and perhaps residential partners for future phases, we intend to the entire $250 million first phase without partners. 
Let's move on to acquisitions. But first, small but significant disposition. You might remember that we acquired 3 small buildings on Newbury Street in Boston within the last 18 months in hopes of growing our presence there dramatically by getting the opportunity to own a large portfolio there controlled by Anglo Irish Bank. We had hoped to deal with Anglo Irish directly and avoid having the portfolio go through a broad public marketing process, it didn't work out that way. The portfolio was market publicly and not surprisingly, found lots of interest. Portfolio sold to a foreign back fund at a price we're unwilling to pay. Accordingly, we have little interest in maintaining our 3 small buildings on Newbury Street and sold them to the same buyer as a larger portfolio. Sales price was nearly double our cost 18 months ago and you'll see the $12 million gain on sale in a future quarter. Cap rate paid was well below 4% on 2011 trailing NOI and barely 4% at 2012 forecasted NOI. Just another example of a growing number of investors' view of the potential for great mixed-use real estate in the country's best markets. 
Let me spend on -- spend my final minutes here on our Plaza El Segundo acquisition and in an adjacent development site. With one of the most complicated and time-consuming deals we've ever made, Federal was able to agree to acquire a controlling interest in a 381,000-square foot landmark retail property and a 100% interest in an adjacent development site at the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue in El Segundo, California, just 2 miles south of LAX. The property serves the affluent communities of Manhattan Beach, El Segundo and Hermosa Beach, among others, a big deal for our West Coast presence and for our leasing, which now includes such trophy properties at Santana Row, The Assets [ph] on Third Street Promenade, Old Town Los Gatos, and now Plaza El Segundo. Those are high-profile destinations are complemented by strong necessity base West Coast properties like Escondido Promenade, Westgate Mall and the Galaxy Building in Hollywood, among others. 
Okay, let's start at Plaza El Segundo with the development site since it's easier to understand. 8 acres on the hard corner of Rosecrans, Sepulveda, existing entitlements for 70,000 square feet of retail and restaurants are in place and make us optimistic that we can make -- make a development deal of $40 million or so pencil on this site. We would expect to be in a position to get started on that development within the year from now. 
Next door, on the 37 acres housing, Plaza El Segundo, there's 3 distinct sections in this asset: a 273,000-square foot community center called The Plaza, anchored by Whole Foods, Best Buy, HomeGoods and Dick's; then there's a 53,000-square foot lifestyle center called The Collection featuring Anthropologie, H&M, J. Crew and others; and finally, a 55,000-square foot specialty center, called The Edge, featuring small shops, restaurants and other service users. Together, this is the definition of a dominant retail district that will get all that much better with the redevelopment of the adjacent hard corner. 
While the deal structure is complex -- and we're not closed yet, we expect to close by the end of the year -- understand that we'll be entitled roughly 75% of the cash flow thrown off by Plaza El Segundo in exchange for the assumption of $175 million secured loan on the property with an above average market rate of 6.4% that matures in 6 years along with our equity investment of $8 million or $9 million. The deal will be slightly accretive to earnings in 2012. It will be more so in 2013. We expect at least an 8% tenure unlevered IRR on this property. This is the kind of deal we've been looking for. One where we can use the strength of our balance sheet and work out a deal structure that go forward for the current owners and give us control in true A+ real state, where we can really add value over time. As I said, the deal is expected to close by year end. Now, we'll line for your questions once we go through Andy's remarks."

I'm going to put a little finer point on our third quarter results. Talked to you about how we're positioned to pay for all the acquisition and development activities that Don discussed, provide a few comments on our improved guidance for '11 and our initial guidance for '12 before turning the call over to your questions. 
But first, I want to point you to Page 16 of our supplemental where we once again expanded our future redevelopment pipeline disclosure. As one of the very few retail REITs, with a significant near term development pipeline, this disclosure should help you to better understand the scope, timing, cost, returns and potential value creation for your models. We have a $0.5 billion of projects and process that we expect to stabilize between now and 2015 at Pike & Rose, Santana Row and Assembly Row, including expanded first phase scope for Assembly Row from what we disclosed last quarter. Entitlements at these properties will allow for additional investments beyond the current scope of work outlined in our disclosure, which together with our bread-and-butter redevelopments and core operations are all key components of future value creation for the trust. 
Turning to results. FFO was up 8.6% on an absolute basis and 6.3% on a per share basis. Same-center property operating income growth came in at 2.4% excluding redevelopments and 3.7%, including redevelopments, one of the highest levels of internal growth we have experienced since the start of the downturn despite the occupancy declines that Don mentioned. We've been able to post strong same center net FFO per share growth as a result to solid leasing, execution of our redevelopment projects and appropriate focus on collections and expense control. All in the straightforward quarter, with no adjustments or accounting noise. 
Getting into a few of the details. Rental income increased 3.5% from last year's third quarter. Similar to last quarter, rental income increases came from the core same-center portfolio from a redevelopment properties and also from our acquisitions of Huntington Square and Tower Shops, offset somewhat by the sale of Feasterville. Other property income declined about $0.5 million versus third quarter 2010 from continued lower lease term fees. On a year-to-date basis, other property income was off over $4 million largely from the significant leased term fee from Home Depot at Flourtown recognized in the first quarter 2010. I promise next quarter is the last time I'll bring up the Home Depot leased term fee. 
Rental expenses again benefited from better year-over-year bad debt expenses to the tune of about $0.01 per share this quarter, as well as from the buyout of the ground leases under Bethesda Row and Pentagon in late 2010, a portion of this ground rent benefit is offset by higher interest expense when you get to FFO. 
Interest expense declined $1.5 million versus third quarter '10, benefiting from a 35 basis points year-over-year decline in weighted average rate, partially offset by higher weighted average balances. G&A was up $1.3 million versus third quarter '10 coming from personnel costs including new leasing and acquisition hires as well as expensed acquisition and development cost. Our solid year-to-date results and positive fourth quarter outlook allowed us to increase our 2011 FFO per share guidance to a range of $4.02 to $4.04. 
Turning to balance sheet for a moment. We issued another $49.2 million of equity under the ATM at a net price of $85.35 per share in the third quarter, bringing our total for the year to $139.3 million. We remain in very solid shape to fund appropriate acquisition, redevelopment and development activities through the fixed income, bank and equity markets at attractive pricing levels. We've recently agreed on terms for a new $200 million, 7-year unsecured term loan with PNC and Capital One as lead banks that we hope to close i the late November. We expect a rate in the 3.5% range on this financing. Proceeds will be utilized to term out our current line of credit exposure and to support future development and acquisition spend. We hope to bring in additional lenders through a syndication to potentially upsize the deal but has secured commitments for the full $200 million from our leads, which really limits our execution risk. This term loan at execution provides an attractive alternative to the 7-year unsecured notes market with a better rate to the tune of about 75 to 100 basis points, greater prepayment flexibility and also the ability to fill a hole in our current debt maturity schedule for 2018. 
Upon closing, we do anticipate swapping our LIBOR exposure on this deal to fix the rates, eliminating our interest rate risk on the transaction. While we currently have the deal sized to $200 million, to the extent we can grow that size, we'd expect to upsize to take advantage of this very attractively priced capital. After executing the term loan, we'll have full of availability on our $400 million revolver with great access to other forms of capital and no debt maturities until mid-2012. This type of financing, combined with our steady use of equity proceeds, provides an appropriate balance of long-term capital to fund the right long-term assets that appealing all on the rates. We're keeping our balance sheet metrics at conservative levels, providing the capacity to take on additional leverage to support the right future acquisition opportunities, just like we're doing with Plaza El Segundo and allowing us to be opportunistic with respect to the timing and form of future capital raising. 
Some key points to notes in our increased '11 guidance include: we're revising our full year, same-store property operating income guidance up to 1.5%, previously we had been at 1% to 1.5%. We're assuming a December 2011 close on Plaza El Segundo and have already expensed about $800,000 in closing costs throughout the year through the third quarter. Remaining closing cost will be recognized in the fourth quarter are included in our '11 guidance range. With the exception of the new term loan to pay down the revolver, all of our previous assumptions remain generally unchanged. 
We do have another big acquisition opportunity that isn't quite tied up yet that has a potential to close before year end. Any acquisitions cost which could be material could absolutely cause us to miss our estimate if that was to happen, but once again, a great long-term deal. 
As for 2012, we feel pretty good that we can give you some decent visibility based on the quality of our portfolio and the stability of our business. As a result, we established 2012 FFO per share guidance at $4.16 to $4.22, representing solid 4% FFO per diluted share growth at the mid-points. 
Here are a couple of things to consider when updating your models. Major contributors to 2012 same-center growth include: stabilization of the 108-unit residential development at Santana Row, 6B; and the impact from the lease-up at 300 Santana Row; the 3 new grocers and 2 new health clubs that Don discussed. These positives are somewhat offset by a portion of Mid-Pike being taken out of service to make way for the Pike & Rose development, as well as some vacancy in Dedham at the Huntington Square Shopping Center -- I'm sorry, at the Huntington Shopping Center associated with the strong re-tenanting opportunity. These major drivers, combined with occupancy in the flat to up 50 basis point range, as well as our bread-and-butter rollover provides the basis for expectation of same-center growth in the 3% range for 2012. 
Plaza El Segundo add about a $0.01 or $0.02 of benefit to 2012 FFO per share results. Lease-up of some vacancy at Plaza El Segundo will provide additional accretion in 2013 as will the future development of the adjacent parcel further in the future. 
SG&A relatively flat in '12 compared to '11. Interest expense will reflect $175 million of debt assumed in the PES acquisition as well is the new $200 million term loan at a rate in the 3.5% range, as I said earlier. The extent that we're able to upsize the term loan, the increase interest expense is not contemplated in our guidance nor is additional usage of the ATM throughout the year. Interest expense increase was to be somewhat offset by increased capitalized interest as we progress at Santana Row, Assembly Row and Pike & Rose. 
Consistent with prior years, we're not including any acquisition activity other than Plaza El Segundo in guidance. Though as I said earlier, we have a couple of potential opportunities in the pipeline. Based on the timing of these acquisitions and the magnitude of the closing cost, these acquisitions could benefit or hurt our 2012 guidance. Another strong quarter, great opportunities for both internal and external growth and an outlook for another year of record FFO per share in 2012. Operator, we'll now take questions."

It's -- I do think it's kind of funny that we're talking about $500 million worth of development between -- albeit, much of a residential at Santana, Mid-Pike and Assembly over the next few years because there is just not very much new products being developed in the country. That's the positives -- that's one of the positives. The other positive is selective, is very selective and that is we continue to see this real distinction between great quality real estate and other. And is it good for Federal because of the selection of the our properties give us more leverage than other sure. Is it good for the country? No, it's not. There really -- this hasn't have-nots deliniation is a bit troublesome for me in this -- to this -- to the extent that we're seeing it. I mean, the capital lease we're talking about raising on the term loan, the lease deals that we're doing and the rolls, even the development on some of the markets that we're in is so completely 180 degrees from what's happening broadly as you put in the macro market for all of good reasons of online sale, online store sales, smaller footprints, smarter business operations.
