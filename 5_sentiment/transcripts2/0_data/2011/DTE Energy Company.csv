Good morning, everyone and thanks for being with us this morning. I'm going to cover two topics today:First, I want to quickly review 2010 and some of our accomplishments last year. And then, I'm going to move on to a look-forward to 2011",4025,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone and thanks for being with us this morning. I'm going to cover two topics today:
First, I want to quickly review 2010 and some of our accomplishments last year. And then, I'm going to move on to a look-forward to 2011 and a few years beyond 2011.
In that second topic, I think is especially important because you'll see later, 2011 for us is a bridge year, between what's been a period of very healthy earnings growth over the last three years and a period in 2012 and beyond, that we're confident will resume that pattern of earnings growth. So more on that in a few minutes.
So moving on to Slide 5, we look back on 2010 as a really successful year for DTE Energy. On the earnings front, our EPS grew 9% year-over-year last year. And in fact, grew at a 9% compound rate for the last three years. In addition last year, we had essentially 11% ROE at both of our utilities so we earned our authorized and also had solid earnings in our Non-Utility businesses where a a strong year in our Power & Industrial business covered for a weaker year in our Energy Trading business.
On a cash flow front, our metrics remain strong. We were upgraded by S&P late in the year, which was something we've been working hard at for several years, so that was gratifying. We also increased our dividends, 6%.
We also kept a intense focus as we have over the past five years, on continuous Improvement, and we continue to reap dividends from this effort within the company. So as I'll talk in a few minutes our absolute O&M is down over the past five years and we continue to work hard on our costs. But increasingly, we're turning this continuous Improvement toward the customer front. You can see that our complaints for example, at the public service commission are down 50% over the past five years.
And as I'll talk further in a little bit, we undertook a big step last year, in sense calling back every customer we have an interaction with using the log defects, where we got things we need to fix and then we're going after that with our CI.
We also undertook a lot of work on our growth agenda this past year. We announced our first major Renewable Energy project, a major win project that I'll talk about a little later. We began construction on our second scrubber at Monroe and as you'll see later, we've got a substantial investment program over the next three years in emission controls, and we launched several new projects in our Power & Industrial business, particularly the Reduced Emissions Fuel business line, which is a significant new business line, that I'll lay out some facts on in a few minutes, as well as our Waste with Renewables business line.
And moving on to Slide 6, talking a little bit more about Continuous Improvement.
I mentioned that this continues to be an important focus for us at the company. You can see from the graphic on the cost front, that our CI initiatives have more than offset structural cost pressures over the last five years so absolute utility O&M is down over $100 million, despite upward pressure and tensioned healthcare, environmental additions at our power plants, general inflation and so forth. And our work here is to keep driving each area of the company to top-quartile operating performance and as we achieve that, push beyond that.
In addition to the cost savings, we're, as I said a minute ago, really focusing the CI effort more and more on the customer front. Outage frequency, improved fieldwork, options for  low-income customers and so forth. The reason for all of this is our belief that the companies that do the best during significant investment cycles and we are in one of those, the companies that do best are those that aggressively manage affordability and maintain constructive regulatory relationships. And our belief is, the best way to accomplish those two things is Continuous Improvement focused on cost and customer-service. To put differently, to get constructive regulation, you need to deserve it, you need to earn it. And that's especially true when heavy investment is putting pressure on rates. And our job is to use this Continuous Improvement process to offset those rate pressures, manage affordability and improve service quality, and if we do that well, we believe the odds of constructive regulation and fair treatment are much higher.
Now, speaking of constructive regulation, on Slide 7, one of the things that's certainly changed for the better than Michigan in recent years is a regulatory structure and a regulatory processes. You can see on Slide 6 some of the highlights and important regulatory developments for our utilities this past year. Starting with the final order we received at Detroit Edison earlier in the year, which we characterized and continue to understand as we went through the years as a constructive order. We held off, as you can see, further right on this slide, we held off on filing a new rate case at Detroit Edison as long as we could, but did eventually file in October, and I think if you'd take a look at that filing, you'll also see that we took some very creative steps within it to manage affordability and the amount that we need to increase rates for customers.
That case, we would expect to self-implement under in April and the case will go final in October. On the MichCon front, we received the final order as he can see in the middle of the slide in June, we did file a rate case pretty quickly on the heels of that. But as the year went on and we continue to work on our costs, and watched the behavior of things within the company, we eventually determined that we could forgo the case and we did that with drawing the case in December, concluding that, that was the right thing to do from a customer-affordability prospective.
Moving on to Slide 8. Another thing that's changed for the better in Michigan over the past year, is the economy. You can see on the left-hand side of the slide, what's happening on the industrial front. The strong performance of the auto companies has been getting a lot of attention nationally, but the industrial turnaround that we're seeing has been pretty broad. As you can see, we were up 21% this past year, which led to an overall growth and territory sales of 3%. That turnaround is translating into the employment of folks here in Michigan as well. You can see that the unemployment rate which peaked at about 14.5% was down to 11.7% by the end of the year. So that's a positive development.
Another indicator of health in the economy is our arrears, and you can see that we took a big step down in arrears this past year. Our uncollectible expense that's associated with that was down sharply last year as well.
So I think the range of indicators suggest that we have worked our way through the events of the recession and we've got a nice recovery in the underlying economy here in Michigan.
On to Slide 9. I'm not going to turn from a look back on 2010, to a look forward to this year and the next few years. I mentioned earlier that the past three years have been a period of very healthy earnings growth for DTE. Earnings per share have grown 9% annually, between 2007 and 2010.
Our EPS guidance for this year, 2011 is roughly flat to 2010 levels, it's actually down a bit at the midpoint of our guidance. As you can see from Slide 10.
And at DTE, we are talking very explicitly with our employees about 2011 being a bridge year. A bridge between that period of healthy earnings growth from 2007 to 2010, and a period in 2012 and beyond that I'm confident is going to resume that pattern of healthy earnings growth, 5% to 6% a year it's what we've been saying for a long time as our target and that's what we foresee.
So one question might be why are we so confident that 2011 is this bridge and we're going to see that resumption of earnings growth next year and beyond. That's one of the things we want to help you understand this morning, and I think to do that, you need to both look back and look forward. You need to look back to understand the dynamics that are shaping our earnings this year in 2011, and look forward at the investments that we are making this year and that we have underway that will play out over the next two years and beyond that will shape earnings in the future.
So what I want to do is take that look back and look forward and I'll do that with our utilities and then turn to our non-utilities businesses. 
And then on Slide 11, I laid this out for Detroit Edison and MichCon, from 2007 to 2010 those businesses, we saw combined utility earnings growth of 9%. We also used continues improvement to bring the ROE's in those two businesses to their allowed levels but during that period, of course the economic crisis hit and we pulled back investment pretty sharply like a lot of people did because of the capital market uncertainty and to manage customer affordability.
And the result of that pullback is putting out this year. So if you look in the middle of the slide you'll see that our combined utility earnings growth is projected at about 3% in 2011. That's less certainly than we've seen in recent years and less than our long-term growth of 5% to 6% but it's really is a result of a lag impact from our reduction in investment in the heart of the crisis.
But as you'll see in a few minutes, this is a your 2011 where we resume strong investments in utilities, especially in renewable power and emission controls within Detroit Edison. And the result of that, on the right-hand, portion of the Slide 11, is that we do expect to see a resumption of 5% to 6% annual growth in our utilities in 2012 and beyond. And in addition, in that period, the renewable investments that were beginning to ramp back up and the environment investments will be actually heavier next year and the few years beyond that.
So this is what I just described is I think even clearer on Slide 12, where you can see our capital spending pattern, we had been planning a period of quite heavy investment in 2009 and 2010 when the crisis hit. You can see how we pulled back, especially sharply in 2009. And we only really start up capital a bit this past year, and this is what temporarily slowed the growth in rate base and what's playing through with the lag here in 2011.
If you look at this year, and the next two years though, you can see in the late blue bars in the green bars, that our emission control investments and renewable investments are going to stop up materially. Total capital expenditures will be $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2011 and as you can see $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion over two-year period, 2012 and 2013. You also see a kind of rotten green box in 2011 with a gray arrow, I'll tell you a little bit about more that in a minute but there's a Renewable Energy project, a wind farm that we're pursuing with a partner. And the arrangement we have in the partner is there going to construct  the project and we're going to buy in as that construction plays out. We're going to finish up the construction this year. So we may buy in, a roughly $200 million portion of the project, late this year or at the very beginning of next year or. So that's $200 million could swing in either late 2011 or early 2012.
You can also see that in the light blue here, the emission control expenditures, ramp back up substantially as we prepare for requirements that are targeted for 2015.
So this step up in capital spending at Detroit Edison is further laid out on Slide 13. The biggest piece of that investment is in our base infrastructure where we see $7 million to $800 million,, $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion in a period to go but the real growth in our earnings power and rate base is coming from the right two columns. Our environmental compliance expenditures, $800 million to $900 million over the three-year period is related targeted to finishing to scrubbers and coming close to finishing one additional SER at our Monroe Power Plant.
In addition to that, we see $500 million to $600 million of Renewable Energy expenditures. The state for us has a requirement of 300 megawatts in place by 2013, so within the next three years. And we have the right under law, to own half of that so our projected expenditures to make that play out are $500 million to $600 million over the next three years. And the details of that renewable expenditure are laid out on Slide 14. And the first thing I'd focus you on is the Red Star there in the middle of the state. That's a project that I mentioned a minute ago that we're pursuing jointly with Indian
[ph]. 
It's a 200-megawatt wind farm. We are going to own 90 megawatts of that installation, about $200 million capital investment. And as I said a minute ago, the way this is playing out is that d we will buy-in for our piece as the project  close to ready to go commercial. You can see the impact of that at the bottom left of the slide, we have a substantial step up in our earnings from Renewable Energy, and energy optimization as we go from 2011 to 2012. And this is certainly one of the things that is driving a return to earnings growth at a higher level at Detroit Edison in 2012.
And if you look down the road, as I mentioned, we need to add to that project between 2012 in 2013. We expect to do that using the 78,000 acres of fuse means that we have under contract in Huron County, that's designated, there by the purple star. We are working on those and we expect those investments on the heels of this Invenergy investment to take earnings in this business lines to about $15 million by 2015, as you can see we'll have a significant portion of that in place by the middle of this period 2013.
That's' gone, moving on to Slide 15. We will also be investing substantial capital over the next three years, about $500 million to $600 million over that or about $175 million to $200 million a year. The MichCon's investment agenda is laid out on Slide 15. The most significant element of MichCon's investment are in the gas distribution network, and in particular, we have been working with the Michigan Public Service Commission on a multiyear main renewal and meter move-out improvement that steps out the capital that we will be committing to our distribution infrastructure.
In addition to that, we continue to find opportunities within our Utility Storage & Transportation asset-base to expand storage, generally what we find customers want us to expand our storage, we contact with those customers and often have pipeline investments that are needed to take that storage to market. That's been added area of investment in recent years and we think that will continue here over the next two years.
So in summary, for Detroit Edison and MichCon, we're coming off a two-year period in 2009 and 2010 where we reduced capital expenditures in the wake of the economic crisis, but our capital expenditures, renewables, emission controls, gasman renewables, and mood meter move out, are going to drive our rate base investment up pretty sharply over the next three years. Our average capital spending and our utilities over the next three years will be about a third higher then it was last year For example. And as this investment will that enable us to bid bridge from about 3% utility earnings rate of 5% to 6% next year and beyond.
Slide 16 takes a similar multi-year look back and look-forward for our Non-Utility businesses. From 2007 to 2010, our two principal Non-Utility businesses, Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power & Industrial both grew at a healthy rate, 20% compound annual growth for those two businesses over the three-year period.
Energy Trading averaged earnings of about $45 million. Although as you know, our last year that three-year period was a low year for us. The other significant event during those three years was a $1.5 billion monetization of our unconventional gas assets.
2011 for these businesses is a bridge year, too. Our P&I earnings are going to be lower than last year. P&I earnings were very high last year but we have some items as I'll describe in a minute. They aren't going to occur this year, but we are scaling up at Power & Industrial through investments in reduced emissions, renewables and we do continue to identify investment opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and we are making progress on those. 
In addition, we are working to rebound from reduced earnings levels in Energy Trading in the last few months as Dave Meador will describe have been promising on that front. And we do continue to work this year to position for the monetization of our unconventional gas assets.
So if I look forward to the next few years in the Non-Utility front, we see reduced emission fuels and renewable investments providing a very substantial growth within our Power & Industrial segment, we have investments that will produce earnings growth at Gas Storage and Pipelines and we think our Energy Trading will return to more normal historical levels. 
That will combine with a move to monetize unconventional gas assets, which will be used to fund growth and this set of dynamics will also contrary to the 5% to 6% growth we're describing in 2012 and beyond.
One of the key adamant that I've just described is the projected growth in our Power and Industrial business and is laid out on Slide 17. First, on the left-hand side of the slide, and actually we first laid this out with his past fall while at EEI, we saw a big step up this past year in earnings. Earnings between nine and 10 more than doubled but some of the items were nonrecurring, so For example,, we saw high coal prices and we have capacity open and that played to our favor, that's not going to occur next year period. We also have the steel tax credit industry, or actually did think that was going to recur or right to the very end of the tax bill this past year but it did get pulled to our surprise and the steel industry's surprise, so those dynamics are producing a step down and earnings of P&I this year.
But as you can see from the light blue and dark blue bars, here we have two segments in this business that we expect to grow materially over the next number of years. One of those in the light blue is the Reduced Emission Fuels segment. And as just as a result reminder, these are products where we have technology that can be used to cold plans to reduce mercury and observations and also benefit from a federal tax credit. We are making progress on developing these other projects. We completed the sale of an interest in one of these products and we had it up and running. That was completed in January, and we are in negotiations with a number of other potential counterparties who run power plants a lot like Detroit Edison and does and face the same Emission Control requirements that we do, and our goal this year is to get several facilities with those counter-parties cited and up and running so that we see the substantial step up in earnings from this segment that's indicated here in 2012. And a little bit longer-term, we do expect to have our facilities pretty much fully in-place[ph] by 2013, and that $40 million to $50 million largely in place by then.
On the Renewable Energy front, this past year, we made significant progress in this arena. We purchased a majority ownership of a 44-megawatt plant in California late in the year. We'll bring that online late this year. We also came to agreement on a 45-megawatt facility in California that we now have in the conversion process that we'll bring online early in 2013. Those two projects brought the total that we have in this segment of Waste Wood projects from small coal plants brought the total to five, and so we're going to see growth just from that base of five projects that we brought online or are bringing online, but we'd expect to continue to find and invest in additional projects here.
So [indiscernible] of all this that we expect the P&I segment to be one of our significant growth areas over the next three years, and contribute to the 5% to 6% that I described earlier. 
We also see opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipeline business and that's laid out of Slide 18. Our strongest opportunities in this segment center on the Millennium Pipeline, which is shown there in dark blue, runs from upstate New York into the New York City area. And also as you can see, it runs through the Marcellus shale and most of our development opportunities for that pipe center on gas that's emerging from the Marcellus shale. And those opportunities come from in the form of mainline pipe expansions, as well as a laterals off of the pipeline, and eventually connectors between Millennium and other pipelines.
And we are making progress on this front as well, in fact, I think the discussions went from pretty introductory and new early last year to discussions that are getting quite promising and serious early this year. 
So [indiscernible]  Here is that over the next three years, we see this is the period that this Gas Storage and Pipeline business, which grew a lot in over the last five years will make the investments that will fuel its next significant step up in growth.
So in summary, for the company then, on Slide 19, our investments in the top left are going to be up materially over the next three years. On average, if you compare the last three years to the next three years, we are up about on the order 25% and that's tied to our investments in Detroit Edison renewable assets, our environmental investments, principally at the mineral power plant, and the Non-Utility investments in P&I and our gas and storage and pipeline that I just mentioned. And I would also say, that the utility investments that we're taking with strong eye on managing customer affordability as I mentioned at the very outset of this discussion.
But if you look at what that implies in terms of investment base and earnings for the next few years, our earnings this year, we've given guidance of $340 million to $370 million, within that we do see utility earnings growth of about 3%. But as you can see, we expect earnings at both the ability and our Non-Utility businesses to pick up in 2012 and 2013 and we're projecting the 5% to 6% longer-term growth there that we've talked about for sometime.
So with that, I'm going to turn things over to Dave Meador to take a little bit closer look at 2010, and our 2011 guidance. Dave, over to you."
266598,118486009,100831,"DTE Energy Co., 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2011",2011-02-09,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Gerry and good morning, again to everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 21.For the year, our operating earnings are $607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And as a reminder, there's a reconciliation to our GAA",1782,"Thanks, Gerry and good morning, again to everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 21.
For the year, our operating earnings are $607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And as a reminder, there's a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings in the appendix, as well as there are other information on the appendix that I hope you will find helpful. The $3.60 per share is a nickel higher than the midpoint of our original guidance for the year at $3.55, and is $0.30 or 9% higher than our 2009 operating earnings. Detroit Edison contributed $2.60  per share and MichCon came in at $0.63. Both utilities did a great job and as Gerry mentioned there in the authorized returns in 2010. We are seeing improvements in the local economy, that we also aligned on the low chart and
with Detroit Edison' temperature normal electric load of 3%, and that was driven predominantly by the industrial sector, which was up 21%. 
The Non-Utility business combined to earn $0.78, with Power & Industrial products earning $85 million, or $0.50 per share with a very strong year-over-year performance. And as we indicated this won't be repeated in 2011. Gas Storage and Pipelines came in at 4% higher than 2009 at $51 million or $0.30 per share, and Energy Trading had net earnings of $0.04 and Unconventional Gas Production had $0.06 a loss.
Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.41 for the year. And overall 2010 was a very good year for as. The performance came in very strong with the bulk of the earnings coming from the two utilities which have returned to their full earnings power.
And as Gerry outlined, the Power & Industrial business had a very strong performance almost offsetting the shortfall at Energy Trading.
Now shifting to 2011 and our outlook for the year on Slide 22. We outline our 2011 earnings guidance for each of the segments. As I've just said, both of our utilities earned their authorized return on equities in 2010 and we expect to do the same this year in 2011. We have a rate case at Detroit Edison, which will be finalized by the fourth quarter, and we're doing everything we believe is necessary to ensure constructive order from the commission and I'll talk a little bit more about that case in a moment. 
In MichCon, we plan to return to a normal weather year, after a warmer than normal in 2010 and lower midstream revenues. Also, at the utilities, we will leverage our continuous improvement capabilities to partially offset O&M expense.
Earnings at Gas Storage and Pipelines will be up another 4% in 2011, as we continue to identify long-term expansion and development opportunities around the Millennium Pipeline.
In 2010, we impaired some non-strategic leases at our Non-conventional Construction business and that won't reoccur in 2011. Also, we are seeing more oil and natural gas liquids production in our Barnett shale properties which is driving higher earnings in 2011. We've included in the appendix some key operating metrics for the business as well as a scheduled which summarizes the valuation for the Barnett assets and a couple of points I want to point out here. Given the nature of our properties, we get a 50% to 60% lift in revenues from natural gas liquids, and we are also pursuing some wells that add oil to our performance.
Currently the value derived from one MCF of gas is about $6.40, which is a nice premium over dry gas prices.  Once a year, we update the reserve analysis for this business and we provide the valuation range which is on Slide 35, and even if you use the conservative low-end of the valuation, and our current reserves are worth at least $400 million, or $2.35 per share, and then the midpoint of that range obviously is much higher. Our plan is to still develop the properties for monetization with a focus on natural gas, liquids and oil, and at the same time, we're going to eliminate the drag down on earnings this year.
The Power & Industrial team is coming off a very strong year that we just talked about for 2010, which included some opportunities which won't reoccur going forward such as the steel industry fills[ph],  tax credit and premium earnings on Coke sales. As Gerry explained, the story with the P&I group is the potential earnings opportunity from the REF business line an the coal-to-waste width conversions.  We'll start to see some earnings from this businesses in 2011, but we'll really start to scale up those lines in 2012 and forward. 
2010 as you know was a challenging year for our Energy Trading business, after a strong first quarter, we saw the markets flat now in he second half of the year with lower volatility and lower commodity prices.
In the third quarter, the business struggled to find market opportunities to generate sufficient gross margins,  however, that begin to change noticeably in November and December. In January, and so far in February this year, we have found trading opportunities returning in areas like power trading and full requirement contracts with gross margins in those months, similar to prior years. In fact, in January, we earned about 20% of the economic gross margin that we have assumed in our full-year guidance.
While we don't see this business going back to historical levels of $40 million to $50 million of operating income this year, we do expect it to make a significant step in that direction and we set the midpoint of guidance at $25 million.
Finally, we are expecting Corporate & Other to have improved results in 2011 primarily due to lower interest rate expense. So in total, we project DTE Energy to have operating earnings of $576 million to $631 million or $3.40 to $3.70 per share.
On Slide 23, we have an overview of the Detroit Edison rate case. We filed the case at the end of October, with a total revenue requirement of $443 million. And as an example of how we are focusing on customer affordability in this rate filing, we proposed some potential alternatives, which could reduce the net rate request by nearly $200 million for a net rate request of $253 million. We're looking forward to working collaboratively with the commission on this rate case over the next coming months.  Testimonies is due at the beginning of April and we plan to self-implement our rate increase in April. 
We will receive the final order in this case no later than the end of October. 
Now turning to cash flows on Slide 24. In 2009, we had one of the strongest cash years in our history with cash from operations of $1.8 billion, and I'm pleased to report, that we achieved same level  of cash from operations in 2010. And we're looking at 2011 with expected even stronger cash results of $1.9 million in cash from operations.
If you looked at total cash after capital and dividend and asset sales for 2009 and 2010 combined, we generated $850 million in total cash flow over two years. As Gerry explained earlier, after a slowing CapEx during the recession we plan to ramp it back up in 2011. We said in past we expect to issue between $100 million to $200 million of new equity to fund our growth over the next several years.  However, as a result of strong cash flows in 2010 and anticipated benefits from bonus depreciation of around $100 million to $200 million between 2011 and 2012, we're not expecting to issue any new equity this year and we are working on reducing our equity needs to 2012.
In Slide 25, we provided a breakdown for our 2011 capital plan. If you look at our capital for the utilities, going back it was $960 million in 2009. It was $1 billion in 2010. And we'll be spending about $1.2 billion in 2011, which is nearly a 25% increase over 2009 levels. At Detroit Edison, as we outlined, we are in the process of scrubbing the two remaining units in Monroe and we expect to have a sharp step-up in our environmental capital for the year. And as we outlined in 2010, we began construction on 200-megawatt wind farm. We'll take ownership of 90 megawatts of that generation in late this year late, or early next year which will be about a $200 million investment for Detroit Edison. 
And in MichCon, we're playing on increasing our capital spending by over 20% in 2011, and this is driven primarily by our pipeline integrity and meter relocation work.  And then at the non-utility business, we're targeting capital investments of $200 million to $300 million.
Slide 26 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We ended the year with our target leverage range and we expect to be within that range for 2011. As a result of one-time deferred tax items in 2010, we realized FFO-to-debt of 28%,  which is well above our targeted range. We expect that to return to targeted levels in 2011 and as a result of our strong balance sheet and cash flows we secured a credit upgrade from S&P at DTE Energy and at both the utilities in December of last year also of which revised Detroit Edison's outlook to positive last month and in both cases, the agency's noted the economic conditions that are improving in Michigan and a very positive regulatory environment that we have here.
let  me wrap up on Slide 27. As we've outlined for you, we have a plan that we're confident in that will provide 5% to 6% long-term operating growth, and at the same time, provides an attractive dividend which combined, provide a very attractive total shareholder return, and at the same time, doing all of that by maintaining a very strong balance sheet. As Gerry very laid out, our utility growth plan is primarily driven by mandated investments and all of this is set in a very constructive regulatory structure that we understand that we have to continue to earn everyday by doing things by driving cost savings, which will enable our utilities to earn their authorized returns. And continuing to focus on operational excellence including customer satisfaction, which we believe over time will, create a distinctive capability in this company compared to others in the industry with a real focus on affordability.
At to compliment the utilities, we have meaningful low-risk growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses that will provide diversity both in earnings and geographic reach.
With that, that wraps up our presentation and we'd be happy to take your questions."

Thanks for being with us this morning.  I’m going to cover two topics today.

Thanks for being with us this morning.  I’m going to cover two topics today.  First I want to quickly review 2010 and some of our accomplishments last year, and then I’m going to move on to a look forward to 2011 and a few years beyond 2011.  And that second topic, I think is especially important because as you’ll see later, 2011 for us is a bridge year between what’s been a period of very healthy earnings growth over the last three years and a period in 2012 and beyond that we’re confident we’ll resume that pattern of earnings growth.  So more on that in a few minutes.
But moving on to Slide 5, we look back on 2010 as a really successful year for DTE Energy.  On the earnings front, our EPS grew 9% year-over-year last year, and in fact grew at a 9% compound rate for the last three years.  In addition, last year we had essentially 11% ROE at both of our utilities, so we earned or authorized, and also had solid earnings in our non-utility businesses where a strong year in our power and industrial business covered off for a weaker year in our energy trading business.
On a cash flow front, our metrics remain strong.  We were upgraded by S&P late in the year, which was something we’ve been working hard at for several years so that was gratifying.  We also increased our dividend 6%.  We also kept an intense focus, as we have for the past five years, on continuous improvement; and we continue to reap dividends from this effort within the Company.  So as I’ll talk in a few minutes, our absolute O&M is down over the past five years, and we continue to work hard on our costs.  But increasingly we’re turning this continuous improvement toward the customer front.  You can see that our complaints, for example, at the Public Service Commission are down 50% over the past five years.  And as I’ll talk further in a little bit, we undertook a big step last year, essentially calling back every customer that we have an interaction with, using that to log defects where we’ve got things that we need to fix, and then we’re going after that with our CI.  
We also undertook a lot of work on our growth agenda this past year.  We announced our first major renewable energy project, a major wind project that I’ll talk about a little later.  We began construction on a second scrubber at Monroe, and as you’ll see later, we’ve got a substantial investment program over the next three years in emission controls; and we launched several new projects in our power and industrial business, particularly the reduced emissions fuel business line, which is a significant new business line that I’ll lay out some facts on here in a few minutes, as well as our waste wood renewables business line.
Moving on to Slide 6, talking a little bit more about continuous improvement.  I mentioned that this continues to be an important focus for us at the Company.  You can see from the graphic on the cost front that our CI initiatives have more than offset structural cost pressures over the last five years; so absolute utility O&M is down over $100 million despite upward pressure in pension, healthcare, environmental additions at our power plants, general inflation, and so forth.  And our work here is to keep driving each area of the Company to top quartile operating performance, and as we achieve that, push beyond that.
In addition to the cost savings we’re, as I said a minute ago, really focusing this CI effort more and more on the customer front - outage frequency, improved fieldwork, options for low income customers, and so forth.  The reason for all of this is our belief that the companies that do the best during significant investment cycles, and we are in one of those, the companies that do best are those that aggressively manage affordability and maintain constructive regulatory relationships.  And our belief is the best way to accomplish those two things is continuous improvement focused on costs and customer service.  
Put differently, to get constructive regulation, you need to deserve it; you need to earn it.  And that’s especially true when heavy investment is putting pressure on rates.  And our job is to use this continuous improvement process to offset those rate pressures, manage affordability, and improve service quality.  And if we do that, well, we believe the odds of constructive regulation and fair treatment are much higher.
Speaking of constructive regulation, on Slide 7 one of the things that’s certainly changed for the better in Michigan in recent years is our regulatory structure and our regulatory processes.  You can see on Slide 6 some of the highlights and important regulatory developments for our utilities this past year, starting with the final order we received at Detroit Edison early in the year, which we characterized and continued to understand as we went through the year as a constructive order.  We held off, as you can see further right on this slide - we held off on filing a new rate case at Detroit Edison as long as we could but did eventually file in October.  And I think if you’ve taken a look at that filing, you’ll also see that we took some very creative steps within it to manage affordability in the amount that we’d need to increase rates for customers.  That case we would expect to self-implement under in April, and the case will go final in October.
On the MichCon front we received a final order, as you can see in the middle of the slide, in June.  We did file a rate case pretty quickly on the heels of that, but as the year went on and we continued to work on our costs and watched the behavior of things within the Company, we eventually determined that we could forego the case; and we did that, withdrawing the case in December, concluding that that was the right thing to do from a customer affordability perspective.
Moving on to Slide 8, another thing that’s changed for the better in Michigan over the past year is the economy; and you can see on the left-hand side of the slide what’s happening on the industrial front.  The strong performance of the auto companies has been getting a lot of attention nationally, but the industrial turnaround that we’re seeing has been pretty broad.  As you can see, we were up 21% this past year which led to an overall growth in territory sales of 3%.  That turnaround is translating into the employment of folks here in Michigan as well.  You can see that the unemployment rate, which peaked at about 14.5%, was down to 11.7% by the end of the year, so that’s a positive development.
Another indicator of health in the economy is our arrears, and you can see that we took a big step down in arrears this past year.  Our uncollectable expense that’s associated with that was down sharply last year as well.  So I think a range of indicators that suggests that we have worked our way through the events of the recession and we’ve got a nice recovery in the underlying economy here in Michigan.
On to Slide 9, I’m now going to turn from a look back on 2010 to a look forward to this year and the next few years.  And I mentioned earlier that the past three years have been a period of very healthy earnings growth for DTE.  Earnings per share have grown 9% annually between 2007 and 2010.  Our EPS guidance for this year, 2011, is roughly flat to 2010 levels.  It’s actually down a bit at the midpoint of our guidance, as you can see from Slide 10.  And at DTE, we are talking very explicitly with our employees about 2011 being a bridge year - a bridge between that period of healthy earnings growth from 2007 to 2010, and a period in 2012 and beyond that I’m confident is going to resume that pattern of healthy earnings growth.  Five to 6% a year is what we’ve been saying for a long time as our target, and that’s what we foresee.
So one question might be why are we so confident that 2011 is this bridge and we’re going to see that resumption of earnings growth next year and beyond?  That’s one of the things we want to help you understand this morning, and I think to do that you need to both look back and look forward.  You need to look back to understand the dynamics that are shaping our earnings this year in 2011, and look forward at the investments that we’re making this year and that we have underway that will play out over the next few years and beyond that will shape earnings in the future.
So what I want to do is take that look back and look forward, and I’ll do that with our utilities and then turn to our non-utility businesses.  On Slide 11, I lay this out for Detroit Edison and MichCon.  From 2007 to 2010 in those two businesses, we saw combined utility earnings growth of 9%.  We also used continuous improvement to bring the ROEs in those two businesses to their allowed levels; but during that period, of course, the economic crisis hit and we pulled back investment pretty sharply, like a lot of people did, because of the capital market uncertainty and to manage customer affordability.  And the result of that pullback is playing out this year.  
So if you look in the middle of this slide, you’ll see that our combined utilities earnings growth is projected at about 3% in 2011.  That’s less certainly than we’ve seen in recent years and less than our long-term goal of 5 to 6%, but it’s really a result of a lag impact from our reduction in investment in the heart of the crisis.  But as you’ll also see in a few minutes, this is the year - 2011 - where we resume strong investments in the utilities, especially in renewable power and emission controls within Detroit Edison.  And the result of that, on the right-hand portion of Slide 11, is that we do expect to see a resumption of 5 to 6% annual growth in our utilities in 2012 and beyond.  And in addition in that period, the renewable investments that we’re beginning to ramp back up and the environmental investments will be actually even heavier next year and the few years beyond that.
So this is—what I just described is, I think, even clearer on Slide 12, where you can see our capital spending pattern.  We had been planning for a period of quite heavy investment in 2009 and ’10 when the crisis hit.  You can see how we pulled back, especially sharply in 2009, and we really only stepped up capital a bit this past year.  This is what temporarily slowed the growth in our rate base and what’s playing through the lag in 2011.
If you look at this year and the next two years, though, you can see in the light blue bars and the green bars that our emission control investments and renewable investments are going to step up materially.  Total capital expenditures will be a 1 billion to 1.2 billion in 2011, and as you can see, 2.4 to 2.8 billion over the two-year period of 2012 and ’13.  You also see on the dotted green box on 2011 with a grey arrow—I’ll tell you a little bit more about that in a minute, but there is a renewable energy project, a wind farm that we’re pursuing with a partner, and the arrangement we have with the partner is that they’re going to construct the project and then we’re going to buy in as that construction plays out.  We’re going to finish up the construction this year, so we may buy in our roughly $200 million portion of the project late this year or at the very beginning next year.  So that $200 million could swing in either late 2011 or early 2012.
You can also see that, in the light blue here, the emission control expenditures ramp back up substantially as we prepare for requirements that are targeted to 2015.
So this step-up in capital spending at Detroit Edison is further laid out on Slide 13.  The biggest piece of that investment is in our base infrastructure where we see 700 to $800 million per year - 2.1 to 2.3 billion over the three-year period.  But the real growth in our earnings power and rate base is coming from the right two columns.  Our environmental compliance expenditures - 800 to $900 million over the three-year period is really targeted at finishing two scrubbers and coming close to finishing one additional SCR at our Monroe power plant.
In addition to that, we see 500 to $600 million of renewable energy expenditures.  The State for us has a requirement of 300 megawatts in place by 2013, so within the next three years; and we have the right under law to own half of that, so our projected expenditures to make that play out are 500 to 600 million over the next three years.  And the details of that renewable expenditure are laid out on Slide 14.
The first thing I’d focus you on is the red star there in the middle of the state.  That’s the project that I mentioned just a minute ago that we’re pursuing jointly with Invenergy.  It’s a 200 megawatt wind farm.  We are going to own 90 megawatts of that installation, about a $200 million capital investment.  And as I said a minute ago, the way this is playing out is that Invenergy is going to front the investment and then we will buy in for our piece as the project gets close to ready to go commercial.
So you can see the impact of that, then, at the bottom left of the slide that we get a substantial step-up in our earnings from renewable energy and energy optimization as we go from 2011 to 2012.  And this is certainly one of the things that is driving a return to earnings growth at a higher level at Detroit Edison in 2012.
Then if you look down the road, as I mentioned, we need to add to that project between 2012 and 2013.  We’d expect to do that using the 78,000 acres of easements that we have under contract in Huron County.  That’s designated there by the purple star.  We’re working on those and we’d expect those investments on the heels of this Invenergy investment to take earnings in this business line to about 50 million by 2015, and as you can see, we’ll have a significant portion of that in place by the middle of this period, 2013.
MichCon, moving on to Slide 15, we’ll also be investing substantial capital over the next three years - about 500 to 600 million over that period, or about 175 to 200 million a year.  MichCon’s investment agenda is laid out on Slide 15.  The most significant element of MichCon’s investments are in the gas distribution network, and in particular we have been working with the Michigan Public Service Commission on a multi-year main renewal and meter move-out program that steps up the capital that we will be committing to our distribution infrastructure.  
In addition to that, we continue to find opportunities within our utility storage and transportation asset base to expand storage.  Generally we find our customers who want us to expand that storage, we contract with those customers and then often have pipeline investments that are needed to take that storage to market.  That’s been an area of investment in recent years and we think that will continue here over the next few years.
So in summary for Detroit Edison and MichCon, we’re coming off a three-year period in 2009 and ’10 where we reduced capital expenditures in the wake of the economic crisis, but our capital expenditures on renewables, emission controls, gas main renewals and meter move-outs are going to drive our rate base investment up pretty sharply over the next three years.  Our average capital spending in our utilities over the next three years will be about a third higher than it was last year, for example; and it’s this investment that will enable us to bridge from about 3% utility earnings growth this year to a higher rate of 5 to 6% next year and beyond.
Slide 16 takes a similar multi-year look back and look forward for our non-utility businesses.  From 2007 to 2010, our two principle non-utility businesses - gas storage and pipelines, and power industrial - both grew at a healthy rate, 20% compound annual growth for those businesses over the three-year period.  Energy trading averaged earnings of about 45 million, although as you know, our last year of that three-year period was a low year for us.  The other significant event during those three years was a $1.5 billion monetization of our unconventional gas assets.
2011 for these businesses is a bridge year too.  Our P&I earnings are going to be lower than last year.  P&I earnings were very high last year but we had some items, as I’ll describe in a minute, that aren’t going to recur this year.  But we are scaling up at power and industrial through investments in reduced emission fuels and our renewables, and we do continue to identify investment opportunities in our gas storage and pipelines business and we are making progress on those.  In addition, we’re working to rebound from reduced earnings levels in energy trading the last few months, as Dave Meador will describe, have been promising on that front.  And we do continue to work this year to position for the monetization of our unconventional gas assets.
So if I look forward to the next few years on the non-utility front, we see reduced emission fuels and renewable investments providing very substantial growth within our power and industrial segment.  We have investments that will produce earnings growth at gas storage and pipelines, and we think our energy trading will return to more normal historical levels.  That will combine with a move to monetize unconventional gas assets which we’ll use to fund growth, and this set of dynamics will also contribute to the 5 to 6% growth that we’re describing in 2012 and beyond. 
Now one of the key elements of what I just described is the projected growth in our power and industrial business, and that is laid out on Slide 17.  First on the left-hand side of the slide, and actually we first laid this out this past fall at EEI, we saw a big step up this past year in earnings - earnings between ‘09 and ‘10 more than doubled.  But some of the items were non-recurring, so for example we saw high coke prices and we had some capacity open, and that played to our favor.  That’s not going to recur next year.  We also had the steel industry fuel tax credit.  We actually did think that was going to recur right to the very end of the tax bill this past year, but it did get pulled, to our surprise and to the steel industry’s surprise.  So those dynamics are producing a step down in earnings at P&I this year.
But as you can see from the light blue and dark blue bars here, we have two segments in this business that we expect to grow materially over the next number of years.  One of those, in the light blue, is the reduced emission fuel segment; and just as a reminder, this is—these are projects where we have a technology that can be used at coal plants to reduce mercury and NOX emissions, that also benefit from a federal tax credit.  We are making progress on developing this set of projects.  We completed the sale of an interest in one of these projects and have it up and running.  That was completed in January.  And we are in negotiations with a number of other potential counterparties who run power plants a lot like Detroit Edison does and face the same emission control requirements that we do, and our goal this year is to get several facilities with those counterparties cited and up and running so that we see the substantial step-up in earnings from this segment that’s indicated here in 2012.  And a little bit longer term, we’d expect to have our facilities pretty much fully pledged by 2013, and that 40 to $50 million largely in place by then.
On the renewable energy front, this past year we made significant progress in this arena.  We purchased a majority ownership of a 44 megawatt plant in California late in the year.  We’ll bring that online late this year.  We also came to an agreement on a 45 megawatt facility in California that we now have in the conversion process that we’ll bring online early in 2013.  Those two projects brought the total that we have in this segment of waste wood projects from small coal plants—brought the total to five, and so we’re going to see growth just from that base of five projects that we’ve brought online or are bringing online.  But we’d expect to continue to find and invest in additional projects here.  So the so-what of all this is that we expect the P&I segment to be one of our significant growth areas over the next three years and contribute to the 5 to 6% that I described earlier.  
We also see opportunities in our gas storage and pipeline business, and that’s laid out on Slide 18.  Our strongest opportunities in this segment center on the Millennium pipeline, which is shown there in dark blue.   It runs from upstate New York into the New York City area.  It also, as you can see, runs through the Marcellus Shale, and most of our development opportunities for that pipe center on gas that’s emerging from the Marcellus Shale.  And those opportunities come in the form of main line pipe expansions as well as laterals off of the pipeline, and eventually connectors between Millennium and other pipelines.  We are making progress on this front as well.  In fact, I think the discussions went from pretty introductory and new early last year to discussions that are getting quite promising and serious early this year.
So I think the so-what here is that over the next three years, we see this as the period that this gas storage and pipeline business, which grew a lot over the past five years, we’ll make the investments that will fuel its next significant step up in growth.
In summary for the Company, then, on Slide 19 our investments on the top left are going to be up materially over the next three years.  On average, if you compare the last three years to the next three years, we’re up on the order of 25% and that’s tied to our investments in Detroit Edison renewable assets, our environmental investments principally at the Monroe power plant, and the non-utility investments in P&I and our gas storage and pipeline that I’ve just mentioned.  I would also say that the utility investments we’re taking with a strong eye on managing customer affordability, as I mentioned at the very outset of this discussion.
But if you look at what that implies in terms of an investment base and earnings for the next few years, our earnings this year, we’ve given guidance of 340 to 370.  Within that, we do see utility earnings growth of about 3%; but as you can see, we expect earnings at both the utilities and our non-utility businesses to pick up in 2012 and ’13, and we’re projecting the 5 to 6% longer term growth there that we’ve talked about for some time.
So with that, I’m going to turn things over to Dave Meador to take a little bit closer look at 2010 and our 2011 guidance.  Dave, over to you.

I’m going to start on Slide 21.  For the year, our operating earnings are 607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance.  And as a reminder, there’s a reconciliation to ou",1755,"Thanks Gerry, and good morning again to everybody.  I’m going to start on Slide 21.  For the year, our operating earnings are 607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance.  And as a reminder, there’s a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings in the appendix, as well as there is other information in the appendix that I hope you’ll find helpful.
The $3.60 per share is a nickel higher than the midpoint of our original guidance for the year at $3.55, and is $0.30 or 9% higher than our 2009 operating earnings.  Detroit Edison contributed $2.60 per share, and MichCon came in at $0.63.  Both utilities did a great job, and as Gerry mentioned there, their authorized returns in 2010.  We are seeing improvements in the local economy that we also aligned on the load chart with Detroit Edison’s temperature normal electric load up 3%, and that was driven predominantly by the industrial sector which was up 21%.  
The non-utility businesses combined to earn $0.78 with power and industrial projects earning 85 million or $0.50 per share with a very strong year-over-year performance.  And as we indicated, this won’t be repeated in 2011.  Gas storage and pipelines came in at 4% higher than 2009 at 51 million or $0.30 per share, and energy trading had earnings of $0.04 and unconventional gas production had a $0.06 loss.
Finally, corporate and other had a loss of $0.41 for the year, and overall 2010 was a very good year for us.  The performance came in very strong with the bulk of the earnings coming from the two utilities, which have returned to their full earnings power.  As Gerry outlined, the power and industrial business had a very strong performance, almost offsetting the shortfall at energy trading.
Now shifting to 2011 and our outlook for the year on Slide 22, we outline our 2011 earnings guidance for each of the segments.  As I just said, both of our utilities earned their authorized return on equity in 2010 and we expect to do the same this year in 2011.  We have a rate case at Detroit Edison which will be finalized by the fourth quarter, and we are doing everything we believe is necessary to ensure a constructive order from the Commission, and I’ll talk a little bit more about that case in a moment.
At MichCon, we plan to return to a normal weather year after a warmer than normal year in 2010 and lower midstream revenues.  Also at the utilities, we will use our continuous improvement capabilities to partially offset O&M expense.  
Earnings at gas storage and pipelines will be up another 4% in 2011 as we continue to identify long-term expansion and development opportunities around the Millennium pipeline.  
In 2010, we impaired some non-strategic leases at our unconventional production business, and that won’t recur in 2011.  Also we’re seeing more oil and natural gas liquids production in our Barnett Shale properties, which is driving higher earnings in 2011.  We’ve included in the appendix some key operating metrics for the business as well as a schedule which summarizes the valuation for the Barnett assets.  
A couple points I want to point out here - given the nature of our properties, we get a 50 to 60% lift in revenue from natural gas liquids, and we are also pursuing some wells that add oil to our performance.  Currently the value derived from 1mcf of gas is about $6.40, which is a nice premium over dry gas prices.  Once a year, we update the reserve analysis for this business and we provide the valuation range, which is on Slide 35.  Even if you use the conservative low end of the valuation, our current reserves are worth at least 400 million or $2.35 per share; and then the midpoint for that range obviously is much higher.  Our plan is to still develop the properties for monetization with a focus on natural gas liquids and oil, and at the same time we’re going to eliminate the drag on earnings this year.
The power and industrial team is coming off a very strong year that we just talked about for 2010, which included some opportunities which won’t recur going forward such as the steel industry fuels tax credit and premium earnings on coke sales.  As Gerry explained, the story with the P&I group is the potential earnings opportunity from the REF business line and the coal to waste wood conversions.  We’ll start to see some earnings from these businesses in 2011 but we really start to scale up those lines in 2012 and forward.
2010, as you know, was a challenging year for our energy trading business.  After a strong first quarter, we saw the markets flatten out in the second half of the year with lower volatility and lower commodity prices.  In the third quarter, the business struggled to find the market opportunities to generate sufficient gross margin; however, that began to change noticeably in November and December.  In January and so far in February this year, we have found trading opportunities returning in areas like power trading and full requirements contract with gross margins in those months similar to prior years.  In fact, in January we earned about 20% of the economic gross margin that we assume in our full-year guidance.  While we don’t see this business getting back to historical levels of 40 to $50 million of operating income this year, we do expect it to make a significant step in that direction and we set the midpoint of guidance at 25 million.  
Finally, we’re expecting corporate and other to have improved results in 2011 primarily due to lower interest rate expense.  So in total, we project DTE Energy to have operating earnings of 576 to 631 million, or $3.40 to $3.70 per share.
On Slide 23, we have an overview of the Detroit Edison rate case.  We filed the case at the end of October with a total revenue requirement of 443 million.  As an example of how we are focusing on customer affordability in this rate filing, we proposed some potential alternatives which could reduce the net rate request by nearly 200 million for a net rate request of $253 million.  We’re looking forward to working collaboratively with the Commission on this rate case over the next coming months.  Staff testimony is due at the beginning of April, and we plan to self-implement a rate increase in April while we’ll receive the final order in this case no later than the end of October.
Now turning to cash flows on Slide 24, in 2009 we had one of the strongest cash years in our history with cash from operations of $1.8 billion, and I’m pleased to report that we achieved the same level of cash from operations in 2010.  We’re looking at 2011 with expected even stronger cash results of 1.9 billion in cash from operations.  If you looked at total cash after capital and dividend and asset sales for 2009 and 2010 combined, we generated $850 million in total cash flow over two years.  
As Gerry explained earlier, after slowing CAPEX during the recession, we plan to ramp it back up in 2011.  We’ve said in the past we expect to issue between 100 and 200 million of new equity to fund our growth over the next several years.  However, as a result of strong cash flows in 2010 and anticipated benefits from bonus depreciation of around 100 to $200 million between 2011 and 2012, we’re not expecting to issue any new equity this year and we’re working on reducing our equity needs for 2012.
On Slide 25, we’ve provided a breakdown for our 2011 capital plan.  If you look at our capital for the utilities, going back it was 960 million in 2009.  It was 1 billion in 2010, and we will be spending about 1.2 billion in 2011 which is nearly a 25% increase over 2009 levels.  At Detroit Edison, as we outlined, we’re in the process of scrubbing the two remaining units at Monroe and we expect to have a sharp step-up in our environmental capital for the year.  As we outlined, in 2010 we began construction on a 200 megawatt wind farm, and we’ll take ownership for 90 megawatts of that generation late this year or early next year, which will be about a $200 million investment for Detroit Edison.  At MichCon, we’re planning on increasing our capital spending by over 20% in 2011, and this is driven primarily by our pipeline integrity and meter relocation work.  Then at the non-utility businesses, we’re targeting capital investments of 200 to $300 million.
Slide 26 summarizes our balance sheet metrics.  We ended the year with our targeted leverage range and we expect to be within that range for 2011.  As a result of one-time deferred tax items in 2010, we realized FFO to debt of 28%, which is well above our targeted range.  We expect that to return to targeted levels in 2011.  And as a result of our strong balance sheet and cash flows we secured a credit upgrade from S&P at DTE Energy and at both of the utilities in December of last year.  Also, Fitch revised Detroit Edison’s rating outlook to positive last month.  In both cases, the agencies noted the economic conditions are improving in Michigan and a very positive regulatory environment that we have here.
Let me wrap up on Slide 27.  As we’ve outlined for you, we have a plan that we’re confident in that will provide 5 to 6% long-term operating growth and at the same time provide an attractive dividend which combined provide a very attractive total shareholder return, and at the same time, doing all of that while maintaining a very strong balance sheet.  As Gerry laid out, our utility growth plan is primarily driven by mandated investments and all of this is set in a very constructive regulatory structure that we understand that we understand we have to continue to earn every day by doing things by driving cost savings which will enable our utilities to earn their authorized return, and continuing to focus on our operational excellence, including customer satisfaction, which we believe over time will create a distinctive capability in this Company compared to others in the industry with a real focus on affordability.  To compliment the utilities, we have meaningful low risk growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses that will continue to provide diversity both in earnings and in geographic reach.  
With that, that wraps up our presentation and we’d be happy to take your questions.

One of the levers that we have here going forward is monetization of the remaining properties in the Barnett Shale, so we’re currently—as we indicated, we’re proving up the properties with a real focus on what I would describe as the wet nature of the gas, which is giving us an uplift in our prices, and we’re currently evaluating when we would start monetizing either small parcels of property or larger parcels over the next several years.

I think our regulators and legislators understand that, so the reason I think it isn’t high on their agenda is for that reason.  I think one person in particular who understands it is our governor.  It didn’t take him long.  He’s an ex-businessman and in particular a high-tech businessman with a financial background.

We’ve said pretty consistently we’re not looking to grow that business.  IT provides us intelligence and cash, and that’s its role.  It was 75 million two years ago, and 6 million last year.  We had a long period in 2010 where the markets just went dead, not only for us but everybody - about an eight month period.  But in December and January and so far in February, we have seen the markets return to much more normal behavior within our operation, so that’s a positive sign.  It’s not something you can project has to continue or will continue, but it certainly is a reversion back to more normal behavior from that eight month dead period last year.  
As Dave said, what we have this year is a range of 10 to 40.  It’s just in line with what we saw this past year at the low end, and kind of the low end of normal at the high end, so the midpoint is 25.  But we’d expect over time that we’d be able to achieve what we’ve seen over the past five years or so - that 40 to $50 million performance.

And what we’re trying to do—first of all, the renewables help with that because of the way the legislature structured them; but secondly, we’re fighting hard on the continuous improvement front to manage our operating cost to a lower growth profile to that.  The combination of the two are what we hope will allow us to moderate the rate increase profile.

But if you look forward, this is a heavy period of investment, particularly in emission controls were we’ve got almost a billion dollars over the next three years, and that’s going to imply that our rate base is going to be growing and we’re going to need to get returns on that to stay healthy.

We want to step back and make sure that we’re getting those.  The other thing that is true in this round of investments for us is that we got a stimulus grant, so that brought down our net investment and it brought down the cost to customers.  So what we want to do, then, is evaluate based upon the savings that we’re seeing, do we see savings to customers without help from the federal government?  In other words, if we need to carry the full load, do these things pay for themselves and lower customer rates?  And that’s what we—we’ll take a pause to do that evaluation.

The other conversation we have in the Company is managing customer bills with a focus on bill size, and so we are looking at the combined residential gas/electric bill and trying to manage it down because we feel if we manage it down, the investments we’re making will be received a lot better.  And so that decline in residential average use, we welcome and working to make happen.

First, I want to quickly review 2010 and some of our accomplishments last year. And then, I'm going to move on to a look-forward to 2011 and a few years beyond 2011.
In that second topic, I think it's especially important because as you'll see later, 2011 for us is a bridge year between what's been a period of very healthy earnings growth over the last three years and a period in 2012 and beyond, that we're confident will resume that pattern of earnings growth. So more on that in a few minutes.
So moving on to Slide 5. We looked back on 2010 as a really successful year for DTE Energy. On the earnings front, our EPS grew 9% year-over-year last year. And in fact, grew at a 9% compound rate for the last three years. In addition last year, we had essentially 11% ROE at both of our utilities. So we earned our authorized and also had solid earnings in our Non-Utility businesses, where a strong year in our Power & Industrial business covered off for a weaker year in our Energy Trading business.
On a cash flow front, our metrics remain strong. We were upgraded by S&P late in the year, which was something we've been working hard at for several years, so that was gratifying. We also increased our dividends 6%.
We also kept an intense focus, as we have for the past five years, on Continuous Improvement, and we continue to reap dividends from this effort within the company. So as I'll talk in a few minutes, our absolute O&M is down over the past five years, and we continue to work hard on our costs. But increasingly, we're turning this Continuous Improvement toward the customer front. You can see that our complaints, for example, at the Public Service Commission, are down 50% over the past five years.
And as I'll talk further in a little bit, we undertook a big step last year, essentially calling back every customer that we have an interaction with, using that to log defects, where we got things we need to fix, and then we're going after that with our CI.
We also undertook a lot of work on our growth agenda this past year. We announced our first major Renewable Energy project, a major win project that I'll talk about a little later. We began construction on our second scrubber at Monroe. And as you'll see later, we've got a substantial investment program over the next three years in emission controls. And we launched several new projects in our Power & Industrial business, particularly the Reduced Emissions Fuel business line, which is a significant new business line, that I'll lay out some facts on here in a few minutes, as well as our Waste Wood Renewables business line.
And moving on to Slide 6, talking a little bit more about Continuous Improvement. I mentioned that this continues to be an important focus for us at the company. You can see from the graphic on the cost front that our CI initiatives have more than offset structural cost pressures over the last five years. So absolute utility O&M is down over $100 million, despite upward pressure in pension and healthcare, environmental additions at our power plants, general inflation and so forth. And our work here is to keep driving each area of the company to top-quartile operating performance, and as we achieve that, push beyond that.
In addition to the cost savings, we're, as I said a minute ago, really focusing the CI effort more and more on the customer front. Outage frequency, improved fieldwork, options for low-income customers and so forth. The reason for all of this is our belief that the companies that do the best during significant investment cycles, and we are in one of those, the companies that do best are those that aggressively manage affordability and maintain constructive regulatory relationships. And our belief is, the best way to accomplish those two things is Continuous Improvement focused on cost and customer-service. To put differently, to get constructive regulation, you need to deserve it, you need to earn it. And that's especially true when heavy investment is putting pressure on rates. And our job is to use this Continuous Improvement process to offset those rate pressures, manage affordability and improve service quality. And if we do that well, we believe the odds of constructive regulation and fair treatment are much higher.
Now, speaking of constructive regulation, on Slide 7, one of the things that's certainly changed for the better in Michigan in recent years is our regulatory structure and our regulatory processes. You can see on Slide 6 some of the highlights and important regulatory developments for our utilities this past year. Starting with the final order we received at Detroit Edison early in the year, which we characterized and continue to understand as we went through the years as a constructive order. We held off, as you can see, further right on the slide, we held off on filing a new rate case at Detroit Edison as long as we could, but did eventually file in October. And I think if you'd take a look at that filing, you'll also see that we took some very creative steps within it to manage affordability and the amount that we'd need to increase rates for customers.
That case, we would expect to self-implement under in April and the case will go final in October. On the MichCon front, we received the final order, as you can see in the middle of the slide, in June. We did file a rate case pretty quickly on the heels of that. But as the year went on, and we continued to work on our costs, and watched the behavior of things within the company, we eventually determined that we could forego the case. And we did that, withdrawing the case in December, concluding that, that was the right thing to do from a customer-affordability perspective.
Moving on to Slide 8. Another thing that's changed for the better in Michigan over the past year is the economy. And you can see on the left-hand side of the slide what's happening on the industrial front. The strong performance of the auto companies has been getting a lot of attention nationally, but the industrial turnaround that we're seeing has been pretty broad. As you can see, we were up 21% this past year, which led to an overall growth and territory sales of 3%. That turnaround is translating into the employment of folks here in Michigan as well. You can see that the unemployment rate, which peaked at about 14.5%, was down to 11.7% by the end of the year. So that's a positive development.
Another indicator of health in the economy is our arrears, and you can see that we took a big step down in arrears this past year. Our uncollectible expense that's associated with that was down sharply last year as well.
So I think a range of indicators that suggest that we have worked our way through the events of the recession, and we've got a nice recovery in the underlying economy here in Michigan.
Onto Slide 9, I'm not going to turn from a look back on 2010, to a look forward to this year and the next few years. I mentioned earlier that the past three years have been a period of very healthy earnings growth for DTE. Earnings per share have grown 9% annually, between 2007 and 2010.
Our EPS guidance for this year, 2011, is roughly flat to 2010 levels. It's actually down a bit at the midpoint of our guidance, as you can see from Slide 10.
And at DTE, we are talking very explicitly with our employees about 2011, being a bridge year. A bridge between that period of healthy earnings growth from 2007 to 2010, and a period in 2012 and beyond that I'm confident is going to resume that pattern of healthy earnings growth. 5% to 6% a year is what we've been saying for a long time is our target, and that's what we foresee.
So one question might be, why are we so confident that 2011 is this bridge and we're going to see that resumption of earnings growth next year and beyond. That's one of the things we want to help you understand this morning. And I think to do that, you need to both look back and look forward. You need to look back to understand the dynamics that are shaping our earnings this year in 2011, and look forward at the investments that we're making this year and that we have underway that will play out over the next few years and beyond that will shape earnings in the future.
So what I want to do is take that look back and look forward, and I'll do that with our utilities and then turn to our Non-Utility businesses. 
And then on Slide 11, I laid this out for Detroit Edison and MichCon. And from 2007 to 2010, in those two businesses, we saw combined utility earnings growth of 9%. We also used Continuous Improvement to bring the ROEs in those two businesses to their allowed levels. But during that period, of course the economic crisis hit, and we pulled back investment pretty sharply like a lot of people did because of the capital market uncertainty and to manage customer affordability.
And the result of that pullback is playing out this year. So if you look in the middle of the slide you'll see that our combined utility earnings growth is projected at about 3% in 2011. That's less certainly than we've seen in recent years and less than our long-term goal of 5% to 6%. But it's really a result of a lag impact from our reduction in investment in the heart of the crisis.
But as you'll also see in a few minutes, this is the year, 2011, where we resume strong investments in utilities, especially in Renewable Power and Emission Controls within Detroit Edison. And the result of that, on the right-hand portion of Slide 11, is that we do expect to see a resumption of 5% to 6% annual growth in our utilities in 2012 and beyond. And in addition, in that period, the renewable investments that were beginning to ramp back up and the environment investments will be actually even heavier next year and the few years beyond that.
So this is what I just described as I think even clearer on Slide 12, where you can see our capital spending pattern, we had been planning for a period of quite heavy investment in 2009 and '10 when the crisis hit. You can see how we pulled back, especially sharply in 2009. And we really only stepped up capital a bit this past year, and this is what temporarily slowed the growth in our rate base and what's playing through with the lag here in 2011.
If you look at this year and the next two years though, you can see in the light blue bars and the green bars, that our emission control investments and renewable investments are going to step up materially. Total capital expenditures will be $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2011, and as you can see, $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion over the two-year period, 2012 and 2013. 
You'll also see a kind of dotted green box in 2011 with a gray arrow, I'll tell you a little bit about more that in a minute. But there's a Renewable Energy project, a wind farm that we're pursuing with a partner. And the arrangement we have with a partner is that they're going to construct the project, and then we're going to buy in as that construction plays out. We're going to finish up the construction this year. So we may buy in a roughly $200 million portion of the project late this year or at the very beginning of next year. So that $200 million could swing in either late 2011 or early 2012.
You can also see that in the light blue here, the emission control expenditures ramped back up substantially as we prepare for requirements that are targeted to 2015.
So this step up in capital spending at Detroit Edison is further laid out on Slide 13. The biggest piece of that investment is in our base infrastructure where we see $700 million, $800 million per year, $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion over the three-year period. But the real growth in our earnings power and rate base is coming from the right two columns. Our environmental compliance expenditures, $800 million to $900 million over the three-year period is really targeted to finishing two scrubbers and coming close to finishing one additional SCR at our Monroe Power Plant.
In addition to that, we see $500 million to $600 million of Renewable Energy expenditures. The state for us has a requirement of 300 megawatts in place by 2013, so within the next three years. And we have the right, under law, to own half of that. So our projected expenditures to make that play out are $500 million to $600 million over the next three years. 
And the details of that renewable expenditure are laid out on Slide 14. And the first thing I'd focus you on is the red star there in the middle of the state. That's the project that I mentioned just a minute ago, that we're pursuing jointly with Invenergy. It's a 200-megawatt wind farm. We are going to own 90 megawatts of that installation, about a $200 million capital investment. And as I said a minute ago, the way this is playing out is that Invenergy is going to front investment, and then we will buy in for our piece as the project  gets close to ready to go commercial. 
So you can see the impact of that, then at the bottom left of the slide that we had a substantial step up in our earnings from Renewable Energy and energy optimization as we go from 2011 to 2012. And this is certainly one of the things that is driving a return to earnings growth at a higher level at Detroit Edison in 2012.
And if you look down the road, as I mentioned, we need to add to that project between 2012 in 2013. We'd expect to do that using the 78,000 acres of easements that we have under contract in Huron County, that's designated there by the purple star. We're working on those, and we'd expect those investments on the heels of this Invenergy investment to take earnings in this business line to about $15 million by 2015. And as you can see we'll have a significant portion of that in place by the middle of this period 2013.
MichCon, moving on to Slide 15. We'll also be investing substantial capital over the next three years, about $500 million to $600 million over that period, or about $175 million to $200 million a year. The MichCon's investment agenda is laid out on Slide 15. The most significant element of MichCon's investments are in the gas distribution network. And in particular, we have been working with the Michigan Public Service Commission on a multiyear main renewal and meter move-out program, that steps up the capital that we will be committing to our distribution infrastructure.
In addition to that, we continue to find opportunities within our Utility Storage & Transportation asset base to expand storage. Generally, what we find our customers who want us to expand our storage, we contract with those customers and then often have pipeline investments that are needed to take that storage to market. That's been an area of investment in recent years, and we think that will continue here over the next few years.
So in summary, for Detroit Edison and MichCon, we're coming off a two-year period in 2009 and 2010 where we reduced capital expenditures in the wake of the economic crisis. But our capital expenditures on renewables, emission controls, gas main renewables, and meter move-outs, are going to drive our rate base investment up pretty sharply over the next three years. Our average capital spending in our utilities over the next three years will be about a third higher than it was last year, for example. And this is investment that will enable us to bridge from about 3% utility earnings growth this year to a higher rate of 5% to 6% next year and beyond.
Slide 16 takes a similar multiyear look back and look forward for our Non-Utility businesses. From 2007 to 2010, our two principal Non-Utility businesses, Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power & Industrial, both grew at a healthy rate, 20% compound annual growth for those two businesses over the three-year period.
Energy Trading averaged earnings of about $45 million. Although as you know, our last year, the three-year period, was a low year for us. The other significant event during those three years was a $1.5 billion monetization of our unconventional gas assets.
2011 for these businesses is a bridge year, too. Our P&I earnings are going to be lower than last year. P&I earnings were very high last year. But we have some items, as I'll describe in a minute, that aren't going to recur this year. But we are scaling up at Power & Industrial through investments in Reduced Emissions Fuel and our renewables. And we do continue to identify investment opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and we are making progress on those. 
In addition, we're working to rebound from reduced earnings levels in Energy Trading in the last few months, as Dave Meador will describe, had been promising on that front. And we do continue to work this year to position for the monetization of our Unconventional Gas assets.
So if I look forward to the next few years in the Non-Utility front, we see reduced emission fuels and renewable investments providing a very substantial growth within our Power & Industrial segment. We have investments that will produce earnings growth at Gas Storage and Pipelines, and we think our Energy Trading will return to more normal historical levels. 
That will combine with a move to monetize Unconventional Gas assets, which we'll use to fund growth. And this set of dynamics will also contribute to the 5% to 6% growth that we're describing in 2012 and beyond.
And one of the key elements of what I just described is the projected growth in our Power & Industrial business, and that's laid out on Slide 17. First, on the left-hand side of the slide, and actually we first laid this out this past fall at EEI. We saw a big step up this past year in earnings. Earnings between '09 and '10 more than doubled, but some of the items were nonrecurring. So for example, we saw high coal prices and we have some capacity open and that played to our favor, that's not going to recur next year period. We also had the steel industry fuel tax credit. We actually did think that was going to recur right to the very end of the tax bill this past year, but it did get pulled to our surprise and to steel industry's surprise. So those dynamics are producing a step down in earnings of P&I this year.
But as you can see from the light blue and dark blue bars, here we have two segments in this business that we expect to grow materially over the next number of years. One of those, in the light blue, is the Reduced Emission Fuel segment. And just as a reminder, these are projects where we have a technology that can be used at coal plants to reduce mercury and NOx emissions. They'll also benefit from a federal tax credit. We are making progress on developing these set of projects. We've completed the sale of an interest in one of these projects and we had it up and running. That was completed in January, and we are in negotiations with a number of other potential counterparties who run power plants a lot like Detroit Edison does and face the same emission control requirements that we do. And our goal this year is to get several facilities with those counterparties sited and up and running, so that we see the substantial step up in earnings from this segment that's indicated here in 2012. And a little bit longer-term, we'd expect to have our facilities pretty much fully placed by 2013, and that $40 million to $50 million largely in place by then.
On the Renewable Energy front, this past year, we made significant progress in this arena. We purchased a majority ownership of a 44-megawatt plant in California late in the year. We'll bring that online late this year. We also came to agreement on a 45-megawatt facility in California that we now have in the conversion process that we'll bring online early in 2013. Those two projects brought the total that we have in this segment of Waste Wood projects, from a small coal plants brought the total to five. And so we're going to see growth just from that base of five projects that we've brought online or are bringing online, but we'd expect to continue to find and invest in additional projects here.
So the soul of all this is that we expect the P&I segment to be one of our significant growth areas over the next three years and contribute to the 5% to 6% that I described earlier. 
We also see opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipeline business, and that's laid out on Slide 18. Our strongest opportunities in this segment center on the Millennium Pipeline, which is shown there in dark blue, runs from upstate New York into the New York City area. And also as you can see, it runs through the Marcellus shale, and most of our development opportunities for that pipe center on gas that's emerging from the Marcellus shale. And those opportunities come in the form of mainline pipe expansions, as well as a laterals off of the pipeline, and eventually connectors between Millennium and other pipelines.
And we are making progress on this front as well, in fact, I think the discussions went from pretty introductory and new early last year to discussions that are getting quite promising and serious early this year. 
[indiscernible]  Here is that over the next three years, we see this is the period that this Gas Storage and Pipeline business, which grew a lot in over the past five years, will make the investments that will fuel its next significant step up in growth.
So in summary, for the company then, on Slide 19, our investments in the top left are going to be up materially over the next three years. On average, if you compare the last three years to the next three years, we're up about on the order of 25%, and that's tied to our investments in Detroit Edison renewable assets, our environmental investments, principally at the Monroe Power Plant, and the Non-Utility investments in P&I and our Gas Storage and Pipeline that I just mentioned. And I would also say that the utility investments, we're taking with a strong eye on managing customer affordability as I mentioned at the very outset of this discussion.
But if you look at what that implies in terms of an investment base and earnings for the next few years, our earnings this year, we've given guidance of $3.40 to $3.70. Within that, we do see utility earnings growth of about 3%. But as you can see, we expect earnings at both the Utilities and our Non-Utility businesses to pick up in 2012 and 2013. And we're projecting the 5% to 6% longer-term growth there that we've talked about for some time.
So with that, I'm going to turn things over to Dave Meador to take a little bit closer look at 2010, and our 2011 guidance. Dave, over to you."

I'm going to start on Slide 21.For the year, our operating earnings are $607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And as a reminder, there's a reconciliation to our GAA",1782,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning again to everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 21.
For the year, our operating earnings are $607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And as a reminder, there's a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings in the appendix, as well as there's other information in the appendix that I hope you will find helpful. The $3.60 per share is a nickel higher than the midpoint of our original guidance for the year at $3.55, and it's $0.30 or 9% higher than our 2009 operating earnings. Detroit Edison contributed $2.60 per share and MichCon came in at $0.63. Both utilities did a great job. And as Gerry mentioned, they earned the authorized returns in 2010. We are seeing improvements in the local economy that we also aligned on the low chart and
with Detroit Edison's temperature normal electric load of 3%, and that was driven predominantly by the industrial sector, which was up 21%. 
The Non-Utility businesses combined to earn $0.78, with Power & Industrial projects earning $85 million or $0.50 per share with a very strong year-over-year performance, and as we indicated this won't be repeated in 2011. Gas Storage and Pipelines came in at 4% higher than 2009 at $51 million or $0.30 per share. And Energy Trading had net earnings of $0.04 and Unconventional Gas Production had $0.06 a loss.
Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.41 for the year. And overall 2010 was a very good year for us. The performance came in very strong with the bulk of the earnings coming from the two utilities, which have returned to their full earnings power.
And as Gerry outlined, the Power & Industrial business had a very strong performance, almost offsetting the shortfall at Energy Trading.
Now shifting to 2011 and our outlook for the year on Slide 22. We outlined our 2011 earnings guidance for each of the segments. As I just said, both of our utilities earned the authorized return on equity in 2010, and we expect to do the same this year in 2011. We have a rate case at Detroit Edison, which will be finalized by the fourth quarter. And we're doing everything we believe is necessary to ensure constructive order from the commission. And I'll talk a little bit more about that case in a moment. 
In MichCon, we plan to return to a normal weather year after a warmer than normal year in 2010, in lower midstream revenues. Also, at the Utilities, we will leverage our continuous improvement capabilities to partially offset O&M expense.
Earnings at Gas Storage and Pipelines will be up another 4% in 2011, as we continue to identify long-term expansion and development opportunities around the Millennium pipeline.
In 2010, we impaired some non-strategic leases at our Unconventional Production business, and that won't reoccur in 2011. Also, we're seeing more oil and natural gas liquids production in our Barnett shale properties, which is driving higher earnings in 2011. We've included in the appendix some key operating metrics for the business, as well as a schedule, which summarizes the valuation for the Barnett assets. 
And a couple of points I want to point out here.  Given the nature of our properties, we get a 50% to 60% lift in revenue from natural gas liquids, and we are also pursuing some wells that add oil to our performance.
Currently the value derived from one Mcf of gas is about $6.40, which is a nice premium over dry gas prices. Once a year we update the reserve analysis for this business and we provide the valuation range, which is on Slide 35. And even if you use the conservative low-end of the valuation, and our current reserves are worth at least $400 million or $2.35 per share, and then the midpoint for that range obviously is much higher. Our plan is to still develop the properties for monetization with a focus on natural gas, liquids and oil, and at the same time, we're going to eliminate the drag on earnings this year.
The Power & Industrial team is coming off a very strong year that we just talked about for 2010, which included some opportunities which won't reoccur going forward such as the Steel Industry Fuels tax credit and premium earnings on coke sales. As Gerry explained, the story with the P&I group is the potential earnings opportunity from the REF business line and the coal-to-waste wood conversions. We'll start to see some earnings from these businesses in 2011, but we'll really start to scale up those lines in 2012 and forward. 
2010, as you know was a challenging year for our Energy Trading business. After a strong first quarter, we saw the markets flatten out in the second half of the year with lower volatility and lower commodity prices.
In the third quarter, the business struggled to find the market opportunities to generate sufficient gross margin, however, that begin to change noticeably in November and December. In January, and so far in February this year, we have found trading opportunities returning in areas like power trading and control requirements contract with gross margins in those months similar to prior years. In fact in January, we earned about 20% of the economic gross margin that we have assumed in our full year guidance.
While we don't see this business getting back to historical levels of $40 million to $50 million of operating income this year, we do expect to make a significant step in that direction, and we set the midpoint of guidance at $25 million.
Finally, we're expecting Corporate & Other to have improved results in 2011, primarily due to lower interest rate expense. So in total, we project DTE Energy to have operating earnings of $576 million to $631 million or $3.40 to $3.70 per share.
On Slide 23, we have an overview of the Detroit Edison rate case. We filed the case at the end of October, with a total revenue requirement of $443 million. And as an example of how we are focusing on customer affordability in this rate filing, we proposed some potential alternatives, which could reduce the net rate request by nearly $200 million for a net rate request of $253 million. We're looking forward to working collaboratively with commission on this rate case over the next coming months. Staff testimony is due at the beginning of April, and we plan to self-implement a rate increase in April, or we'll receive a final order in this case no later than the end of October. 
Now turning to cash flows on Slide 24. In 2009, we had one of the strongest cash years in our history with cash from operations of $1.8 billion. And I'm pleased to report that we achieved the same level  of cash from operations in 2010. And we're looking at 2011 with expected even stronger cash results of $1.9 billion in cash from operations.
If you looked at total cash after capital and in dividend and asset sales for 2009 and 2010 combined, we generated $850 million in total cash flow over two years. As Gerry explained earlier, after slowing CapEx during the recession, we plan to ramp it back up in 2011. We've said in the past we expect to issue between $100 million and $200 million of new equity to fund our growth over the next several years. However, as a result of strong cash flows in 2010 and anticipated benefits from bonus depreciation of around $100 million to $200 million between 2011 and 2012, we're not expecting to issue any new equity this year. And we're working on reducing our equity needs for 2012.
On Slide 25, we provide a breakdown for our 2011 capital plan. If you look at our capital for the utilities, going back it was $960 million in 2009. It was $1 billion in 2010. And we'll be spending about $1.2 billion in 2011, which is nearly a 25% increase over 2009 levels. At Detroit Edison, as we outlined, we're in the process of scrubbing the two remaining units in Monroe, and we expect to have a sharp step-up in our environmental capital for the year. And as we outlined in 2010, we began a construction on  a 200-megawatt wind farm. We'll take ownership for 90 megawatts of that generation in late this year or early next year, which will be about a $200 million investment for Detroit Edison. 
And in MichCon, we're planning on increasing our capital spending by over 20% in 2011. And this is driven primarily by our pipeline integrity and meter relocation work.  And then at the Non-Utility businesses, we're targeting capital investments of $200 million to $300 million.
Slide 26 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We ended the year with our targeted leverage range, and we expect to be within that range for 2011. As a result of one-time deferred tax items in 2010, we realized FFO-to-debt of 28%,  which is well above our targeted range. We expect that to return to targeted levels in 2011. 
And as a result of our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we secured a credit upgrade from S&P at DTE Energy and at both the utilities in December of last year. Also Fitch revised Detroit Edison's rating outlook to positive last month. And in both cases, the agencies noted the economic conditions that are improving in Michigan and the very positive regulatory environment that we have here.
Let me wrap up on Slide 27. As we've outlined for you, we have a plan, and we're confident in, that will provide 5% to 6% long-term operating growth, and at the same time provide an attractive dividend, which combine, provide a very attractive total shareholder return. And at the same time, doing all of that by maintaining a very strong balance sheet. As Gerry laid out, our utility growth plan is primarily driven by mandated investments. And all of this is set in a very constructive regulatory structure that we understand that we have to continue to earn everyday by doing things, by driving cost savings, which will enable our utilities to earn their authorized return. And continuing to focus on operational excellence, including customer satisfaction, which we believe over time will create a distinctive capability in this company compared to others in the industry with a real focus on affordability.
And to complement the utilities, we have meaningful low-risk growth opportunities in our Non-Utility businesses that will continue to provide diversity, both in earnings and geographic reach.
With that, that wraps up our presentation. And we'll be happy to take your questions."

We're going to drive that down next year. One of the levers that we have here going forward is monetization of the remaining properties in the Barnett shale. So we're currently, as we indicated, proving up the properties with the real focus on what I would describe as the wet nature of the gas, which is giving us an uplift in our prices. And we're currently evaluating when we would start monetizing either small parcels of property or larger parcels over the next several years."

But in December and January and so far in February, we have seen the markets return to much more normal behavior within our operation. So that's a positive sign. It's not something you can project, it has to continue or will continue. But it certainly is a reversion back to more normal behavior from that, that eight-month death period last year. And as Dave said, what we have this year is a range of $10 million to $40 million. It's just in line with what we saw this past year at the low-end, and kind of a low-end of normal at the high-end, so the midpoint is $25 million.

We've filed the case and as any other case over time, after we filed it, some of the assumptions started to change and the factors we looked at the amount of money what we would need on the rate increase to hit our targeted earnings was much smaller.

And then we can put our energy and focus together on the Detroit Edison case where there's a lot more economics. So this is more about that overtime the number got small enough, we started asking ourselves a question why are we pursuing a case versus just going back to what we do really well, which is work on Continuous Improvement and cost. And I think Gerry addressed that overall, our ROE view right now is that in the Edison case, we filed for 11 and then eight. We believe that our position on that is supportable, and we're going to pursue that in the case. And we think there's other, much larger value drivers for customers that we will be talking to the commission about, and the way that we filed that case that can make it a win-win for us and for customers and that ROE is one of them."

First, I want to quickly review 2010 and some of our accomplishments last year. And then, I'm going to move on to a look-forward to 2011 and a few years beyond 2011.
In that second topic, I think it's especially important because as you'll see later, 2011 for us is a bridge year between what's been a period of very healthy earnings growth over the last three years and a period in 2012 and beyond, that we're confident will resume that pattern of earnings growth. So more on that in a few minutes.
So moving on to Slide 5. We looked back on 2010 as a really successful year for DTE Energy. On the earnings front, our EPS grew 9% year-over-year last year. And in fact, grew at a 9% compound rate for the last three years. In addition last year, we had essentially 11% ROE at both of our utilities. So we earned our authorized and also had solid earnings in our Non-Utility businesses, where a strong year in our Power & Industrial business covered off for a weaker year in our Energy Trading business.
On the cash flow front, our metrics remain strong. We were upgraded by S&P late in the year, which was something we've been working hard at for several years, so that was gratifying. We also increased our dividends 6%.
We also kept an intense focus, as we have for the past five years, on Continuous Improvement, and we continue to reap dividends from this effort within the company. So as I'll talk in a few minutes, our absolute O&M is down over the past five years, and we continue to work hard on our costs. But increasingly, we're turning this Continuous Improvement toward the customer front. You can see that our complaints, for example, at the Public Service Commission, are down 50% over the past five years.
And as I'll talk further in a little bit, we undertook a big step last year, essentially calling back every customer that we have an interaction with, using that to log defects, where we've got things we need to fix, and then we're going after that with our CI.
We also undertook a lot of work on our growth agenda this past year. We announced our first major Renewable Energy project, a major win project that I'll talk about a little later. We began construction on our second scrubber at Monroe. And as you'll see later, we've got a substantial investment program over the next three years in emission controls. And we launched several new projects in our Power & Industrial business, particularly the Reduced Emissions Fuel business line, which is a significant new business line, that I'll lay out some facts on here in a few minutes, as well as our Waste Wood Renewables business line.
And moving on to Slide 6, talking a little bit more about Continuous Improvement. I mentioned that this continues to be an important focus for us at the company. You can see from the graphic on the cost front that our CI initiatives have more than offset structural cost pressures over the last five years. So absolute utility O&M is down over $100 million, despite upward pressure in pension and healthcare, environmental additions at our power plants, general inflation and so forth. And our work here is to keep driving each area of the company to top-quartile operating performance, and as we achieve that, push beyond that.
In addition to the cost savings, we're, as I said a minute ago, really focusing the CI effort more and more on the customer front. Outage frequency, improved fieldwork, options for low-income customers and so forth. The reason for all of this is our belief that the companies that do the best during significant investment cycles, and we are in one of those, the companies that do best are those that aggressively manage affordability and maintain constructive regulatory relationships. And our belief is, the best way to accomplish those two things is Continuous Improvement focused on cost and customer-service. To put differently, to get constructive regulation, you need to deserve it, you need to earn it. And that's especially true when heavy investment is putting pressure on rates. And our job is to use this Continuous Improvement process to offset those rate pressures, manage affordability and improve service quality. And if we do that well, we believe the odds of constructive regulation and fair treatment are much higher.
Now, speaking of constructive regulation, on Slide 7, one of the things that's certainly changed for the better in Michigan in recent years is our regulatory structure and our regulatory processes. You can see on Slide 6 some of the highlights and important regulatory developments for our utilities this past year. Starting with the final order we received at Detroit Edison early in the year, which we characterized and continue to understand as we went through the years as a constructive order. We held off, as you can see, further right on the slide, we held off on filing a new rate case at Detroit Edison as long as we could, but did eventually file in October. And I think if you'd take a look at that filing, you'll also see that we took some very creative steps within it to manage affordability and the amount that we'd need to increase rates for customers.
That case, we would expect to self-implement under in April and the case will go final in October. On the MichCon front, we received the final order, as you can see in the middle of the slide, in June. We did file a rate case pretty quickly on the heels of that. But as the year went on, and we continued to work on our costs, and watched the behavior of things within the company, we eventually determined that we could forego the case. And we did that, withdrawing the case in December, concluding that, that was the right thing to do from a customer-affordability perspective.
Moving on to Slide 8. Another thing that's changed for the better in Michigan over the past year is the economy. And you can see on the left-hand side of the slide what's happening on the industrial front. The strong performance of the auto companies has been getting a lot of attention nationally, but the industrial turnaround that we're seeing has been pretty broad. As you can see, we were up 21% this past year, which led to an overall growth and territory sales of 3%. That turnaround is translating into the employment of folks here in Michigan as well. You can see that the unemployment rate, which peaked at about 14.5%, was down to 11.7% by the end of the year. So that's a positive development.
Another indicator of health in the economy is our arrears, and you can see that we took a big step down in arrears this past year. Our uncollectible expense that's associated with that was down sharply last year as well.
So I think a range of indicators that suggest that we have worked our way through the events of the recession, and we've got a nice recovery in the underlying economy here in Michigan.
Onto Slide 9, I'm now going to turn from a look back on 2010, to a look forward to this year and the next few years. I mentioned earlier that the past three years have been a period of very healthy earnings growth for DTE. Earnings per share have grown 9% annually, between 2007 and 2010.
Our EPS guidance for this year, 2011, is roughly flat to 2010 levels. It's actually down a bit at the midpoint of our guidance, as you can see from Slide 10.
And at DTE, we are talking very explicitly with our employees about 2011, being a bridge year. A bridge between that period of healthy earnings growth from 2007 to 2010, and a period in 2012 and beyond that I'm confident is going to resume that pattern of healthy earnings growth. 5% to 6% a year is what we've been saying for a long time is our target, and that's what we foresee.
So one question might be, why are we so confident that 2011 is this bridge and we're going to see that resumption of earnings growth next year and beyond. That's one of the things we want to help you understand this morning. And I think to do that, you need to both look back and look forward. You need to look back to understand the dynamics that are shaping our earnings this year in 2011, and look forward at the investments that we're making this year and that we have underway that will play out over the next few years and beyond that will shape earnings in the future.
So what I want to do is take that look back and look forward, and I'll do that with our utilities and then turn to our Non-Utility businesses. 
And then on Slide 11, I laid this out for Detroit Edison and MichCon. And from 2007 to 2010, in those two businesses, we saw combined utility earnings growth of 9%. We also used Continuous Improvement to bring the ROEs in those two businesses to their allowed levels. But during that period, of course the economic crisis hit, and we pulled back investment pretty sharply like a lot of people did because of the capital market uncertainty and to manage customer affordability.
And the result of that pullback is playing out this year. So if you look in the middle of the slide you'll see that our combined utility earnings growth is projected at about 3% in 2011. That's less certainly than we've seen in recent years and less than our long-term goal of 5% to 6%. But it's really a result of a lag impact from our reduction in investment in the heart of the crisis.
But as you'll also see in a few minutes, this is the year, 2011, where we resume strong investments in the utilities, especially in Renewable Power and Emission Controls within Detroit Edison. And the result of that, on the right-hand portion of Slide 11, is that we do expect to see a resumption of 5% to 6% annual growth in our utilities in 2012 and beyond. And in addition, in that period, the renewable investments that we're beginning to ramp back up and the environment investments will be actually even heavier next year and the few years beyond that.
So this is what I just described as I think even clearer on Slide 12, where you can see our capital spending pattern, we had been planning for a period of quite heavy investment in 2009 and '10 when the crisis hit. You can see how we pulled back, especially sharply in 2009. And we really only stepped up capital a bit this past year, and this is what temporarily slowed the growth in our rate base and what's playing through with the lag here in 2011.
If you look at this year and the next two years though, you can see in the light blue bars and the green bars, that our emission control investments and renewable investments are going to step up materially. Total capital expenditures will be $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2011, and as you can see, $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion over the two-year period, 2012 and 2013. 
You'll also see a kind of dotted green box in 2011 with a gray arrow, I'll tell you a little bit about more that in a minute. But there's a Renewable Energy project, a wind farm that we're pursuing with a partner. And the arrangement we have with a partner is that they're going to construct the project, and then we're going to buy in as that construction plays out. We're going to finish up the construction this year. So we may buy in a roughly $200 million portion of the project late this year or at the very beginning of next year. So that $200 million could swing in either late 2011 or early 2012.
You can also see that in the light blue here, the emission control expenditures ramp back up substantially as we prepare for requirements that are targeted to 2015.
So this step up in capital spending at Detroit Edison is further laid out on Slide 13. The biggest piece of that investment is in our base infrastructure where we see $700 million, $800 million per year, $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion over the three-year period. But the real growth in our earnings power and rate base is coming from the right two columns. Our environmental compliance expenditures, $800 million to $900 million over the three-year period is really targeted to finishing two scrubbers and coming close to finishing one additional SCR at our Monroe Power Plant.
In addition to that, we see $500 million to $600 million of Renewable Energy expenditures. The state for us has a requirement of 300 megawatts in place by 2013, so within the next three years. And we have the right, under law, to own half of that. So our projected expenditures to make that play out are $500 million to $600 million over the next three years. 
And the details of that renewable expenditure are laid out on Slide 14. And the first thing I'd focus you on is the red star there in the middle of the state. That's the project that I mentioned just a minute ago, that we're pursuing jointly with Invenergy. It's a 200-megawatt wind farm. We are going to own 90 megawatts of that installation, about a $200 million capital investment. And as I said a minute ago, the way this is playing out is that Invenergy is going to front the investment, and then we will buy in for our piece as the project  gets close to ready to go commercial. 
So you can see the impact of that, then at the bottom left of the slide that we get a substantial step up in our earnings from Renewable Energy and energy optimization as we go from 2011 to 2012. And this is certainly one of the things that is driving a return to earnings growth at a higher level at Detroit Edison in 2012.
And if you look down the road, as I mentioned, we need to add to that project between 2012 in 2013. We'd expect to do that using the 78,000 acres of easements that we have under contract in Huron County, that's designated there by the purple star. We're working on those, and we'd expect those investments on the heels of this Invenergy investment to take earnings in this business line to about $15 million by 2015. And as you can see we'll have a significant portion of that in place by the middle of this period 2013.
MichCon, moving on to Slide 15. We'll also be investing substantial capital over the next three years, about $500 million to $600 million over that period, or about $175 million to $200 million a year. The MichCon's investment agenda is laid out on Slide 15. The most significant element of MichCon's investments are in the gas distribution network. And in particular, we have been working with the Michigan Public Service Commission on a multiyear main renewal and meter move-out program, that steps up the capital that we will be committing to our distribution infrastructure.
In addition to that, we continue to find opportunities within our Utility Storage & Transportation asset base to expand storage. Generally, what we find our customers who want us to expand our storage, we contract with those customers and then often have pipeline investments that are needed to take that storage to market. That's been an area of investment in recent years, and we think that will continue here over the next few years.
So in summary, for Detroit Edison and MichCon, we're coming off a two-year period in 2009 and 2010 where we reduced capital expenditures in the wake of the economic crisis. But our capital expenditures on renewables, emission controls, gas main renewables, and meter move-outs, are going to drive our rate base investment up pretty sharply over the next three years. Our average capital spending in our utilities over the next three years will be about a third higher than it was last year, for example. And it's this investment that will enable us to bridge from about 3% utility earnings growth this year to a higher rate of 5% to 6% next year and beyond.
Slide 16 takes a similar multiyear look back and look forward for our Non-Utility businesses. From 2007 to 2010, our two principal Non-Utility businesses, Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power & Industrial, both grew at a healthy rate, 20% compound annual growth for those two businesses over the three-year period.
Energy Trading averaged earnings of about $45 million. Although as you know, our last year, in that three-year period, was a low year for us. The other significant event during those three years was a $1.5 billion monetization of our unconventional gas assets.
2011 for these businesses is a bridge year, too. Our P&I earnings are going to be lower than last year. P&I earnings were very high last year. But we have some items, as I'll describe in a minute, that aren't going to recur this year. But we are scaling up at Power & Industrial through investments in Reduced Emissions Fuel and our renewables. And we do continue to identify investment opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and we are making progress on those. 
In addition, we're working to rebound from reduced earnings levels in Energy Trading in the last few months, as Dave Meador will describe, have been promising on that front. And we do continue to work this year to position for the monetization of our Unconventional Gas assets.
So if I look forward to the next few years in the Non-Utility front, we see reduced emission fuels and renewable investments providing a very substantial growth within our Power & Industrial segment. We have investments that will produce earnings growth at Gas Storage and Pipelines, and we think our Energy Trading will return to more normal historical levels. 
That will combine with a move to monetize Unconventional Gas assets, which we'll use to fund growth. And this set of dynamics will also contribute to the 5% to 6% growth that we're describing in 2012 and beyond.
And one of the key elements of what I just described is the projected growth in our Power & Industrial business, and that's laid out on Slide 17. First, on the left-hand side of the slide, and actually we first laid this out this past fall at EEI. We saw a big step up this past year in earnings. Earnings between '09 and '10 more than doubled, but some of the items were nonrecurring. So for example, we saw high coke prices and we have some capacity open and that played to our favor, that's not going to recur next year. We also had the steel industry fuel tax credit. We actually did think that was going to recur right to the very end of the tax bill this past year, but it did get pulled to our surprise and to steel industry's surprise. So those dynamics are producing a step down in earnings of P&I this year.
But as you can see from the light blue and dark blue bars, here we have two segments in this business that we expect to grow materially over the next number of years. One of those, in the light blue, is the Reduced Emission Fuel segment. And just as a reminder, these are projects where we have a technology that can be used at coal plants to reduce mercury and NOx emissions that also benefit from a federal tax credit. We are making progress on developing this set of projects. We've completed the sale of an interest in one of these projects and we have it up and running. That was completed in January, and we are in negotiations with a number of other potential counterparties who run power plants a lot like Detroit Edison does and face the same emission control requirements that we do. And our goal this year is to get several facilities with those counterparties sited and up and running, so that we see the substantial step up in earnings from this segment that's indicated here in 2012. And a little bit longer-term, we'd expect to have our facilities pretty much fully placed by 2013, and that $40 million to $50 million largely in place by then.
On the Renewable Energy front, this past year, we made significant progress in this arena. We purchased a majority ownership of a 44-megawatt plant in California late in the year. We'll bring that online late this year. We also came to agreement on a 45-megawatt facility in California that we now have in the conversion process that we'll bring online early in 2013. Those two projects brought the total that we have in this segment of Waste Wood projects, from small coal plants brought the total to five. And so we're going to see growth just from that base of five projects that we've brought online or are bringing online, but we'd expect to continue to find and invest in additional projects here.
So the so what of all this is that we expect the P&I segment to be one of our significant growth areas over the next three years and contribute to the 5% to 6% that I described earlier. 
We also see opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipeline business, and that's laid out on Slide 18. Our strongest opportunities in this segment center on the Millennium Pipeline, which is shown there in dark blue, runs from upstate New York into the New York City area. And also as you can see, it runs through the Marcellus shale, and most of our development opportunities for that pipe center on gas that's emerging from the Marcellus shale. And those opportunities come in the form of mainline pipe expansions, as well as a laterals off of the pipeline, and eventually connectors between Millennium and other pipelines.
And we are making progress on this front as well, in fact, I think the discussions went from pretty introductory and new early last year to discussions that are getting quite promising and serious early this year. 
So I think the so what here is that over the next three years, we see this as the period that this Gas Storage and Pipeline business, which grew a lot over the past five years, will make the investments that will fuel its next significant step up in growth.
So in summary, for the company then, on Slide 19, our investments in the top left are going to be up materially over the next three years. On average, if you compare the last three years to the next three years, we're up about on the order of 25%, and that's tied to our investments in Detroit Edison renewable assets, our environmental investments, principally at the Monroe Power Plant, and the Non-Utility investments in P&I and our Gas Storage and Pipeline that I just mentioned. And I would also say that the utility investments, we're taking with a strong eye on managing customer affordability as I mentioned at the very outset of this discussion.
But if you look at what that implies in terms of an investment base and earnings for the next few years, our earnings this year, we've given guidance of $3.40 to $3.70. Within that, we do see utility earnings growth of about 3%. But as you can see, we expect earnings at both the Utilities and our Non-Utility businesses to pick up in 2012 and 2013. And we're projecting the 5% to 6% longer-term growth there that we've talked about for some time.
So with that, I'm going to turn things over to Dave Meador to take a little bit closer look at 2010, and our 2011 guidance. Dave, over to you."

I'm going to start on Slide 21.For the year, our operating earnings are $607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And as a reminder, there's a reconciliation to our GAA",1781,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning again to everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 21.
For the year, our operating earnings are $607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And as a reminder, there's a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings in the appendix, as well as there's other information in the appendix that I hope you will find helpful. The $3.60 per share is a nickel higher than the midpoint of our original guidance for the year at $3.55, and it's $0.30 or 9% higher than our 2009 operating earnings. Detroit Edison contributed $2.60 per share and MichCon came in at $0.63. Both utilities did a great job. And as Gerry mentioned, they earned their authorized returns in 2010. We are seeing improvements in the local economy that we also aligned on the low chart
with Detroit Edison's temperature normal electric load of 3%, and that was driven predominantly by the industrial sector, which was up 21%. 
The Non-Utility businesses combined to earn $0.78, with Power & Industrial projects earning $85 million or $0.50 per share with a very strong year-over-year performance, and as we indicated this won't be repeated in 2011. Gas Storage and Pipelines came in at 4% higher than 2009 at $51 million or $0.30 per share. And Energy Trading had net earnings of $0.04 and Unconventional Gas Production had $0.06 a loss.
Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.41 for the year. And overall 2010 was a very good year for us. The performance came in very strong with the bulk of the earnings coming from the two utilities, which have returned to their full earnings power.
And as Gerry outlined, the Power & Industrial business had a very strong performance, almost offsetting the shortfall at Energy Trading.
Now shifting to 2011 and our outlook for the year on Slide 22. We outlined our 2011 earnings guidance for each of the segments. As I just said, both of our utilities earned their authorized return on equity in 2010, and we expect to do the same this year in 2011. We have a rate case at Detroit Edison, which will be finalized by the fourth quarter. And we're doing everything we believe is necessary to ensure constructive order from the commission. And I'll talk a little bit more about that case in a moment. 
In MichCon, we plan to return to a normal weather year after a warmer than normal year in 2010, in lower midstream revenues. Also, at the Utilities, we will leverage our continuous improvement capabilities to partially offset O&M expense.
Earnings at Gas Storage and Pipelines will be up another 4% in 2011, as we continue to identify long-term expansion and development opportunities around the Millennium pipeline.
In 2010, we impaired some non-strategic leases at our Unconventional Production business, and that won't reoccur in 2011. Also, we're seeing more oil and natural gas liquids production in our Barnett shale properties, which is driving higher earnings in 2011. We've included in the appendix some key operating metrics for the business, as well as a schedule, which summarizes the valuation for the Barnett assets. 
And a couple of points I want to point out here.  Given the nature of our properties, we get a 50% to 60% lift in revenue from natural gas liquids, and we are also pursuing some wells that add oil to our performance.
Currently the value derived from one Mcf of gas is about $6.40, which is a nice premium over dry gas prices. Once a year we update the reserve analysis for this business and we provide the valuation range, which is on Slide 35. And even if you use the conservative low-end of the valuation, and our current reserves are worth at least $400 million or $2.35 per share, and then the midpoint for that range obviously is much higher. Our plan is to still develop the properties for monetization with a focus on natural gas, liquids and oil, and at the same time, we're going to eliminate the drag on earnings this year.
The Power & Industrial team is coming off a very strong year that we just talked about for 2010, which included some opportunities which won't reoccur going forward such as the Steel Industry Fuels tax credit and premium earnings on coke sales. As Gerry explained, the story with the P&I group is the potential earnings opportunity from the REF business line and the coal-to-waste wood conversions. We'll start to see some earnings from these businesses in 2011, but we'll really start to scale up those lines in 2012 and forward. 
2010, as you know was a challenging year for our Energy Trading business. After a strong first quarter, we saw the markets flatten out in the second half of the year with lower volatility and lower commodity prices.
In the third quarter, the business struggled to find the market opportunities to generate sufficient gross margin, however, that begin to change noticeably in November and December. In January, and so far in February this year, we have found trading opportunities returning in areas like power trading and flow requirements contract with gross margins in those months similar to prior years. In fact in January, we earned about 20% of the economic gross margin that we have assumed in our full year guidance.
While we don't see this business getting back to historical levels of $40 million to $50 million of operating income this year, we do expect to make a significant step in that direction, and we set the midpoint of guidance at $25 million.
Finally, we're expecting Corporate & Other to have improved results in 2011, primarily due to lower interest rate expense. So in total, we project DTE Energy to have operating earnings of $576 million to $631 million or $3.40 to $3.70 per share.
On Slide 23, we have an overview of the Detroit Edison rate case. We filed the case at the end of October, with a total revenue requirement of $443 million. And as an example of how we are focusing on customer affordability in this rate filing, we proposed some potential alternatives, which could reduce the net rate request by nearly $200 million for a net rate request of $253 million. We're looking forward to working collaboratively with commission on this rate case over the next coming months. Staff testimony is due at the beginning of April, and we plan to self-implement a rate increase in April, or we'll receive a final order in this case no later than the end of October. 
Now turning to cash flows on Slide 24. In 2009, we had one of the strongest cash years in our history with cash from operations of $1.8 billion. And I'm pleased to report that we achieved the same level  of cash from operations in 2010. And we're looking at 2011 with expected even stronger cash results of $1.9 billion in cash from operations.
If you looked at total cash after capital and in dividend and asset sales for 2009 and 2010 combined, we generated $850 million in total cash flow over two years. As Gerry explained earlier, after slowing CapEx during the recession, we plan to ramp it back up in 2011. We've said in the past we expect to issue between $100 million and $200 million of new equity to fund our growth over the next several years. However, as a result of strong cash flows in 2010 and anticipated benefits from bonus depreciation of around $100 million to $200 million between 2011 and 2012, we're not expecting to issue any new equity this year. And we're working on reducing our equity needs for 2012.
On Slide 25, we provide a breakdown for our 2011 capital plan. If you look at our capital for the utilities, going back it was $960 million in 2009. It was $1 billion in 2010. And we'll be spending about $1.2 billion in 2011, which is nearly a 25% increase over 2009 levels. At Detroit Edison, as we outlined, we're in the process of scrubbing the two remaining units in Monroe, and we expect to have a sharp step-up in our environmental capital for the year. And as we outlined in 2010, we began a construction on  a 200-megawatt wind farm. We'll take ownership for 90 megawatts of that generation in late this year or early next year, which will be about a $200 million investment for Detroit Edison. 
And in MichCon, we're planning on increasing our capital spending by over 20% in 2011. And this is driven primarily by our pipeline integrity and meter relocation work.  And then at the Non-Utility businesses, we're targeting capital investments of $200 million to $300 million.
Slide 26 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We ended the year with our targeted leverage range, and we expect to be within that range for 2011. As a result of one-time deferred tax items in 2010, we realized FFO-to-debt of 28%,  which is well above our targeted range. We expect that to return to targeted levels in 2011. 
And as a result of our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we secured a credit upgrade from S&P at DTE Energy and at both the utilities in December of last year. Also Fitch revised Detroit Edison's rating outlook to positive last month. And in both cases, the agencies noted the economic conditions that are improving in Michigan and the very positive regulatory environment that we have here.
Let me wrap up on Slide 27. As we've outlined for you, we have a plan, and we're confident in, that will provide 5% to 6% long-term operating growth, and at the same time provide an attractive dividend, which combine, provide a very attractive total shareholder return. And at the same time, doing all of that by maintaining a very strong balance sheet. As Gerry laid out, our utility growth plan is primarily driven by mandated investments. And all of this is set in a very constructive regulatory structure that we understand that we have to continue to earn everyday by doing things, by driving cost savings, which will enable our utilities to earn their authorized return. And continuing to focus on operational excellence, including customer satisfaction, which we believe over time will create a distinctive capability in this company compared to others in the industry with a real focus on affordability.
And to complement the utilities, we have meaningful low-risk growth opportunities in our Non-Utility businesses that will continue to provide diversity, both in earnings and geographic reach.
With that, that wraps up our presentation. And we'll be happy to take your questions."

And subsequently, we translated that into about $100 million to $200 million of equity per year. And through our strong cash flows, as we indicated, there'll be no equity this year. We're going to drive that down next year. One of the levers that we have here going forward is monetization of the remaining properties in the Barnett shale. So we're currently, as we indicated, proving up the properties with the real focus on what I would describe as the wet nature of the gas, which is giving us an uplift in our prices. And we're currently evaluating when we would start monetizing either small parcels of property or larger parcels over the next several years."

It provides us intelligence and cash, and that's its role. It was $75 million two years ago and $6 million last year. We had a long period in 2010 where the markets just went dead, not only for us but everybody, about an eight month period. But in December and January and so far in February, we have seen the markets return to much more normal behavior within our operation. So that's a positive sign. It's not something you can project, has to continue or will continue. But it certainly is a reversion back to more normal behavior from that, that eight-month dead period last year. And as Dave said, what we have this year is a range of $10 million to $40 million. It's just in line with what we saw this past year at the low-end, and kind of a low-end of normal at the high-end, so the midpoint is $25 million.

We've filed the case and as any other case over time, after we filed it, some of the assumptions started to change and the factors we looked at said the amount of money what we would need on the rate increase to hit our targeted earnings was much smaller. And we stood back, and looked at it, and said we could actually pull this case and go after cost reductions and hit our objectives and at the same time, it's one less case for us in the commission, and it's the right thing for customers to do. And then we can put our energy and focus together on the Detroit Edison case where there's a lot more economics. So this is more about that over time the number got small enough, we started asking ourselves the question why are we pursuing a case versus just going back to what we do really well, which is work on Continuous Improvement and cost. And I think Gerry addressed that overall, our ROE view right now is that in the Edison case, we filed for 11 1/8. We believe that our position on that is supportable, and we're going to pursue that in the case. And we think there's other, much larger value drivers for customers that we will be talking to the commission about, and the way that we filed that case that can make it a win-win for us and for customers and that ROE is one of them."

First, I want to quickly review 2010 and some of our accomplishments last year. And then, I'm going to move on to a look-forward to 2011 and a few years beyond 2011.
In that second topic, I think it's especially important because as you'll see later, 2011 for us is a bridge year between what's been a period of very healthy earnings growth over the last three years and a period in 2012 and beyond, that we're confident will resume that pattern of earnings growth. So more on that in a few minutes.
So moving on to Slide 5. We looked back on 2010 as a really successful year for DTE Energy. On the earnings front, our EPS grew 9% year-over-year last year. And in fact, grew at a 9% compound rate for the last three years. In addition last year, we had essentially 11% ROE at both of our utilities. So we earned our authorized and also had solid earnings in our Non-Utility businesses, where a strong year in our Power & Industrial business covered off for a weaker year in our Energy Trading business.
On the cash flow front, our metrics remain strong. We were upgraded by S&P late in the year, which was something we've been working hard at for several years, so that was gratifying. We also increased our dividends 6%.
We also kept an intense focus, as we have for the past five years, on Continuous Improvement, and we continue to reap dividends from this effort within the company. So as I'll talk in a few minutes, our absolute O&M is down over the past five years, and we continue to work hard on our costs. But increasingly, we're turning this Continuous Improvement toward the customer front. You can see that our complaints, for example, at the Public Service Commission, are down 50% over the past five years.
And as I'll talk further in a little bit, we undertook a big step last year, essentially calling back every customer that we have an interaction with, using that to log defects, where we've got things we need to fix, and then we're going after that with our CI.
We also undertook a lot of work on our growth agenda this past year. We announced our first major Renewable Energy project, a major win project that I'll talk about a little later. We began construction on our second scrubber at Monroe. And as you'll see later, we've got a substantial investment program over the next three years in emission controls. And we launched several new projects in our Power & Industrial business, particularly the Reduced Emissions Fuel business line, which is a significant new business line, that I'll lay out some facts on here in a few minutes, as well as our Waste Wood Renewables business line.
And moving on to Slide 6, talking a little bit more about Continuous Improvement. I mentioned that this continues to be an important focus for us at the company. You can see from the graphic on the cost front that our CI initiatives have more than offset structural cost pressures over the last five years. So absolute utility O&M is down over $100 million, despite upward pressure in pension and healthcare, environmental additions at our power plants, general inflation and so forth. And our work here is to keep driving each area of the company to top-quartile operating performance, and as we achieve that, push beyond that.
In addition to the cost savings, we're, as I said a minute ago, really focusing the CI effort more and more on the customer front. Outage frequency, improved fieldwork, options for low-income customers and so forth. The reason for all of this is our belief that the companies that do the best during significant investment cycles, and we are in one of those, the companies that do best are those that aggressively manage affordability and maintain constructive regulatory relationships. And our belief is, the best way to accomplish those two things is Continuous Improvement focused on cost and customer-service. To put differently, to get constructive regulation, you need to deserve it, you need to earn it. And that's especially true when heavy investment is putting pressure on rates. And our job is to use this Continuous Improvement process to offset those rate pressures, manage affordability and improve service quality. And if we do that well, we believe the odds of constructive regulation and fair treatment are much higher.
Now, speaking of constructive regulation, on Slide 7, one of the things that's certainly changed for the better in Michigan in recent years is our regulatory structure and our regulatory processes. You can see on Slide 6 some of the highlights and important regulatory developments for our utilities this past year. Starting with the final order we received at Detroit Edison early in the year, which we characterized and continue to understand as we went through the years as a constructive order. We held off, as you can see, further right on the slide, we held off on filing a new rate case at Detroit Edison as long as we could, but did eventually file in October. And I think if you'd take a look at that filing, you'll also see that we took some very creative steps within it to manage affordability and the amount that we'd need to increase rates for customers.
That case, we would expect to self-implement under in April and the case will go final in October. On the MichCon front, we received the final order, as you can see in the middle of the slide, in June. We did file a rate case pretty quickly on the heels of that. But as the year went on, and we continued to work on our costs, and watched the behavior of things within the company, we eventually determined that we could forego the case. And we did that, withdrawing the case in December, concluding that, that was the right thing to do from a customer-affordability perspective.
Moving on to Slide 8. Another thing that's changed for the better in Michigan over the past year is the economy. And you can see on the left-hand side of the slide what's happening on the industrial front. The strong performance of the auto companies has been getting a lot of attention nationally, but the industrial turnaround that we're seeing has been pretty broad. As you can see, we were up 21% this past year, which led to an overall growth and territory sales of 3%. That turnaround is translating into the employment of folks here in Michigan as well. You can see that the unemployment rate, which peaked at about 14.5%, was down to 11.7% by the end of the year. So that's a positive development.
Another indicator of health in the economy is our arrears, and you can see that we took a big step down in arrears this past year. Our uncollectible expense that's associated with that was down sharply last year as well.
So I think a range of indicators that suggest that we have worked our way through the events of the recession, and we've got a nice recovery in the underlying economy here in Michigan.
Onto Slide 9, I'm now going to turn from a look back on 2010, to a look forward to this year and the next few years. I mentioned earlier that the past three years have been a period of very healthy earnings growth for DTE. Earnings per share have grown 9% annually, between 2007 and 2010.
Our EPS guidance for this year, 2011, is roughly flat to 2010 levels. It's actually down a bit at the midpoint of our guidance, as you can see from Slide 10.
And at DTE, we are talking very explicitly with our employees about 2011, being a bridge year. A bridge between that period of healthy earnings growth from 2007 to 2010, and a period in 2012 and beyond that I'm confident is going to resume that pattern of healthy earnings growth. 5% to 6% a year is what we've been saying for a long time is our target, and that's what we foresee.
So one question might be, why are we so confident that 2011 is this bridge and we're going to see that resumption of earnings growth next year and beyond. That's one of the things we want to help you understand this morning. And I think to do that, you need to both look back and look forward. You need to look back to understand the dynamics that are shaping our earnings this year in 2011, and look forward at the investments that we're making this year and that we have underway that will play out over the next few years and beyond that will shape earnings in the future.
So what I want to do is take that look back and look forward, and I'll do that with our utilities and then turn to our Non-Utility businesses. 
And then on Slide 11, I laid this out for Detroit Edison and MichCon. And from 2007 to 2010, in those two businesses, we saw combined utility earnings growth of 9%. We also used Continuous Improvement to bring the ROEs in those two businesses to their allowed levels. But during that period, of course the economic crisis hit, and we pulled back investment pretty sharply like a lot of people did because of the capital market uncertainty and to manage customer affordability.
And the result of that pullback is playing out this year. So if you look in the middle of the slide you'll see that our combined utility earnings growth is projected at about 3% in 2011. That's less certainly than we've seen in recent years and less than our long-term goal of 5% to 6%. But it's really a result of a lag impact from our reduction in investment in the heart of the crisis.
But as you'll also see in a few minutes, this is the year, 2011, where we resume strong investments in the utilities, especially in Renewable Power and Emission Controls within Detroit Edison. And the result of that, on the right-hand portion of Slide 11, is that we do expect to see a resumption of 5% to 6% annual growth in our utilities in 2012 and beyond. And in addition, in that period, the renewable investments that we're beginning to ramp back up and the environment investments will be actually even heavier next year and the few years beyond that.
So this is what I just described as I think even clearer on Slide 12, where you can see our capital spending pattern, we had been planning for a period of quite heavy investment in 2009 and '10 when the crisis hit. You can see how we pulled back, especially sharply in 2009. And we really only stepped up capital a bit this past year, and this is what temporarily slowed the growth in our rate base and what's playing through with the lag here in 2011.
If you look at this year and the next two years though, you can see in the light blue bars and the green bars, that our emission control investments and renewable investments are going to step up materially. Total capital expenditures will be $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2011, and as you can see, $2.4 billion to $2.8 billion over the two-year period, 2012 and 2013. 
You'll also see a kind of dotted green box in 2011 with a gray arrow, I'll tell you a little bit about more that in a minute. But there's a Renewable Energy project, a wind farm that we're pursuing with a partner. And the arrangement we have with a partner is that they're going to construct the project, and then we're going to buy in as that construction plays out. We're going to finish up the construction this year. So we may buy in a roughly $200 million portion of the project late this year or at the very beginning of next year. So that $200 million could swing in either late 2011 or early 2012.
You can also see that in the light blue here, the emission control expenditures ramp back up substantially as we prepare for requirements that are targeted to 2015.
So this step up in capital spending at Detroit Edison is further laid out on Slide 13. The biggest piece of that investment is in our base infrastructure where we see $700 million, $800 million per year, $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion over the three-year period. But the real growth in our earnings power and rate base is coming from the right two columns. Our environmental compliance expenditures, $800 million to $900 million over the three-year period is really targeted to finishing two scrubbers and coming close to finishing one additional SCR at our Monroe Power Plant.
In addition to that, we see $500 million to $600 million of Renewable Energy expenditures. The state for us has a requirement of 300 megawatts in place by 2013, so within the next three years. And we have the right, under law, to own half of that. So our projected expenditures to make that play out are $500 million to $600 million over the next three years. 
And the details of that renewable expenditure are laid out on Slide 14. And the first thing I'd focus you on is the red star there in the middle of the state. That's the project that I mentioned just a minute ago, that we're pursuing jointly with Invenergy. It's a 200-megawatt wind farm. We are going to own 90 megawatts of that installation, about a $200 million capital investment. And as I said a minute ago, the way this is playing out is that Invenergy is going to front the investment, and then we will buy in for our piece as the project  gets close to ready to go commercial. 
So you can see the impact of that, then at the bottom left of the slide that we get a substantial step up in our earnings from Renewable Energy and energy optimization as we go from 2011 to 2012. And this is certainly one of the things that is driving a return to earnings growth at a higher level at Detroit Edison in 2012.
And if you look down the road, as I mentioned, we need to add to that project between 2012 in 2013. We'd expect to do that using the 78,000 acres of easements that we have under contract in Huron County, that's designated there by the purple star. We're working on those, and we'd expect those investments on the heels of this Invenergy investment to take earnings in this business line to about $15 million by 2015. And as you can see we'll have a significant portion of that in place by the middle of this period 2013.
MichCon, moving on to Slide 15. We'll also be investing substantial capital over the next three years, about $500 million to $600 million over that period, or about $175 million to $200 million a year. The MichCon's investment agenda is laid out on Slide 15. The most significant element of MichCon's investments are in the gas distribution network. And in particular, we have been working with the Michigan Public Service Commission on a multiyear main renewal and meter move-out program, that steps up the capital that we will be committing to our distribution infrastructure.
In addition to that, we continue to find opportunities within our Utility Storage & Transportation asset base to expand storage. Generally, what we find our customers who want us to expand our storage, we contract with those customers and then often have pipeline investments that are needed to take that storage to market. That's been an area of investment in recent years, and we think that will continue here over the next few years.
So in summary, for Detroit Edison and MichCon, we're coming off a two-year period in 2009 and 2010 where we reduced capital expenditures in the wake of the economic crisis. But our capital expenditures on renewables, emission controls, gas main renewables, and meter move-outs, are going to drive our rate base investment up pretty sharply over the next three years. Our average capital spending in our utilities over the next three years will be about a third higher than it was last year, for example. And it's this investment that will enable us to bridge from about 3% utility earnings growth this year to a higher rate of 5% to 6% next year and beyond.
Slide 16 takes a similar multiyear look back and look forward for our Non-Utility businesses. From 2007 to 2010, our two principal Non-Utility businesses, Gas Storage and Pipelines and Power & Industrial, both grew at a healthy rate, 20% compound annual growth for those two businesses over the three-year period.
Energy Trading averaged earnings of about $45 million. Although as you know, our last year, in that three-year period, was a low year for us. The other significant event during those three years was a $1.5 billion monetization of our unconventional gas assets.
2011 for these businesses is a bridge year, too. Our P&I earnings are going to be lower than last year. P&I earnings were very high last year. But we have some items, as I'll describe in a minute, that aren't going to recur this year. But we are scaling up at Power & Industrial through investments in Reduced Emissions Fuel and our renewables. And we do continue to identify investment opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipelines business, and we are making progress on those. 
In addition, we're working to rebound from reduced earnings levels in Energy Trading in the last few months, as Dave Meador will describe, have been promising on that front. And we do continue to work this year to position for the monetization of our Unconventional Gas assets.
So if I look forward to the next few years in the Non-Utility front, we see reduced emission fuels and renewable investments providing a very substantial growth within our Power & Industrial segment. We have investments that will produce earnings growth at Gas Storage and Pipelines, and we think our Energy Trading will return to more normal historical levels. 
That will combine with a move to monetize Unconventional Gas assets, which we'll use to fund growth. And this set of dynamics will also contribute to the 5% to 6% growth that we're describing in 2012 and beyond.
And one of the key elements of what I just described is the projected growth in our Power & Industrial business, and that's laid out on Slide 17. First, on the left-hand side of the slide, and actually we first laid this out this past fall at EEI. We saw a big step up this past year in earnings. Earnings between '09 and '10 more than doubled, but some of the items were nonrecurring. So for example, we saw high coke prices and we have some capacity open and that played to our favor, that's not going to recur next year. We also had the steel industry fuel tax credit. We actually did think that was going to recur right to the very end of the tax bill this past year, but it did get pulled to our surprise and to steel industry's surprise. So those dynamics are producing a step down in earnings of P&I this year.
But as you can see from the light blue and dark blue bars, here we have two segments in this business that we expect to grow materially over the next number of years. One of those, in the light blue, is the Reduced Emission Fuel segment. And just as a reminder, these are projects where we have a technology that can be used at coal plants to reduce mercury and NOx emissions that also benefit from a federal tax credit. We are making progress on developing this set of projects. We've completed the sale of an interest in one of these projects and we have it up and running. That was completed in January, and we are in negotiations with a number of other potential counterparties who run power plants a lot like Detroit Edison does and face the same emission control requirements that we do. And our goal this year is to get several facilities with those counterparties sited and up and running, so that we see the substantial step up in earnings from this segment that's indicated here in 2012. And a little bit longer-term, we'd expect to have our facilities pretty much fully placed by 2013, and that $40 million to $50 million largely in place by then.
On the Renewable Energy front, this past year, we made significant progress in this arena. We purchased a majority ownership of a 44-megawatt plant in California late in the year. We'll bring that online late this year. We also came to agreement on a 45-megawatt facility in California that we now have in the conversion process that we'll bring online early in 2013. Those two projects brought the total that we have in this segment of Waste Wood projects, from small coal plants brought the total to five. And so we're going to see growth just from that base of five projects that we've brought online or are bringing online, but we'd expect to continue to find and invest in additional projects here.
So the so what of all this is that we expect the P&I segment to be one of our significant growth areas over the next three years and contribute to the 5% to 6% that I described earlier. 
We also see opportunities in our Gas Storage and Pipeline business, and that's laid out on Slide 18. Our strongest opportunities in this segment center on the Millennium Pipeline, which is shown there in dark blue, runs from upstate New York into the New York City area. And also as you can see, it runs through the Marcellus shale, and most of our development opportunities for that pipe center on gas that's emerging from the Marcellus shale. And those opportunities come in the form of mainline pipe expansions, as well as a laterals off of the pipeline, and eventually connectors between Millennium and other pipelines.
And we are making progress on this front as well, in fact, I think the discussions went from pretty introductory and new early last year to discussions that are getting quite promising and serious early this year. 
So I think the so what here is that over the next three years, we see this as the period that this Gas Storage and Pipeline business, which grew a lot over the past five years, will make the investments that will fuel its next significant step up in growth.
So in summary, for the company then, on Slide 19, our investments in the top left are going to be up materially over the next three years. On average, if you compare the last three years to the next three years, we're up about on the order of 25%, and that's tied to our investments in Detroit Edison renewable assets, our environmental investments, principally at the Monroe Power Plant, and the Non-Utility investments in P&I and our Gas Storage and Pipeline that I just mentioned. And I would also say that the utility investments, we're taking with a strong eye on managing customer affordability as I mentioned at the very outset of this discussion.
But if you look at what that implies in terms of an investment base and earnings for the next few years, our earnings this year, we've given guidance of $3.40 to $3.70. Within that, we do see utility earnings growth of about 3%. But as you can see, we expect earnings at both the Utilities and our Non-Utility businesses to pick up in 2012 and 2013. And we're projecting the 5% to 6% longer-term growth there that we've talked about for some time.
So with that, I'm going to turn things over to Dave Meador to take a little bit closer look at 2010, and our 2011 guidance. Dave, over to you."

I'm going to start on Slide 21.For the year, our operating earnings are $607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And as a reminder, there's a reconciliation to our GAA",1781,"Thanks, Gerry, and good morning again to everybody. I'm going to start on Slide 21.
For the year, our operating earnings are $607 million or $3.60 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance. And as a reminder, there's a reconciliation to our GAAP reported earnings in the appendix, as well as there's other information in the appendix that I hope you will find helpful. The $3.60 per share is a nickel higher than the midpoint of our original guidance for the year at $3.55, and it's $0.30 or 9% higher than our 2009 operating earnings. Detroit Edison contributed $2.60 per share and MichCon came in at $0.63. Both utilities did a great job. And as Gerry mentioned, they earned their authorized returns in 2010. We are seeing improvements in the local economy that we also aligned on the low chart
with Detroit Edison's temperature normal electric load of 3%, and that was driven predominantly by the industrial sector, which was up 21%. 
The Non-Utility businesses combined to earn $0.78, with Power & Industrial projects earning $85 million or $0.50 per share with a very strong year-over-year performance, and as we indicated this won't be repeated in 2011. Gas Storage and Pipelines came in at 4% higher than 2009 at $51 million or $0.30 per share. And Energy Trading had net earnings of $0.04 and Unconventional Gas Production had $0.06 a loss.
Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.41 for the year. And overall 2010 was a very good year for us. The performance came in very strong with the bulk of the earnings coming from the two utilities, which have returned to their full earnings power.
And as Gerry outlined, the Power & Industrial business had a very strong performance, almost offsetting the shortfall at Energy Trading.
Now shifting to 2011 and our outlook for the year on Slide 22. We outlined our 2011 earnings guidance for each of the segments. As I just said, both of our utilities earned their authorized return on equity in 2010, and we expect to do the same this year in 2011. We have a rate case at Detroit Edison, which will be finalized by the fourth quarter. And we're doing everything we believe is necessary to ensure constructive order from the commission. And I'll talk a little bit more about that case in a moment. 
In MichCon, we plan to return to a normal weather year after a warmer than normal year in 2010, in lower midstream revenues. Also, at the Utilities, we will leverage our continuous improvement capabilities to partially offset O&M expense.
Earnings at Gas Storage and Pipelines will be up another 4% in 2011, as we continue to identify long-term expansion and development opportunities around the Millennium pipeline.
In 2010, we impaired some non-strategic leases at our Unconventional Production business, and that won't reoccur in 2011. Also, we're seeing more oil and natural gas liquids production in our Barnett shale properties, which is driving higher earnings in 2011. We've included in the appendix some key operating metrics for the business, as well as a schedule, which summarizes the valuation for the Barnett assets. 
And a couple of points I want to point out here.  Given the nature of our properties, we get a 50% to 60% lift in revenue from natural gas liquids, and we are also pursuing some wells that add oil to our performance.
Currently the value derived from one Mcf of gas is about $6.40, which is a nice premium over dry gas prices. Once a year we update the reserve analysis for this business and we provide the valuation range, which is on Slide 35. And even if you use the conservative low-end of the valuation, and our current reserves are worth at least $400 million or $2.35 per share, and then the midpoint for that range obviously is much higher. Our plan is to still develop the properties for monetization with a focus on natural gas, liquids and oil, and at the same time, we're going to eliminate the drag on earnings this year.
The Power & Industrial team is coming off a very strong year that we just talked about for 2010, which included some opportunities which won't reoccur going forward such as the Steel Industry Fuels tax credit and premium earnings on coke sales. As Gerry explained, the story with the P&I group is the potential earnings opportunity from the REF business line and the coal-to-waste wood conversions. We'll start to see some earnings from these businesses in 2011, but we'll really start to scale up those lines in 2012 and forward. 
2010, as you know was a challenging year for our Energy Trading business. After a strong first quarter, we saw the markets flatten out in the second half of the year with lower volatility and lower commodity prices.
In the third quarter, the business struggled to find the market opportunities to generate sufficient gross margin, however, that begin to change noticeably in November and December. In January, and so far in February this year, we have found trading opportunities returning in areas like power trading and flow requirements contract with gross margins in those months similar to prior years. In fact in January, we earned about 20% of the economic gross margin that we have assumed in our full year guidance.
While we don't see this business getting back to historical levels of $40 million to $50 million of operating income this year, we do expect to make a significant step in that direction, and we set the midpoint of guidance at $25 million.
Finally, we're expecting Corporate & Other to have improved results in 2011, primarily due to lower interest rate expense. So in total, we project DTE Energy to have operating earnings of $576 million to $631 million or $3.40 to $3.70 per share.
On Slide 23, we have an overview of the Detroit Edison rate case. We filed the case at the end of October, with a total revenue requirement of $443 million. And as an example of how we are focusing on customer affordability in this rate filing, we proposed some potential alternatives, which could reduce the net rate request by nearly $200 million for a net rate request of $253 million. We're looking forward to working collaboratively with commission on this rate case over the next coming months. Staff testimony is due at the beginning of April, and we plan to self-implement a rate increase in April, or we'll receive a final order in this case no later than the end of October. 
Now turning to cash flows on Slide 24. In 2009, we had one of the strongest cash years in our history with cash from operations of $1.8 billion. And I'm pleased to report that we achieved the same level  of cash from operations in 2010. And we're looking at 2011 with expected even stronger cash results of $1.9 billion in cash from operations.
If you looked at total cash after capital and in dividend and asset sales for 2009 and 2010 combined, we generated $850 million in total cash flow over two years. As Gerry explained earlier, after slowing CapEx during the recession, we plan to ramp it back up in 2011. We've said in the past we expect to issue between $100 million and $200 million of new equity to fund our growth over the next several years. However, as a result of strong cash flows in 2010 and anticipated benefits from bonus depreciation of around $100 million to $200 million between 2011 and 2012, we're not expecting to issue any new equity this year. And we're working on reducing our equity needs for 2012.
On Slide 25, we provide a breakdown for our 2011 capital plan. If you look at our capital for the utilities, going back it was $960 million in 2009. It was $1 billion in 2010. And we'll be spending about $1.2 billion in 2011, which is nearly a 25% increase over 2009 levels. At Detroit Edison, as we outlined, we're in the process of scrubbing the two remaining units in Monroe, and we expect to have a sharp step-up in our environmental capital for the year. And as we outlined in 2010, we began a construction on  a 200-megawatt wind farm. We'll take ownership for 90 megawatts of that generation in late this year or early next year, which will be about a $200 million investment for Detroit Edison. 
And in MichCon, we're planning on increasing our capital spending by over 20% in 2011. And this is driven primarily by our pipeline integrity and meter relocation work.  And then at the Non-Utility businesses, we're targeting capital investments of $200 million to $300 million.
Slide 26 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We ended the year with our targeted leverage range, and we expect to be within that range for 2011. As a result of one-time deferred tax items in 2010, we realized FFO-to-debt of 28%,  which is well above our targeted range. We expect that to return to targeted levels in 2011. 
And as a result of our strong balance sheet and cash flows, we secured a credit upgrade from S&P at DTE Energy and at both the utilities in December of last year. Also Fitch revised Detroit Edison's rating outlook to positive last month. And in both cases, the agencies noted the economic conditions that are improving in Michigan and the very positive regulatory environment that we have here.
Let me wrap up on Slide 27. As we've outlined for you, we have a plan, and we're confident in, that will provide 5% to 6% long-term operating growth, and at the same time provide an attractive dividend, which combine, provide a very attractive total shareholder return. And at the same time, doing all of that by maintaining a very strong balance sheet. As Gerry laid out, our utility growth plan is primarily driven by mandated investments. And all of this is set in a very constructive regulatory structure that we understand that we have to continue to earn everyday by doing things, by driving cost savings, which will enable our utilities to earn their authorized return. And continuing to focus on operational excellence, including customer satisfaction, which we believe over time will create a distinctive capability in this company compared to others in the industry with a real focus on affordability.
And to complement the utilities, we have meaningful low-risk growth opportunities in our Non-Utility businesses that will continue to provide diversity, both in earnings and geographic reach.
With that, that wraps up our presentation. And we'll be happy to take your questions."

We're going to drive that down next year. One of the levers that we have here going forward is monetization of the remaining properties in the Barnett shale. So we're currently, as we indicated, proving up the properties with the real focus on what I would describe as the wet nature of the gas, which is giving us an uplift in our prices.

We, very explicitly, are telling our people, and we, from an affordability standpoint, hold off as long as we can. But we also don't want to hold off so long that the cases become complex or large. For us, the regulators are our customers. So it's striking that balance between regularity and health for us, and workload and impact on our customers. So this past year that meant that we held off from a case in January until a filing in October. But if you look forward, this is a heavy period of investment, particularly in Emission  Controls, where we've got almost $1 billion over the next three years. And that's going to imply that our rate base is going to be growing, and we're going to need to get returns on that to stay healthy. So I expect to see us going in each year, but we'll use the philosophy I just described."

The other thing that is true in this round of investments for us is that we got a stimulus grant. So that brought down our net investment, and it brought down the cost to customers. So what we want to do then is to evaluate based upon the savings that we are seeing. Do we see savings to customers without help from the federal government, in other words if we need to carry the full load, do these things pay for themselves and lower customer rates? And that's what we -- we'll take a pause to do that evaluation. The other thing that we want to evaluate is the service improvement, so these meters are going to allow us to do some things for customers that we've never been able to do like know before they know when they're out of power, and typical example, people are off at work,  come home to find they're power out. We'll know that and can get them back up and running before they ever knew they were out of power.

So this is more about that over time the number got small enough, we started asking ourselves the question why are we pursuing a case versus just going back to what we do really well, which is work on Continuous Improvement and cost.

We believe that our position on that is supportable, and we're going to pursue that in the case.

Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, Nick Khouri and Mark Rolling. I also have members of the leadership team available for Q&A if necessary.
Let me start with an overview on Slide 5. We have plans that will provide 5% to 6%  earnings growth and with both with our dividend of $2.24 per share, that provides a very attractive to shareholder return of 9% to 10%. This is offset with a key purity of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our utility growth is driven by a federal and state mandates which even after aggressive cost management, a capital efficiency work will still generate 5%  to 6% earnings growth.
The utility plans are supported by a constructive regulatory structure and our cost savings are a tool to allow us to earn our authorized returns. We continue to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction. And as an example of that, our complaints to the Michigan Public Service Commission are down by another third this year. And our focus on procurement in Michigan has about 40% of our annual $1.1 billion spend driven to Michigan as we focus on helping drive Michigan's economy forward.
We also have meaningful growth opportunities in our Non-Utility businesses. The AGA Financial Conference is coming up here in May and Gerry Anderson will be there with updates on the Power & Industrial business, including an update on the REF business line and in our midstream business.
Now turning to Slide 6 is an overview for the quarter. We are a $1.11 per share in an operating earnings and we're right where we want to be in order to deliver your guidance of $3.40 to $3.70 per share. The 2 utilities are at 11%  return on equity last year and they remain on track to do the same this year. Yesterday, the Public Service Commission issued an order regarding self implementation, which was in line with our expectations and our plans. We have proposed several options to the commission in our original piece filings, which would get to you to the same interim economics of $230 million. The commission shows the option of $107 million in interim rates by not resetting the base rates for choice and the continuation of the choice tracker. And when you put this together, it gets you back to the same outcome of $230 million in economics. This was a result of the collaborative effort with the staff, and we are pleased with the constructive outcome.
Both power, industrial and gas pipelines and storage are also right on plan for the year. And just to note on the development side, we have entered into a letter of intent to Southwestern Energy to construct the lateral pipe, which we have referred to in our IR our materials as our Bluestone project. Bluestone will be a wholly owned DTE pipeline connecting to both Millennium and to the Tennessee pipeline and will transport gas from Southwestern's Marcellus Shale acreage. In terms of this arrangement are being negotiated right now as we work out a definitive agreement and Gerry Anderson will provide an update on this project at AGA.
Peter will take you through the details in a moment in Energy Trading, but Energy Trading is tracking economically to our guidance target. This quarters accounting earnings reflect timing within the year, and we continue to be comfortable with our total your guidance for Energy Trading. So overall, we're up to a very good start for the year. Our balance sheet is also right where we wanted to be and cash from operations was $700 million. We also have accelerated the timing of some of our wind projects with increasing our capital spending of about $300 million for the year. Although this increased to our 2011 CapEx guidance we provided earlier in the year, it is within our renewable energy plan, which is have been approved by the commission and Nick will take you through the details of the wind project on the capital side. With that, overview, let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the quarter."

I'd like to start with Slide 8 in the first quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings was $1.11. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to the GAAP reported earnings is contained",767,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 8 in the first quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings was $1.11. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to the GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. $0.57 and Michigan which typically have the strong first quarter came in at $0.49. The 9 utility segments combined earned $0.15. The drivers for the nonutility first quarter results were gas storage and pipeline at $0.9. Our industrial projects at $0.06, Energy Trading at $0.01 and commercial gas production at $0.01 loss. Finally, corporate and other had a loss of $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 9 and the summary of the quarter-to-quarter performance by segment.
Our earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are down $41 million for the quarter. Together, our core utilities, Edison and MichCon had $10 million of an earnings over to prior year and additional details in the 2 utility companies later in the presentation.
Our Non-Utility segments are down $42 million, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment down $36 million, which had historically high income in the first quarter last year. I'll provide more color on the Energy Trading performance in a moment. Power & Industrial projects was down $8 million, resulting from non-repeating last year from the steel energy fuels tax credit and favorable coal pricing.
Gas Storage and Pipeline and Unconventional Gas Production earnings are up slightly from the prior year. Corporate & Other was down $9 million from last year due to a onetime 2010 tax benefit. Before I move from this page, just a few more words on the Energy Trading's first quarter performance. As you recall, we lowered the income range in our 2011 guidance for the trading business to a midpoint of $25 million, down by a more historical average of $40 million to $50 million We are on track to achieve the midpoint of guidance for the segment in 2011.
The first quarter is off to a strong start for new transactions. On Page 21 of the appendix, we provided our spinach be delicious both economic and accounting performance. On that page, you will see that we have $22 million of economic income, which is not recognized yet for accounting purposes. There are numerous transactions we entered into in the first quarter that will not start recognizing income until the physical delivery of the power or gas.  An example of this is gas transaction where the gas delivered starting in the fourth quarter. We expect a good portion of the 22 mine that flow through operating earnings in the fourth quarter this year.
As a result, the next 2 quarters of accounting income could be relatively flat for Energy Trading business.
Now I like to go through some quarterly details of the utility companies beginning with Detroit Edison on Slide 10. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison was $97 million, up $6 million from the prior year. Margin for the quarter was up $8 million, driven primarily by energy efficiency incentives recorded in the first quarter 2011 after receiving a favorable order in our efficiency reconciliation related to achieving prior year incentives. Even though we have revenue decoupling with our electric utility, we still closely monitor underlying electrical load. Overall, temperature in our number was up 1 percent in the quarter. We continue to see positive signs of economic improvement in Michigan translating into an increased sales.
On the expense side, O&M was higher as a result of timing power plant maintenance and onetime benefit savings realized in 2010. In addition, in 2011, we have experience lower interest expense in favorable first quarter of 2011 property tax settlement at Detroit Edison.
Moving onto Page 11, a review of MichCon's performance. As mentioned earlier, the first quarter is typically the strongest in the seasonal Gas Utility business. Operating earnings for MichCon was $83 million, up $4 million from the prior year. The primary driver was $16 million of favorable weather impacts as the quarter saw 14%  pickup in heating degree days compared to 2010. Margin that other than was down $9 million primarily driven by the fact that a final rates in the June 2010 order, which carried into the first quarter of 2011 are lower than the south implementation rates executed in the first quarter of 2010.  In addition, maintenance expense were up due to an increase in schedule in main service repairs. That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter.I'd like to turn discussion over to Nick Khouri who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and board of directors. To the first three months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal for the historical strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 13 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage in cash flow ranges.  In addition, we have made significant progress towards our 2011 funding requirements. We have completed our pension plan funding earlier this year than in past years, and we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong with no expiring credit facilities until 2012.
Page 14 provides an overview of DTE's keys cash flow in the first quarter of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations, adjusted of for the early pension contribution was about on par with a strong internal cash seen last year.  As expected, capital was up a bit compared to last year, which I will detail in just a minute. On to net cash reached approximately a positive $300 million in the first quarter of 2011. As in prior years, net cash is not equal across the four quarters of the year both working capital requirements and capital spending is back loaded towards the end of the year.
Page 15 detail first quarter capital spending. Year-to-date capital spending is about on par with last year for MichCon and the Non-Utility business. Capital is higher in Detroit Edison, reflecting an expected increase in environmental spending in the timing of plant outages.
Page 16 shows our revised guidance for 2011 cash and capital. The only change from the original guidance is higher renewable investments at Detroit Edison. As Dave mentioned, we were presented with an opportunity to accelerate the timing of our wind investment in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million, up from the original guidance of $50 million.  Expense renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with the preexisting surcharge, a new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates while still maintaining our balance sheet targets.
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically storage year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment in the Renewable portfolio of Detroit Edison.
Now let me turn it back to Dave to wrap up."

It could be the issue of trackers being reset or a trackers that go away and the clarity that you might need during that as you're going through interim rates. So when we file this case, we have filed the case and provided some options that we believe are viable options that could benefit customers during this time.

Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak; Nick Khouri and Mark Rolling. I also have members of the leadership team available for Q&A if necessary.
Let me start with an overview on Slide 5. We have plans that will provide 5% to 6%  earnings growth, and when coupled with our dividend of $2.24 per share, that provides a very attractive total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. This is offset with the key priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our utility growth is driven by federal and state mandates, which even after aggressive cost management and capital efficiency work, will still generate 5% to 6% earnings growth.
The utility plans are supported by a constructive regulatory structure and our cost savings are a tool to allow us to earn our authorized returns. We continue to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction. And as an example of that, our complaints to the Michigan Public Service Commission are down by another 1/3 this year. And our focus on procurement in Michigan has about 40% of our annual $1.1 billion spend driven to Michigan as we focus on helping drive Michigan's economy forward. We also have meaningful growth opportunities in our Non-Utility businesses. 
The AGA Financial Conference is coming up here in May, and Gerry Anderson will be there with updates on the Power & Industrial business, including an update on the REF business line and on our Midstream business.
Now turning to Slide 6 is an overview for the quarter. We are a $1.11 per share in an operating earnings and we're right where we want to be in order to deliver our guidance of $3.40 to $3.70 per share. The 2 utilities are at 11%  return on equity last year and they remain on track to do the same this year. Yesterday, the Public Service Commission issued an order regarding Detroit Edison's self implementation, which was in line with our expectations and our plans. We had proposed several options to the commission in our original case filing which would get you to the same interim economics of $230 million. The commission shows the option of $107 million in interim rates by not resetting the base rates for choice and the continuation of the choice tracker. And when you put this together, it gets you back to the same outcome of $230 million in economics. This was the result of a collaborative effort with the staff, and we are pleased with the constructive outcome.
Both Power & Industrial and Gas Pipelines and Storage are also right on plan for the year. And just to note on the development side, we have entered into a letter of intent  with Southwestern Energy to construct a lateral pipe, which we have referred to in our IR materials as our Bluestone Project. Bluestone will be a wholly owned DTE pipeline connecting to both Millennium and to the Tennessee Pipeline and will transport gas from Southwestern's Marcellus Shale acreage. Terms of the -- of this arrangement are being negotiated right now as we work out the definitive agreement, and Gerry Anderson will provide an update on this project at AGA.
Peter will take you through the details in a moment on Energy Trading, but Energy Trading's tracking economically to our guidance target. This quarter's accounting earnings reflect timing within the year, and we continue to be comfortable with our total-year guidance for Energy Trading. So overall, we're off to a very good start for the year. Our balance sheet is also right where we want it to be and cash from operations was $700 million. We also have accelerated the timing of some of our Wind Projects with increases in our capital spending of about $300 million for the year. Although this is an increase to our 2011 CapEx guidance that we provided earlier in the year, it is within our renewable energy plan which has been approved by the commission. And Nick will take you through the details of the Wind Projects on the capital side. With that overview, now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the quarter."

I'd like to start with Slide 8 and the first quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings was $1.11. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in",786,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 8 and the first quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings was $1.11. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.57, and MichCon, which typically has a strong first quarter came in at $0.49. The Non-Utility segments combined earned $0.15. The drivers for the Non-Utility first quarter results were Gas Storage and Pipelines at $0.09, Power & Industrial projects at $0.06, Energy Trading at $0.01, Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 9 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are down $41 million for the quarter. Together, our core utilities, Edison and MichCon had $10 million of earnings over the prior year, and I'll be providing additional details on the 2 utility companies later in the presentation.
Our Non-Utility segments are down $42 million, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment down $36 million, which had historically high income in the first quarter last year. I'll provide more color on the Energy Trading performance in a moment. Power & Industrial projects was down $8 million, resulting from non-repeating earnings last year from the steel energy fuel's [ph] tax credit and favorable coal pricing.
Gas Storage and Pipelines and Unconventional Gas Production earnings are up slightly from the prior year. Corporate & Other was down $9 million from last year, due to a onetime 2010 tax benefit. Before I move from this page, just a few more words on the Energy Trading's first quarter performance. As you recall, we lowered the income range in our 2011 guidance for the Trading business to a midpoint of $25 million, down by a more historical average of $40 million to $50 million We are on track to achieve this midpoint of guidance for this segment in 2011.
The first quarter is off to a strong start for new transactions. On Page 21 of the appendix, we provided our standard page, which shows both economic and accounting performance. On that page, you will see we have $22 million of economic income, which is not recognized yet for accounting purposes. There are numerous transactions we entered into in the first quarter that will not start recognizing income until the physical delivery of the power or gas. An example of this is a coal-requirement [ph] gas transaction where the gas is delivered starting in the fourth quarter. We expect a good portion of the 22 million of tonnage to flow through operating earnings in the fourth quarter of this year.
As a result, the next 2 quarters of accounting income could be relatively flat for our Energy Trading business.
Now I'd like to go through some quarterly details of the utility companies beginning with Detroit Edison on Slide 10. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison was $97 million, up $6 million from the prior year. Margin for the quarter was up $8 million, driven primarily by energy efficiency incentives recorded in the first quarter of 2011 after receiving a favorable order in our efficiency reconciliation related to achieving prior year incentives. Even though we have revenue decoupling with our electric utility, we still closely monitor underlying electric load. Overall, temperature normal, electric load in the territory was up 1% in the quarter. We continue to see positive signs of economic improvement in Michigan, translating into an increased sales.
On the expense side, O&M was higher as a result of timing power plant maintenance and one-time benefit savings realized in 2010. In addition, in 2011, we have experience lower interest expense in favorable first quarter of 2011 property tax settlement at Detroit Edison.
Moving onto Page 11, a review of MichCon's performance. As mentioned earlier, the first quarter is typically the strongest in the seasonal Gas Utility business. Operating earnings for MichCon was $83 million, up $4 million from the prior year. The primary driver was $16 million of favorable weather impacts as the quarter saw 14% pickup in heating degree days compared to 2010. Margin that other than was down $9 million, primarily driven by the fact that a final rates in the June 2010 order, which carried into the first quarter of 2011 are lower than the south implementation executed in the first quarter of 2010.  In addition, maintenance expenses were up slightly this quarter, due to an increase in schedule in main service repairs. That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to turn discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and the board of directors. To the first three months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal for the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 13 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage in cash flow ranges.  In addition, we have made significant progress towards our 2011 funding requirements. We have completed our pension plan funding earlier this year than in past years, and we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong with no expiring credit facilities until 2012.
Page 14 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow in the first quarter of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations, adjusted for the early pension contribution was about on par with the strong internal cash seen last year.  As expected, capital was up a bit compared to last year, which I will detail in just a minute. Total net cash reached approximately a positive $300 million in the first quarter of 2011. As in prior years, net cash is not equal across the four quarters of the year. Both working capital requirements and capital spending is back-loaded towards the end of the year.
Page 15 details first quarter capital spending. Year-to-date capital spending is about on par with last year for MichCon and the Non-Utility businesses. Capital is higher in Detroit Edison, reflecting an expected increase in environmental spending and the timing of plant outages.
Page 16 shows our revised guidance for 2011 cash and capital. The only change from the original guidance is higher renewable investments at Detroit Edison. As Dave mentioned, we were presented with an opportunity to accelerate the timing of our wind investment in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Expense renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with the preexisting surcharge, a new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates while still maintaining our balance sheet targets.
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment in the Renewable portfolio of Detroit Edison.
Now let me turn it back to Dave to wrap up."

First of all, in our Power & Industrial business, we've outlined our growth projections to go out into 2015 where we're driving to get that business to a net income level of $100 million. The 2 areas of growth, the Renewable business line, which are the small coal plants that we're acquiring and converting to biomass that qualify for renewable energy credits. So we have 5 projects that are either in construction or operating right now, and we'll provide an update there. The other growth opportunities coming out of the Reduced Emission Fields business line this is, again, where we've licensed technology that when added to coal, it's used in the production of electricity. It reduces NOx by 40% -- excuse me, 20% and mercury by 40%. And we are in the process right now of citing those plants, negotiating with counter parties around tax credits. And again, as this business line ramps up over the next several years, it'll provide substantial earnings for us. It's a business line that qualifies for a tax credit that runs for 10 years. So he'll just provide an update on the insights up there. And then on midstream, we've had tremendous growth over the last 5 years and this year, were over $50 million of net income. We've outlined our aspirations to get that to 2000 -- by 2015 to $70 million of net income, and I think people have been  waiting this hear something on the development side, and this Bluestone project now. We've had a significant step forward in terms of reaching a tentative agreement with a counter party that would allow us to build out the lateral pipeline. And this could be a significant investment for the company and it's also the driver that'll help drive net income growth industry to over the next several years."

So we work very collaboratively through these issues. We have some complexities. And as we go through these interim rate increases, one of the complexities is dealing with some of these trackers that are in place, and it could be the choice tracker. It could be the issue of trackers being reset or a trackers that go away and the clarity that you might need during that, as you're going through interim rates. So when we file this case, we have filed the case and provided some options that we believe are viable options that could benefit customers during this time. And one of those options, as an example, was not to reset the choice tracker but basically to continue it. So this ended up with one of the options, and the economics are exactly what we had planned on. And in terms of the tone of what you see in the order right, I would just say that everyone has got different stakeholders that they're writing, documents too, and I would not read too much into that.

We also were on a path already to pursue 90% mercury reduction in MichCon. So what we have outlined for you is that we are going to continue to build our scrubbers and SCR at Monroe. And down the road, we anticipate putting additional environmental controls in some of the other larger, newer units, but there will be smaller and older coal plants that will be closed. And someday, somewhere, we'll be adding a new generation that would be likely to be gas generation. So I think what you're hearing from the industry and from us also is that we think the timetables are way too aggressive.

Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak; Nick Khouri and Mark Rolling. I also have members of the leadership team available for Q&A if necessary.
Let me start with an overview on Slide 5. We have plans that will provide 5% to 6%  earnings growth, and when coupled with our dividend of $2.24 per share, that provides a very attractive total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. This is offset with the key priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our utility growth is driven by federal and state mandates, which even after aggressive cost management and capital efficiency work, will still generate 5% to 6% earnings growth.
The utility plans are supported by a constructive regulatory structure and our cost savings are a tool to allow us to earn our authorized returns. We continue to focus on operational excellence and customer satisfaction. And as an example of that, our complaints to the Michigan Public Service Commission are down by another 1/3 this year. And our focus on procurement in Michigan has about 40% of our annual $1.1 billion spend driven to Michigan as we focus on helping drive Michigan's economy forward. We also have meaningful growth opportunities in our Non-Utility businesses. 
The AGA Financial Conference is coming up here in May, and Gerry Anderson will be there with updates on the Power & Industrial business, including an update on the REF business line and on our Midstream business.
Now turning to Slide 6 is an overview for the quarter. We are a $1.11 per share in an operating earnings and we're right where we want to be in order to deliver our guidance of $3.40 to $3.70 per share. The 2 utilities are at 11%  return on equity last year and they remain on track to do the same this year. Yesterday, the Public Service Commission issued an order regarding Detroit Edison's self implementation, which was in line with our expectations and our plans. We had proposed several options to the commission in our original case filing which would get you to the same interim economics of $230 million. The commission shows the option of $107 million in interim rates by not resetting the base rates for choice and the continuation of the choice tracker. And when you put this together, it gets you back to the same outcome of $230 million in economics. This was the result of a collaborative effort with the staff, and we are pleased with the constructive outcome.
Both Power & Industrial and Gas Pipelines and Storage are also right on plan for the year. And just to note on the development side, we have entered into a letter of intent  with Southwestern Energy to construct a lateral pipe, which we have referred to in our IR materials as our Bluestone Project. Bluestone will be a wholly owned DTE pipeline connecting to both Millennium and to the Tennessee Pipeline and will transport gas from Southwestern's Marcellus Shale acreage. Terms of the -- of this arrangement are being negotiated right now as we work out the definitive agreement, and Gerry Anderson will provide an update on this project at AGA.
Peter will take you through the details in a moment on Energy Trading, but Energy Trading's tracking economically to our guidance target. This quarter's accounting earnings reflect timing within the year, and we continue to be comfortable with our total-year guidance for Energy Trading. So overall, we're off to a very good start for the year. Our balance sheet is also right where we want it to be and cash from operations was $700 million. We also have accelerated the timing of some of our Wind Projects with increases in our capital spending of about $300 million for the year. Although this is an increase to our 2011 CapEx guidance that we provided earlier in the year, it is within our renewable energy plan which has been approved by the commission. And Nick will take you through the details of the Wind Projects on the capital side. With that overview, now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through the quarter."
266598,129885799,118500,"DTE Energy Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2011",2011-04-27,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 8 and the first quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings was $1.11. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in",785,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning to everyone. I'd like to start with Slide 8 and the first quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings was $1.11. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.57, and MichCon, which typically has a strong first quarter came in at $0.49. The Non-Utility segments combined earned $0.15. The drivers for the Non-Utility first quarter results were Gas Storage and Pipelines at $0.09, Power & Industrial projects at $0.06, Energy Trading at $0.01, Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 9 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are down $41 million for the quarter. Together, our core utilities, Edison and MichCon had $10 million of earnings over the prior year, and I'll be providing additional details on the 2 utility companies later in the presentation.
Our Non-Utility segments are down $42 million, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment down $36 million, which had historically high income in the first quarter last year. I'll provide more color on the Energy Trading performance in a moment. Power & Industrial projects was down $8 million, resulting from non-repeating earnings last year from the steel energy fuel's [ph] tax credit and favorable coal pricing.
Gas Storage and Pipelines and Unconventional Gas Production earnings are up slightly from the prior year. Corporate & Other was down $9 million from last year, due to a onetime 2010 tax benefit. Before I move from this page, just a few more words on the Energy Trading's first quarter performance. As you recall, we lowered the income range in our 2011 guidance for the Trading business to a midpoint of $25 million, down by a more historical average of $40 million to $50 million We are on track to achieve this midpoint of guidance for this segment in 2011.
The first quarter is off to a strong start for new transactions. On Page 21 of the appendix, we provided our standard page, which shows both economic and accounting performance. On that page, you will see we have $22 million of economic income, which is not recognized yet for accounting purposes. There are numerous transactions we entered into in the first quarter that will not start recognizing income until the physical delivery of the power or gas. An example of this is a coal-requirement [ph] gas transaction where the gas is delivered starting in the fourth quarter. We expect a good portion of the 22 million of tonnage to flow through operating earnings in the fourth quarter of this year.
As a result, the next 2 quarters of accounting income could be relatively flat for our Energy Trading business.
Now I'd like to go through some quarterly details of the utility companies beginning with Detroit Edison on Slide 10. Operating earnings for Detroit Edison was $97 million, up $6 million from the prior year. Margin for the quarter was up $8 million, driven primarily by energy efficiency incentives recorded in the first quarter of 2011 after receiving a favorable order in our efficiency reconciliation related to achieving prior year incentives. Even though we have revenue decoupling with our electric utility, we still closely monitor underlying electric load. Overall, temperature normal, electric load in the territory was up 1% in the quarter. We continue to see positive signs of economic improvement in Michigan, translating into  increased sales.
On the expense side, O&M was higher as a result of timing power plant maintenance and one-time benefit savings realized in 2010. In addition, in 2011, we have experience lower interest expense in favorable first quarter of 2011 property tax settlement at Detroit Edison.
Moving onto Page 11, a review of MichCon's performance. As mentioned earlier, the first quarter is typically the strongest in the seasonal Gas Utility business. Operating earnings for MichCon was $83 million, up $4 million from the prior year. The primary driver was $16 million of favorable weather impacts as the quarter saw 14% pickup in heating degree days compared to 2010. Margin that other than was down $9 million, primarily driven by the fact that a final rates in the June 2010 order, which carried into the first quarter of 2011 are lower than the south implementation executed in the first quarter of 2010.  In addition, maintenance expenses were up slightly this quarter, due to an increase in schedule in main service repairs. That concludes an update on our earnings for the quarter. I'd like to turn discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and the board of directors. To the first three months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal for the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 13 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage in cash flow ranges.  In addition, we have made significant progress towards our 2011 funding requirements. We have completed our pension plan funding earlier this year than in past years, and we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong with no expiring credit facilities until 2012.
Page 14 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow in the first quarter of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations, adjusted for the early pension contribution was about on par with the strong internal cash seen last year.  As expected, capital was up a bit compared to last year, which I will detail in just a minute. Total net cash reached approximately a positive $300 million in the first quarter of 2011. As in prior years, net cash is not equal across the four quarters of the year. Both working capital requirements and capital spending is back-loaded towards the end of the year.
Page 15 details first quarter capital spending. Year-to-date capital spending is about on par with last year for MichCon and the Non-Utility businesses. Capital is higher in Detroit Edison, reflecting an expected increase in environmental spending and the timing of plant outages.
Page 16 shows our revised guidance for 2011 cash and capital. The only change from the original guidance is higher renewable investments at Detroit Edison. As Dave mentioned, we were presented with an opportunity to accelerate the timing of our wind investment in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Expense renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with the preexisting surcharge, a new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates while still maintaining our balance sheet targets.
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment in the Renewable portfolio of Detroit Edison.
Now let me turn it back to Dave to wrap up."

It reduces NOx by 40% -- excuse me, 20% and mercury by 40%. And we are in the process right now of citing those plants, negotiating with counter parties around tax credits.

So when we file this case, we have filed the case and provided some options that we believe are viable options that could benefit customers during this time. And one of those options, as an example, was not to reset the choice tracker but basically to continue it. So this ended up with one of the options, and the economics are exactly what we had planned on. And in terms of the tone of what you see in the order right, I would just say that everyone has got different stakeholders that they're writing documents to, and I would not read too much into that. Our relationship is good. It doesn't mean we agree on everything, but I think the fact that we got through this self implementation and then the economics are aligned and we're able to stand by our guidance is a very positive signal."

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak; Nick Khouri; and Mark Rolling. I also have members of the leadership team in the room and they're available in the Q&A if needed.
Before we get started, I just wanted to mention that we ended up announcing our earnings call and CMS did at the same time inadvertently. So when we realized that we adjusted our call 0.5 hour here to allow as many of you as possible to listen to both TMS' call. And going forward, we'll try to avoid that so you can hear both of the Michigan companies as we go through our quarterly earnings.
So with that background, let me start on Slide 5. This is our investment thesis and for those of you that followed the company, you've seen this investment thesis many times and you know that it's constant in terms as Northstar for us in positioning DTE Energy in attractive investment for you. In May, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, which brings the annual dividend to $2.35 per share. And in addition to that solid dividend yield, we plan to deliver 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth. And when you combine those 2 together, that provides an attractive total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. 
Our utility growth is driven by mandates at the State and the Federal level and is supported by a constructive regulatory environment. While the capital requirements to meet the current and proposed environmental rules and renewable mandates are quite significant for apply we're applying our continues improvement methodology to drive greater capital efficiency to ensure we manage the impact on our customers.
And as we've talked about many times in the past, it's our continues improvement capabilities, which have enabled us to make significant reductions in O&M expense and drive our utilities turns, their authorized returns, which they did last year and we're targeted to again this year.
We continue to focus on operational excellence and customer service. And as an example of those, one that I've mentioned that we have driven many, many improvement initiatives. One of the things that we focused in on is providing appointment windows for our customers and then delivering on those appointments. So we do that in both the gas and the electric utilities as an example. And right now, we're at a 96% attainment of the windows when we give our customers appointments. Another example in that areas is our channel management strategy where we're looking to ship customers from customer offices to the voice response system, to call centers, then to the web and then our new mobile applications that we're developing. And at the same time, delighting those customers and every channel that we serve them in.
We also remain committed to being a force for growth and renewed prosperity in the communities we serve. We recently announced the plan to boost our annual Michigan-based purchases of products and services by $250 million by 2015. Approximately, 60% of our non-fuel purchases will be sourced in Michigan by then, which is up from 44% today.
Another example is this week, we announced that other Detroit-based companies an employee program called Live Detroit, which provides incentives for those to move into downtown Detroit or the midtown area just North of us. We've also recently talked about some of the meaningful growth opportunities we have in our Non-Utility businesses, particularly at the power industrial projects and also the gas midstream business. And I'll give you an update on recent developments on those fronts in just a minute. 
On Slide 6 is an overview for the quarter. We strive to develop a reputation of putting on our plans and then delivering on those commitments. we are right where we want to be after 6 months with solid results in the quarter where we earned $0.65 an operating earnings per share. Detroit Edison's margin was up for the quarter, with self-implementation of new rates beginning in the Spring, while the Power & Industrial earnings are down from a record level in 2010. And that's mainly due to a number of non-recurring items last year.
The gas midstream business continues to provide good earnings growth and Energy Trading earnings are up significantly from the loss we experienced in the second quarter of 2010. Our reported earnings include a one-time benefit from the change in the state of Michigan tax law. The impact of this change was neutral at the utilities and was incurred only at the Non-Utility businesses.
On the cash front, we've generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations year-to-date, which is consistent from the strong levels that we achieved last year and our balance sheet metrics are right where we want them to be. On the development said, we entered into a long-term agreement with Southwestern Energy earlier this month to build and operate the Bluestone lateral pipeline and gathering system. The Bluestone lateral will be a wholly owned DTE pipeline running between the Millennium Pipeline and the Tennessee pipeline, Bluestone gathering assets will collect natural gas from Southwestern's Marcellus Shale acreage and move it to the lateral pipe. The investment for this lateral pipe and the initial gathering system will be $150 million to $200 million with upside potential over time to expand that gathering system for a total investment of up to $280 million.
We also announced the first 2 expansions in the Millennium mainline which we're going to service in 2012 and 2013. So for sometime, we have talked about the fact that our assets are very, very strategically positioned relative to the Marcellus shale. And what you're seeing now is us stepping out to make investments, which will support the growth of the Midstream business there. At Power & Industrial business, we're seeing the reduced emissions fuel business materializing at the significant growth opportunities. We have 5 REF machines in service and 2 more are being constructed. And we're in advanced discussions with a number of potential partners and expectable build potentially additional facilities this year.
We expect to be able to go into more detail on both of these investments at the Fall EEI financial conference. 
Now moving to Slide 7. I want to give you a sense of we're we are halfway through the year. Our performance for the first 6 months of 2011 continues to support our full year guidance at the midpoint. Now being a former car guide, I would describe the first 6 months by saying we're firing on all peak cylinders. But now that I'm driving a Chevy, I can't use that analogy anymore. But I'd say in the electric wealth virgin here, the electric engines are all running and spinning throughout the company here very well. Both our utilities are on track during their authorized returns again, which is at 11%. And we're looking forward to a productive order to Detroit Edison as a rate case plays out later this Fall. 
Year-to-date, operating earnings of both the non-utility businesses are in line with our full year projections as well. Power & Industrial will probably see a small lift in second of the year due to the REF projects starting to come online. And both Energy Trading and Corporate & Other are on track to hit their guidance for the year.
So overall, we had a very good first half of the year. And with that overview, now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through more details on the second quarter."

I'd like to start with Slide 9 in the second quarter earnings. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.65. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Turning contributed $0.59 in this account, which typically incurs an operating loss for the second quarter combined came in at a $0.02 loss. The non-utility segments combined have earned $0.18. The drivers for the non-utility second quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipeline at $0.09, Trading at $0.07, Power & Industrial projects at $0.02, and noncommercial gas production at a pending loss. Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 10 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment.
At a single pipeline presentation pages this quarter due to the straightforward nature of the influences utilities for those of the earning of utilities and described in the quarter-over-quarter changes in Slide 10. Operating earnings for the DTE Energy are up $45 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was $100 million, up $13 million from prior year. The profitability is driven by improved margin resulting from self-implemented rates in the second quarter of 2011. Even though our utility is decoupled, we closely our sales level and the underlying economy for our region. Overall, attempt to normal electric load in the territory was relatively flat for the quarter. Last year in the second quarter, the auto companies were ramping up production at inventory levels, so it was a strong quarter for industrial sales. This is playing out as we look at the quarter-over-quarter this year.
Moving to MichCon, as noted earlier, the second quarter is typically a loss for the seasonal Gas Utility business. MichCon has an operating loss of $3 million, down $2 million for the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by final other rates falling through this quarter versus self-implementred rates last year. We also saw lower storage revenues offset by favorable weather. 
Our non-utility segments were $26 million, primarily driven by higher earnings at Energy Trading partially offset by lower earnings at Power & Industrial Projects. Power & Industrial Projects were down $17 million resulting from non-repeating earnings last year for the still fuels tax credit and favorable transportation contracts. Energy Trading is up $38 million, following a loss of $26 million in the second quarter of 2010. The improvement is driven by favorable economic performance and favorable accounting timing related earnings.
We have provided our standard year-to-date economic and accounting earnings was for the segment in the appendix. In this quarter, we've also included a quarter-over-quarter walk. Lastly, Corporate and Others was up $8 million from last year due to lower interest and taxes in 2011. That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. I'd turn discussion over to Nick Khouri who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and the Board of Directors. Through the first 6 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 12 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we have made significant progress towards our 2011 funding requirements. We completed our pension plan funding earlier this year than in past years and we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong with no expiring credit facilities until 2012.
Page 13 provides an overview of DTE Energy's cash flow in the first half of this year versus the same period last year. As Dave mentioned, cash from operations at $1.2 billion was on par with the strong internal cash seen last year. As expected capital was off compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute, all told, net cash reached a positive $300 million in the first half of 2011. As in prior years, net cash is not equal across the 4 quarters of the year, both working capital requirements and capital spending is backloaded towards the end of the year.
Page 14 details capital spending. As expected, capital spending is up from last year. Capital is higher at Detroit Edison, reflecting an increase in both environmental spending and the acceleration of wind projects in Michigan. As we discussed on our last call, we have accelerated the timing of our wind investment in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million for the full year, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Such renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with a preexisting surcharge. The new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates, while still maintaining our balance sheet targets.
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets on track, with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment in the renewable portfolio for Detroit Edison. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.With me this morning are Peter",1297,"Thank you, Connie. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, Nick Khouri, and Mark Rolling. I also have members of the leadership team in the room and they're available in the Q&A session if needed.
Before we get started, I just wanted to mention that we ended up announcing our earnings call and CMS did at the same time, inadvertently. So when we realized that, we adjusted our call 0.5 hour here to allow as many of you as possible to listen to both, since CMS' call, and going forward, we'll try to avoid that so you can hear both of the Michigan companies as we go through our quarterly earnings.
So with that background, let me start on Slide 5. This is our investment thesis and for those of you that followed the company, you've seen this investment thesis many times and you know that it's constant and it serves as the North star for us in positioning DTE Energy as an attractive investment for you. In May, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, which brings the annual dividend to $2.35 per share. And in addition to that solid dividend yield, we plan to deliver 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth. And when you combine those 2 together, that provides an attractive total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. 
Our utility growth is driven by mandates at the State and the Federal level and is supported by a constructive regulatory environment. While capital requirements to meet both the current and proposed environmental rules and renewable mandates are quite significant we're applying our continues improvement methodology to drive greater capital efficiency to ensure we manage the impact on our customers.
And as we've talked about many times in the past, it's our continues improvement capabilities, which have enabled us to make significant reductions in O&M expense and drive our utilities turns, their authorized returns, which they did last year and we're targeted to, again, this year.
We continue to focus on operational excellence and customer service. And as an example of those effort, one that I've mentioned that we have driven many, many improvement initiatives. One of the things that we focused in on is providing appointment windows for our customers and then delivering on those appointments. So we do that in both the gas and the electric utilities as an example. And right now, we're at a 96% attainment of the windows when we give our customers appointments. 
Another example in that areas is our channel management strategy, where we're looking to ship customers from customer offices to the voice response system, to call centers, then to the web and then our new mobile applications that we're developing. And at the same time, delighting those customers in every channel that we serve them in.
We also remain committed to being a force for growth and renewed prosperity in the communities we serve. We recently announced the plan to boost our annual Michigan-based purchases of products and services by $250 million by 2015. Approximately, 60% of our non-fuel purchases will be sourced in Michigan by then, which is up from 44% today.
Another example is, this week, we announced with other Detroit-based companies an employee program called Live Detroit, which provides incentives for those to move into downtown Detroit or the midtown area just north of us. We've also recently talked about some of the meaningful growth opportunities we have in our Non-Utility businesses, particularly at the power industrial projects and also the Gas Midstream business. And I'll give you an update on recent developments on those fronts in just a minute. 
On Slide 6 is an overview for the quarter. We strive to develop a reputation of putting out our plans and then delivering on those commitments. We are right where we want to be after 6 months with solid results in the quarter, where we earned $0.65 in operating earnings per share. Detroit Edison's margin was up for the quarter, with self-implementation of new rates beginning in the Spring, while the Power & Industrial earnings are down from a record level in 2010. And that's mainly due to a number of non-recurring items last year.
The Gas Midstream business continues to provide good earnings for us and Energy Trading earnings are up significantly from the loss we experienced in the second quarter of 2010. Our reported earnings include a one-time benefit from the change in the state of Michigan tax law. The impact of this change was neutral at the Utilities and was incurred only at the Non-Utility businesses.
On the cash front, we've generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations year-to-date, which is consistent from the strong levels that we achieved last year and our balance sheet metrics are right where we want them to be. On the development side, we entered into a long-term agreement with Southwestern Energy earlier this month to build and operate the Bluestone lateral pipeline and gathering system. The Bluestone lateral will be a wholly owned DTE Pipeline running between the Millennium Pipeline and the Tennessee Pipeline. The Bluestone gathering assets will collect natural gas from Southwestern's Marcellus Shale acreage and move it to the lateral pipe. The investment for this lateral pipe and the initial gathering system will be $150 million to $200 million with upside potential over time to expand that gathering system for a total investment of up to $280 million.
We also announced the first 2 expansions in the Millennium mainline, which we're going to service in 2012 and 2013. So for sometime, we've talked about the fact that our assets are very, very strategically positioned relative to the Marcellus shale. And what you're seeing now is us stepping out to make investments, which will support the growth of the Midstream business there. At Power & Industrial business, we're seeing the Reduced Emission Fuel business materializing at the significant growth opportunities. We have 5 REF machines in service and 2 more are being constructed. And we're in advanced discussions with a number of potential partners and expectable build potentially additional facilities this year.
We expect to be able to go into more detail on both of these investments at the Fall EEI financial conference. 
Now moving to Slide 7. I want to give you a sense of we're we are halfway through the year. Our performance for the first 6 months of 2011 continues to support our full year guidance at midpoint. Now being a former car guy, I would describe the first 6 months by saying we're firing on all 8 cylinders. But now that I'm driving a Chevy Volt,I can't use that analogy anymore. But I'd say in the electric world version here, the electric engines are all running and spinning throughout the company here very well. Both our utilities are on track during their authorized returns again, which is at 11%. And we're looking forward to a productive order Detroit Edison as a rate case plays out later this Fall. 
Year-to-date, operating earnings of both the non-utility businesses are in line with our full year projections as well. Power & Industrial will probably see a small lift in the second half of the year due to the REF projects starting to come online. And both Energy Trading and Corporate & Other are on track to hit their guidance for the year.
So overall, we had a very good first half of the year. And with that overview, now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through more details on the second quarter."

I'd like to start with Slide 9 in the second quarter earnings. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.65. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the Appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.59. And MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss for the second quarter combined came in at a $0.02 loss. The Non-utility segments combined have earned $0.18. The drivers for the non-utility second quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipeline at $0.09, Trading at $0.07, Power & Industrial projects at $0.02, and noncommercial gas production at a $0.01 loss. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 10 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment.
I've simplified my presentation pages this quarter due to the straightforward nature of the earnings experienced at utilities, for those separate earnings works [ph] on the utilities and described at quarter-over-quarter changes in Slide 10. Operating earnings for the DTE Energy are up $45 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was $100 million, up $13 million from prior year. The profitability [ph] is driven by improved margin resulting from self-implemented rates in the second quarter of 2011. Even though our large utility is decoupled, we closely monitor sales levels and the underlying economy for our region. Overall, attempt [ph] to normal electric load in the territory was relatively flat for the quarter. Last year in the second quarter, the auto companies were ramping up production at inventory levels, so it's a strong quarter for industrial sales. This is playing out as we look at the quarter-over-quarter this year.
Moving to MichCon, as noted earlier, the second quarter is typically a loss for the seasonal Gas Utility business. MichCon had an operating loss of $3 million, down $2 million for the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by final other rates falling through this quarter versus self-implemented rates last year. We also saw lower storage revenues offset by favorable weather. 
Our non-utility segments were up $26 million, primarily driven by higher earnings at Energy Trading, partially offset by lower earnings at Power & Industrial Projects. Power & Industrial Projects are down $17 million resulting from non-repeating earnings last year from the steel industry fuels tax credit and favorable transportation contracts. Energy Trading is up $38 million, following a loss of $26 million in the second quarter of 2010. The improvement is driven by favorable economic performance and favorable accounting timing related earnings.
We have provided our standard year-to-date economic and accounting earnings walks [ph] for the segment in the Appendix. In this quarter, we've also included a quarter-over-quarter walk[ph].  Lastly, Corporate and Others was up $8 million from last year due to lower interest and taxes in 2011. That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. I'll turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and the Board of Directors. Through the first 6 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track. In fact, nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 12 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we have made significant progress towards our 2011 funding requirements. We completed our pension plan funding earlier this year than in past years and we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong with no expiring credit facilities until 2012.
Page 13 provides an overview of DTE Energy's cash flow in the first half of this year versus the same period last year. As Dave mentioned, cash from operations at $1.2 billion was on par with the strong internal cash seen last year. As expected capital was up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash reached a positive $300 million in the first half of 2011. As in prior years, net cash is not equal across the 4 quarters of the year, both working capital requirements and capital spending is backloaded towards the end of the year.
Page 14 details capital spending. As expected, capital spending is up from last year. Capital is higher at Detroit Edison, reflecting an increase in both environmental spending and the acceleration of wind projects in Michigan. As we discussed on our last call, we have accelerated the timing of our wind investment in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million for the full year, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Such renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with a pre-existing surcharge. The new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates, while still maintaining our balance sheet targets.
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment in renewable portfolio for Detroit Edison. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

My other comment I just wanted to make, we've seen this in the last couple of cases where we have several moving pieces. An example would be decoupling and whether the decoupling mechanism changes, how customer choice and the tracker around that has handled in other tracker.

Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.With me this morning are Peter",1305,"Thank you, Connie. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements.
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, Nick Khouri, and Mark Rolling. I also have members of the leadership team in the room and they're available in the Q&A session if needed.
Before we get started, I just wanted to mention that we ended up announcing our earnings call and CMS did at the same time, inadvertently. So when we realized that, we adjusted our call 0.5 hour here to allow as many of you as possible to listen to both us and CMS' call. And going forward, we'll try to avoid that so you can hear both of the Michigan companies as we go through our quarterly earnings.
So with that background, let me start on Slide 5. This is our investment thesis. And for those of you that follow the company, you've seen this investment thesis many times and you know that it's constant and it serves as the North star for us in positioning DTE Energy as an attractive investment for you. In May, we announced a 5% increase in our dividend, which brings the annual dividend to $2.35 per share. And in addition to that solid dividend yield, we plan to deliver 5% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth. And when you combine those 2 together, that provides an attractive total shareholder return of 9% to 10%. 
Our utility growth is driven by mandates at the state and the federal level and is supported by a constructive regulatory environment. While capital requirements to meet both the current and proposed environmental rules and renewable mandates are quite significant, we're applying our continuous improvement methodology to drive greater capital efficiency to ensure we manage the impact on our customers.
And as we've talked about many times in the past, it's our continuous improvement capabilities which have enabled us to make significant reductions in O&M expense and drive our utilities turns -- their authorized returns, which they did last year and we're targeted to again this year.
We continue to focus on operational excellence and customer service. And as an example of those, I wanted to mention that we have driven many, many improvement initiatives. One of the things that we focused in on is providing appointment windows for our customers and then delivering on those appointments. So we do that in both the gas and the electric utilities, as an example. And right now, we're at a 96% attainment of the windows when we give our customers appointments. 
Another example in that area is our channel management strategy, where we're looking to shift customers from customer offices to the voice response system, to call centers, then to the web and then our new mobile applications that we're developing -- and at the same time, delighting those customers in every channel that we serve them in.
We also remain committed to being a force for growth and renewed prosperity in the communities we serve. We recently announced the plan to boost our annual Michigan-based purchases of products and services by $250 million by 2015. Approximately 60% of our non-fuel purchases will be sourced in Michigan by then, which is up from 44% today.
Another example is, this week we announced, with other Detroit-based companies, an employee program called Live Detroit, which provides incentives for those to move into downtown Detroit or the midtown area just north of us. We've also recently talked about some of the meaningful growth opportunities we have in our Non-Utility businesses, particularly at the Power & Industrial Projects, and also the Gas Midstream business. And I'll give you an update on recent developments on those fronts in just a minute. 
On Slide 6 is an overview for the quarter. We strive to develop a reputation of putting out our plans and then delivering on those commitments. We are right where we want to be after 6 months, with solid results in the quarter, where we earned $0.65 in operating earnings per share. Detroit Edison's margin was up for the quarter, with self-implementation of new rates beginning in the spring, while the Power & Industrial earnings are down from a record level in 2010. And that's mainly due to a number of non-recurring items last year.
The Gas Midstream business continues to provide good earnings for us and Energy Trading earnings are up significantly from the loss we experienced in the second quarter of 2010. Our reported earnings include a onetime benefit from the change in the state of Michigan tax law. The impact of this change was neutral at the Utilities and was incurred only at the Non-Utility businesses.
On the cash front, we've generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations year-to-date, which is consistent from the strong levels that we achieved last year and our balance sheet metrics are right where we want them to be. On the development side, we entered into a long-term agreement with Southwestern Energy earlier this month to build and operate the Bluestone lateral pipeline and gathering system. The Bluestone lateral will be a wholly owned DTE pipeline running between the Millennium Pipeline and the Tennessee Pipeline. The Bluestone gathering assets will collect natural gas from Southwestern's Marcellus Shale acreage and move it to the lateral pipe. The investment for this lateral pipe and the initial gathering system will be $150 million to $200 million with upside potential over time to expand that gathering system, for a total investment of up to $280 million.
We also announced the first 2 expansions in the Millennium mainline, which will go into service in 2012 and 2013. So for some time, we've talked about the fact that our assets are very, very strategically positioned relative to the Marcellus Shale. And what you're seeing now is us stepping out to make investments which will support the growth of the Midstream business there. At the Power & Industrial business, we're seeing the Reduced Emission Fuels business materializing as a significant growth opportunity. We have 5 REF machines in service and 2 more are being constructed. And we're in advanced discussions with a number of potential partners and expect that we'll build potentially additional facilities this year.
We expect to be able to go into more detail on both of these investments at the Fall EEI Financial Conference. 
Now moving to Slide 7. I want to give you a sense of where we are halfway through the year. Our performance for the first 6 months of 2011 continues to support our full year guidance at midpoint. Now being a former car guy, I would describe the first 6 months by saying we're firing on all 8 cylinders. But now that I'm driving a Chevy Volt,I can't use that analogy anymore. But I'd say in the electric world version here, the electric engines are all running and spinning throughout the company here very well. Both our utilities are on track, doing their authorized returns again, which is at 11%. And we're looking forward to a productive order at Detroit Edison as our rate case plays out later this fall. 
Year-to-date, operating earnings of both the Non-Utility businesses are in line with our full year projections as well. Power & Industrial will probably see a small lift in the second half of the year due to the REF projects starting to come online. And both Energy Trading and Corporate & Other are on track to hit their guidance for the year.
So overall, we had a very good first half of the year. And with that overview, now let me turn it over to Peter, who will take you through more details on the second quarter."

I'd like to start with Slide 9 in the second quarter earnings [indiscernible].  For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings were $0.65. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the Appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.59. And MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss for the second quarter combined came in at a $0.02 loss. The Non-Utility segments combined to earn $0.18. The drivers for the Non-Utility second quarter results were Gas Storage & Pipeline at $0.09, Trading at $0.07, Power & Industrial Projects at $0.03, and Nonconventional Gas Production at a $0.01 loss. Finally, Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.10 in the quarter. 
Let's move to Slide 10 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment.
I've simplified my presentation pages this quarter due to the straightforward nature of the earnings experiences at the utilities. For those separate earnings walks on the utilities, I described the quarter-over-quarter changes with Slide 10. Operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are up $45 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was $100 million, up $13 million from prior year. The favorability is driven by improved margin resulting from self-implemented rates in the second quarter of 2011. Even though our electric utility is decoupled, we closely monitor sales levels and the underlying economy for our region. Overall, temperature-normal electric load in the territory was relatively flat for the quarter. Last year in the second quarter, the auto companies were ramping up production and inventory levels, so it's a strong quarter for industrial sales. This is playing out as we look at the quarter-over-quarter this year.
Moving to MichCon, as noted earlier, the second quarter is typically a loss for the seasonal Gas Utility business. MichCon had an operating loss of $3 million, down $2 million for the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by final order rates falling through this quarter versus self-implemented rates last year. We also saw lower storage revenues offset by favorable weather. 
Our non-utility segments were up $26 million, primarily driven by higher earnings at Energy Trading, partially offset by lower earnings at Power & Industrial Projects. Power & Industrial Projects are down $17 million resulting from non-repeating earnings last year from the steel industry fuels tax credit and favorable transportation contracts. Energy Trading is up $38 million, following a loss of $26 million in the second quarter of 2010. The improvement is driven by favorable economic performance and favorable accounting timing-related earnings.
We have provided our standard year-to-date economic and accounting earnings walks for the segment in the Appendix, and this quarter we've also included a quarter-over-quarter walk.  Lastly, Corporate and Other was up $8 million from last year due to lower interest and taxes in 2011. 
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter. I'll turn the discussion over to Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and the Board of Directors.

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and the Board of Directors. Through the first 6 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track -- in fact, nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 12 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we have made significant progress towards our 2011 funding requirements. We completed our pension plan funding earlier this year than in past years and we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong, with no expiring credit facilities until 2012.
Page 13 provides an overview of DTE Energy's cash flow in the first half of this year versus the same period last year. As Dave mentioned, cash from operations at $1.2 billion was on par with the strong internal cash seen last year. As expected, capital was up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash reached a positive $300 million in the first half of 2011. As in prior years, net cash is not equal across the 4 quarters of the year. Both working capital requirements and capital spending is backloaded towards the end of the year.
Page 14 details capital spending. As expected, capital spending is up from last year. Capital is higher at Detroit Edison, reflecting an increase in both environmental spending and the acceleration of wind projects in Michigan. As we discussed on our last call, we have accelerated the timing of our wind investment in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million for the full year, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Since renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with a pre-existing surcharge, the new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates, while still maintaining our balance sheet targets.
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment in Renewable portfolio for Detroit Edison. 
Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

An example would be decoupling and whether the decoupling mechanism changes, how customer Choice and the tracker around that is handled, and other trackers.

With me dismount are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Comptroller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, who's our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members management team with me that I can call on during the Q&A period.
This morning we'll cover the third quarter results in the final order we recently received in the Detroit Edison rate case. I'll be at EEI next week, and we'll take the opportunity there to update you on our long-term plan, including an early outlook of 2012 operating earnings. I'll provide updates on the growth story at the 2 utilities, as well as Power & Industrial's REF business line, the Gas Storage and Pipelines, Bluestone Project. 
Additionally, we'll provide an update on how we will finance our growth plans over the next several years. Gary and I will be at EEI on Monday, although the focus on this call will be on the quarter and 2011. 
Let me start on Slide 5. We have a disciplined growth plan now. We'll provide 5% to 6% long-term earnings growth per share, which when combined with our attractive dividend provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is always set around one of our Northstar's which is maintaining a strong balance sheet. Gas utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments including a long-term cast iron main replacement plan and a program to move gas meters outside of customers' homes. In Michigan, we are supported by both the 2008 comprehensive energy legislation and a very constructive regulatory structure and we see it as our responsibility to earn this favorable construct every single day. We utilized continuous improvement capabilities to ensure our utilities are as efficient as possible, and that at the same time, we're minimizing rate increases to our customers. This intense focus on continuous improvement has resulted in O&M cost, which in absolute terms, are lower than 2005 levels. That means over the last 6 years, we've offset over $325 million of inflation. This has enabled both our utilities during our authorized returns, and at the same time, we've improved operational metrics throughout the company by holding down rate increases to customers. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our Nonutility businesses as well, particularly on the empowered industrial projects and the gas storage and pipelines. And as I mentioned, we'll take you through the long-term growth plans at EEI Financial Conference on Monday and Tuesday.
On the next couple of pages, I'll provide an overview of the quarterly results, the rate order and also an update on our guidance. Turning to Slide 6, is the highlight from our third quarter. We continue to have a good year and turned in another solid quarter. DTE Energy had operating earnings of $1.07 per share compared to $0.96 in the third quarter of last year. The key quarter-over-quarter drivers include lower earnings at Detroit Edison due to higher plant O&M spend in the quarter, Power & Industrial had one-time non-repeating items last year in the third quarter. So earnings this year are lower. Midstream business continues to provide solid earnings and Energy Trading earnings are up sharply driven by ongoing improved economic performance.
The 3 quarters of the year behind us, in the final rate order at Edison now completed, we're confident in tightening our operating earnings guidance for the year to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, and $3.40 to $3.70 per share improving the midpoint up $0.05. And I have a page on guidance coming up that we could take you through. 
Balance sheet remains strong and we will hit all of our goals for the year. Also, we just recently renewed our $1.8 billion credit line, taking them off 5 years with a nice reduction and fees. And we have received the final order at Detroit Edison, which I will now cover on the next page which is Slide 7. 
But first let me set the context for the Detroit Edison rate order. Comprehensive energy legislation, which was passed in 2008, had features that were negotiated among all key stakeholders. This included the renewable energy and energy efficiency plans, the skewing of business rates for business customers and a 12-month rate case cycle with 6 months self implementation of rates. Over the last few years, there were several tracking mechanisms added to our regulatory framework, including a bad debt tracker, the storm and restoration tracker and an electric choice tracker. Probably wasn't contemplated was a complexity of how to deal with multiple tracking mechanisms being modified or eliminated during the period of self implementation. So as further complicated this year, a separate depreciation case at Detroit Edison which was finalized in June. The good news from a complexity standpoint is that almost all the drivers have been removed. The bad debt, the storm restoration and choice trackers were eliminated, but we still retain a modified revenue in decoupling mechanism at Detroit Edison. The Detroit Edison will be a simpler story going forward, although we do have a couple of reconciliation cases to work our way through. And then as a reminder, at MichCon, we saw a bad debt tracker and the decoupling mechanism there also. 
In the Detroit Edison case, the intersection of the trackers, self implementation and the depreciation in case had a complexity and we had 1 item that we asked the MPSC to relook at this week, and we really appreciate the commission resolving this in a timely manner. It was related to the accounting treatment of the impact of change and depreciation rates during the self implementation period. There are some other technical issues in the case that we will pursue and will be hearing process we file for that rehearing in the next several weeks. Data was constructive order and we look forward to working with the existing commissioners and the new Chairman. 
On page 8 is an update on our 2011 operating earnings guidance. Overall, we're tightening our earnings per share range by bringing of the lower end of the range by $0.10 and increasing the midpoint $0.05 to $3.60. The lower range for Detroit Edison incorporates the partial year 50 basis points reduction in the authorized return on equity for that utility. We now expect unconventional gas to have a tiny loss for the year as we continue to prove up the oil reserves in the Marble Falls [ph] and prepare those assets for monetization. Energy Trading as I previously noted, is having a very solid economic performance year-to-date, giving us the confidence to move their range closer to historical earning levels. The revised guidance is $593 million to $628 million with the midpoint of $3.60 per share. 
Now, let me pass it over to Peter Oleksiak, who will take you through to some additional details on the quarter."

Just over Slide 10 and third quarter earnings results. The quarter DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.07. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.92, and MichCon with typically incurs an operating loss in the third quarter, came in at $0.06 loss. 
Non-utilities segments combined to earn $0.27. Drivers for the nonutility second quarter results were Energy Trading at $0.13, gas, storage and pipeline at $0.08, Power & Industrial projects at $0.07 and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. On the Corporate & Other had a loss of $0.06 in the quarter. 
Let's move on to Slide 11 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Our operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are up $20 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was $157 million, down $8 million from the prior year. I'll cover more details on Detroit Edison in a moment. As noted earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss for the seasonal Gas Utility business which had a non-operating loss of $11 million, down $5 million from prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by a true-up of the final rate order in 2010 and lower storage revenues in 2011. The nonutility segments are up $23 million in total, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment, partially offset by lower earnings at our Power & Industrial products. Energy Trading is up $34 million in 2011, coming off a loss of $12 million in the third quarter of 2010. Improvement is driven by a favorable economic performance and the benefit of accounting timing. Dave mentioned in his update on earnings guidance, the trading companies is essentially back at historical levels of income with a strong third quarter performance. For your reference, we provide our standard year-to-date economic to accountings earnings wap for the segment in the appendix, which shows the improved economic earnings in 2011 versus 2010. 
Another driver in the quarter-over-quarter performance is the Power & Industrial projects segment which was down $14 million in the quarter, which is primarily resulting from nonrepeating earnings last year from the still energy fuels tax credit. 
Lastly, Corporate & Other was up $10 million from last year primarily the lower interest and 2011. We expect attributable ability reverse in the fourth quarter with the timing of tax-related expense.
Page 12 shows an earning loss for Detroit Edison. Again, the company boost operating earnings of $157 million for the quarter, a decrease of $8 million from the prior year, experienced a $1 million improvement in margin driven by self implementation rates recorded in the third quarter, offset by the revenue true up recorded as a result of the October final order. 
Even though electric utilities decoupled, we closely monitor sales levels and the underlying economy for our region. Overall, temperature normalized and service area load was up just over 0.50% in the quarter and close to 1%, up year to date. Industrial load is up another 2% year-to-date and is normalized driven primarily by the automotive sector. As a note, we had a very hot summer with a lot of storm activity as much of the country. That is since revenue decoupling mechanism and restoration tracker neutralized those impacts from hitting the bottom line. Primary change and earnings for the quarter is an increase of the timing of plan, maintenance and O&M expense within our generation fleet. We are still on track to achieve our O&M plans for the year.
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter and I'll turn the discussion over to the Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow the balance sheet remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. The first 9 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full-year goals. And in fact,",395,"Thanks, Peter. As always, improved cash flow the balance sheet remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. The first 9 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full-year goals. And in fact, are nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 14 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year well within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we have completed our 2011 funding requirements, including a $200 million contribution into our pension plan earlier this year. As we've said all along, we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong, specially as Dave mentioned with the recent 5-year extension of our $1.8 billion of credit facilities. 
Page 15 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow the first 3 quarters of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.5 billion is on par with a strong internal cash last year. As expected capital is up compared to last year, as I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash, after dividends is a positive $100 million for the first 3 quarters of 2011. 
Page 16 details capital spending. Year-to-date, total capital at DTE is up about 20% or $180 million from the prior year. Capital at Edison is higher, reflecting an increase in both environmental spending and the acceleration of Wind Projects in Michigan. As we discussed on our call last quarter, we have accelerated the timing of our wind investments in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million for the full year, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Since renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with a pre-existing surcharge, new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates while still maintaining our balance sheet targets.
At MichCon, both operational expansion capital is up this year, while non-utility capital is down due to the 2010 equity contribution from Millennium as their pipeline went into service. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track and year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010 allowing us to accelerate our investment into the renewable portfolio for Detroit Edison. Let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

That said, we are going to be looking for example at the Gas business, with what you see across the country that the majority of what's happening on rates there is related to infrastructure investments, and it's pretty common to have infrastructure-related trackers for gas LDC's and that's something we're very interested in at MichCon which would allow us even to stay out of rate cases even further. But for the most part of Detroit Edison, I think what you're going to get to overtime is that it's going to be assets placed and service is going to be the primary issue that we'll be covering often these great pieces and it's pretty routine for us. We don't have this allowances and as you know, most of the capital here is mandated capital."

And before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements. 
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Comptroller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, who's our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me that I can call on during the Q&A period.
This morning, we'll cover the third quarter results in the final order we recently received in the Detroit Edison rate case. We'll be at EEI next week, and we'll take the opportunity there to update you on our long-term plan, including an early outlook of 2012 operating earnings. We'll provide updates on the growth story at the 2 utilities, as well as Power & Industrial's REF business line and Gas Storage and Pipelines' Bluestone Project.
Additionally, we'll provide an update on how we will finance our growth plans over the next several years. Gerry and I will be at EEI on Monday, though the focus on this call will be on the quarter and 2011. 
Let me start on Slide 5. We have a disciplined growth plan now. We'll provide 5% to 6% long-term earnings growth per share, which when combined with our attractive dividend, provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is always set around one of our Northstar's, which is maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
But utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments including a long-term cast-iron main replacement plan and a program to move gas meters outside of customers' homes. In Michigan, we are supported by both the 2008 comprehensive energy legislation and a very constructive regulatory structure. And we see it as our responsibility to earn this favorable construct every single day. We utilize continuous improvement capabilities to ensure our utilities are as efficient as possible, and that, at the same time, are minimizing rate increases to our customers. This intense focus on continuous improvement has resulted in O&M cost, which in absolute terms, are lower than 2005 levels. That means over the last 6 years, we've offset over $325 million of inflation. This has enabled both of our utilities during their authorized returns, and at the same time, we've improved operational metrics throughout the company by holding down rate increases to customers. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses as well, particularly on the empowered industrial projects in the Gas Storage and Pipelines. And as I mentioned, we'll take you through their long-term growth plans at the EEI Financial Conference on Monday and Tuesday.
On the next couple of pages, I'll provide an overview of the quarterly results, the rate order and also an update on our guidance. So turning to Slide 6, are the highlights from our third quarter. We continue to have a good year and turned in another solid quarter. DTE Energy had operating earnings of $1.07 per share compared to $0.96 in the third quarter of last year. The key quarter-over-quarter drivers include lower earnings at Detroit Edison due to higher plant O&M spend in the quarter. Power & Industrial had one-time non-repeating items last year in the third quarter, so earnings this year are lower. Our Midstream business continues to provide solid earnings, and Energy Trading earnings are up sharply driven by ongoing improved economic performance.
With 3 quarters of the year behind us and the final rate order at Edison now completed, we're confident in tightening our operating earnings guidance for the year to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, from $3.40 to $3.70 per share, moving the midpoint up $0.05. And I have a page on the guidance coming up that we could take you through. 
The balance sheet remains strong and we will hit all of our goals for the year. Also we just recently renewed our $1.8 billion credit line, taking them off 5 years with a nice reduction and fees. And we have received the final order at Detroit Edison, which I will now cover on the next page which is Slide 7. 
But first let me set the context for the Detroit Edison rate order. The comprehensive energy legislation, which was passed in 2008, had features that were negotiated among all key stakeholders. This included the renewable energy and energy efficiency plans, the deskewing of business rates for business customers and a 12-month rate case cycle with 6 months self-implementation of rates. Over the last few years, there were several tracking mechanisms added to our regulatory framework, including a bad debt tracker, the storm and restoration tracker and an electric choice tracker. But probably wasn't contemplated was the complexity of how to deal with multiple tracking mechanisms being modified or eliminated during a period of self-implementation. This is further complicated this year by a separate depreciation case at Detroit Edison, which was finalized in June. The good news from a complexity standpoint is that almost all the trackers have been removed. But the bad debt, the storm restoration and choice trackers were eliminated. But we still retain a modified revenue in decoupling mechanism at Detroit Edison. The Detroit Edison will be a simpler story going forward, although we do have a couple of reconciliation cases to work our way through. And then as a reminder, at MichCon, we saw a bad debt tracker and the decoupling mechanism there also. 
In the Detroit Edison case, the intersection of the trackers, self-implementation and the depreciation in case had a complexity and we had one item that we asked the MPSC to relook at this week, and we really appreciate the commission resolving this in a timely manner. It was related to the accounting treatment of the impact of change and depreciation rates during the self-implementation period. There are some other technical issues in the case that we will pursue in our rehearing process and we'll file for that rehearing in the next several weeks. Beyond that, it was a constructive order and we look forward to working with the existing commissioners and the new Chairman. 
On page 8, there's an update on our 2011 operating earnings guidance. Overall, we're tightening our earnings per share range by bringing up the lower end of the range by $0.10 and increasing the midpoint $0.05 to $3.60. The lower range for Detroit Edison incorporates the partial year 50 basis points reduction in the authorized return on equity for that utility. We now expect unconventional gas to have a tiny loss for the year as we continue to prove up the oil reserves in the Marble Falls and prepare those assets for monetization. Energy Trading, as I previously noted, is having a very solid economic performance year-to-date, giving us the confidence to move their range closer to historical earning levels. The revised guidance is $593 million to $628 million, with the midpoint of $3.60 per share. 
Now let me pass it over to Peter Oleksiak, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."

For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.07. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.92, and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss in the third quarter, came in at $0.06 loss. 
The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.27. The drivers for the non-utility second quarter results were Energy Trading at $0.13, Gas, Storage and Pipelines at $0.08, Power & Industrial Projects at $0.07 and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, corporate & other had a loss of $0.06 in the quarter. 
Let's move on to Slide 11 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Our operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are up $20 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was $157 million, down $8 million from the prior year. I'll cover more details on Detroit Edison in a moment. As noted earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss for the seasonal gas utility business. MichCon had a non-operating loss of $11 million, down $5 million from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by a true-up of the final rate order in 2010 and lower storage revenues in 2011. Our non-utility segments are up $23 million in total, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment, partially offset by lower earnings at our Power & Industrial projects. Energy Trading is up $34 million in 2011, coming off a loss of $12 million in the third quarter of 2010. The improvement is driven by a favorable economic performance and the benefit of accounting timing. As Dave mentioned in his update on earnings guidance, the trading companies is essentially back at historical levels of income with a strong third quarter performance. For your reference, we provided our standard year-to-date economic to accountings earnings swap for the segment in the appendix, which shows the improved economic earnings in 2011 versus 2010. 
Another driver in the quarter-over-quarter performance is the Power & Industrial Projects segment, which was down $14 million in the quarter, which is primarily resulting from non-repeating earnings last year from the steel industry fuel's tax credit. 
Lastly, corporate & other was up $10 million from last year primarily to lower interest in 2011. We expect attributable ability reverse in the fourth quarter with the timing of tax-related expense.
Page 12 shows an earning loss for Detroit Edison. Again, the company produced operating earnings of $157 million for the quarter, a decrease of $8 million from the prior year. We experienced a $1 million improvement in margin driven by self-implementation rates recorded in the third quarter, offset by the revenue true-up recorded as a result of the October final order. 
Even though electric utilities decoupled, we closely monitor sales levels and the underlying economy for our region. Overall, temperature-normalized service area load was up just over 0.50% in the quarter and close to 1% up year to date. Industrial load is up another 2% year-to-date, temperature-normalized driven primarily by the automotive sector. As a note, we had a very hot summer with a lot of storm activity as in much of the country. That is since revenue decoupling mechanism and restoration tracker neutralized those impacts from hitting the bottom line. The primary change in earnings for the quarter is an increase in the timing of plan, maintenance and O&M expense within our generation fleet. We are still on track to achieve our O&M plans for the year.
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter, and I'll turn the discussion over to the Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow in balance sheet remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. For the first 9 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full-year goals, and in fact, are nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 14 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year well within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we have completed our 2011 funding requirements, including a $200 million contribution into our pension plan earlier this year. As we've said all along, we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong, especially as Dave mentioned with the recent 5-year extension of our $1.8 billion of credit facilities. 
Page 15 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow in the first 3 quarters of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.5 billion was on par with a strong internal cash seen last year. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was a positive $100 million through the first 3 quarters of 2011. 
Page 16 details capital spending. Year-to-date, total capital at DTE is up about 20%, or $180 million from the prior year. Capital at Edison is higher, reflecting an increase in both environmental spending and the acceleration of Wind Projects in Michigan. As we discussed on our call last quarter, we have accelerated the timing of our wind investments in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million for the full year, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Since renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with a pre-existing surcharge, the new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates while still maintaining our balance sheet targets.
At MichCon, both operational expansion capital is up this year, while non-utility capital is down due to the 2010 equity contribution from Millennium, as their pipeline went into service. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment into a renewable portfolio for Detroit Edison. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

And it's pretty common to have infrastructure-related trackers for gas LDCs and that's something we're very interested in at MichCon, which would allow us even to stay out of rate cases even further. But for the most part of Detroit Edison, I think what you're going to get to overtime is that it's going to be assets placed in service is going to be the primary issue that we'll be covering often in these rate cases and that's pretty routine for us.

And before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements. 
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Comptroller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, who's our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me that I can call on during the Q&A period.
This morning, we'll cover the third quarter results and the final order we recently received in the Detroit Edison rate case. We'll be at EEI next week, and we'll take the opportunity there to update you on our long-term plan, including an early outlook of 2012 operating earnings. We'll provide updates on the growth story at the 2 utilities, as well as Power & Industrial's REF business line and Gas Storage and Pipelines' Bluestone Project.
Additionally, we'll provide an update on how we will finance our growth plans over the next several years. Gerry and I will be at EEI Monday, so the focus on this call will be on the quarter and 2011. 
Let me start on Slide 5. We have a disciplined growth plan that will provide 5% to 6% long-term earnings growth per share, which when combined with our attractive dividend, provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is always set around one of our north stars, which is maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
But utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments including a long-term cast-iron main replacement plan and a program to move gas meters outside of customers' homes. In Michigan, we are supported by both the 2008 comprehensive energy legislation and a very constructive regulatory structure. And we see it as our responsibility to earn this favorable construct every single day. We utilize continuous improvement capabilities to ensure our utilities are as efficient as possible, and that, at the same time, we're minimizing rate increases to our customers. This intense focus on continuous improvement has resulted in O&M cost, which in absolute terms, are lower than 2005 levels. That means over the last 6 years, we've offset over $325 million of inflation. This has enabled both of our utilities during their authorized returns, and at the same time, we've improved operational metrics throughout the company by holding down rate increases to customers. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses as well, particularly on the empowered industrial projects in the Gas Storage and Pipelines. And as I mentioned, we'll take you through our long-term growth plans at the EEI Financial Conference on Monday and Tuesday.
On the next couple of pages, I'll provide an overview of the quarterly results, the rate order and also an update on our guidance. So turning to Slide 6, are the highlights from our third quarter. We continue to have a good year and turned in another solid quarter. DTE Energy had operating earnings of $1.07 per share compared to $0.96 in the third quarter of last year. The key quarter-over-quarter drivers include lower earnings at Detroit Edison due to higher plant O&M spend in the quarter. Power & Industrial had one-time non-repeating items last year in the third quarter, so earnings this year are lower. Our Midstream business continues to provide solid earnings, and Energy Trading earnings are up sharply driven by ongoing improved economic performance.
With 3 quarters of the year behind us and the final rate order at Edison now completed, we're confident in tightening our operating earnings guidance for the year to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, from $3.40 to $3.70 per share, moving the midpoint up $0.05. And I have a page on the guidance coming up that we could take you through. 
The balance sheet remains strong, and we will hit all of our goals for the year. Also we just recently renewed our $1.8 billion credit line, taking them out 5 years with a nice reduction in fees. And we have received the final order at Detroit Edison, which I will now cover on the next page which is Slide 7. 
But first let me set the context for the Detroit Edison rate order. The comprehensive energy legislation, which was passed in 2008, had features that were negotiated among all key stakeholders. This included the renewable energy and energy efficiency plans, the skewing of business rates for business customers and a 12-month rate case cycle with 6 months self-implementation of rates. Over the last few years, there were several tracking mechanisms added to our regulatory framework, including a bad debt tracker, the storm and restoration tracker and an electric choice tracker. What probably wasn't contemplated was the complexity of how to deal with multiple tracking mechanisms being modified or eliminated during a period of self-implementation. This is further complicated this year by a separate depreciation case at Detroit Edison, which was finalized in June. The good news from a complexity standpoint is that almost all the trackers have been removed. But the bad debt, the storm restoration and choice trackers were eliminated. But we still retain a modified revenue decoupling mechanism at Detroit Edison. The Detroit Edison will be a simpler story going forward, although we do have a couple of reconciliation cases to work our way through. And then as a reminder, at MichCon, we still have a bad debt tracker and the decoupling mechanism there also. 
In the Detroit Edison case, the intersection of the trackers, self-implementation and the depreciation case add a complexity and we had one item that we asked the MPSC to relook at this week, and we really appreciate the commission resolving this in a timely manner. It was related to the accounting treatment of the impact of change and depreciation rates during the self-implementation period. There are some other technical issues in the case that we will pursue in a rehearing process and we'll file for that rehearing in the next several weeks. Beyond that, it was a constructive order and we look forward to working with the existing commissioners and the new Chairman. 
On page 8, there's an update on our 2011 operating earnings guidance. Overall, we're tightening our earnings per share range by bringing up the lower end of the range by $0.10 and increasing the midpoint $0.05 to $3.60. The lower range for Detroit Edison incorporates the partial year 50 basis points reduction in the authorized return on equity for that utility. We now expect unconventional gas to have a tiny loss for the year as we continue to prove up the oil reserves in the Marble Falls and prepare those assets for monetization. Energy Trading, as I previously noted, is having a very solid economic performance year-to-date, giving us the confidence to move their range closer to historical earning levels. The revised guidance is $593 million to $628 million, with the midpoint of $3.60 per share. 
Now let me pass it over to Peter Oleksiak, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."

For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.07. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.92, and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss in the third quarter, came in at $0.06 loss. 
The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.27. The drivers for the non-utility second quarter results were Energy Trading at $0.13, Gas, Storage and Pipelines at $0.08, Power & Industrial Projects at $0.07 and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, corporate & other had a loss of $0.06 in the quarter. 
Let's move on to Slide 11 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Our operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are up $20 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was $157 million, down $8 million from the prior year. I'll cover more details on Detroit Edison in a moment. As noted earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss for the seasonal gas utility business. MichCon had a non-operating loss of $11 million, down $5 million from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by a true-up of the final rate order in 2010 and lower storage revenues in 2011. Our non-utility segments are up $23 million in total, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment, partially offset by lower earnings at our Power & Industrial projects. Energy Trading is up $34 million in 2011, coming off a loss of $12 million in the third quarter of 2010. The improvement is driven by a favorable economic performance and the benefit of accounting timing. As Dave mentioned in his update on earnings guidance, the trading company is essentially back at historical levels of income with a strong third quarter performance. For your reference, we provided our standard year-to-date economic to accountings earnings walk for the segment in the appendix, which shows the improved economic earnings in 2011 versus 2010. 
Another driver in the quarter-over-quarter performance is the Power & Industrial Projects segment, which was down $14 million in the quarter, which is primarily resulting from non-repeating earnings last year from the steel industry fuel's tax credit. 
Lastly, corporate & other was up $10 million from last year primarily to lower interest in 2011. We expect attributable ability reverse in the fourth quarter with the timing of tax-related expense.
Page 12 shows an earning loss for Detroit Edison. Again, the company produced operating earnings of $157 million for the quarter, a decrease of $8 million from the prior year. We experienced a $1 million improvement in margin driven by self-implementation rates recorded in the third quarter, offset by the revenue true-up recorded as a result of the October final order. 
Even though electric utilities decoupled, we closely monitor sales levels and the underlying economy for our region. Overall, temperature-normalized service area load was up just over 0.50% in the quarter and close to 1% up year to date. Industrial load is up another 2% year-to-date, temperature-normalized driven primarily by the automotive sector. As a note, we had a very hot summer with a lot of storm activity as did much of the country. Edison's revenue decoupling mechanism and restoration tracker neutralized those impacts from hitting the bottom line. The primary change in earnings for the quarter is an increase in the timing of plan, maintenance and O&M expense within our generation fleet. We are still on track to achieve our O&M plans for the year.
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter, and I'll turn the discussion over to the Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. For the first 9 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full-year goals,",402,"Thanks, Peter. As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. For the first 9 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full-year goals, and in fact, are nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 14 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year well within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we have completed our 2011 funding requirements, including a $200 million contribution into our pension plan earlier this year. As we've said all along, we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong, especially as Dave mentioned with the recent 5-year extension of our $1.8 billion of credit facilities. 
Page 15 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow in the first 3 quarters of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.5 billion was on par with a strong internal cash seen last year. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was a positive $100 million through the first 3 quarters of 2011. 
Page 16 details capital spending. Year-to-date, total capital at DTE is up about 20%, or $180 million from the prior year. Capital at Edison is higher, reflecting an increase in both environmental spending and the acceleration of Wind Projects in Michigan. As we discussed on our call last quarter, we have accelerated the timing of our wind investments in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million for the full year, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Since renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with a pre-existing surcharge, the new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates while still maintaining our balance sheet target.
At MichCon, both operational and expansion capital is up this year, while non-utility capital is down due to the 2010 equity contribution from Millennium, as that pipeline went into service. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment in the  renewable portfolio for Detroit Edison. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

And it's pretty common to have infrastructure-related trackers for gas LDCs and that's something we're very interested in at MichCon, which would allow us even to stay out of rate cases even further. But for the most part at Detroit Edison, I think what you're going to get to over time is it's going to be assets placed in service is going to be the primary issue that we'll be covering off in these rate cases and that's pretty routine for us.

And before we get started, I encourage you to read the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2, including the reference to forward-looking statements. 
With me this morning are Peter Oleksiak, our Vice President and Comptroller; Nick Khouri, our Vice President and Treasurer; and Mark Rolling, who's our Director of Investor Relations. I also have members of the management team with me that I can call on during the Q&A period.
This morning, we'll cover the third quarter results and the final order we recently received in the Detroit Edison rate case. We'll be at EEI next week, and we'll take the opportunity there to update you on our long-term plan, including an early outlook of 2012 operating earnings. We'll provide updates on the growth story at the 2 utilities, as well as Power & Industrial's REF business line and Gas Storage and Pipelines' Bluestone Project.
Additionally, we'll provide an update on how we will finance our growth plans over the next several years. Gerry and I will be at EEI Monday, so the focus on this call will be on the quarter and 2011. 
Let me start on Slide 5. We have a disciplined growth plan that will provide 5% to 6% long-term earnings growth per share, which when combined with our attractive dividend, provides a 9% to 10% total shareholder return. And all of this is always set around one of our north stars, which is maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
But utilities have robust growth plans. At Detroit Edison, the growth is driven primarily by mandated environmental controls and renewable energy. While at MichCon, the growth is driven by infrastructure investments including a long-term cast-iron main replacement plan and a program to move gas meters outside of customers' homes. In Michigan, we are supported by both the 2008 comprehensive energy legislation and a very constructive regulatory structure. And we see it as our responsibility to earn this favorable construct every single day. We utilize continuous improvement capabilities to ensure our utilities are as efficient as possible, and that, at the same time, we're minimizing rate increases to our customers. This intense focus on continuous improvement has resulted in O&M cost, which in absolute terms, are lower than 2005 levels. That means over the last 6 years, we've offset over $325 million of inflation. This has enabled both of our utilities during their authorized returns, and at the same time, we've improved operational metrics throughout the company by holding down rate increases to customers. 
We continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our non-utility businesses as well, particularly on the empowered industrial projects in the Gas Storage and Pipelines. And as I mentioned, we'll take you through our long-term growth plans at the EEI Financial Conference on Monday and Tuesday.
On the next couple of pages, I'll provide an overview of the quarterly results, the rate order and also an update on our guidance. So turning to Slide 6, are the highlights from our third quarter. We continue to have a good year and turned in another solid quarter. DTE Energy had operating earnings of $1.07 per share compared to $0.96 in the third quarter of last year. The key quarter-over-quarter drivers include lower earnings at Detroit Edison due to higher plant O&M spend in the quarter. Power & Industrial had one-time non-repeating items last year in the third quarter, so earnings this year are lower. Our Midstream business continues to provide solid earnings, and Energy Trading earnings are up sharply driven by ongoing improved economic performance.
With 3 quarters of the year behind us and the final rate order at Edison now completed, we're confident in tightening our operating earnings guidance for the year to $3.50 to $3.70 per share, from $3.40 to $3.70 per share, moving the midpoint up $0.05. And I have a page on the guidance coming up that we could take you through. 
The balance sheet remains strong, and we will hit all of our goals for the year. Also we just recently renewed our $1.8 billion credit line, taking them out 5 years with a nice reduction in fees. And we have received the final order at Detroit Edison, which I will now cover on the next page which is Slide 7. 
But first let me set the context for the Detroit Edison rate order. The comprehensive energy legislation, which was passed in 2008, had features that were negotiated among all key stakeholders. This included the renewable energy and energy efficiency plans, the skewing of business rates for business customers and a 12-month rate case cycle with 6 months self-implementation of rates. Over the last few years, there were several tracking mechanisms added to our regulatory framework, including a bad debt tracker, the storm and restoration tracker and an electric choice tracker. What probably wasn't contemplated was the complexity of how to deal with multiple tracking mechanisms being modified or eliminated during a period of self-implementation. This is further complicated this year by a separate depreciation case at Detroit Edison, which was finalized in June. The good news from a complexity standpoint is that almost all the trackers have been removed. But the bad debt, the storm restoration and choice trackers were eliminated. But we still retain a modified revenue decoupling mechanism at Detroit Edison. The Detroit Edison will be a simpler story going forward, although we do have a couple of reconciliation cases to work our way through. And then as a reminder, at MichCon, we still have a bad debt tracker and the decoupling mechanism there also. 
In the Detroit Edison case, the intersection of the trackers, self-implementation and the depreciation case add a complexity and we had one item that we asked the MPSC to relook at this week, and we really appreciate the commission resolving this in a timely manner. It was related to the accounting treatment of the impact of change and depreciation rates during the self-implementation period. There are some other technical issues in the case that we will pursue in a rehearing process and we'll file for that rehearing in the next several weeks. Beyond that, it was a constructive order and we look forward to working with the existing commissioners and the new Chairman. 
On page 8, there's an update on our 2011 operating earnings guidance. Overall, we're tightening our earnings per share range by bringing up the lower end of the range by $0.10 and increasing the midpoint $0.05 to $3.60. The lower range for Detroit Edison incorporates the partial year 50 basis points reduction in the authorized return on equity for that utility. We now expect unconventional gas to have a tiny loss for the year as we continue to prove up the oil reserves in the Marble Falls and prepare those assets for monetization. Energy Trading, as I previously noted, is having a very solid economic performance year-to-date, giving us the confidence to move their range closer to historical earning levels. The revised guidance is $593 million to $628 million, with the midpoint of $3.60 per share. 
Now let me pass it over to Peter Oleksiak, who will take you through some additional details on the quarter."
266598,141957466,185840,"DTE Energy Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","DTE Energy Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 10 and third quarter earnings results. For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.07. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained i",621,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with Slide 10 and third quarter earnings results. 
For the quarter, DTE's operating earnings per share was $1.07. I'd like to remind everyone that a reconciliation to GAAP reported earnings is contained in the appendix. Detroit Edison contributed $0.92, and MichCon, which typically incurs an operating loss in the third quarter, came in at $0.06 loss. 
The non-utility segments combined to earn $0.27. The drivers for the non-utility second quarter results were Energy Trading at $0.13, Gas, Storage and Pipelines at $0.08, Power & Industrial Projects at $0.07 and Unconventional Gas Production at $0.01 loss. Finally, corporate & other had a loss of $0.06 in the quarter. 
Let's move on to Slide 11 and a summary of the quarter-over-quarter performance by segment. Our operating earnings for consolidated DTE Energy are up $20 million for the quarter. Detroit Edison's operating earnings was $157 million, down $8 million from the prior year. I'll cover more details on Detroit Edison in a moment. As noted earlier, the third quarter is typically a loss for the seasonal gas utility business. MichCon had a non-operating loss of $11 million, down $5 million from the prior year. The decrease in earnings was driven by a true-up of the final rate order in 2010 and lower storage revenues in 2011. Our non-utility segments are up $23 million in total, primarily driven by our Energy Trading segment, partially offset by lower earnings at our Power & Industrial projects. Energy Trading is up $34 million in 2011, coming off a loss of $12 million in the third quarter of 2010. The improvement is driven by a favorable economic performance and the benefit of accounting timing. As Dave mentioned in his update on earnings guidance, the trading company is essentially back at historical levels of income with a strong third quarter performance. For your reference, we provided our standard year-to-date economic to accountings earnings walk for the segment in the appendix, which shows the improved economic earnings in 2011 versus 2010. 
Another driver in the quarter-over-quarter performance is the Power & Industrial Projects segment, which was down $14 million in the quarter, which is primarily resulting from non-repeating earnings last year from the steel industry fuel's tax credit. 
Lastly, corporate & other was up $10 million from last year primarily to lower interest in 2011. We expect attributable ability reverse in the fourth quarter with the timing of tax-related expense.
Page 12 shows an earning loss for Detroit Edison. Again, the company produced operating earnings of $157 million for the quarter, a decrease of $8 million from the prior year. We experienced a $1 million improvement in margin driven by self-implementation rates recorded in the third quarter, offset by the revenue true-up recorded as a result of the October final order. 
Even though electric utilities decoupled, we closely monitor sales levels and the underlying economy for our region. Overall, temperature-normalized service area load was up just over 0.50% in the quarter and close to 1% up year to date. Industrial load is up another 2% year-to-date, temperature-normalized driven primarily by the automotive sector. As a note, we had a very hot summer with a lot of storm activity as did much of the country. Edison's revenue decoupling mechanism and restoration tracker neutralized those impacts from hitting the bottom line. The primary change in earnings for the quarter is an increase in the timing of plan, maintenance and O&M expense within our generation fleet. We are still on track to achieve our O&M plans for the year.
That concludes an update on the earnings for the quarter, and I'll turn the discussion over to the Nick Khouri, who will cover cash flow and capital expenditures."

As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. For the first 9 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full-year goals,",402,"Thanks, Peter. As always, improved cash flow and balance sheet strength remains a key priority for management and Board of Directors. For the first 9 months of this year, DTE Energy's cash and balance sheet metrics are on track to hit our full-year goals, and in fact, are nearly equal to the historically strong year we saw in 2010. 
Page 14 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. We expect to end this year well within our targeted leverage and cash flow ranges. In addition, we have completed our 2011 funding requirements, including a $200 million contribution into our pension plan earlier this year. As we've said all along, we do not foresee the need for new equity in 2011. Liquidity remains strong, especially as Dave mentioned with the recent 5-year extension of our $1.8 billion of credit facilities. 
Page 15 provides an overview of DTE's cash flow in the first 3 quarters of this year versus the same period last year. Cash from operations at $1.5 billion was on par with a strong internal cash seen last year. As expected, capital is up compared to last year, which I will detail in a minute. All told, net cash after dividends was a positive $100 million through the first 3 quarters of 2011. 
Page 16 details capital spending. Year-to-date, total capital at DTE is up about 20%, or $180 million from the prior year. Capital at Edison is higher, reflecting an increase in both environmental spending and the acceleration of Wind Projects in Michigan. As we discussed on our call last quarter, we have accelerated the timing of our wind investments in Michigan. Renewable capital in 2011 is now projected at $350 million for the full year, up from the original guidance of $50 million. Since renewable investments at Detroit Edison are funded with a pre-existing surcharge, the new capital can be supported without an increase in customer rates while still maintaining our balance sheet target.
At MichCon, both operational and expansion capital is up this year, while non-utility capital is down due to the 2010 equity contribution from Millennium, as that pipeline went into service. 
In summary, DTE's cash and balance sheet targets are on track, with year-to-date actuals nearing the historically strong year we saw in 2010, allowing us to accelerate our investment in the  renewable portfolio for Detroit Edison. Now let me turn it back over to Dave to wrap up."

Our sense, first of all, as I mentioned, that our rate proceedings will become much simpler with the removal of many of these trackers. And our general approach and philosophy is to stay out of rate cases as long as possible. As you know, we're very sensitive to the impact of rate increases on our customers, so we do everything we can do including ongoing continuous improvement to stay out of rate cases. That said, we are going to be looking for example at the Gas business, with what you see across the country is the majority of what's happening on rates there is related to infrastructure investments. And it's pretty common to have infrastructure-related trackers for gas LDCs and that's something we're very interested in at MichCon, which would allow us even to stay out of rate cases even further. But for the most part at Detroit Edison, I think what you're going to get to over time is it's going to be assets placed in service is going to be the primary issue that we'll be covering off in these rate cases and that's pretty routine for us. We don't have disallowances, and as you know, most of the capital here is mandated capital."
