As you all know, this tax season started off very slow across the industry. Millions of taxpayers were unable to file their returns prior to February 14 due to IRS delays and process of service forms. As a",761,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. As you all know, this tax season started off very slow across the industry. Millions of taxpayers were unable to file their returns prior to February 14 due to IRS delays and process of service forms. 
As a result, the first peak of tax season shifted well into February. We estimate total tax filings at the IRS through February 28 were down about 2%, and believe we gained share both in the retail and online markets. 
By year end, we estimate total filings at the IRS will be about flat to last year due to sustain high levels of unemployment. We are now more than halfway through the tax season, and I'm very pleased with our performance and execution today.
As you recall, I articulated my top priorities heading into this tax season which at this than the significant early-seasoned client losses we experienced in each of the last two seasons.
Then on December 23, we lost our access to the important RAL product, and as we began the 2011 tax season, we faced the marketplace for our competitors who were aggressively advertising their RAL availability to our disadvantage. 
Despite that challenge, the growth initiatives that we have implemented had proved to be effective and our execution is improved considerably.
As Phil will explain in more detail, our pre-federal 1040 EZ offer and a new and more compelling marketing messages served to drive more traffic into our offices.
For existing clients our attention to the brand and client satisfaction scores have improved over last year. Our level of new H&R Block client growth is the largest we've seen in at least six years. 
In retail total returns prepared through February 28, it was 3.2% from last year. 
With respect to our Digital business, which Jason will discuss in more detail, we fulfilled our preseason promise is over via our website, which has improved navigation and ease of use. We've leveraged our free offer to drive new clients and have improved our overall digital conversion rates.
These actions have been effective through February 28, as we have had nearly 30% growth in total digital returns prepared, including growth of more than 30% in the strategic board of online category.
As expected, the decline in our retail net average charged, or NAC, has improved by 19 basis points since February 15. Year-to-date, through February 28, the NAC declined by 7%, primarily due to the success of our free federal 1040 EZ offer. Also contributing to the NAC Reduction for February was the loss of some form 1048 clients due to the lack of a RAL product.
Excluding our 1040 EZ product from both years, our NAC actually increased by nearly 3%. As we entered into the second half of the season, we should see continued and gradual improvement in the NAC as we serve clients with more complexity, and due to the discontinuation of our EZ promotion which ended February 28.
However, primarily due to the strong success of the EZ promotion, we expect the full-year decline in the NAC of 2% to four percentage points. And the EZ promotion with a targeted initiative, which we were able to do because of our financial strength, our scale and our ability to aggressively message this offer.  We firmly believe this program will provide a pipeline of new filers to the H&R Block brand for future years, allowing us to monetize these clients as they transition to more complex returns.
With the first half of the season now behind us, our focus turns to execution in the second half of the season. To date, I am very pleased with our focused execution, effective marketing and the exceptional service our tax professionals and support staff have provided our clients.
However, we have still have the declines like to serve and we are committed to finishing strong to further improve our market share and better position ourselves for the 2012 tax season. 
For fiscal 2011, we believe our total retail returns prepared will increase approximately 50 to 150 basis points compared to the prior year.
Before I conclude, I'd like to briefly comment on our pending acquisition of TaxACT. The transaction remains under regulatory review, and we have provided additional information as requested by the Department of Justice. 
The closing date is not yet finalized but will occur as soon as regulatory approvals are received. Both parties recently agreed to extend the transaction date from April 30 to May 31.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Phil."

I'll use the next part of the call to accomplish three things: Briefly remind you of the challenges we face entering the season, review the commitments we made to address these challenges and discuss the progress we made in executing against those commitments. Our progress with which we were quite pleased today.
On the December call, we Reviewed several challenges that we faced moving into the season. They were steep, and they became steeper, as we move closer to the season start. They included: First, the press economic circumstances that impact our clients, especially our early-season client disproportionately; second, negative momentum from two prior years of substantial first-half client law losses, which significantly reduced pool clients from which we could retain; third, former pen and paper filers have increasingly chosen individual space over the assisted retail space, which is impacting the pool of new clients available to our Retail business; and fourth and finally, threads our Refund Anticipation Loan business from a challenging regulatory environment. 
While without the scenario of our competitors have RAL that we do not with one possible outcome, we thought this is a worst-case scenario as we know now, that scenario did in fact materialized.
On the December call, we stated clearly, that our strong brand, our superior retail presence, our banking capabilities and most importantly, our rigorously-trained and service-minded tax professionals, all constituted assets we can leverage, and that those asset tapas optimistic regarding the future of our Retail business despite the many challenges we face.
With then shared our plans to improve both our Retention fundamentals and our short-term new client growth trends. I will now take a few minutes review the progress we have made against these plans.
On the retention front, we built on our prior year's work and focused on upgrading our front desk presidents and personnel, moving our clients to our higher performing tax professionals, and improving our contact center experience to better serve clients during remote touch points. We continue to see strong progress in service delivery from these and other initiatives. Our retention is up over a point from prior year despite our inability to offer RALs. Our overall client satisfaction as inclined, up nearly two points to date.
Virtually, all satisfaction measures, including friendly greeting, Cared About Me, confidence in tax professional knowledge and intent to refer have risen nicely. Our contact center in particular that is to show strong issue resolution and satisfaction gains.
Our client quality programs and social media programs have worked to boost our client retention efforts as well, and of course, as service improves, more clients recommend us to their friends, which brings us to our new client discussion.
In December, we highlighted two reasons that we need to address the new client growth area a very aggressively. We needed to reverse several years of new client declines and as referred to earlier, we need to fill the gap left by a declining base of clients available to retain in the first half. We detailed five drivers, including: First, changes to our Emerald Advance program, making it available to new and prior clients; second, a new free 1040 EZ tax professional sampling program; third, our early-season settlement product approach; and fourth, a new national marketing campaign; and fifth, our competitive conversion program.
Overall, our new client growth programs have delivered above expectations. Through February 28, we served 25% more new clients than we did last year. As Alan mentioned, this is the highest level of new client growth we've seen in at least six years.
Our Emerald Advance preseason line of credit program exceeded our client growth expectations, as we approved more clients than originally anticipated. We do have higher bad debt associated with this program that originally found however, and Jeff will cover this briefly later in the call.
Our free 1040 EZ tax professional deadly program has vividly exceeded our client growth expectations. We're delighted that hundreds of thousands of new clients in the younger demographic came in to sample the best tax professionals in the country. Given our strong satisfaction scores, we also have confidence that we will see many of them return in future years for more complex tax preparation as well.
Retention of these clients will be the longer-term determinant of this program's success, as our research indicates that within two years, 55% of these clients will file a more complex tax return. This program did drive our net ever charged down in the first half. However, this is more of a function of program volume success than it is our ability to monetize the program. In fact, our monetization plans for this program were in line with expectations.
We'll recall that our product situation was not certain at the time of our last call. We committed to you though that we would use our strengths to compete aggressively in the early-season and that whatever our offering, you can expect us to use our scale to promote our product more aggressively than we did in the prior year.
Despite these obstacles, we delivered on that commitment. Despite severe obstacles, excuse me. After disappointing and late regulatory outcomes, we relied heavily on our different payment RAC product as our early-season driver. 
Our execution, our strong early season marketing message and our strong tax professional languages came through in a big way, and we held on to more several product lines and most of us thought possible back in December. Additionally, our Emerald Card offering is held up very nicely despite our RAL situation, highlighting its consumer appeal.
Now a quick word about our advertising. As Alan, we could not be more pleased of our advertising program this year. We ask taxpayers to never settle for less with the best tax professionals in the industry and they are responding. 
Our marketing team and agency developed a fantastic campaign. That campaign did not held consumers about our equities, demonstrated it come at them as it is our expertise, second overview experiences. And that proved and continues through very powerful. 
Our campaign also helped to drive our Free EZ professional sampling program and our RAC program as previously mentioned. And finally, our tax professional support is campaign as it highlights the expertise and client focus, we believe that this campaign has long-term staying power.
Finally, we continue to believe that rising regulatory associated cost and the RAL situation will accelerate consolidation of this fragmented industry. We have accelerated our efforts this year to capitalize on this trend, converting more than 100,000 returns from competitors the RAL facing H&R Block returns this year.
To summarize, we are very pleased with our efforts to improve retention and new client growth. The strength of our brand continues to draw our clients seeking industry's best service and professionals.
Before I conclude though, I'd like to briefly review our net average charge, or NAC. You will recall from our December calls, that we expect the material change our overall year end NAC, but also mention a number of factors that impacted. In the first half, three factors compounded to reduce our NAC. 
And I would say these are, in order of importance, from least to most: In IRS associated forms only issued that impacted the time it which clients 12 more complex and higher value returns, the loss of some RAL clients whose returns typically contain credits that can make them relatively complex, and third, a more successful tax professional sampling program than we anticipated.
So I'd like to address each factor. A more complex and higher value business continues to recover post the delay, and we expect complete or near compete recovery by year end. We do not anticipate recovering all of our RAL related returns of course but we held that impact intact in the early-season. 
In fact, last year, we retained 65% of RAL clients. And this year, we retained 63% of RAL clients, and we're quite pleased with that results given our situation.
We do not expect to make up the full NAC production at our free EZ tax professional program drove. However, we see this stronger than anticipated promotional success as a positive for our current year and our future, and is certainly not a negative as it constitutes a revenue neutral, and very low cost client-acquisition vehicle.
Keep in mind, looking forward, that we faced none of these NAC challenges in the second half within our current plans.
In conclusion, we implement an aggressive growth plan in the first half of the season. That plan and our service initiatives, which continued to drive up retention and helped us overcome an even late field and then some.
Our field, marketing and support teams and our franchisees have begun executing our second half initiatives, which focused primarily on inviting clients and to sample the expertise of our tax professionals, with second look as our proof point. Early indications in our second half program supported by our national ad campaign and local marketing efforts, indicate continued momentum.
Both our second books and return conversion rates are well ahead of last year, giving us increased confidence heading into the remainder of the season. I have portion of the work with exceptional team members across our company-owned franchise network, all of whom have helped drive performance and the challenging environment. We remain pleased with our progress, focused on second half performance and service fundamentals and optimistic on our ability to grow this business in the future.
I will now turn the call over to Jason."

As we entered the season, our focus was to outpace the industry growth in online, an area we continue to believe is the primary digital battleground. year-to-date, we've grown 30% in online, and based on these results is our believe we have taken share in the online category.
Within online, we've seen particularly strong demand for our products from new clients, with an increase of 49%. Even with the influx of new clients, we see modest improvement in product monetization, strong demand for our financial products. With online RACs, or what we call Simple Pay units up 28%.
In software, category we believe will continue to slowly decline, we are effectively flat, with some of these units have come through additional distribution in the low-cost retailer. This was widely a continued focus on winning in online, an area we view as a more open-playing field.
Our results this year are a direct outcome from execution around the promises we made for improvement in the following areas: Marketing, to redesign of our website, and simplification of our online product that improvement and client conversion. 
First, in marketing, our goal was to increase brand awareness of the H&R Block At Home products, using attention grabbing advertising, coupled with a clear style for free caller action to drive customer acquisition and trial.
We also used our advertising to highlight an added feature to all of our products, including our free product, the ability to get worry-free audit support for all customers. Offering this service free to all customers is unique to H&R Block, and represents an offering only a combined retail and software business can deliver profitably. 
The feedback from our customers and year-over-year traffic growth of 29% indicate early success for these marketing messages.
This year, we were able to better capitalize on this web traffic growth, leveraging our newly redesigned website to turn visitors into customers in the form of registered online users and retail appointments. We not only updated the look to better represent our brand, we also simplified the experience to get customer started in the online product, as well as giving retail clients a clear path to making an appointment.
So far this year, retail appointments made from the website are up 92%, a number that not only represents material volume growth, it also represents improved visit to appointment conversion.
Finally, we improved some key sections of our online product to ensure that once we've landed a registered client, we turn this client into a completed return. As a result, product conversion rates are up for both new and prior clients. Clearly, the combination of our website and product improvement shows in our early results.
Other key quality measures also demonstrate these changes have resonated with clients, with client retention up for new and prior online clients, as well as client satisfaction scores, up 3% in both online and software. I am truly pleased to report this strong execution, demonstrate the ability for our brand resonate and deliver results without coming at the expense of our core retail tax business.

276601,127503146,109335,"H&R Block, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 09, 2011",2011-03-09,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jason. Let me begin by providing a recap of our third quarter results. Today, we reported a $0.01 per share loss from continuing operations. Our current quarter results were not comparable to the prior period due to the number of unusual items. An",832,"Thanks, Jason. Let me begin by providing a recap of our third quarter results. Today, we reported a $0.01 per share loss from continuing operations. Our current quarter results were not comparable to the prior period due to the number of unusual items. And adjusting for those items, we reported per share earnings for the quarter of $0.14, compared with per share earnings last year of $0.16.
Let me briefly outline the adjustments. Each period included asset impairments principally related to goodwill of our business services segment last year and related to our red year business unit this quarter. The current quarter impairment totaled approximately $14 million after tax, or about $0.04 per share.
As expected, we have experienced some client loss related to early-season settlement product clients. Those clients frequently took advantage of the tax event as a convenient opportunity to pay down outstanding balances under an Emerald line of credit. As a result, we expect to incur higher credit losses this year, and our third quarter loss has exceeded last year by an estimated $13 million after tax, or $0.04 per share.
Outstanding loan balances at the end of February remained higher than historical levels, and we will continue to monitor fourth quarter collections and update credit loss assumptions at April 30.
As you know, the IRS was not able to accept certain electronically-filed tax returns, primarily involving delay prior to February 14. And we deferred revenue at January 31 of $19.7 million relating to completed returns which could not be refiled.  This revenue was recognized in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Finally, we also increased legal reserves within our Tax Services segment this quarter, and the increase reduced earnings by about $0.03 per share.
In addition to the revenue deferral, the IRS filing delay impacted current quarter results through changes in taxpayer filing patterns and an extending of our first peek while into the month of February. This isn't merely a timing difference, and as you can see from today's announcement, volumes in February have been strong.
One final thought on how changes in our settlement product offerings this year will impact full-year results. For the full year, we expect to settlement products revenues to decline by about $20 million, compared with aggregate revenues last year. This revenue decrease is almost entirely due to a decline in aggregate units and not related to the significant pricing differences between products.
In addition, cost of terminating the HSBC contract, including contractual payments we have historically received in our fiscal fourth quarter, will adversely impact full-year per share earnings by about $0.04.
Turning to our mortgage loan portfolio. Mortgage loans held by our bank continued to wind down, and the net principal balance of mortgage loans decreased by about $24 million during the quarter to just over $500 million.
Our allowance for loan losses was $88 million at quarter end, or nearly 15% of outstanding principal compared to $97 million, or 13% a year ago.
A shrinking loan portfolio in moderation of delinquency and loss rates has resulted in reduced loss provisions this year, and year-to-date losses have fallen $12 million compared with the same period last year.
We saw no significant changes in rep and warranty claim activity during the quarter. Sand Canyon entered the quarter with open claims that were asserted in the first and second quarters but have not yet been reviewed in the principal amount of $121 million.
In addition, new claims for alleged breaches in the principal amount of $33 million were received during the third quarter. Substantially all of these claims were reviewed during the quarter, and incurred losses were only $4.3 million.  We ended the quarter with open claims of $14 million. 
As expected, payments of approximately $25 million were made during the quarter for previously reserved losses under an April 2008 indemnification agreement. And all remaining obligations under this agreement totaling $24 million were paid in our fourth quarter. 
As a reminder from last quarter's call, this agreement was previously entered into with a single specific counter-party in exchange for a full and complete release of that party's ability to assert rep and warranty claims.
At quarter end, Sand Canyon's rep and warranty reserve was $155 million, and the reserve included both the remaining $24 million payable under the indemnification arrangement, and also included $131 million for future probable losses on an asserted claims.
Claim activity and associated losses continue to remain within reserve expectations. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity positions remained strong as we enter our most profitable quarter. We ended the third quarter with nearly $1.5 billion of cash and over $800 million of equity. With the absence of RAL related short-term borrowings, our short-term debt decreased by more than $1 billion versus last year, to $1.7 billion.
Short-term borrowings which peaked at just over $700 million in February were fully repaid in March. And at January 31, 305 million shares were outstanding.
And now, I'll turn the call back to Alan."

After losing our RAL product in the 11 our, we entered this season at a meaningful competitive disadvantage. As a result, many people externally expected us to report significant early-season client and market share losses. Certainly, the loss of RALs have impacted our year in a number of ways. 
As Jeff pointed out, it triggered the red year goodwill impairment charge that we incurred this quarter. It also caused our traditional RAL customers to migrate to competitors where we often lost higher revenue from more complex forms.
This client loss will also cost us six there is higher than anticipated bad debt on our Emerald line of credit products. But our organization is executing consistently to our business plan with excellence.
Our organizational alignment to distinct P&Ls, the leadership of our business presidents, and the recasting of individual short-term incentives to more controllable and impactful business drivers has resulted in market share gains at both retail and digital at this interim point.
The realignment of the marketing function into the retail tax business has ensured that our product and pricing plans are developed in complete coordination with our advertising and marketing, and our advertising is driving new client growth.
Our early market share success is heavily driven by simplifying our activities and focusing in executing on fewer, more impactful metrics, in your operating the business to tighter. Our organization is improving execution everyday. 
I am increasingly optimistic about our future. Headwinds can become the tailwinds. Total IRS returns to increase in coming years as employment levels improve. A level financial product marketplace should provide some revenue list to H&R Block just due to more traditional mix of tax forms.
Our 1040EZ client pipeline gives us a strong customer base to build from, as these of filers migrate to more complex returns. 
Our strong balance sheet, our brand name and significant second half expertise client market share are all positive differentiators. But the most important asset we must continue to demonstrate in any market scenario is our ability to execute. 
So as we turn our attention to the second half of this year, we must continue to demonstrate our ability to execute with our more complex tax clients, where we have historically retained at a higher level.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us to finish tax season 2011 strongly, and improve our overall market position as we head into tax season 2012. Kirsten, we're now ready to take questions."

I don't think the business model, without financial products works for everybody. So what I would say is that we see a level playing field, terrific advantages for us going forward. I think a natural lift to our NAC on a level playing field as we get more of a normalized mix of say, 1040, and credit type forms that we lost some share on this year.

But the things that I focus on this, this is a fairly simple business and it's very hard to get it right. So I think that the most important element of the success here is having clear accountability and responsibility within your operating model. So you cannot share jobs. When I came here in July, we had three retail presidents.  Now we have one, and we had very clear responsibility and accountability to that. We have -- When I came, we had -- our bank was run by someone were ported to the CFO. Our Digital business was run by somebody who report it to IT. We moved marketing under retail. We've changed incentives to make the incentives controllable, specific, measurable, actionable. We have clear P&L visibility with each of the P&L owners, and the costs roll under them, they're more direct, they're less attributable, they're activity-based. So when you have that kind of a business model, then you start have accountability, you start have execution and the measurement that allows you to self-correct. So it sounds like a lot of words, but it's a model that works, and it's working now. We have people in the field that know exactly what the responsibilities are, exactly how they are measured and they are performing very, very well."

I think it's important to note that even though our NACs down, the NAC without EZ is out. And to that we're not discounting across the board for volume. We are selectively targeting certain segments of the market place and leveraging our brand and our marketing expertise to drive incremental units and tax returns and clients that will be part of this franchise in years to come. So I think that it has been a very worrisome year with respect to the environmental and timing delays. But I'm very, very pleased with where we are at right now."

So we've gone from -- we had 16 million retail customers. And when I came back, we had 14 million. So when we've began to put our plans together, the key when you get into kind of a customer spiral like that, we have 71%, 72% retention, it's very difficult to stop client losses in one-year. But that's what we're trying to do. We said we're going to stop the client losses in one year. Now at that point, remember, we didn't have had RALs. We thought you had RAL and of course we had our countries and give up to the business plan around our acquisitions. So we leveraged our Emerald products in the early market, we had our 1040EZ promotion, which we're going to run through the February 15, and then our next big idea which is our single promotion, which is going to be for the second half of the year. And we set our goals and objectives and made our changes to our business model that I articulated before. Then, we lost RALs. So really had -- to your question really is the value proposition between volume and price. So we're trying to make the point here through the narrative that we didn't want discount it across-the-board. We looked at the conditions of the market, and we break them into nine different segments and we said, we're under-indexed, where's our growth opportunity for the future? What are the forms that people use of early in their careers? How fast are door those favorable forms convert more public forms? And we made a strategic approach towards owning the early market and surgeon forums to build our pipeline of customers in future years. These are generally younger people, they're generally people 18 to 24 years old, they're generally not married. They don't own houses yet but they're beginning their careers, they're beginning to work, and they're heavily sometimes -- they can be digital customers. We view this as people who migrate to 1048 and then 40 very quickly with their life spectrum. So the value proposition again, we know we were going to have RAL been. We lost 1048 that have impacted the pricing NAC in a way that we hasn't participated at the beginning of the year, anticipated at the beginning of the year. But this was a targeted approach that worked, and we felt that the more it worked and the more volume we've got, the more pressure on NAC but the more successful in program would be. And that's kind of where we are right now. So as a look at this, looking back, I would say that it was just what we needed at the exact right time, and we've executed it just like we wanted. The key, I think, that has been brought up before, I think Michael brought it up a minute ago, is how to retain these customers, how do they progress through the complexity of the forms over the life? That will measure the success of this program. That's why I kind of like our business model. At the fact that we've got the right people and the right shares with the right incentives to make that happen over the next few years."

276601,127503146,109456,"H&R Block, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 09, 2011",2011-03-09,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. As you all know, this tax season started off very slow across the industry. Millions of taxpayers were unable to file their returns prior to February 14 due to IRS delays in processing certain forms.  As a r",758,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. As you all know, this tax season started off very slow across the industry. Millions of taxpayers were unable to file their returns prior to February 14 due to IRS delays in processing certain forms.  As a result, the first peak of tax season shifted well into February. We estimate total tax filings at the IRS through February 28 were down about 2%, and believe we've gained share both in the retail and online markets. By year end, we estimate total filings at the IRS will be about flat to last year due to sustain high levels of unemployment. We are now more than halfway through the tax season, and I'm very pleased with our performance and execution to date.  
As you recall, I articulated my top priority heading into this tax season which at this than the significant early season client losses we experienced in each of the last two seasons.  Then on December 23, we lost our access to the important RAL product. And as we began the 2011 tax season, we faced the marketplace where our competitors were aggressively advertising their RAL availability to our disadvantage. 
Despite that challenge, the growth initiatives that we implemented had proved to be effective and our execution is improved considerably.  As Phil will explain in more detail, our free federal 1040 EZ offer and a new and more compelling marketing message served to drive more traffic into our offices.  For existing clients, our retention to the brand and client satisfaction scores have improved over last year. Our level of new H&R Block client growth is the largest we've seen in at least six years. 
In Retail, total returns prepared through February 28, grew 3.2% from last year. 
With respect to our Digital business, as Jason will discuss in more detail, we fulfilled our pre-season promise is over via our website, which has improved navigation and ease of use. We've leveraged our free offer to drive new clients and have improved our overall digital conversion rates.  These actions have been effective through February 28, as we have had nearly 13% growth in total digital returns prepared, including growth of more than 30% in the strategically important online category.
As expected, the decline in our retail net average charge, or NAC, has improved by 90 basis points since February 15. Year-to-date, through February 28, the NAC declined by 7%, primarily due to the success of our free federal 1040 EZ offer. Also contributing to the NAC reduction through February was the loss of some Form 1048 clients due to the lack of a RAL product.
Excluding our 1040 EZ products from both years, our NAC actually increased by nearly 3%. As we enter into the second half of the season, we should see continued and gradual improvement in the NAC as we serve clients with more complexity, and due to the discontinuation of our EZ promotion which ended February 28.
However, primarily due to the strong success of the EZ promotion, we expect the full-year decline in the NAC of two to four percentage points. The EZ promotion with a targeted initiative, which we were able to do because of our financial strength, our scale and our ability to aggressively message this offer.  We firmly believe this program will provide a pipeline of new filers to the H&R Block brand for future years, allowing us to monetize these clients as they transition to more complex returns.
With the first half of the season now behind us, our focus turns to execution in the second half of the season. To date, I am very pleased with our focused execution, effective marketing and the exceptional service our tax professionals and support staff have provided our clients.  However, we still have millions of clients left to serve and we are committed to finishing strong to further improve our market share and better position ourselves for the 2012 tax season.  For fiscal 2011, we believe our total retail returns prepared will increase approximately 50 to 150 basis points compared to the prior year.
Before I conclude, I'd like to briefly comment on our pending acquisition of TaxACT. The transaction remains under regulatory review, and we have provided additional information as requested by the Department of Justice.  The closing date is not yet finalized, but will occur as soon as regulatory approvals are received. Both parties recently agreed to extend the transaction date from April 30 to May 31.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Phil."

I'll use the next part of the call to accomplish three things: Briefly remind you of the challenges we face entering the season, review the commitments we made to address these challenges and discuss the progress we ma",1605,"Thank you, Alan, and good afternoon. I'll use the next part of the call to accomplish three things: Briefly remind you of the challenges we face entering the season, review the commitments we made to address these challenges and discuss the progress we made in executing against those commitments; a progress with which we were quite pleased today.
On the December call, we reviewed several challenges that we faced moving into the season. They were steep, and they became steeper as we move closer to the season start. They included: First, depressed economic circumstances that impacted our clients, especially our early-season client disproportionately; second, negative momentum from two prior years of substantial first half client law losses, which significantly reduced the pool of clients from which we could retain; third, former pen-and-paper filers have increasingly chosen individual the digital space over the assisted retail space, which has impacted the pool of new clients available to our Retail business; and fourth and finally, threats our Refund Anticipation Loan business from a challenging regulatory environment. 
While we thought the scenario of our competitors have RALs and we do not was one possible outcome, we saw this is a worst case scenario. As we know now, that scenario did, in fact, materialized. On the December call, we stated clearly that our strong brand, our superior retail presence, our banking capabilities and most importantly, our rigorously-trained and service-minded tax professionals, all constituted assets we could leverage, and that those asset kept us optimistic regarding the future of our Retail business despite the many challenges we face.  We then shared our plans to improve both our retention fundamentals and our short-term new client growth trends. I will now take a few minutes review the progress we have made against these plans.
On the retention front, we built on our prior year's work and focused on upgrading our front desk presence and personnel, moving our clients to our higher performing tax professionals, and improving our contact center experience to better serve clients during remote touch points. We continue to see strong progress in service delivery from these and other initiatives. Our retention is up over a point from prior year despite our inability to offer RALs. Our overall client satisfaction has again climbed, up nearly two points to date.
Virtually all satisfaction measures, including friendly greeting, Cared About Me, confidence in tax professional's knowledge and intent to refer have risen nicely. Our contact center in particular continues to show strong issue resolution and satisfaction gains.  Our client calling programs and social media programs have worked to boost our client retention efforts as well. And, of course, as service improves, more clients recommend us to their friends, which brings us to our new client discussion.
In December, we highlighted two reasons that we need to address the new client growth area very aggressively. We needed to reverse several years of new client declines, and as referred to earlier, we need to fill a gap left by a declining base of clients available to retain in the first half. We detailed five drivers, including: First, changes to our Emerald Advance program, making it available to new and prior clients; second, a new free 1040 EZ tax professional sampling program; third, our early-season settlement product approach; and fourth, a new national marketing campaign; and fifth, our competitive conversion program.
Overall, our new client growth programs have delivered above expectations. Through February 28, we served 25% more new clients than we did last year. As Alan mentioned, this is the highest level of new client growth we've seen in at least six years.
Our Emerald Advance pre-season line of credit program exceeded our client growth expectations, as we approved more clients than originally anticipated. We do have higher bad debt associated with this program than originally planned however, and Jeff will cover this briefly later in the call.
Our free 1040 EZ tax professional sampling program has significantly exceeded our client growth expectations. We're delighted that hundreds of thousands of new clients in a younger demographic came in to sample the best trained tax professionals in the country. Given our strong satisfaction scores, we also have confidence that we will see many of them return in future years for more complex tax preparation as well.
Retention of these clients will be the longer term determinant of this program's success, as our research indicates that within two years, 55% of these clients will file a more complex tax return. This program did drive our net average charge down in the first half. However, this is more of a function of program volume success than it is our ability to monetize the program. In fact, our monetization plans for this program were in line with expectations.
You will recall that our settlement product situation was not certain at the time of our last call. We committed to you, though, that we would use our strengths to compete aggressively in the early season and that whatever our offering, you can expect us to use our scale to promote our product more aggressively than we did in the prior year. 
Despite these obstacles, we delivered on that commitment. Despite severe obstacles, excuse me. After disappointing and late regulatory outcomes, we relied heavily on our deferred payment RAC product as our early-season driver. 
Our execution, a strong early season marketing message and our strong tax professional client relationships came through in a big way, and we held on to more settlement product clients than most would have thought possible back in December. Additionally, our Emerald Card offering has held up very nicely despite our RAL situation, highlighting its consumer appeal.
Now a quick word about our advertising. As Alan mentioned, we could not be more pleased with our advertising program this year. We ask taxpayers to never settle for less with the best tax professionals in the industry, and they're responding.  Our marketing team and agency developed a fantastic campaign. That campaign did not tell consumers about our expertise; it demonstrated it, it demonstrated our expertise with real-life Second Look review experiences. And that proved and continues to prove very powerful.  Our campaign also helped drive our free EZ professional sampling program and our RAC program as previously mentioned. And finally, our tax professionals support this campaign as it highlights their expertise and client focus. We believe that this campaign has long-term staying power.
Finally, we continue to believe that rising regulatory associated costs and the RAL situation will accelerate consolidation of this fragmented industry. We have accelerated our efforts this year to capitalize on this trend, converting more than 100,000 returns from competitors for H&R Block returns this year.
To summarize, we are very pleased with our efforts to improve retention and new client growth. The strength of our brand continues to draw our clients seeking the industry's best service and professionals.
Before I conclude, though, I'd like to briefly review our net average charge or NAC. You will recall from our December calls, that we expected no material change to our overall year end NAC, but also mentioned a number of factors could impact it. In the first half, three factors compounded to reduce our NAC.  And I would say these are, in order of importance, from least to most: An IRS associated forms only issued that impacted the timing in which clients filed more complex and higher value returns; the loss of some RAL clients whose returns typically contain credits that can make them relatively complex; and third, a more successful tax professional sampling program than we anticipated.
So I'd like to address each factor. A more complex and higher value business continues to recover post the delay, and we expect complete or near compete recovery by year end. We do not anticipate recovering all of our RAL-related returns, of course, but we held this impact in check in the early-season.  In fact, last year, we retained 65% of RAL clients. This year, we retained 63% of RAL clients, and we're quite pleased with that result given our situation.
We do not expect to make up the full NAC reduction that our free EZ tax professional program drove. However, we see this stronger than anticipated promotional success as a positive for our current year and our future, and certainly not a negative as it constitutes a revenue neutral, and very low cost client-acquisition vehicle.  Keep in mind, looking forward, that we face none of these NAC challenges in the second half within our current plans.
In conclusion, we implemented an aggressive growth plan in the first half of the season. That plan and our service initiatives, which continued to drive up retention and helped us overcome an uneven playing field and then some.  Our field, marketing and support teams and our franchisees have begun executing our second half initiatives, which focused primarily on inviting clients in to sample the expertise of our tax professionals, with Second Look as our proof point. Early indications on our second half program supported by our national ad campaign and local marketing efforts, indicate continued momentum.  Both our Second Looks and return conversion rates are well ahead of last year, giving us increased confidence heading into the remainder of the season. I am fortunate to work with exceptional team members across our company-owned and franchise network, all of whom have helped drive performance in a challenging environment. We remain pleased with our progress, focused on second half performance and service fundamentals and optimistic on our ability to grow this business in the future.
I will now turn the call over to Jason."

As we enter this season, our focus was to outpace the industry growth in online, an area we continue to believe is the primary digital battleground. Year-to-date, we've grown 30% in non-FFA online, and based on these results is our believe we have taken share in the online category.
Within online, we've seen particularly strong demand for our products from new clients, with an increase of 49%. Even with the influx of new clients, we see modest improvements in product monetization and strong demand for our financial products, with online RACs, or what we call Simple Pay units, up 28%.
In software, a category we believe will continue to slowly decline, we are effectively flat, with some of these units have come through additional distribution in the low-cost retailer. This is why we continue to focus on winning in online, an area we view as a more open playing field.
Our results this year are a direct outcome from execution around the promises we made for improvement in the following areas: Marketing, the redesign of our website, and simplification of our online product to drive improvement and client conversion. 
First, in marketing, our goal was to increase brand awareness of the H&R Block At Home products, using attention-grabbing advertising, coupled with a clear File For Free call to action to drive customer acquisition and trial.  We also used our advertising to highlight an added feature to all of our products, including our free product, the ability to get worry-free audit support for all customers. Offering this service free to all customers is unique to H&R Block, and represents an offering only a combined retail and software business can deliver profitably. The feedback from our customers and year-over-year traffic growth of 29% indicate early success for these marketing messages.
This year, we were able to better capitalize on this web traffic growth, leveraging our newly redesigned website to turn visitors into customers in the form of registered online users and retail appointments. We not only updated the look to better represent our brand, we also simplified the experience to get customers started in the online product, as well as giving retail clients a clear path to making an appointment.  So far this year, retail appointments made from the website are up 92%, a number that not only represents material volume growth, it also represents improved visit-to-appointment conversion.
Finally, we improved some key sections of our online product to ensure once we landed a registered client, we turn this client into a completed return. As a result, product conversion rates are up for both new and prior clients. Clearly, the combination of our website and product improvement shows in our early results.
Other key quality measures also demonstrate these changes have resonated with clients, with client retention up for new and prior online clients, as well as client satisfaction scores, up 3% in both online and software. I am truly pleased to report this strong execution, demonstrate the ability for our brand to resonate and deliver results without coming at the expense of our core retail tax business.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Brown."
276601,127503146,109456,"H&R Block, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 09, 2011",2011-03-09,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jason. Let me begin by providing a recap of our third quarter results. Today, we reported a $0.01 per share loss from continuing operations. Our current quarter results were not comparable to the prior period due to the number of unusual items. An",829,"Thanks, Jason. Let me begin by providing a recap of our third quarter results. Today, we reported a $0.01 per share loss from continuing operations. Our current quarter results were not comparable to the prior period due to the number of unusual items. And adjusting for those items, we reported per share earnings for the quarter of $0.14, compared with per share earnings last year of $0.16.
Let me briefly outline the adjustments. Each period included asset impairments principally related to goodwill of our business services segment last year and related to our RedGear business unit this quarter. The current quarter impairment totaled approximately $14 million after tax, or about $0.04 per share.
As expected, we have experienced some client loss related to early-season settlement product clients. Those clients frequently took advantage of the tax event as a convenient opportunity to pay down outstanding balances under an Emerald line of credit. As a result, we expect to incur higher credit losses this year, and our third quarter loss has exceeded last year by an estimated $13 million after tax, or $0.04 per share.
Outstanding loan balances at the end of February remained higher than historical levels, and we will continue to monitor fourth quarter collections and update credit loss assumptions at April 30.
As you know, the IRS was not able to accept certain electronically-filed tax returns, primarily involving Schedule A prior to February 14. And we deferred revenue at January 31 of $19.7 million relating to completed returns which could not be e-filed.  This revenue was recognized in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Finally, we also increased legal reserves within our Tax Services segment this quarter, and the increase reduced earnings by about $0.03 per share.
In addition to the revenue deferral, the IRS filing delay impacted current quarter results through changes in taxpayer filing patterns and an extending of our first peek well into the month of February. This is merely a timing difference, and as you can see from today's announcement, volumes in February have been strong.
One final thought on how changes in our settlement product offerings this year will impact full-year results. For the full year, we expect settlement products revenues to decline by about $20 million, compared with aggregate revenues last year. This revenue decrease is almost entirely due to a decline in aggregate units and not related to significant pricing differences between products.
In addition, costs of terminating the HSBC contract, including contractual payments we have historically received in our fiscal fourth quarter, will adversely impact full year per share earnings by about $0.04.
Turning to our mortgage loan portfolio. Mortgage loans held by our bank continue to wind down, and the net principal balance of mortgage loans decreased by about $24 million during the quarter to just over $500 million.  Our allowance for loan losses was $88 million at quarter end, or nearly 15% of outstanding principal, compared to $97 million, or 13%, a year ago.
A shrinking loan portfolio in moderation of delinquency and loss rates has resulted in reduced loss provisions this year, and year-to-date losses have fallen $12 million compared with the same period last year.
We saw no significant changes in rep and warranty claim activity during the quarter. Sand Canyon entered the quarter with open claims that were asserted in the first and second quarters, but had not yet been reviewed in the principal amount of $121 million.  In addition, new claims for alleged breaches in the principal amount of $33 million were received during the third quarter. Substantially all of these claims were reviewed during the quarter, and incurred losses were only $4.3 million.  We ended the quarter with open claims of $14 million. 
As expected, payments of approximately $25 million were made during the quarter for previously reserved losses under an April 2008 indemnification agreement. And all remaining obligations under this agreement, totaling $24 million, were paid in our fourth quarter.  As a reminder from last quarter's call, this agreement was previously entered into with a single specific counter-party in exchange for a full and complete release of that party's ability to assert rep and warranty claims.
At quarter end, Sand Canyon's rep and warranty reserve was $155 million, and the reserve included both the remaining $24 million payable under the indemnification arrangement, and also included $131 million for future probable losses on unasserted claims.  Claim activity and associated losses continue to remain within reserved expectations. 
Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong as we enter our most profitable quarter. We ended the third quarter with nearly $1.5 billion of cash and over $800 million in equity. With the absence of RAL-related short-term borrowings, our short-term debt decreased by more than $1 billion versus last year, to $1.7 billion.
Short-term borrowings which peaked at just over $700 million in February were fully repaid in March. And at January 31, 305 million shares were outstanding.
And now, I'll turn the call back to Alan."

After losing our RAL product in the 11th hour, we entered this season at a meaningful competitive disadvantage. As a result, many people externally expected us to report significant early-season client and market share losses. Certainly, the loss of RALs has impacted our year in a number of ways.  As Jeff pointed out, it triggered the RedGear goodwill impairment charge that we incurred this quarter. It also caused our traditional RAL customers to migrate to competitors where we often lost higher revenue from more complex forms.  This client loss also cost us to experience higher than anticipated bad debts on our Emerald line of credit product. But our organization is executing consistently to our business plan with excellence.  Our organizational alignment to distinct P&Ls, the leadership of our business presidents, and the recasting of individual short-term incentives to more controllable and impactful business drivers has resulted in market share gains at both retail and digital at this interim point.  The realignment of the marketing function into the Retail Tax business has ensured that our product and pricing plans are developed in complete coordination with our advertising and marketing. And our advertising is driving new client growth.  Our early market share success is heavily driven by simplifying our activities and focusing in executing on fewer, more impactful metrics, and we're operating the business to tighter tolerances. Our organization is improving in execution everyday. 
I am increasingly optimistic about our future. Headwinds can become the tailwinds. Total IRS returns should increase in coming years as employment levels improve. A level, financial product marketplace should provide some revenue page for H&R Block just due to more traditional mix of tax forms. Our 1040EZ client pipeline gives us a strong customer base to build from, as these filers migrate to more complex returns.  Our strong balance sheet, our brand name and significant second half expertise client market share are all positive differentiators. But the most important asset we must continue to demonstrate in any market scenario is our ability to execute.  So as we turn our attention to the second half of this year, we must continue to demonstrate our ability to execute with our more complex tax clients, whom we have historically retained at a higher level.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us to finish tax season 2011 strongly, and improve our overall market position as we head into tax season 2012. Kristen, we're now ready to take questions."

But I think as we look at this, we are a tax provider, we think we're the best provider. People that look like us don't have the second half like we have. I think that we've proven this year that our brand is really a strong brand. We see, I think, as financial products change going forward, there's a likely scenario of people that drop out, people that consolidate. I don't think the business model, without financial products works for everybody. So what I would say is that we see, in a level playing field, terrific advantages for us going forward. I think a natural lift to our NAC on a level playing field as we get more of a normalized mix of state, 1040, and earn income credit type forms that we lost some share on this year. But I think the model doesn't work for everybody. I think the consolidation will be good for us. Change is good for us."

They're more direct. They're less attributable. They're activity based.

And I'm just glad that we put the program -- we didn't change any programs when the RAL was lost. We kept the programs we had. We stayed focused. We didn't jump around and overreact to this. I think it's important to note that even though our NAC's down, the NAC without the EZ is out. And to that we're not discounting across the board for volume. We're selectively targeting certain segments of the marketplace and leveraging our brand and our marketing expertise to drive incremental units and tax returns and clients and visits that will be part of this franchise in years to come. So I think that this has been a very worrisome year with respect to environmental and timing delays. But I'm very, very pleased with where we are right now."

So we've gone from -- when I left here in '08, we had 16 million retail customers. And when I came back, we had 14 million. So when we began to put our plans together, the key -- when you get into kind of a customer spiral like that, we have 71%, 72% retention, it's very difficult to stop client losses in one year. But that's what we're trying-ed to do. We said we're going to stop the client losses in one year. Now at that point, remember, we didn't know we didn't have RALs. We thought we still had RALs and, of course, we had our RACs. And we developed a business plan around client acquisitions. So we leveraged our Emerald products in the early market. We had our 1040EZ promotion, which we were going to run through the February 15. And then our next big idea was our Second Look promotion, which was going to be for the second half of the year. And we set our goals and objectives and made the changes to our business model that I articulated before. Then we lost RALs. So we really had -- so your question really is the value proposition between volume and price. So we're trying to make the point here through the narrative that we didn't want discount it across the board. We looked at the segmentations of the market, and we break them into nine different segments, and we said, ""Where are we underindexed? Where's our growth opportunity for the future? What are the forms that people use early in their careers? How fast do those simple forms convert to more complex forms?"" And we made a strategic approach towards owning the early market and certain forums to build our pipeline of customers in future years. These are generally younger people. They're generally people 18 to 24 years old. They're generally not married. They generally don't own houses yet, but they're beginning their careers. They're beginning to work, and they're heavily sometimes -- they can be digital customers. We view this as people who would migrate to 1040As and then 1040s very quickly with their life spectrum. So the value proposition again, we didn't know we weren't going to have RALs then. We lost some 1040As that have impacted the pricing NAC in a way that we hadn't anticipated at the beginning of the year. But this was a targeted approach that worked. And we felt that the more it worked and the more volume we got, the more pressure on NAC but the more successful the program would be. And that's kind of where we are right now. So as I look at this, looking back, I would say that it was just what we needed at the exact right time, and we've executed it just like we wanted to. The key, I think, that has been brought up before, I think Michael brought it up a minute ago, is how to retain these customers, how do they progress through the complexity of the forms over life? That will measure the success of this program. That's why I kind of like our business model. I like the fact that we've got the right people in the right chairs with the right incentives to make this happen over the next few years."

As you all know, this tax season started off very slow across the industry. Millions of taxpayers were unable to file their returns prior to February 14 due to IRS delays in processing certain forms.  As a r",758,"Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. As you all know, this tax season started off very slow across the industry. Millions of taxpayers were unable to file their returns prior to February 14 due to IRS delays in processing certain forms.  As a result, the first peak of tax season shifted well into February. We estimate total tax filings at the IRS through February 28 were down about 2%, and believe we've gained share both in the retail and online markets. By year end, we estimate total filings at the IRS will be about flat to last year due to sustain high levels of unemployment. We are now more than halfway through the tax season, and I'm very pleased with our performance and execution to date.  
As you recall, I articulated my top priority heading into this tax season was to stem the significant early season client losses we experienced in each of the last two seasons.  Then on December 23, we lost our access to the important RAL product. And as we began the 2011 tax season, we faced the marketplace where our competitors were aggressively advertising their RAL availability to our disadvantage. 
Despite that challenge, the growth initiatives that we implemented had proved to be effective and our execution is improved considerably.  As Phil will explain in more detail, our free federal 1040 EZ offer and a new and more compelling marketing message served to drive more traffic into our offices.  For existing clients, our retention to the brand and client satisfaction scores have improved over last year. Our level of new H&R Block client growth is the largest we've seen in at least six years. 
In Retail, total returns prepared through February 28, grew 3.2% from last year. 
With respect to our Digital business, as Jason will discuss in more detail, we fulfilled our pre-season promise is simplify our website, which has improved navigation and ease of use. We've leveraged our free offer to drive new clients and have improved our overall digital conversion rates.  These actions have been effective through February 28, as we have had nearly 13% growth in total digital returns prepared, including growth of more than 30% in the strategically important online category.
As expected, the decline in our retail net average charge, or NAC, has improved by 90 basis points since February 15. Year-to-date, through February 28, the NAC declined by 7%, primarily due to the success of our free federal 1040 EZ offer. Also contributing to the NAC reduction through February was the loss of some Form 1040A clients due to the lack of a RAL product.
Excluding our 1040 EZ products from both years, our NAC actually increased by nearly 3%. As we enter into the second half of the season, we should see continued and gradual improvement in the NAC as we serve clients with more complexity, and due to the discontinuation of our EZ promotion which ended February 28.
However, primarily due to the strong success of the EZ promotion, we expect a full-year decline in the NAC of two to four percentage points. The EZ promotion was a targeted initiative, which we were able to do because of our financial strength, our scale and our ability to aggressively message this offer.  We firmly believe this program will provide a pipeline of new filers to the H&R Block brand for future years, allowing us to monetize these clients as they transition to more complex returns.
With the first half of the season now behind us, our focus turns to execution in the second half of the season. To date, I am very pleased with our focused execution, effective marketing and the exceptional service our tax professionals and support staff have provided our clients.  However, we still have millions of clients left to serve and we are committed to finishing strong to further improve our market share and better position ourselves for the 2012 tax season.  For fiscal 2011, we believe our total retail returns prepared will increase approximately 50 basis points to 150 basis points compared to the prior year.
Before I conclude, I'd like to briefly comment on our pending acquisition of TaxACT. The transaction remains under regulatory review, and we have provided additional information as requested by the Department of Justice.  The closing date is not yet finalized, but will occur as soon as regulatory approvals are received. Both parties recently agreed to extend the transaction date from April 30 to May 31.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Phil."

I'll use the next part of the call to accomplish three things: Briefly remind you of the challenges we face entering the season, review the commitments we made to address these challenges and discuss the progress we ma",1605,"Thank you, Alan, and good afternoon. I'll use the next part of the call to accomplish three things: Briefly remind you of the challenges we face entering the season, review the commitments we made to address these challenges and discuss the progress we made in executing against those commitments; progress with which we were quite pleased to date.
On the December call, we reviewed several challenges that we faced moving into the season. They were steep, and they became steeper as we moved closer to the season start. They included: First, depressed economic circumstances that impacted our clients, especially our early-season client disproportionately; second, negative momentum from two prior years of substantial first half client losses, which significantly reduced the pool of clients from which we could retain; third, former pen-and-paper filers have increasingly chosen the digital space over the assisted retail space, which has impacted the pool of new clients available to our Retail business; and fourth and finally, threats to our Refund Anticipation Loan business from a challenging regulatory environment. 
While we thought the scenario of our competitors have RALs and we do not was one possible outcome, we saw this is a worst case scenario. As we know now, that scenario did, in fact, materialize. On the December call, we stated clearly that our strong brand, our superior retail presence, our banking capabilities and most importantly, our rigorously-trained and service-minded tax professionals, all constituted assets we could leverage, and that those assets kept us optimistic regarding the future of our Retail business despite the many challenges we faced.  We then shared our plans to improve both our retention fundamentals and our short-term new client growth trends. I will now take a few minutes to review the progress we have made against these plans.
On the retention front, we built on our prior year's work and focused on upgrading our front desk presence and personnel, moving our clients to our higher performing tax professionals, and improving our contact center experience to better serve clients during remote touch points. We continue to see strong progress in service delivery from these and other initiatives. Our retention is up over a point from prior year despite our inability to offer RALs. Our overall client satisfaction has again climbed, up nearly two points to date.
Virtually all satisfaction measures, including friendly greeting, Cared About Me, confidence in tax professional's knowledge and intent to refer have risen nicely. Our contact center in particular continues to show strong issue resolution and satisfaction gains.  Our client calling programs and social media programs have worked to boost our client retention efforts as well. And, of course, as service improves, more clients recommend us to their friends, which brings us to our new client discussion.
In December, we highlighted two reasons that we need to address the new client growth area very aggressively. We needed to reverse several years of new client declines, and as referred to earlier, we need to fill a gap left by a declining base of clients available to retain in the first half. We detailed five drivers, including: First, changes to our Emerald Advance program, making it available to new and prior clients; second, a new free 1040 EZ tax professional sampling program; third, our early-season settlement product approach; and fourth, a new national marketing campaign; and fifth, our competitive conversion program.
Overall, our new client growth programs have delivered above expectations. Through February 28, we served 25% more new clients than we did last year. As Alan mentioned, this is the highest level of new client growth we've seen in at least six years.
Our Emerald Advance pre-season line of credit program exceeded our client growth expectations, as we approved more clients than originally anticipated. We do have higher bad debt associated with this program than originally planned, however, and Jeff will cover this briefly later in the call.
Our free 1040 EZ tax professional sampling program has significantly exceeded our client growth expectations. We're delighted that hundreds of thousands of new clients in a younger demographic came in to sample the best trained tax professionals in the country. Given our strong satisfaction scores, we also have confidence that we will see many of them return in future years for more complex tax preparation as well.
Retention of these clients will be the longer term determinant of this program's success, as our research indicates that within two years, 55% of these clients will file a more complex tax return. This program did drive our net average charge down in the first half. However, this is more of a function of program volume success than it is our ability to monetize the program. In fact, our monetization plans for this program were in line with expectations.
You will recall that our settlement product situation was not certain at the time of our last call. We committed to you, though, that we would use our strengths to compete aggressively in the early season and that whatever our offering, you can expect us to use our scale to promote our product more aggressively than we did in the prior year. 
Despite these obstacles, we delivered on that commitment. Despite severe obstacles, excuse me. After disappointing and late regulatory outcomes, we relied heavily on our deferred payment RAC product as our early-season driver. 
Our execution, a strong early season marketing message and our strong tax professional client relationships came through in a big way, and we held on to more settlement product clients than most would have thought possible back in December. Additionally, our Emerald Card offering has held up very nicely despite our RAL situation, highlighting its consumer appeal.
Now a quick word about our advertising. As Alan mentioned, we could not be more pleased with our advertising program this year. We asked taxpayers to never settle for less than the best tax professionals in the industry, and they're responding.  Our marketing team and agency developed a fantastic campaign. That campaign did not tell consumers about our expertise; it demonstrated it, it demonstrated our expertise with real-life Second Look review experiences. And that proved and continues to prove very powerful.  Our campaign also helped drive our free EZ professional sampling program and our RAC program as previously mentioned. And finally, our tax professionals support this campaign as it highlights their expertise and client focus. We believe that this campaign has long-term staying power.
Finally, we continue to believe that rising regulatory associated costs and the RAL situation will accelerate consolidation of this fragmented industry. We have accelerated our efforts this year to capitalize on this trend, converting more than 100,000 returns from competitors to H&R Block returns this year.
To summarize, we are very pleased with our efforts to improve retention and new client growth. The strength of our brand continues to draw clients seeking the industry's best service and professionals.
Before I conclude, though, I'd like to briefly review our net average charge or NAC. You will recall from our December call, that we expected no material change to our overall year end NAC, but also mentioned a number of factors could impact it. In the first half, three factors compounded to reduce our NAC.  And I would say these are, in order of importance, from least to most: An IRS associated forms delay issue that impacted the timing in which clients filed more complex and higher value returns; the loss of some RAL clients whose returns typically contain credits that can make them relatively complex; and third, a more successful tax professional sampling program than we anticipated.
So I'd like to address each factor. A more complex and higher value business continues to recover post the delay, and we expect complete or near compete recovery by year end. We do not anticipate recovering all of our RAL-related returns, of course, but we held this impact in check in the early-season.  In fact, last year, we retained 65% of RAL clients. This year, we retained 63% of RAL clients, and we're quite pleased with that result given our situation.
We do not expect to make up the full NAC reduction that our free EZ tax professional program drove. However, we see this stronger than anticipated promotional success as a positive for our current year and our future, and certainly not a negative as it constitutes a near revenue neutral, and very low cost client-acquisition vehicle.  Keep in mind, looking forward, that we face none of these NAC challenges in the second half within our current plans.
In conclusion, we implemented an aggressive growth plan in the first half of the season. That plan and our service initiatives, which continue to drive up retention and help us overcome an uneven playing field and then some.  Our field, marketing and support teams and our franchisees have begun executing our second half initiatives, which focus primarily on inviting clients in to sample the expertise of our tax professionals, with Second Look as our proof point. Early indications on our second half program supported by our national ad campaign and local marketing efforts, indicate continued momentum.  Both our Second Looks and return conversion rates are well ahead of last year, giving us increased confidence heading into the remainder of the season. I am fortunate to work with exceptional team members across our company-owned and franchise network, all of whom have helped drive performance in a challenging environment. We remain pleased with our progress, focused on second half performance and service fundamentals and optimistic on our ability to grow this business in the future.
I will now turn the call over to Jason."

As we enter this season, our focus was to outpace the industry growth in online, an area we continue to believe is the primary digital battleground. Year-to-date, we've grown 30% in non-FFA online, and based on these results, it is our belief we have taken share in the online category.
Within online, we've seen particularly strong demand for our products from new clients, with an increase of 49%. Even with the influx of new clients, we see modest improvements in product monetization and strong demand for our financial products, with online RACs, or what we call Simple Pay units, up 28%.
In software, a category we believe will continue to slowly decline, we are effectively flat, but some of these units have come through additional distribution in a low-cost retailer. This is why we continue to focus on winning in online, an area we view as a more open playing field.
Our results this year are a direct outcome from execution around the promises we made for improvement in the following areas: Marketing, the redesign of our website, and simplification of our online product to drive improvement and client conversion. 
First, in marketing, our goal was to increase brand awareness of the H&R Block At Home products, using attention-grabbing advertising, coupled with a clear File For Free call to action to drive customer acquisition and trial.  We also used our advertising to highlight an added feature to all of our products, including our free product, the ability to get worry-free audit support for all customers. Offering this service free to all customers is unique to H&R Block, and represents an offering only a combined retail and software business can deliver profitably. The feedback from our customers and year-over-year web traffic growth of 29% indicate early success for these marketing messages.
This year, we were able to better capitalize on this web traffic growth, leveraging our newly redesigned website to turn visitors into customers in the form of registered online users and retail appointments. We not only updated the look to better represent our brand, we also simplified the experience to get customers started in the online product, as well as giving retail clients a clear path to making an appointment. So far this year, retail appointments made from the website are up 92%, a number that not only represents material volume growth, it also represents improved visit-to-appointment conversion.
Finally, we improved some key sections of our online product to ensure once we landed a registered client, we turn this client into a completed return. As a result, product conversion rates are up for both new and prior clients. Clearly, the combination of our website and product improvement shows in our early results.
Other key quality measures also demonstrate these changes have resonated with clients, with client retention up for new and prior online clients, as well as client satisfaction scores up 3% in both online and software. I am truly pleased to report this strong execution, demonstrate the ability for our brand to resonate and deliver results without coming at the expense of our core retail tax business.
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Brown."
276601,127503146,110014,"H&R Block, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Mar 09, 2011",2011-03-09,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jason. Let me begin by providing a recap of our third quarter results. Today, we reported a $0.01 per share loss from continuing operations. Our current quarter results were not comparable to the prior period due to the number of unusual items. An",829,"Thanks, Jason. Let me begin by providing a recap of our third quarter results. Today, we reported a $0.01 per share loss from continuing operations. Our current quarter results were not comparable to the prior period due to the number of unusual items. And adjusting for those items, we reported per share earnings for the quarter of $0.14, compared with per share earnings last year of $0.16.
Let me briefly outline the adjustments. Each period included asset impairments principally related to goodwill of our business services segment last year and related to our RedGear business unit this quarter. The current quarter impairment totaled approximately $14 million after tax, or about $0.04 per share.
As expected, we have experienced some client loss related to early-season settlement product clients. Those clients frequently took advantage of the tax event as a convenient opportunity to pay down outstanding balances under an Emerald line of credit. As a result, we expect to incur higher credit losses this year, and our third quarter loss has exceeded last year by an estimated $13 million after tax, or $0.04 per share.
Outstanding loan balances at the end of February remained higher than historical levels, and we will continue to monitor fourth quarter collections and update credit loss assumptions at April 30.
As you know, the IRS was not able to accept certain electronically-filed tax returns, primarily involving Schedule A prior to February 14. And we deferred revenue at January 31 of $19.7 million relating to completed returns which could not be e-filed.  This revenue was recognized in our fiscal fourth quarter.
Finally, we also increased legal reserves within our Tax Services segment this quarter, and the increase reduced earnings by about $0.03 per share.
In addition to the revenue deferral, the IRS filing delay impacted current quarter results through changes in taxpayer filing patterns and an extending of our first peek well into the month of February. This is merely a timing difference, and as you can see from today's announcement, volumes in February have been strong.
One final thought on how changes in our settlement product offerings this year will impact full-year results. For the full year, we expect settlement products revenues to decline by about $20 million, compared with aggregate revenues last year. This revenue decrease is almost entirely due to a decline in aggregate units and not related to significant pricing differences between products.
In addition, costs of terminating the HSBC contract, including contractual payments we have historically received in our fiscal fourth quarter, will adversely impact full year per share earnings by about $0.04.
Turning to our mortgage loan portfolio. Mortgage loans held by our bank continue to wind down, and the net principal balance of mortgage loans decreased by about $24 million during the quarter to just over $500 million.  Our allowance for loan losses was $88 million at quarter end, or nearly 15% of outstanding principal, compared to $97 million, or 13%, a year ago.
A shrinking loan portfolio and moderation of delinquency and loss rates has resulted in reduced loss provisions this year, and year-to-date losses have fallen $12 million compared with the same period last year.
We saw no significant changes in rep and warranty claim activity during the quarter. Sand Canyon entered the quarter with open claims that were asserted in the first and second quarters, but had not yet been reviewed in the principal amount of $121 million.  In addition, new claims for alleged breaches in the principal amount of $33 million were received during the third quarter. Substantially all of these claims were reviewed during the quarter, and incurred losses were only $4.3 million. We ended the quarter with open claims of $14 million. 
As expected, payments of approximately $25 million were made during the quarter for previously reserved losses under an April 2008 indemnification agreement. And all remaining obligations under this agreement, totaling $24 million, were paid in our fourth quarter.  As a reminder from last quarter's call, this agreement was previously entered into with a single specific counter-party in exchange for a full and complete release of that party's ability to assert rep and warranty claims.
At quarter end, Sand Canyon's rep and warranty reserve was $155 million, and the reserve included both the remaining $24 million payable under the indemnification arrangement, and also included $131 million for future probable losses on unasserted claims.  Claim activity and associated losses continue to remain within reserved expectations. 
Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity positions remain strong as we enter our most profitable quarter. We ended the third quarter with nearly $1.5 billion of cash and over $800 million in equity. With the absence of RAL-related short-term borrowings, our short-term debt decreased by more than $1 billion versus last year, to $1.7 billion.
Short-term borrowings which peaked at just over $700 million in February were fully repaid in March. And at January 31, 305 million shares were outstanding.
And now, I'll turn the call back to Alan."

After losing our RAL product in the 11th hour, we entered this season at a meaningful competitive disadvantage. As a result, many people externally expected us to report significant early-season client and market share losses. Certainly, the loss of RALs has impacted our year in a number of ways.  As Jeff pointed out, it triggered the RedGear goodwill impairment charge that we incurred this quarter. It also caused some of our traditional RAL customers to migrate to competitors where we often lost higher revenue from more complex forms.  This client loss also caused us to experience higher than anticipated bad debts on our Emerald line of credit product. But our organization is executing consistently to our business plan with excellence.  Our organizational alignment to distinct P&Ls, the leadership of our business presidents, and the recasting of individual short-term incentives to more controllable and impactful business drivers has resulted in market share gains at both retail and digital at this interim point.  The realignment of the marketing function into the Retail Tax business has ensured that our product and pricing plans are developed in complete coordination with our advertising and marketing. And our advertising is driving new client growth.  Our early market share success is heavily driven by simplifying our activities and focusing in executing on fewer, more impactful metrics, and we're operating the business to tighter tolerances. Our organization is improving in execution every day. 
I am increasingly optimistic about our future. Headwinds can become  tailwinds. Total IRS returns should increase in coming years as employment levels improve. A level, financial product marketplace should provide some revenue lift to  H&R Block just due to a more traditional mix of tax forms. Our 1040EZ client pipeline gives us a strong customer base to build from, as these filers migrate to more complex returns.  Our strong balance sheet, our brand name and significant second half expertise client market share are all positive differentiators. But the most important asset we must continue to demonstrate in any market scenario is our ability to execute.  So as we turn our attention to the second half of this year, we must continue to demonstrate our ability to execute with our more complex tax clients, whom we have historically retained at a higher level.
We still have a lot of work ahead of us to finish tax season 2011 strongly, and improve our overall market position as we head into tax season 2012. Kristen, we're now ready to take questions."

It's hard to -- As we look at -- I think every scenario, there's a scenario that there are no financial products. There's a scenario that there are no RALs. I think there is a number of different ways this can go. I think each of them provides some challenges and everyone some benefits. But I think as we look at this, we are a tax provider, we think we're the best tax provider. People that look like us don't have the second half like we have. I think that we've proven this year that our brand is really a strong brand. We see, I think, as financial products change going forward, there's a likely scenario of people that drop out, people that consolidate. I don't think the business model, without financial products works for everybody. So what I would say is that we see, in a level playing field, terrific advantages for us going forward. I think a natural lift to our NAC on a level playing field as we get more of a normalized mix of state, 1040, and earn income credit type forms that we lost some share on this year. But I think the model doesn't work for everybody. I think the consolidation will be good for us. Change is good for us."

So when you have that kind of a business model, then you start to have accountability, you start to have execution and the measurement that allows you to self-correct. So it sounds like a lot of words, but it's a model that works, and it's working now. We have people in the field that know exactly what their responsibilities are, exactly how they are measured and they're performing very, very well."

I think it's important to note that even though our NAC's down, the NAC without the EZ is up. It shows that we're not discounting across the board for volume. We're selectively targeting certain segments of the marketplace and leveraging our brand and our marketing expertise to drive incremental units and tax returns and clients in here  that will be part of this franchise in years to come.

So we've gone from -- when I left here in '08, we had 16 million retail customers. And when I came back, we had 14 million. So when we began to put our plans together, the key -- when you get into kind of a customer spiral like that, we have 71%, 72% retention, it's very difficult to stop client losses in one year. But that's what we tried to do. We said we're going to stop the client losses in one year. Now at that point, remember, we didn't know we didn't have RALs. We thought we still had RALs and, of course, we had our RACs. And we developed a business plan around client acquisitions. So we leveraged our Emerald products in the early market. We had our 1040EZ promotion, which we were going to run through the February 15. And then our next big idea was our Second Look promotion, which was going to be for the second half of the year. And we set our goals and objectives and made the changes to our business model that I articulated before. Then we lost RALs. So we really had -- so your question really is the value proposition between volume and price. So we're trying to make the point here through the narrative that we didn't want to discount across the board. We looked at the segmentations of the market, and we break them into nine different segments, and we said, ""Where are we under indexed? Where's our growth opportunity for the future? What are the forms that people use early in their careers? How fast do those simple forms convert to more complex forms?"" And we made a strategic approach towards owning the early market and certain forums to build our pipeline of customers in future years. These are generally younger people. They're generally people 18 to 24 years old. They're generally not married. They generally don't own houses yet, but they're beginning their careers. They're beginning to work, and they're heavily sometimes -- they can be digital customers. We view this as people who would migrate to 1040As and then 1040s very quickly through their life spectrum. So the value proposition again, we didn't know we weren't going to have RALs then. We lost some 1040As that have impacted the pricing NAC in a way that we hadn't anticipated at the beginning of the year. But this was a targeted approach that worked. And we felt that the more it worked and the more volume we got, the more pressure on NAC but the more successful the program would be. And that's kind of where we are right now. So as I look at this, looking back, I would say that it was just what we needed at the exact right time, and we've executed it just like we wanted to. The key, I think, that has been brought up before, I think Michael brought it up a minute ago, is how do we retain these customers, how do they progress through the complexity of the forms over life? That will measure the success of this program. That's why I kind of like our business model. I like the fact that we've got the right people in the right chairs with the right incentives to make this happen over the next few years."

It's a pleasure to be here today on my first earnings call as H&R Block CEO.
Earlier today, we announced the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 results and I'm pleased to say that we have a lot of momentum going into fiscal 2012. Today, I'll talk a bit about that momentum. I'll also give you a sense of what I learned during my first 6 weeks on the job. Let's start with our fiscal 2011 results.
First, total returns compared worldwide were up nearly 6% to $24.5 million. In the U.S., we grew returns by 6.5%, our best growth since 2001. We estimate that industry-wide IRS filings grew by about 1%, so that we gained about 80 basis points of share in the U.S. 
In retail Tax Services, Phil and his team drove much stronger results in many as many expected. We gained more than 500,000 clients and we estimated that we gained 60 basis points of share in the assisted category. We also showed significant improvements in key leading indicators including client retention satisfaction and new client growth. So how did we grow shares?
In retail, our growth this year was led by improved execution client service and aggressive client acquisition programs, such as free federal 1040EZs and Second Looks. We also capitalize on industry-wide consolidation to convert competitive returns to H&R Block.
I'm particularly excited about the success of the free federal 1040EZ program. Introducing young filers to the benefit of assisted tax-preparation is a critical component of our long-term growth strategy.
Remember, the majority of these spiders migrate to more complex tax returns within 2 years. Thanks to the program we now have a solid pipeline of a new and younger clients and the word of mouth referral they generate.
Expect more of this kind of innovative marketing in 2012. In digital, our share gains were the result of improved marketing, the redesign of our website and product simplification. The smart advertising and a clear call to action drove customer acquisition and trial. Our website turned visitors into client and an improved product experience help clients achieve completed returns.
As a result, our client base increase by nearly 800,000, led by online growth of nearly 29%. Thanks to the fabulous work from Jason and his team, we estimated that we gained 90 basis points of market share in online and about 60 basis points in software.
In financial services, we leverage H&R Block Bank this year to offset the loss of RALs. The bank process nearly 6 million RACs and approximately 2.3 million Emerald Cards with $8 billion in total deposits.
Finally, on the international front, total returns in Canada and Australia grew by 1%. International revenues increased about 8% to $206 million, largely due to favorable exchange rates.
All together, our adjusted non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was essentially flat to last year, and we generated free cash flow of $450 million.
Of course, there are some challenges in 2011. Our inability to offer RALs impacted our financial results, although the company did do an outstanding job dealing with the loss of the product. Another drag on both our top and bottom line came from RSM McGladrey, which had a disappointing year.
Revenue and profitability there fell for the second consecutive year. Obviously, the challenges at McGladrey are on my radar screen.
And like many S&P 500 companies today, H&R Block has had its deal of legal threats and challenges. As you may have heard, some people with their own agenda have used the news media to imply that H&R Block might be liable for all claims in excess of Sand Canyon's ability to pay.
We strongly disagree. We believe that Sand Canyon's financial position is more than sufficient to satisfy valid rep and warrant-related claims.
We also believe that anyone pursuing rep and warrant claims will have no recourse to H&R Block. In short, we are confident that Sand Canyon will continue to handle all valid claims and we believe that the process will not affect H&R Block.
Jeff, will go into more detail later in the call.
As you might imagine, the past 6 weeks have been a whirlwind of activities for me. I spent time with our associates, franchisees, and the best tax professionals in the industry. I've gotten to know the senior staff and we spent hours reviewing and considering our plans for 2012 and beyond.
Here are a few of my early takeaways. First, I believe there is a lot more value to be had across the 4 key growth areas, retail tax, digital tax, the Emerald Card and internationally.
H&R Block is well positioned to thrive in the sea of change and competition. And here is what has bolstered my confidence. First, our core retail business is strong and growing stronger as more clients turn to H&R Block. The assisted category remains very resilient to the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the value that the tax professionals provide clients. There has been no change in the proportion of either assisted or do-it-yourself returns during the last decade.
Today, assisted returns represent about 61% of IRS filings, the exact same percentage as 2002 and more than 90% of industry revenues.
Second, our Digital business is acting as a springboard to a deeper relationship with our existing clients and is opening the door to new ones. As the digital category continues to grow at the expense of the shrinking pen and paper markets, the goal in 2012 is to compete with a vengeance and continue to take digital share.
Third, the Emerald Cards is a fabulous product that makes H&R Block Bank a key asset. I believe that we can significantly expand on the success of the Emerald Cards by increasing the number of cards in circulation, the amount of direct deposits and the frequency of use.
Finally, I believe H&R Block's business outside the U.S. is underrated, and I'm excited about our prospects in this area. In 2012, we will focus on growing clients and market share in Canada and Australia, while continuing to explore additional countries in which to further build our global presence.
And one of the highlights in my first 6 weeks was a the opportunity to spend time with Henry Bloch. He patiently listened as I talked about a variety of ideas for the company he founded. He could not have been more gracious, and he had a wealth of suggestions to per share.
Towards the end of our conversation he said, remember Bill, however, you approach it, our clients come first. If we stay focused on them and on preparing error-free returns, we'll ultimately increase in the number of returns we're a part of it.
And if we do that, we'll ultimately increase profitability. Mr. Block nailed it. His simple equation will be at the heart of our efforts in 2012.
Now let me turn it over to Jeff to discuss our financial results."
276601,134257417,137768,"H&R Block, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jun 23, 2011",2011-06-23,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. After a slow start, our tax season finished exceptionally well and our 4Q results reflect the strength of our finish. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.14 per share, included an after-tax litigation charge in our Business Services segment of",1172,"Thank you, Bill. After a slow start, our tax season finished exceptionally well and our 4Q results reflect the strength of our finish. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.14 per share, included an after-tax litigation charge in our Business Services segment of $17 million or $0.06 per share. Excluding this charge, we achieved quarterly earnings of $2.20 per share.
For the full fiscal year, net income from continuing operations was $419 million or $1.35 per share. Excluding the fourth quarter litigation charge as well as other previously announced charges, adjusted income from continuing operations of $471 million was essentially flat to the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.52 due to reduced shares outstanding. Total revenues fell approximately 2.5% to $3.8 billion 
In our Tax Services segment, fiscal 2011 revenues fell about 2% to $2.9 billion, primarily due to the sale of company-owned locations to franchisees, as well as revenue impacts stemming from our inability to offer refund loans this tax season.
Adjusting for special items, pretax income for this segment was essentially flat to the prior year at $830 million.
Cost reduction measures put into place in the first quarter of this year, principally reductions in force and reductions in our office network offset revenue declines and allowed us to achieve higher margins. Adjusted pretax margins improved from 28% last year to 28.5% in the current fiscal year.
Our results this year included a $45 million of pretax gains from the sale of company-owned offices and results last year included gains of $49 million.
Our focus on rebalancing our office network is substantially complete, and we expect little of this activity in coming years.
Gains in 2012 will be limited primarily to the $7 million of deferred gains that existed at the end of the current year.
At RSM McGladrey, revenues fell approximately 3.5% to $830 million as growth in the professional services sectors in which we compete proved challenging. Reductions in both management fees from McGladrey & Pullen and services performed under a large multiyear engagement in our consulting practice also contributed to the decline in revenues. 
Adjusting for litigation and impairment charges, pretax income for this segment declined from $88 million last year to $77 million in the current year, and lower profitability was due almost entirely to the decline in revenues.
In corporate, our pretax loss of $139 million compared to a loss of $142 million in the prior year. Declining mortgage loan balances yielded lower interest earnings, which were more than offset by reduced loss provisions on those loans.
The net principal balance of mortgage loans held for investment at year end was $485 million, a decline of $110 million from the prior year and losses on mortgage loans fell nearly $12 million compared to the prior year.
Results of our discontinued operations principally reflect the litigations and related costs associated with the ongoing wind down of the former mortgage origination and servicing business of Sand Canyon.
Losses from discontinued operations over $13 million in the current year compared with $10 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter Sand Canyon received new claims for alleged representations and warranties in the principal amount of $55 million.
Claims of approximately $45 million were reviewed during the quarter with incurred losses totaling $4 million. At April 30, claims totaling $79 million remained under review in Sand Canyon's reserve for probable losses on representation and warranty claims totaled $126 million.
As mentioned on last quarter's call, Sand Canyon made its final payment of $24 million during the quarter for reserve losses under $50 million indemnification agreement dated April 2008, and Sand Canyon has now fully fulfilled its obligation to that party.
As a reminder with the exception of a few instances where H&R Block guaranteed the performance of Sand Canyon, representation and warranty claims are solely the obligation of Sand Canyon. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity.
It has maintained separate executive and operational offices, its own management team, IT platforms and separate administrative functions.
Sand Canyon secured its own independent warehouse lines to fund loan originations and provided separate audited financial statements to its lenders. There was no overlap of the Sand Canyon and H&R Block executive teams. Decisions on underwriting, originating and the sale of loans were made solely by Sand Canyon personnel.
In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block since the business was acquired in 1997.
Based on claim activity that we have observed since Sand Canyon ceased operating activities, we continue to believe its reserve is adequate where ultimate losses ever takes the amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon.
At April 30, 2011, Sand Canyon had equity approximately $300 million in addition to its accrual for representation and warranty liabilities of $126 million.
We believe the Sand Canyon's equity is more than sufficient to satisfy valid third-party claims and the claimants have no recourse to H&R Block, expect for the third parties that H&R Block has guaranteed the performance of Sand Canyon.
As a reminder, these parties were buyers of Sand Canyon pools that require apparent guarantees at Sand Canyon with exiting the mortgage loan origination business.
Guarantees were related to Sand Canyon's performance obligations under the agreements and were not related to loan performance.
Remaining guarantees involve 3 loan pools with an original principal balance of approximately $1.7 billion. Over the last 3 years, Sand Canyon has not received any claims related to 2 of these loan pools totaling $1.5 billion. And on the remaining pool, Sand Canyon has received claims of $7 million with losses totaling less than $1 million.
While we cannot predict what may happen in the event of a lawsuit or a Sand Canyon bankruptcy, we have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block under any veil-piercing argument.
There has been no cases to date in which H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon.
Now turning to our overall financial position. We ended the year with unrestricted cash of $1.7 billion, total debt of $1.1 billion and equity of $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2011, the company repurchased and retired 19 million shares at a cost of $280 million for an average cost of less than $15 per share, and we have 305 million shares outstanding at year end. Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 38.1% in fiscal 2011 compared to 37.6% a year ago. And next year, we expect our full year tax rate from continuing operations to approximate 38.5% to 39%. 
Depreciation and amortization was $122 million for the current year and we expect a similar expense level next year. Capital expenditures this year were $63 million and in fiscal 2012, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $90 million.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some final remarks."

Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to provide an update on 2 areas. First, the Justice Department filed an injunction last month to block our pending acquisition of TaxACT. Both H&R Block and TaxACT remain committed to the transaction. Here's why. First, we continue to believe this merger is the right strategy and that our legal position is strong. Second, combining H&R Block and TaxACT will do exactly what the Justice Department wants, bring competition to a digital marketplace that's currently dominated by one player Intuit
Third, and most importantly, we believe consumers will be the primary beneficiaries of the merger through innovation, enhanced functionality and low prices. As a result, H&R Block and TaxACT have agreed to vigorously pursue litigation against the Department of Justice. We expect a preliminary injunction hearing will take place by the end of September.
Finally, let me touch on capital allocation. As you all know, we generate a significant amount of free cash flow. As we look ahead, our goals are to grow clients and market share. I see some great opportunities to invest in our business and strategic, complementary adjacencies to accomplish those goals. To do this, the board and I have decided to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. We will focus on strengthening our balance sheet, growing our net worth and maintaining the financial flexibility to grow clients and market share.
We will make strategic investments while continuing to return capital to shareholders. We are pleased to maintain our annual dividend of $0.60 per share, which represents a strong yield of nearly 4%, and we plan to continue share purchases on an opportunistic basis while positioning our balance sheet to support our growth plans.
With that, let's open up the call to your questions. Operator?"

I want to step back for a second and then get into specifics. I think simplifying financial services for this user base is needed. And I think the Emerald card can be the catalyst for that approach It's a low-cost option. I don't think we probably marketed that as well as we could have, but I think there is a way that this can potentially be a very big idea. Specifically this year, I think, there are 3 ways we can do that. One, we've done a lot of education on the basics of using a debit card. but I think there are still aspects of this card that are well kept secret that we want to push further. we're going to use direct marketing this year. We've streamlined the process we used at the tech desk to issue cards but we've never reached out to clients directly around the importance and the ease-of-use of direct deposit of our payroll and the ability to load cash up on to this. And finally, we are working to improve that product. We do that every year but I think we really have the zeal around the user experience. We think we can simplify the fees and reduce them We think we can enhance our service. So we are actively working to really take not only taxable approach to 2012 but also look at the larger idea of simplifying financial services for this user base."

It's a pleasure to be here today on my first earnings call as H&R Block's CEO.Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 results and I'm pleased to say that we have a lot of momentum going",1157,"Thank you , Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here today on my first earnings call as H&R Block's CEO.
Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 results and I'm pleased to say that we have a lot of momentum going into fiscal 2012. Today, I'll talk a bit about that momentum. I'll also give you a sense of what I've learned during my first 6 weeks on the job. Let's start with our fiscal 2011 results.
First, total returns prepared worldwide were up nearly 6% to $24.5 million. In the U.S., we grew returns by 6.5%, our best growth since 2001. We estimate that industry-wide IRS filings grew about 1%, so that we gained about 80 basis points of share in the U.S. 
In retail Tax Services, Phil and his team drove much stronger results in many expected. We gained more than 500,000 clients, and we estimate that we gained 60 basis points of share in the assisted category. We also showed significant improvement in key leading indicators, including client retention, satisfaction and new client growth. So how did we grow share?
In retail, our growth this year was led by improved execution, client service and aggressive client acquisition programs, such as free federal 1040EZs and Second Looks. We also capitalize on industry-wide consolidation to convert competitive returns to H&R Block.
I'm particularly excited about the success of the free federal 1040EZ program. Introducing young filers to the benefit of assisted tax-preparation is a critical component of our long-term growth strategy.
Remember, the majority of these filers migrate to more complex tax returns within 2 years. Thanks to the program, we now have a solid pipeline of new and younger clients and the word of mouth referrals they generate. Expect more of this kind of innovative marketing in 2012. 
In digital, our share gains were the result of improved marketing, the redesign of our website and product simplification. Smart advertising and a clear call to action drove customer acquisition and trial. Our website turned visitors into clients and an improved product experience help clients achieve completed returns.
As a result, our client base increase by nearly 800,000, led by online growth of nearly 29%. Thanks to the fabulous work from Jason and his team, we estimate that we gained 90 basis points of market share in online and about 60 basis points in software.
In financial services, we leveraged H&R Block Bank this year to offset the loss of RALs. The bank processed nearly 6 million RACs and approximately 2.3 million Emerald Cards with $8 billion in total deposits.
Finally, on the international front, total returns in Canada and Australia grew about 1%. International revenues increased about 8% to $206 million, largely due to favorable exchange rates. All together, our adjusted non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was essentially flat to last year, and we generated free cash flow of $450 million.
Of course, there were some challenges in 2011. Our inability to offer RALs impacted our financial results, although the company did do an outstanding job dealing with the loss of the product. Another drag on both our top and bottom line came from RSM McGladrey, which had a disappointing year. Revenue and profitability there fell for the second consecutive year. Obviously, the challenges at McGladrey are on my radar screen.
And like many S&P 500 companies today, H&R Block has had to deal with its share of legal threats and challenges. As you may have heard, some people with their own agenda have used the news media to imply that H&R Block might be liable for all claims in excess of Sand Canyon's ability to pay.  
We strongly disagree. We believe that Sand Canyon's financial position is more than sufficient to satisfy valid rep and warrant-related claims. We also believe that anyone pursuing rep and warrant claims will have no recourse to H&R Block. In short, we're confident that Sand Canyon will continue to handle all valid claims and we believe the process will not affect H&R Block.
Jeff, will go into more detail later in the call.
As you might imagine, the past 6 weeks have been a whirlwind of activities for me. I've spent time with our associates, franchisees, and the best tax professionals in the industry. I've gotten to know the senior staff and we spent hours reviewing and considering our plans for 2012 and beyond.
Here are a few of my early takeaways. First, I believe there is a lot more value to be had across 4 key growth areas, retail tax, digital tax, the Emerald Card and internationally.
H&R Block is well positioned to thrive in the sea of change and competition. And here is what is bolstering my confidence. First, our core retail business is strong and growing stronger as more clients turn to H&R Block. The assisted category remains very resilient, due to the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the value that tax professionals provide clients. There has been no change in the proportion of either assisted or do-it-yourself returns during the last decade.
Today, assisted returns represent about 61% of IRS filings, the exact same percentage as 2002 and more than 90% of industry revenues. Second, our Digital business is acting as a springboard to a deeper relationship with our existing clients and is opening the door to new ones. As the digital category continues to grow at the expense of the shrinking pen and paper market, the goal in 2012 is to compete with a vengeance and continue to take digital share.
Third, the Emerald Card is a fabulous product that makes H&R Block Bank a key asset. I believe we can significantly expand on the success of the Emerald Card, by increasing the number of cards in circulation, the amount of direct deposits and the frequency of use.
Finally, I believe H&R Block's business outside the U.S. is underrated, and I'm excited about our prospects in this area. In 2012, we will focus on growing clients and market share in Canada and Australia, while continuing to explore additional countries in which to further build our global presence.
And one of the highlights in my first 6 weeks was the opportunity to spend time with Henry Block. He patiently listened as I talked about a variety of ideas for the company he founded. He could not have been more gracious, and he had a wealth of suggestions to share.
Towards the end of our conversation he said, remember Bill, however, you approach it, our clients come first. If we stay focused on them and on preparing error-free returns, we'll ultimately increase the number of returns we're a part of.
And if we do that, we'll ultimately increase profitability. Mr. Block nailed it. His simple equation will be at the heart of our efforts in 2012. Now let me turn it over to Jeff to discuss our financial results."
276601,134257417,137785,"H&R Block, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jun 23, 2011",2011-06-23,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. After a slow start, our tax season finished exceptionally well and our fourth quarter results reflect the strength of our finish. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.14 per share, included an after-tax litigation charge in our Business Services",1179,"Thank you, Bill. After a slow start, our tax season finished exceptionally well and our fourth quarter results reflect the strength of our finish. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.14 per share, included an after-tax litigation charge in our Business Services segment of $17 million or $0.06 per share. Excluding this charge, we achieved quarterly earnings of $2.20 per share.
For the full fiscal year, net income from continuing operations was $419 million or $1.35 per share. Excluding the fourth quarter litigation charge, as well as other previously announced charges, adjusted income from continuing operations of $471 million was essentially flat to the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.52, due to reduced shares outstanding. Total revenues fell approximately 2.5% to $3.8 billion 
In our Tax Services segment, fiscal 2011 revenues fell about 2% to $2.9 billion, primarily due to the sale of company-owned locations to franchisees, as well as revenue impacts stemming from our inability to offer refund loans this tax season.
Adjusting for special items, pretax income for this segment was essentially flat to the prior year at $830 million. Cost reduction measures put into place in the first quarter of this year, principally reductions in force and reductions in our office network, offset revenue declines and allowed us to achieve higher margins. Adjusted pretax margins improved from 28% last year to 28.5% in the current fiscal year.
Our results this year included $45 million of pretax gains from the sale of company-owned offices and results last year included gains of $49 million.  Our focus on rebalancing our office network is substantially complete, and we expect little of this activity in coming years. Gains in 2012 will be limited, primarily to the $7 million of deferred gains that existed at the end of the current year.
At RSM McGladrey, revenues fell approximately 3.5% to $830 million, as growth in the professional services sectors in which we compete proved challenging. Reductions in both management fees from McGladrey & Pullen and services performed under a large multiyear engagement in our consulting practice also contributed to the decline in revenues. 
Adjusting for litigation and impairment charges, pretax income for this segment declined from $88 million last year to $77 million in the current year, and lower profitability was due almost entirely to the decline in revenues.
In corporate, our pretax loss of $139 million compared to a loss of $142 million in the prior year. Declining mortgage loan balances yielded lower interest earnings, which were more than offset by reduced loss provisions on those loans.
The net principal balance of mortgage loans held for investment at year end was $485 million, a decline of $110 million from the prior year and losses on mortgage loans fell nearly $12 million compared to the prior year.
Results of our discontinued operations principally reflect the litigations and related costs, associated with the ongoing wind down of the former mortgage origination and Servicing business of Sand Canyon.
Losses from discontinued operations were $13 million in the current year compared with $10 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter, Sand Canyon received new claims for alleged breaches of representation and warranties in the principal amount of $55 million.
Claims of approximately $45 million were reviewed during the quarter, with incurred losses totaling $4 million. At April 30, claims totaling $79 million remained under review in Sand Canyon's reserve for probable losses on representation and warranty claims totaled $126 million.
As mentioned on last quarter's call, Sand Canyon made its final payment of $24 million during the quarter for reserve losses under a $50 million indemnification agreement dated April 2008, and Sand Canyon has now fully fulfilled its obligation to that party.
As a reminder with the exception of a few instances where H&R Block guaranteed the performance of Sand Canyon, representation and warranty claims are solely the obligation of Sand Canyon. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity. It has maintained separate executive and operational offices, its own management team, IT platforms and separate administrative functions.
Sand Canyon secured its own independent warehouse lines to fund loan originations and provided separate audited financial statements to its lenders. There was no overlap of the Sand Canyon and H&R Block executive teams. Decisions on underwriting, originating and the sale of loans were made solely by Sand Canyon personnel. In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block since the business was acquired in 1997.
Based on claim activity that we have observed since Sand Canyon ceased operating activities, we continue to believe its reserve is adequate, where ultimate losses ever to exceed reserved amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon.
At April 30, 2011, Sand Canyon had equity of approximately $300 million, in addition to its accrual for representation and warranty liabilities of $126 million. We believe the Sand Canyon's equity is more than sufficient to satisfy valid third-party claims, and the claimants have no recourse to H&R Block, except for the 3 parties which H&R Block has guaranteed the performance of Sand Canyon.
As a reminder, these parties were buyers of Sand Canyon loan pools, that required apparent guarantee the Sand Canyon was exiting the Mortgage Loan Origination business. Guarantees were related to Sand Canyon's performance obligations under the applicable agreements and were not related to loan performance.
Remaining guarantees involve 3 loan pools with an original principal balance of approximately $1.7 billion. Over the last 3 years, Sand Canyon has not received any claims related to 2 of these loan pools totaling $1.5 billion. And on the remaining pool, Sand Canyon has received claims of $7 million, with losses totaling less than $1 million.
While we cannot predict what may happen in the event of a lawsuit or Sand Canyon bankruptcy, we have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block under any veil-piercing argument. There have been no cases to date in which an H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon.
Now turning to our overall financial position. We ended the year with unrestricted cash of $1.7 billion, total debt of $1.1 billion and equity of $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2011, the company repurchased and retired 19 million shares at a cost of $280 million, or an average cost of less than $15 per share, and we have 305 million shares outstanding at year end. 
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 38.1% in fiscal 2011 compared to 37.6% a year ago. And next year, we expect our full year tax rate for continuing operations to approximate 38.5% to 39%. 
Depreciation and amortization was $122 million for the current year, and we expect a similar expense level next year. Capital expenditures this year were $63 million and in fiscal 2012, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $90 million.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some final remarks."

Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to provide an update on 2 areas. First, the Justice Department filed an injunction last month to block our pending acquisition of TaxACT. Both H&R Block and TaxACT remain committed to the transaction. Here's why. First, we continue to believe this merger is the right strategy and that our legal position is strong; second, combining H&R Block and TaxACT will do exactly what the Justice Department wants, bring competition to a digital marketplace that's currently dominated by one player, Intuit; third, and most importantly, we believe consumers will be the primary beneficiaries of the merger, through innovation, enhanced functionality and low prices. As a result, H&R Block and TaxACT have agreed to vigorously pursue litigation against the Department of Justice. We expect a preliminary injunction hearing will take place by the end of September.
Finally, let me touch on capital allocation. As you all know, we generate a significant amount of free cash flow. As we look ahead, our goals are to grow clients and market share. I see some great opportunities to invest in our business and strategic, complementary adjacencies to accomplish those goals. To do this, the board and I have decided to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. We will focus on strengthening our balance sheet, growing our net worth and maintaining the financial flexibility to grow clients and market share.
We'll make strategic investments while continuing to return capital to shareholders. We are pleased to maintain our annual dividend of $0.60 per share, which represents a strong yield of nearly 4%, and we plan to continue share purchases on an opportunistic basis, while positioning our balance sheet to support our growth plans.

And that I think we're going to have, an ability to take that playbook, improve upon it, and I look for us to -- our goal is to grow clients and market share, and I think that we'll deal with whatever economic situation it is, but I know the team is very hard at work.

I want to kind of step back for a second and then get into specifics. I think simplifying financial services for this user base is needed. And I think the Emerald Card can be the catalyst for that approach. It's a low-cost option, I don't think we probably marketed that as well as we could have, and I think that there' a way that this can potentially be a very big idea. Specifically this year, I think, there are 3 ways we can do that. One, we've done a lot of education to our clients of the basics of using a debit card. But I think, there are still aspects of this card that are well kept secret that we want to push further. we're going to use direct marketing this year. We've streamlined the process, we used at the tax desk to issue cards, but we've never reached out to clients directly around the importance and the ease-of-use of direct deposit of our payroll, and the ability to load cash on to this. And finally, we're working to continue to improve that product. We do that every year, but I think we really have a zeal around the user experience. We think we can simplify the fees and reduce them, we think we can enhance our service. So we are actively working to really take not only a taxable approach to 2012, but also look at the larger idea of simplifying financial services for this user base."

In conjunction with today's call, we have posted the press release and slide presentation to the Investor Relations website at hrblock.com. We also plan to file our 10-K for fiscal 2011 later this afternoon.

Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. As a result, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially.
You could learn more about these risks in today's press release, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2010 and our other SEC filings. H&R Block undertakes no obligation to publicly update these risk factors or forward-looking statements. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that some of the numbers we reference today are presented on the non-GAAP basis.

It's a pleasure to be here today on my first earnings call as H&R Block's CEO.Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 results and I'm pleased to say that we have a lot of momentum going",1157,"Thank you , Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here today on my first earnings call as H&R Block's CEO.
Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 results and I'm pleased to say that we have a lot of momentum going into fiscal 2012. Today, I'll talk a bit about that momentum. I'll also give you a sense of what I've learned during my first 6 weeks on the job. Let's start with our fiscal 2011 results.
First, total returns prepared worldwide were up nearly 6% to 24.5 million. In the U.S., we grew returns by 6.5%, our best growth since 2001. We estimate that industry-wide IRS filings grew about 1%, so that we gained about 80 basis points of share in the U.S. 
In retail Tax Services, Phil and his team drove much stronger results than many expected. We gained more than 500,000 clients, and we estimate that we gained 60 basis points of share in the assisted category. We also showed significant improvement in key leading indicators, including client retention, satisfaction and new client growth. So how did we grow share?
In retail, our growth this year was led by improved execution, client service and aggressive client acquisition programs, such as free federal 1040EZs and Second Looks. We also capitalized on industry-wide consolidation to convert competitive returns to H&R Block.
I'm particularly excited about the success of the free federal 1040EZ program. Introducing young filers to the benefit of assisted tax-preparation is a critical component of our long-term growth strategy.
Remember, the majority of these filers migrate to more complex tax returns within 2 years. Thanks to the program, we now have a solid pipeline of new and younger clients and the word of mouth referrals they generate. Expect more of this kind of innovative marketing in 2012. 
In digital, our share gains were the result of improved marketing, the redesign of our website and product simplification. Smart advertising and a clear call to action drove customer acquisition and trial. Our website turned visitors into clients and an improved product experience help clients achieve completed returns.
As a result, our client base increased by nearly 800,000, led by online growth of nearly 29%. Thanks to the fabulous work from Jason and his team, we estimate that we gained 90 basis points of market share in online and about 60 basis points in software.
In financial services, we leveraged H&R Block Bank this year to offset the loss of RALs. The bank processed nearly 6 million RACs and approximately 2.3 million Emerald Cards with $8 billion in total deposits.
Finally, on the international front, total returns in Canada and Australia grew about 1%. International revenues increased about 8% to $206 million, largely due to favorable exchange rates. All together, our adjusted non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was essentially flat to last year, and we generated free cash flow of $450 million.
Of course, there were some challenges in 2011. Our inability to offer RALs impacted our financial results, although the company did do an outstanding job dealing with the loss of the product. Another drag on both our top and bottom line came from RSM McGladrey, which had a disappointing year. Revenue and profitability there fell for the second consecutive year. Obviously, the challenges at McGladrey are on my radar screen.
And like many S&P 500 companies today, H&R Block has had to deal with its share of legal threats and challenges. As you may have heard, some people with their own agenda have used the news media to imply that H&R Block might be liable for all claims in excess of Sand Canyon's ability to pay.  
We strongly disagree. We believe that Sand Canyon's financial position is more than sufficient to satisfy valid rep and warrant-related claims. We also believe that anyone pursuing rep and warrant claims will have no recourse to H&R Block. In short, we're confident that Sand Canyon will continue to handle all valid claims and we believe the process will not affect H&R Block.
Jeff, will go into more detail later in the call.
As you might imagine, the past 6 weeks have been a whirlwind of activities for me. I've spent time with our associates, franchisees, and the best tax professionals in the industry. I've gotten to know the senior staff and we spent hours reviewing and considering our plans for 2012 and beyond.
Here are a few of my early takeaways. First, I believe there is a lot more value to be had across 4 key growth areas; retail tax, digital tax, the Emerald Card and internationally.
H&R Block is well positioned to thrive in the sea of change and competition. And here is what is bolstering my confidence. First, our core retail business is strong and growing stronger as more clients turn to H&R Block. The assisted category remains very resilient, due to the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the value that tax professionals provide clients. There has been no change in the proportion of either assisted or do-it-yourself returns during the last decade.
Today, assisted returns represent about 61% of IRS filings, the exact same percentage as 2002 and more than 90% of industry revenues. Second, our Digital business is acting as a springboard to a deeper relationship with our existing clients and is opening the door to new ones. As the digital category continues to grow at the expense of the shrinking pen and paper market, the goal in 2012 is to compete with a vengeance and continue to take digital share.
Third, the Emerald Card is a fabulous product that makes H&R Block Bank a key asset. I believe we can significantly expand on the success of the Emerald Card, by increasing the number of cards in circulation, the amount of direct deposits and the frequency of use.
Finally, I believe H&R Block's business outside the U.S. is underrated, and I'm excited about our prospects in this area. In 2012, we will focus on growing clients and market share in Canada and Australia, while continuing to explore additional countries in which to further build our global presence.
And one of the highlights in my first 6 weeks was the opportunity to spend time with Henry Block. He patiently listened as I talked about a variety of ideas for the company he founded. He could not have been more gracious, and he had a wealth of suggestions to share.
Towards the end of our conversation he said, ""Remember Bill, however, you approach it, our clients come first. If we stay focused on them and on preparing error-free returns, we'll ultimately increase the number of returns we're a part of.
And if we do that, we'll ultimately increase profitability."" Mr. Block nailed it. His simple equation will be at the heart of our efforts in 2012. Now let me turn it over to Jeff to discuss our financial results."
276601,134257417,137803,"H&R Block, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jun 23, 2011",2011-06-23,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. After a slow start, our tax season finished exceptionally well and our fourth quarter results reflect the strength of our finish. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.14 per share, included an after-tax litigation charge in our Business Services",1179,"Thank you, Bill. After a slow start, our tax season finished exceptionally well and our fourth quarter results reflect the strength of our finish. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.14 per share, included an after-tax litigation charge in our Business Services segment of $17 million or $0.06 per share. Excluding this charge, we achieved quarterly earnings of $2.20 per share.
For the full fiscal year, net income from continuing operations was $419 million or $1.35 per share. Excluding the fourth quarter litigation charge, as well as other previously announced charges, adjusted income from continuing operations of $471 million was essentially flat to the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.52, due to reduced shares outstanding. Total revenues fell approximately 2.5% to $3.8 billion 
In our Tax Services segment, fiscal 2011 revenues fell about 2% to $2.9 billion, primarily due to the sale of company-owned locations to franchisees, as well as revenue impacts stemming from our inability to offer refund loans this tax season.
Adjusting for special items, pretax income for this segment was essentially flat to the prior year at $830 million. Cost reduction measures put into place in the first quarter of this year, principally reductions in force and reductions in our office network, offset revenue declines and allowed us to achieve higher margins. Adjusted pretax margins improved from 28% last year to 28.5% in the current fiscal year.
Our results this year included $45 million of pretax gains from the sale of company-owned offices and results last year included gains of $49 million.  Our focus on rebalancing our office network is substantially complete, and we expect little of this activity in coming years. Gains in 2012 will be limited, primarily to the $7 million of deferred gains that existed at the end of the current year.
At RSM McGladrey, revenues fell approximately 3.5% to $830 million, as growth in the professional services sectors in which we compete proved challenging. Reductions in both management fees from McGladrey & Pullen and services performed under a large multiyear engagement in our consulting practice also contributed to the decline in revenues. 
Adjusting for litigation and impairment charges, pretax income for this segment declined from $88 million last year to $77 million in the current year, and lower profitability was due almost entirely to the decline in revenues.
In corporate, our pretax loss of $139 million compared to a loss of $142 million in the prior year. Declining mortgage loan balances yielded lower interest earnings, which were more than offset by reduced loss provisions on those loans.
The net principal balance of mortgage loans held for investment at year end was $485 million, a decline of $110 million from the prior year and losses on mortgage loans fell nearly $12 million compared to the prior year.
Results of our discontinued operations principally reflect the litigations and related costs, associated with the ongoing wind down of the former mortgage origination and Servicing business of Sand Canyon.
Losses from discontinued operations were $13 million in the current year compared with $10 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter, Sand Canyon received new claims for alleged breaches of representation and warranties in the principal amount of $55 million.
Claims of approximately $45 million were reviewed during the quarter, with incurred losses totaling $4 million. At April 30, claims totaling $79 million remained under review in Sand Canyon's reserve for probable losses on representation and warranty claims totaled $126 million.
As mentioned on last quarter's call, Sand Canyon made its final payment of $24 million during the quarter for reserve losses under a $50 million indemnification agreement dated April 2008, and Sand Canyon has now fully fulfilled its obligation to that party.
As a reminder with the exception of a few instances where H&R Block guaranteed the performance of Sand Canyon, representation and warranty claims are solely the obligation of Sand Canyon. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity. It has maintained separate executive and operational offices, its own management team, IT platforms and separate administrative functions.
Sand Canyon secured its own independent warehouse lines to fund loan originations and provided separate audited financial statements to its lenders. There was no overlap of the Sand Canyon and H&R Block executive teams. Decisions on underwriting, originating and the sale of loans were made solely by Sand Canyon personnel. In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block since the business was acquired in 1997.
Based on claim activity that we have observed since Sand Canyon ceased operating activities, we continue to believe its reserve is adequate, where ultimate losses ever to exceed reserved amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon.
At April 30, 2011, Sand Canyon had equity of approximately $300 million, in addition to its accrual for representation and warranty liabilities of $126 million. We believe the Sand Canyon's equity is more than sufficient to satisfy valid third-party claims, and the claimants have no recourse to H&R Block, except for the 3 parties which H&R Block has guaranteed the performance of Sand Canyon.
As a reminder, these parties were buyers of Sand Canyon loan pools, that required apparent guarantee the Sand Canyon was exiting the Mortgage Loan Origination business. Guarantees were related to Sand Canyon's performance obligations under the applicable agreements and were not related to loan performance.
Remaining guarantees involve 3 loan pools with an original principal balance of approximately $1.7 billion. Over the last 3 years, Sand Canyon has not received any claims related to 2 of these loan pools totaling $1.5 billion. And on the remaining pool, Sand Canyon has received claims of $7 million, with losses totaling less than $1 million.
While we cannot predict what may happen in the event of a lawsuit or Sand Canyon bankruptcy, we have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block under any veil-piercing argument. There have been no cases to date in which an H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon.
Now turning to our overall financial position. We ended the year with unrestricted cash of $1.7 billion, total debt of $1.1 billion and equity of $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2011, the company repurchased and retired 19 million shares at a cost of $280 million, or an average cost of less than $15 per share, and we have 305 million shares outstanding at year end. 
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 38.1% in fiscal 2011 compared to 37.6% a year ago. And next year, we expect our full year tax rate for continuing operations to approximate 38.5% to 39%. 
Depreciation and amortization was $122 million for the current year, and we expect a similar expense level next year. Capital expenditures this year were $63 million and in fiscal 2012, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $90 million.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some final remarks."

Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to provide an update on 2 areas. First, the Justice Department filed an injunction last month to block our pending acquisition of TaxACT. Both H&R Block and TaxACT remain committed to the transaction. Here's why. First, we continue to believe this merger is the right strategy and that our legal position is strong; second, combining H&R Block and TaxACT will do exactly what the Justice Department wants, bring competition to a digital marketplace that's currently dominated by one player, Intuit; third, and most importantly, we believe consumers will be the primary beneficiaries of the merger, through innovation, enhanced functionality and low prices. As a result, H&R Block and TaxACT have agreed to vigorously pursue litigation against the Department of Justice. We expect a preliminary injunction hearing will take place by the end of September.
Finally, let me touch on capital allocation. As you all know, we generate a significant amount of free cash flow. As we look ahead, our goals are to grow clients and market share. I see some great opportunities to invest in our business and strategic, complementary adjacencies to accomplish those goals. To do this, the board and I have decided to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. We will focus on strengthening our balance sheet, growing our net worth and maintaining the financial flexibility to grow clients and market share.
We'll make strategic investments while continuing to return capital to shareholders. We are pleased to maintain our annual dividend of $0.60 per share, which represents a strong yield of nearly 4%, and we plan to continue share purchases on an opportunistic basis, while positioning our balance sheet to support our growth plans.
With that, let's open up the call to your questions. Operator?"

I want to kind of step back for a second and then get into specifics. I think simplifying financial services for this user base is needed. And I think the Emerald Card can be the catalyst for that approach. It's a low-cost option, I don't think we probably marketed that as well as we could have, and I think that there' a way that this can potentially be a very big idea. Specifically this year, I think, there are 3 ways we can do that. One, we've done a lot of education to our clients of the basics of using a debit card. But I think, there are still aspects of this card that are well kept secret that we want to push further. we're going to use direct marketing this year. We've streamlined the process, we used at the tax desk to issue cards, but we've never reached out to clients directly around the importance and the ease-of-use of direct deposit of our payroll, and the ability to load cash on to this. And finally, we're working to continue to improve that product. We do that every year, but I think we really have a zeal around the user experience. We think we can simplify the fees and reduce them, we think we can enhance our service. So we are actively working to really take not only a taxable approach to 2012, but also look at the larger idea of simplifying financial services for this user base."

It's a pleasure to be here today on my first earnings call as H&R Block's CEO.
Earlier today, we announced fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 results and I'm pleased to say that we have a lot of momentum going into fiscal 2012. Today, I'll talk a bit about that momentum. I'll also give you a sense of what I've learned during my first 6 weeks on the job. Let's start with our fiscal 2011 results.
First, total returns prepared worldwide were up nearly 6% to 24.5 million. In the U.S., we grew returns by 6.5%, our best growth since 2001. We estimate that industry-wide IRS filings grew about 1%, so that we gained about 80 basis points of share in the U.S. 
In retail Tax Services, Phil and his team drove much stronger results than many expected. We gained more than 500,000 clients, and we estimate that we gained 60 basis points of share in the assisted category. We also showed significant improvement in key leading indicators, including client retention, satisfaction and new client growth. So how did we grow share?
In retail, our growth this year was led by improved execution, client service and aggressive client acquisition programs, such as free federal 1040EZs and Second Looks. We also capitalized on industry-wide consolidation to convert competitor returns to H&R Block.
I'm particularly excited about the success of the free federal 1040EZ program. Introducing young filers to the benefits of assisted tax-preparation is a critical component of our long-term growth strategy.
Remember, the majority of these filers migrate to more complex tax returns within 2 years. Thanks to the program, we now have a solid pipeline of new and younger clients and the word of mouth referrals they generate. Expect more of this kind of innovative marketing in 2012. 
In digital, our share gains were the result of improved marketing, the redesign of our website and product simplification. Smart advertising and a clear call to action drove customer acquisition and trial. Our website turned visitors into clients and an improved product experience help clients achieve completed returns.
As a result, our client base increased by nearly 800,000, led by online growth of nearly 29%. Thanks to the fabulous work from Jason and his team, we estimate that we gained 90 basis points of market share in online and about 60 basis points in software.
In financial services, we leveraged H&R Block Bank this year to offset the loss of RALs. The bank processed nearly 6 million RACs and approximately 2.3 million Emerald Cards with $8 billion in total deposits.
Finally, on the international front, total returns in Canada and Australia grew about 1%. International revenues increased about 8% to $206 million, largely due to favorable exchange rates. Altogether, our adjusted non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was essentially flat to last year, and we generated free cash flow of $450 million.
Of course, there were some challenges in 2011. Our inability to offer RALs impacted our financial results, although the company did do an outstanding job dealing with the loss of the product. Another drag on both our top and bottom line came from RSM McGladrey, which had a disappointing year. Revenue and profitability there fell for the second consecutive year. Obviously, the challenges at McGladrey are on my radar screen.
And like many S&P 500 companies today, H&R Block has had to deal with its share of legal threats and challenges. As you may have heard, some people with their own agenda have used the news media to imply that H&R Block might be liable for all claims in excess of Sand Canyon's ability to pay.  
We strongly disagree. We believe that Sand Canyon's financial position is more than sufficient to satisfy valid rep and warrant-related claims. We also believe that anyone pursuing rep and warrant claims will have no recourse to H&R Block. In short, we're confident that Sand Canyon will continue to handle all valid claims and we believe the process will not affect H&R Block.
Jeff will go into more detail later in the call.
As you might imagine, the past 6 weeks have been a whirlwind of activities for me. I've spent time with our associates, franchisees, and the best tax professionals in the industry. I've gotten to know the senior staff and we've spent hours reviewing and considering our plans for 2012 and beyond.
Here are a few of my early takeaways. First, I believe there is a lot more value to be had across 4 key growth areas: retail tax, digital tax, the Emerald Card and internationally.
H&R Block is well positioned to thrive in a sea of change and competition. And here is what is bolstering my confidence. First, our core retail business is strong and growing stronger as more clients turn to H&R Block. The assisted category remains very resilient, due to the complexity of the U.S. tax code and the value that tax professionals provide clients. There has been no change in the proportion of either assisted or do-it-yourself returns during the last decade.
Today, assisted returns represent about 61% of IRS filings, the exact same percentage as 2002 and more than 90% of industry revenues. Second, our Digital business is acting as a springboard to a deeper relationship with our existing clients and is opening the door to new ones. As the digital category continues to grow at the expense of the shrinking pen and paper market, the goal in 2012 is to compete with a vengeance and continue to take digital share.
Third, the Emerald Card is a fabulous product that makes H&R Block Bank a key asset. I believe we can significantly expand on the success of the Emerald Card, by increasing the number of cards in circulation, the amount of direct deposits and the frequency of use.
Finally, I believe H&R Block's business outside the U.S. is underrated, and I'm excited about our prospects in this area. In 2012, we will focus on growing clients and market share in Canada and Australia, while continuing to explore additional countries in which to further build our global presence.
And one of the highlights in my first 6 weeks was the opportunity to spend time with Henry Block. He patiently listened as I talked about a variety of ideas for the company he founded. He could not have been more gracious, and he had a wealth of suggestions to share.
Towards the end of our conversation he said, ""Remember, Bill, however you approach it, our clients come first. If we stay focused on them and on preparing error-free returns, we'll ultimately increase the number of returns we're a part of. And if we do that, we'll ultimately increase profitability."" Mr. Block nailed it. His simple equation will be at the heart of our efforts in 2012. Now let me turn it over to Jeff to discuss our financial results."
276601,134257417,147533,"H&R Block, Inc., Q4 2011 Earnings Call, Jun 23, 2011",2011-06-23,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. After a slow start, our tax season finished exceptionally well and our fourth quarter results reflect the strength of our finish. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.14 per share included an after-tax litigation charge in our Business Services",1177,"Thank you, Bill. After a slow start, our tax season finished exceptionally well and our fourth quarter results reflect the strength of our finish. Fourth quarter earnings of $2.14 per share included an after-tax litigation charge in our Business Services segment of $17 million or $0.06 per share. Excluding this charge, we achieved quarterly earnings of $2.20 per share.
For the full fiscal year, net income from continuing operations was $419 million or $1.35 per share. Excluding the fourth quarter litigation charge, as well as other previously announced charges, adjusted income from continuing operations of $471 million was essentially flat to the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.52, due to reduced shares outstanding. Total revenues fell approximately 2.5% to $3.8 billion 
In our Tax Services segment, fiscal 2011 revenues fell about 2% to $2.9 billion, primarily due to the sale of company-owned locations to franchisees, as well as revenue impacts stemming from our inability to offer refund loans this tax season.
Adjusting for special items, pretax income for the segment was essentially flat to the prior year at $830 million. Cost reduction measures put into place in the first quarter of this year, principally reductions in force and reductions in our office network, offset revenue declines and allowed us to achieve higher margins. Adjusted pretax margins improved from 28% last year to 28.5% in the current fiscal year.
Our results this year included $45 million of pretax gains from the sale of company-owned offices and results last year included gains of $49 million.  Our focus on rebalancing our office network is substantially complete, and we expect little of this activity in coming years. Gains in 2012 will be limited, primarily to the $7 million of deferred gains that existed at the end of the current year.
At RSM McGladrey, revenues fell approximately 3.5% to $830 million, as growth in the professional services sectors in which we compete proved challenging. Reductions in both management fees from McGladrey & Pullen and services performed under a large multiyear engagement in our consulting practice also contributed to the decline in revenues. 
Adjusting for litigation and impairment charges, pretax income for the segment declined from $88 million last year to $77 million in the current year, and lower profitability was due almost entirely to the decline in revenues.
In corporate, our pretax loss of $139 million compared to a loss of $142 million in the prior year. Declining mortgage loan balances yielded lower interest earnings, which were more than offset by reduced loss provisions on those loans.
The net principal balance of mortgage loans held for investment at year end was $485 million, a decline of $110 million from the prior year, and losses on mortgage loans fell nearly $12 million compared to the prior year.
Results of our discontinued operations principally reflect litigation and related costs associated with the ongoing wind down of the former mortgage origination and Servicing business of Sand Canyon.
Losses from discontinued operations were $13 million in the current year compared with $10 million a year ago. During the fourth quarter, Sand Canyon received new claims for alleged breaches of representation and warranties in the principal amount of $55 million.
Claims of approximately $45 million were reviewed during the quarter, with incurred losses totaling $4 million. At April 30, claims totaling $79 million remained under review and Sand Canyon's reserve for probable losses on representation and warranty claims totaled $126 million.
As mentioned on last quarter's call, Sand Canyon made its final payment of $24 million during the quarter for reserved losses under a $50 million indemnification agreement dated April 2008, and Sand Canyon has now fully fulfilled its obligation to that party.
As a reminder, with the exception of a few instances where H&R Block guaranteed the performance of Sand Canyon, representation and warranty claims are solely the obligation of Sand Canyon. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity. It has maintained separate executive and operational offices, its own management team, IT platforms and separate administrative functions.
Sand Canyon secured its own independent warehouse lines to fund loan originations and provided separate audited financial statements to its lenders. There was no overlap of the Sand Canyon and H&R Block executive teams. Decisions on underwriting, originating and the sale of loans were made solely by Sand Canyon personnel. In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block since the business was acquired in 1997.
Based on claim activity that we have observed since Sand Canyon ceased operating activities, we continue to believe its reserve is adequate. Were ultimate losses ever to exceed reserved amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon.
At April 30, 2011, Sand Canyon had equity of approximately $300 million, in addition to its accrual for representation and warranty liabilities of $126 million. We believe Sand Canyon's equity is more than sufficient to satisfy valid third-party claims, and that claimants have no recourse to H&R Block, except for the 3 parties which H&R Block has guaranteed the performance of Sand Canyon.
As a reminder, these parties were buyers of Sand Canyon loan pools that required apparent guarantee that Sand Canyon was exiting the Mortgage Loan Origination business. Guarantees were related to Sand Canyon's performance obligations under the applicable agreements and were not related to loan performance.
Remaining guarantees involve 3 loan pools with an original principal balance of approximately $1.7 billion. Over the last 3 years, Sand Canyon has not received any claims related to 2 of these loan pools totaling $1.5 billion. And on the remaining pool, Sand Canyon has received claims of $7 million, with losses totaling less than $1 million.
While we cannot predict what may happen in the event of a lawsuit or Sand Canyon bankruptcy, we have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block under any veil-piercing argument. There have been no cases to date in which an H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon.
Now turning to our overall financial position. We ended the year with unrestricted cash of $1.7 billion, total debt of $1.1 billion and equity of $1.4 billion. In fiscal 2011, the company repurchased and retired 19 million shares at a cost of $280 million, or an average cost of less than $15 per share, and we had 305 million shares outstanding at year end. 
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 38.1% in fiscal 2011 compared to 37.6% a year ago. And next year, we expect our full year tax rate for continuing operations to approximate 38.5% to 39%. 
Depreciation and amortization was $122 million for the current year, and we expect a similar expense level next year. Capital expenditures this year were $63 million and in fiscal 2012, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $90 million.
And with that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some final remarks."

Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to provide an update on 2 areas. First, the Justice Department filed an injunction last month to block our pending acquisition of TaxACT. Both H&R Block and TaxACT remain committed to the transaction. Here's why. First, we continue to believe this merger is the right strategy and that our legal position is strong; second, combining H&R Block and TaxACT will do exactly what the Justice Department wants, bring competition to a digital marketplace that's currently dominated by one player, Intuit; third, and most importantly, we believe consumers will be the primary beneficiaries of the merger, through innovation, enhanced functionality and low prices. As a result, H&R Block and TaxACT have agreed to vigorously pursue litigation against the Department of Justice. We expect a preliminary injunction hearing will take place by the end of September.
Finally, let me touch on capital allocation. As you all know, we generate a significant amount of free cash flow. As we look ahead, our goals are to grow clients and market share. I see some great opportunities to invest in our business and strategic complementary adjacencies to accomplish those goals. To do this, the board and I have decided to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. We will focus on strengthening our balance sheet, growing our net worth and maintaining the financial flexibility to grow clients and market share.
We'll make strategic investments while continuing to return capital to shareholders. We are pleased to maintain our annual dividend of $0.60 per share, which represents a strong yield of nearly 4%, and we plan to continue share purchases on an opportunistic basis, while positioning our balance sheet to support our growth plans.
With that, let's open up the call to your questions. Operator?"

But I want to be clear on international. My experience with international, I think the way you grow international businesses is not -- is I think in a continuous fashion. You don't go out and try to place a big bet there. I think you add a country, you learn, you add another one. So I think this is going to be more of a step-by-step approach there, but I do think that the capabilities we have in the company, the technology that underpins the company, is quite strong and will travel well. And obviously, I'm a big believer in the brand, and I think the brand will also travel well. So stay tuned. This is a longer-term play, but I think there is value to unlock there."

And I think the Emerald Card can be the catalyst for that approach. It's a low-cost option, I don't think we probably marketed that as well as we could have, and I think that there's a way that this can potentially be a very big idea. Specifically this year, I think there's 3 ways we can do that. One, we've done a lot of education to our clients on the basics of using a debit card. But I think there are still aspects of this card that are well-kept secrets that we want to push further. We're going to use direct marketing this year. We've streamlined the process we use at the tax desk to issue cards, but we've never reached out to clients directly around the importance and the ease-of-use of direct deposit of our payroll, and the ability to load cash onto this. And finally, we're working to continue to improve that product. We do that every year, but I think we really have a zeal around the user experience. We think we can simplify the fees and reduce them, we think we enhance our service. So we are actively working to really take not only a tactful approach to 2012, but also look at the larger idea of simplifying financial services for this user base."

276601,139463736,165188,"H&R Block, Inc., Q1 2012 Earnings Call, Sep 01, 2011",2011-09-01,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Derek, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I know many of your anxious to begin the long weekend so our prepared remarks before we take your questions will be rather brief. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results that were in line",620,"Thank you, Derek, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I know many of your anxious to begin the long weekend so our prepared remarks before we take your questions will be rather brief. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results that were in line with our expectations. Our adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $111 million was essentially flat to the prior year. On a per-share basis, the adjusted loss of $0.37 was $0.02 below the prior year due to fewer shares outstanding. 
Given the seasonality of our businesses and the fact that nearly all of our revenue and earnings come in the fourth quarter, our first quarter results generally don't provide a lot of color on our performance. That said, I am pleased with the initial progress we've shown in Q1. Following the sale of RSM, we will enter next tax season squarely focused on continuing to drive client a market share growth in each of our 4 key areas: retail, digital, international and financial services. I'll have much more to say about our plans at our Investor Conference in New York City on December 8.
Now I'd like to provide a brief update on both TaxACT and RSM. First, the TaxACT preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled to begin next week on September 6. We anticipate the hearing will last several weeks, and we are hopeful that a decision will be made soon after. We continue to believe this merger is the right strategy and that our legal position is strong. Combining H&R Block and TaxACT will do exactly what the Justice Department wants: bring competition to a digital market that's currently dominated by one player into it. Most importantly, we believe consumers will be the primary beneficiaries of the merger through innovation, enhanced functionality and low prices.
Turning to RSM McGladrey, last week, we signed a nonbinding letter of intent to sell substantially all RSM assets to the partners at McGladrey & Pullen. After a thorough review of the alternative, we believe this sale is in the best interest of H&R Block and our shareholders. Most importantly, we see this transaction as an important step in refocusing the company on growing clients and market share in our core Tax business and improving our margins. 
Total consideration is estimated at $610 million, approximately 90% of that consideration will be in the form of cash at closing with the remainder being financed by H&R Block over a term of 5 to 7 years. M&P will also assume substantially all liabilities. We anticipate this transaction will close by calendar year end. 
I would like to wish our friends at McGladrey the very best. For 12 years, they have been our partners and shared in the journey with H&R Block. I'm confident that the outstanding professionals at McGladrey will prosper in the years ahead.
I'd like to conclude with a few words on capital allocation. Clearly, capital allocation remains very important to us. First, I'd like to point out that we were restricted from buying shares in the most recent quarter due to the ongoing negotiations with M&P. Second, we have an authorization from the board to repurchase shares in fiscal 2012 that we fully intend to utilize. 
Following last week's announcement, a recurring question was, what will you do with the cash from the sale of RSM? We must be mindful not to get ahead of ourselves by discussing the potential uses of cash until we have definitive resolution in both the pending acquisition of TaxACT and closing on the sale of RSM. We will have more to say about our capital allocation plans on December 8. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

I'd like to begin by breaking down the net after-tax charge of $0.20 per share included in our first quarter results.

I'd like to begin by breaking down the net after-tax charge of $0.20 per share included in our first quarter results. That net charge consisted of the following items: First, the goodwill impairment on the sale of RSM, which totaled $85 million or $0.17 per share. Second, we impaired all of the remaining goodwill at RSM EquiCo, a separate business of RSM's that is not included in the sale to M&P and which we will seek to dispose of separately. That impairment totaled $14 million or $0.02 per share. Third, we realized a pretax gain of $10 million or $0.02 per share on the first quarter sale of RSM's compensation and benefits consulting practice. And finally, we incurred a litigation charge of $50 million or $0.03 per share and our Tax Services segment.
Now looking at segment results, revenues and Tax Services were $91 million for the quarter, essentially flat for the prior year. The segment's quarterly pretax loss of $169 million improved from a pretax loss of $175 million a year ago. Each period included charges, the litigation charge of $15 million in the current quarter and a severance-related charge of nearly $17 million in the prior quarter. 
In corporate, our pretax loss of $31 million was a slight improvement to the prior year. The improvement was due primarily to reduced loss provisions on mortgage loans held at H&R Block, which declined from $8 million a year ago to $5.6 million in the current quarter. The net principal balance of mortgage loans declined to $467 million at July 31, a decline of $18 million from the prior quarter.
Turning to discontinued operations, our first quarter loss of $2 million compared with a net loss of $3 million a year ago. Claims for allege breaches of representations and warranties in the principal amount of $48 million were resolved during the quarter with incurred losses totaling $485,000. Sand Canyon received a new and reasserted claims during the quarter of $35 million and at July 31, claims totaling $66 million remained under review. Sand Canyon's reserve totaled $126 million at July 31, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. 
One other item of note relating to our discontinued mortgage operations. In August, H&R Block was dismissed as a defendant to a securities fraud action initiated in October 2010 by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. This claim involved 2 securitizations within initial principal balance of approximately $50 million, of which $42 million remains outstanding. Sand Canyon remains as the sole defendant in this manner, and we have currently concluded that a loss in this claim is not probable for Sand Canyon.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

I know many of you are anxious to begin a long weekend, so our prepared remarks before we take your questions, will be rather brief. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results that were in l",622,"Thank you, Derek, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I know many of you are anxious to begin a long weekend, so our prepared remarks before we take your questions, will be rather brief. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results that were in line with our expectations. Our adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $111 million was essentially flat to the prior year. On a per-share basis, the adjusted loss of $0.37 was $0.02 below the prior year due to fewer shares outstanding. 
Given the seasonality of our businesses and the fact that nearly all of our revenue and earnings come in the fourth quarter, our first quarter results generally don't provide a lot of color on our performance. That said, I am pleased with the initial progress we've shown in Q1. Following the sale of RSM, we will enter next tax season squarely focused on continuing to drive client and market share growth in each of our 4 key areas: Retail, digital, international and financial services. I'll have much more to say about our plans at our Investor Conference in New York City on December 8.
Now I'd like to provide a brief update on both TaxACT and RSM. First, the TaxACT preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled to begin next week on September 6. We anticipate the hearing will last several weeks, and we are hopeful that a decision will be made soon after. We continue to believe this merger is the right strategy, and that our legal position is strong. Combining H&R Block and TaxACT will do exactly what the Justice Department wants: Bring competition to a digital market that's currently dominated by one player into it. Most importantly, we believe consumers will be the primary beneficiaries of the merger through innovation, enhanced functionality, and low prices.
Turning to RSM McGladrey, last week, we signed a nonbinding letter of intent to sell substantially all of RSM's assets to the partners at McGladrey & Pullen. After a thorough review of the alternatives, we believe this sale is in the best interest of H&R Block and our shareholders. Most importantly, we see this transaction as an important step in refocusing the company on growing clients and market share in our core Tax business and improving our margins. 
Total consideration is estimated at $610 million, approximately 90% of that consideration will be in the form of cash at closing, with the remainder being financed by H&R Block over a term of 5 to 7 years. M&P will also assume substantially all liabilities. We anticipate this transaction will close by calendar year end. 
I would like to wish our friends at McGladrey the very best. For 12 years, they have been our partners and shared in the journey with H&R Block. I'm confident that the outstanding professionals at McGladrey will prosper in the years ahead.
I'd like to conclude with a few words on capital allocation. Clearly, capital allocation remains very important to us. First, I'd like to point out that we were restricted from buying shares in the most recent quarter due to the ongoing negotiations with M&P. Second, we have an authorization from the board to repurchase shares in fiscal 2012 that we fully intend to utilize. 
Following last week's announcement, a recurring question was, ""what will you do with the cash from the sale of RSM?"" We must be mindful not to get ahead of ourselves by discussing the potential uses of cash until we have definitive resolution on both the pending acquisition of TaxACT and closing on the sale of RSM. We will have more to say about our capital allocation plans on December 8. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

I'd like to begin by breaking down the net after-tax charge of $0.20 per share included in our first quarter results.

I'd like to begin by breaking down the net after-tax charge of $0.20 per share included in our first quarter results. That net charge consisted of the following items: First, the goodwill impairment on the sale of RSM, which totaled $85 million or $0.17 per share. Second, we impaired all of the remaining goodwill at RSM EquiCo, a separate business of RSM's that is not included in the sale to M&P and which we will seek to dispose of separately. That impairment totaled $14 million or $0.02 per share. Third, we realized a pretax gain of $10 million or $0.02 per share on the first quarter sale of RSM's compensation and benefit consulting practice. And finally, we incurred a litigation charge of $50 million, or $0.03 per share in our Tax Services segment.
Now looking at segment results, Revenues and Tax Services were $91 million for the quarter, essentially flat to the prior year. The segment's quarterly pretax loss of $169 million improved from a pretax loss of $175 million a year ago. Each period included charges, the litigation charge of $15 million in the current quarter and a severance-related charge of nearly $17 million in the prior quarter. 
In corporate, our pretax loss of $31 million was a slight improvement to the prior year. The improvement was due primarily to reduced loss provisions on mortgage loans held at H&R Block, which declined from $8 million a year ago to $5.6 million in the current quarter. The net principal balance of mortgage loans declined to $467 million at July 31, a decline of $18 million from the prior quarter.
Turning to discontinued operations, our first quarter loss of $2 million compared with a net loss of $3 million a year ago. Claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the principal amount of $48 million were resolved during the quarter with incurred losses totaling $485,000. Sand Canyon received new and reasserted claims during the quarter of $35 million, and at July 31, claims totaling $66 million remained under review. Sand Canyon's reserve totaled $126 million at July 31, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. 
One other item of note relating to our discontinued mortgage operations. In August, H&R Block was dismissed as a defendant to a securities fraud action initiated in October 2010 by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. This claim involved 2 securitizations within an initial principal balance of approximately $50 million, of which $42 million remains outstanding. Sand Canyon remains as the sole defendant in this manner, and we have currently concluded that a loss on this claim is not probable for Sand Canyon.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions."

I know many of you are anxious to begin the long weekend, so our prepared remarks before we take your questions will be rather brief. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results that were in line with our expectations. Our adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $111 million was essentially flat to the prior year. On a per-share basis, the adjusted loss of $0.37 was $0.02 below the prior year due to fewer shares outstanding. 
Given the seasonality of our businesses and the fact that nearly all of our revenue and earnings come in the fourth quarter, our first quarter results generally don't provide a lot of color on our performance. That said, I am pleased with the initial progress we've shown in Q1. Following the sale of RSM, we will enter next tax season squarely focused on continuing to drive client and market share growth in each of our 4 key areas: Retail, digital, international and financial services. I'll have much more to say about our plans at our Investor Conference in New York City on December 8.
Now I'd like to provide a brief update on both TaxACT and RSM. First, the TaxACT preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled to begin next week on September 6. We anticipate the hearing will last several weeks, and we are hopeful that a decision will be made soon after. We continue to believe this merger is the right strategy, and that our legal position is strong. Combining H&R Block and TaxACT will do exactly what the Justice Department wants: Bring competition to a digital market that's currently dominated by one player, Intuit. Most importantly, we believe consumers will be the primary beneficiaries of the merger through innovation, enhanced functionality, and low prices.
Turning to RSM McGladrey, last week, we signed a non-binding letter of intent to sell substantially all of RSM's assets to the partners at McGladrey & Pullen. After a thorough review of the alternatives, we believe this sale is in the best interest of H&R Block and our shareholders. Most importantly, we see this transaction as an important step in refocusing the company on growing clients and market share in our core Tax business and improving our margins. 
Total consideration is estimated at $610 million. Approximately 90% of that consideration will be in the form of cash at closing, with the remainder being financed by H&R Block over a term of 5 to 7 years. M&P will also assume substantially all liabilities. We anticipate this transaction will close by calendar year end. 
I would like to wish our friends at McGladrey the very best. For 12 years, they have been our partners and shared in the journey with H&R Block. I'm confident that the outstanding professionals at McGladrey will prosper in the years ahead.
I'd like to conclude with a few words on capital allocation. Clearly, capital allocation remains very important to us. First, I'd like to point out that we were restricted from buying shares in the most recent quarter due to the ongoing negotiations with M&P. Second, we have an authorization from the board to repurchase shares in fiscal 2012 that we fully intend to utilize. 
Following last week's announcement, a recurring question was, ""what will you do with the cash from the sale of RSM?"" We must be mindful not to get ahead of ourselves by discussing the potential uses of cash until we have definitive resolution on both the pending acquisition of TaxACT and closing on the sale of RSM. We will have more to say about our capital allocation plans on December 8. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff."

I'd like to begin by breaking down the net after-tax charge of $0.20 per share included in our first quarter results. That net charge consisted of the following items: First, the goodwill impairment on the sale of RSM, which totaled $85 mill",452,"Thanks, Bill. I'd like to begin by breaking down the net after-tax charge of $0.20 per share included in our first quarter results. That net charge consisted of the following items: First, the goodwill impairment on the sale of RSM, which totaled $85 million or $0.17 per share. Second, we impaired all of the remaining goodwill at RSM EquiCo, a separate business of RSM's that is not included in the sale to M&P and which we will seek to dispose of separately. That impairment totaled $14 million or $0.02 per share. Third, we realized a pretax gain of $10 million or $0.02 per share on the first quarter sale of RSM's compensation and benefit consulting practice. And finally, we incurred a litigation charge of $15, or $0.03 per share in our Tax Services segment.
Now looking at segment results, Revenues and Tax Services were $91 million for the quarter, essentially flat to the prior year. The segment's quarterly pretax loss of $169 million improved from a pretax loss of $175 million a year ago. Each period included charges, the litigation charge of $15 million in the current quarter and a severance-related charge of nearly $17 million in the prior quarter. 
In corporate, our pretax loss of $31 million was a slight improvement to the prior year. The improvement was due primarily to reduced loss provisions on mortgage loans held at H&R Block, which declined from $8 million a year ago to $5.6 million in the current quarter. The net principal balance of mortgage loans declined to $467 million at July 31, a decline of $18 million from the prior quarter.
Turning to discontinued operations, our first quarter loss of $2 million compared with a net loss of $3 million a year ago. Claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties in the principal amount of $48 million were resolved during the quarter with incurred losses totaling $485,000. Sand Canyon received new and reasserted claims during the quarter of $35 million, and at July 31, claims totaling $66 million remained under review. Sand Canyon's reserve totaled $126 million at July 31, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. 
One other item of note relating to our discontinued mortgage operations. In August, H&R Block was dismissed as a defendant to a securities fraud action initiated in October 2010 by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago. This claim involved 2 securitizations within an initial principal balance of approximately $50 million, of which $42 million remains outstanding. Sand Canyon remains as the sole defendant in this matter, and we have currently concluded that a loss on this claim is not probable for Sand Canyon.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions."

We look forward to sharing our plans and outlook with you next Thursday at our Investors Conference in New York City. We hope all of you can make it. Now, today's call will be centered on our second quarter results. Earlier, we announced a net loss from continuing operations of $0.41 per share. As we shift our focus to growing clients and market share on our core tax business, we've taken significant steps to dispose non-core assets such as RSM McGladrey and expressed tax. While this has led to one-time charges in each of the past 2 quarters, we are essentially clearing the decks for long-term earnings growth and higher margins. On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, our second quarter net loss was essentially flat to last year, and Jeff will provide more details on this later in the call. In more recent developments, I am very pleased to announce that we closed on the sale of RSM yesterday. will walk you through the details of the transaction with the key take away that the final terms and conditions are consistent to those previously announced in August. I'd like to wish our friends at McGladrey the very best. For 12 years, they were partners and work by our sides. I am confident that these outstanding professionals will prosper in the years ahead. Another exciting development this past quarter was our renewed partnership with Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the country. We will operate in approximately 300 offices this year and while this does not materially impact our fiscal 2012 results, we certainly hope to grow this partnership in the coming years. Now, before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address Sand Canyon, our discontinued mortgage subsidiary. Sand Canyon increased third quarter -- third-party activity last quarter. In line of this activity, I' believe it was prudent of them to increase the reserve for estimated losses on warrant-related claims. It's important to note that as a subprime originator, Sand Canyon were more limited our prime originations. Because Sand Canyon is no longer in the business of originating or servicing loans, it is under no pressure to maintain any ongoing mortgage relationships. This means Sand Canyon has and will continue to review each claim on a loan-by-loan basis and will only pay valid claims. I want to emphasize 3 main points. First, the additional provision announced today does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's exposure to warrant-related claims. This is a critical point and it'll all of you here whether or not claim activity remains at elevated levels in the near future, we believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. Second, Sand Canyon is a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is very strong in any potential corporate vail piercing arguments. In other words, what happens a Sand Canyon stays at Sand Canyon. We're confident that H&R Block's future will not be impacted were by rep and warrant claims by Sand Canyon. And finally, none of this activity changes how we think about capital allocation. In fact, I am pleased that were able to take advantage of the market volatility this past quarter to repurchase and retire more than 4% of outstanding shares at an average price of $13.61 per share. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. As part of his remarks, Jeff will spend a good deal of time discussing Sand Canyon. We want you to be crystal clear on Sand Canyon's history, how we view them and how we're managing the situation. So now let's turn the clock call over to Jeff."

Today, we announced a per share loss from continuing operations of $0.41 for the quarter. This compares to a per share loss of $0.36 a year ago. Our loss increased I'm ready due to charges in the current quarter and adjusting for those charges our non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations are $115 million or $0.38 per share was essentially flat to our adjusted lost a year ago. Primarily due to results from our Australian tax operations, revenues in our Tax Services segment grew 9% for the quarter to $121 million. Segment incurred in off-season pretax loss of $174 million compared to a loss of $154 million a year ago. Losses increased primarily due to a charge of approximately $9 million in connection with the decision to discontinue expressed tax and an $8 million increase in litigation costs. Turning to discontinued operations, reported results now reflect both Sand Canyon and RSM McGladrey. Let me start by reviewing the details of yesterday's closing on the sale of RSM. We will receive total proceeds of approximately $575 million. That includes closing cash proceeds of $487 million, a note on teh principal amount of $54 million and approximately $34 million of cash which we expect to receive by calendar year end. MNP also assumed substantially all liabilities of the RSM business including contingent payments and lease obligations. As Bill mentioned, the final terms and conditions are consistent with those previously announced in August. References from the previously announced purchase price of $610 million are the result of cash of approximately $35 million transferred by RSM to H&R Block prior to closing. In addition, the salable trigger account distribution of approximately $80 million to RSM employees who are participants in H&R blocks sponsored deferred compensation plan. Now let me touch on second quarter results and discontinued operations. We reported a net loss of $19 million compared with net income of $2 million a year ago. Third quarter results include a $20 million pretax charge at Sand Canyon related to its reserve increase for estimated losses on a contingent loan repurchase obligations. As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in claim activity at Sand Canyon this quarter. Before I discuss the details about that claim activity and the related reserve increase, let me take a moment to review some historical context about the reps and warrants Sand Canyon provided in connection with loans it originated. As a reminder, Sand Canyon did not guaranty loan performance or underlying credit losses. Rather, it's loan related obligations pertain to valid claims for breaches of reps and warranties, typically, an alleged failure to appear to its stated underwriting guidelines. Asserted claims are reviewed by Sand Canyon on a loan-by-loan basis including a file-by-file review of loan origination documents. Invalid claims are rejected and claims Sand Canyon determines to be valid are satisfied. Because of its underwriting standards we routinely adhered to, and because it has completely exited the business, Sand Canyon has not been motivated to grant policy adjustments or to seek negotiated. Resolution of claims through a loan-by-loan review process has served Sand Canyon well and is the approach it expects to continue. As a true subprime originator, Sand Canyon's underwriting guidelines were typically broader than those of the prime originator. For example, many of its originations were stated income loans that did not require the originator to take any action to validate income levels provided by the borrower. In addition, it's important to remember that parties asserting claims must demonstrate causation. In other words, Sand Canyon has no obligation unless that there was an actual breach of a rep and warranty and that, that reach materially and adversely affected the interest of an investor. Demonstrating claims validity and causation of the material and adverse effect can be difficult. Since May 2008, Sand Canyon has reviewed claims on approximately 4,000 loans in the aggregate principal amount of $772 million. Of the claims it has reviewed, Sand Canyon has found about 85% to be invalid. Over that period, total incurred losses on valid claims were about $70 million. With that context, I'll now review second quarter claim activity. During the quarter, Sand Canyon completed a review of claims in the principal amount of $61 million and incurred losses on those claims totaled $3 million. New claims for alleged breaches of reps and warranties in the principal amount of $483 million were received in the quarter. The nature of those claims in the loans to which they relate including loan vintage, loan performance characteristics and alleged breaches of representations and warranties is consistent with claims received in prior periods. Second quarter activity included claims asserted by private label securitization trustees on behalf of bond holders of approximately $385 million. Additionally, claims totaling $85 million were asserted by monoline insurers and approximately $14 million of claims were the result of either recessions of mortgage insurance or asserted by other counterparties. All new claims were from loans originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007. Because Sand Canyon generally has up to 120 days to respond to claims, there are typically open things at the end of any quarter for which review is pending. Total claims under review at October 31 totaled $537 million. Sand Canyon reserves for contingent losses it determines are estimable or probable to occur. By assessing loan repurchase and indemnification obligations on both known claims and projections of future claims. After assessing observed third-party activity during the quarter, Sand Canyon recorded an increase to its reserve of $20 million and the reserve at October 31 now stands at $143 million. At October 31, Sand Canyon had equity of approximately $287 million, in addition to its reserves. For losses ever to exceed reserved amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon. We continue to believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. I agree with Bill's earlier statement, this recent activity does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's ultimate exposure to loss from rep and warrant related claims. Approximately 90% of claims received to date have related to origination during the 2006 and 2007 calendar years. Loans that were originated about 5 to 6 years ago. We assume future claim activity will relate to loans originated during these 2 years. We also believe that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less likely the default resulted from a rep and warranty breach and instead was more likely a result of external factors. Our historical claim data supports that belief. Based on claim activity to date, we have observed that valid claims relate almost exclusively to loans that became delinquent within the first 24 months following origination. Of the loans that Sand Canyon originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007, $9 billion became delinquent in the first 24 months. However, just because a loan experiences an early default does not necessarily mean there is any breach of the rep and warranty. Bondholders and other market participants understood and assumed the risk for credit losses of the securities they purchased act by subprime loans originated by Sand Canyon. We believe that a significant portion of the current level of losses in mortgage loans originated by Sand Canyon is the result of external factors and not necessarily a defect of the loan of origination. These include unprecedented declines in home prices, historic high levels of unemployment and other macroeconomic factors. And finally, let me provide a reminder about corporate separateness. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity. In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block. While we won't speculate what might happen in the event of a lawsuit or Sand Canyon bankruptcy, there has been no cases to date on which H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon. We have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block or the interests of H&R Block shareholders and creditors. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

As put back claims come in, this is about loan files. This is about an individual loan and as we said that we were approaching this, the way Sand Canyon is approaching this, it doesn't matter really who puts it back. It's about the loan that was granted to Person A at that particular time and whether or not principally Sand Canyon followed underwriting standards. So I think that the characterization whether where the put back came from is while interesting is really not the core issue because the way we evaluate any put back is on the loan file by loan file basis. And whether or not the disclosures that Sand Canyon made at that time were appropriately followed. And so that's principally what we're looking at and as Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we've got a fair amount of history on this. And so while characterizing where -- I think that's appropriate for us to do that but again, it comes down to that $200,000 individual loan mortgage that was given out and whether or not there's a valid claim from the counterparty.

Next tax season is quickly approaching, and we believe we've developed the right strategy for continued market share growth in tax season 2012 and beyond. Today's announcement by Intuit that it now needs live chat tax advisors to grow TurboTax validates our confidence in the assisted tax business. We look forward to sharing our plans and outlook with you next Thursday at our Investor Conference in New York City. We hope all of you can make it. 
Now today's call will be centered on our second quarter results. Earlier, we announced a net loss from continuing operations of $0.41 per share. As we shift our focus to growing clients and market share in our core tax business, we've taken significant steps to dispose of non-core assets, such as RSM McGladrey and ExpressTax. While this has led to onetime charges in each of the past 2 quarters, we're essentially clearing the decks for long-term earnings growth and higher margins. 
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, our second quarter net loss was essentially flat to last year, and Jeff will provide more details on this later in the call. In more recent developments, I am very pleased to announce that we closed on the sale of RSM yesterday. Jeff will walk you through the details of the transaction, but the key takeaway is that the final terms and conditions are consistent to those previously announced in August. I'd like to wish our friends at McGladrey the very best. For 12 years, they were our partners and worked by our sides. I'm confident that these outstanding professionals will prosper in the years ahead. 
Another exciting development this past quarter was our renewed partnership with Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the country. We will operate in approximately 300 offices this year. And while this does not materially impact our fiscal 2012 results, we certainly hope to grow this partnership in the coming years. 
Now before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address Sand Canyon, our discontinued mortgage subsidiary. Sand Canyon saw increased third quarter -- third-party activity last quarter. In light of this activity, I believe it was prudent of them to increase the reserve for estimated losses on rep and warrant-related claims. It's important to note that as a subprime originator, Sand Canyon's reps and warranties were more limited than would be typical of Alt-A or prime originations. Because Sand Canyon is no longer in the business of originating or servicing loans, it is under no pressure to maintain any ongoing mortgage relationships. This means Sand Canyon has and will continue to review each claim on a loan-by-loan basis and will only pay valid claims. 
I want to emphasize 3 main points. First, the additional provision announced today does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's exposure to rep and warrant-related claims. This is a critical point and I hope all of you hear. Whether or not claim activity remains at elevated levels in the near future, we believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. 
Second, Sand Canyon is a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is very strong in any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments. In other words, what happens at Sand Canyon stays at Sand Canyon. We're confident that H&R Block's future will not be impacted by rep and warrant claims of Sand Canyon. 
And finally, none of this activity changes how we think about capital allocation. In fact, I am pleased that we're able to take advantage of the market volatility this past quarter to repurchase and retire more than 4% of outstanding shares at an average price of $13.61 per share. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. 
As part of his remarks, Jeff will spend a good deal of time discussing Sand Canyon. We want you to be crystal clear on Sand Canyon's history, how we view them and how we're managing the situation. So now let's turn the call over to Jeff."
276601,142770056,198318,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2011",2011-12-01,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill.

Our loss increased primarily due to charges in the current quarter. And adjusting for those char",1361,"Thanks, Bill. Today, we announced a per share loss from continuing operations of $0.41 for the quarter. This compares to a per share loss of $0.36 a year ago. Our loss increased primarily due to charges in the current quarter. And adjusting for those charges, our non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $115 million or $0.38 per share was essentially flat to our adjusted loss a year ago. Primarily due to results from our Australian tax operations, revenues in our Tax Services segment grew 9% for the quarter to $121 million. The segment incurred an off-season pretax loss of $174 million compared to a loss of $154 million a year ago. Losses increased primarily due to a charge of approximately $9 million, in connection with the decision to discontinue ExpressTax and an $8 million increase in litigation costs. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Reported results now reflect both Sand Canyon and RSM McGladrey. Let me start by reviewing the details of yesterday's closing on the sale of RSM. We will receive total proceeds of approximately $575 million. That includes closing cash proceeds of $487 million, a note in the principal amount of $54 million and approximately $34 million of cash, which we expect to receive by calendar year end. M&P also assumed substantially all liabilities of the RSM business, including contingent payments and lease obligations. 
As Bill mentioned, the final terms and conditions are consistent with those previously announced in August. Differences from the previously announced purchase price of $610 million are the result of cash of approximately $35 million transferred by RSM to H&R Block prior to closing. In addition, the sale will trigger account distributions of approximately $80 million to RSM employees who are participants in an H&R Block-sponsored deferred compensation plan. 
Now let me touch on second quarter results and discontinued operations. We reported a net loss of $19 million compared with net income of $2 million a year ago. Third quarter results include a $20 million pretax charge at Sand Canyon, related to its reserve increase for estimated losses on contingent loan repurchase obligations. As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in claim activity at Sand Canyon this quarter. Before I discuss the details about that claim activity and the related reserve increase, let me take a moment to review some historical context about the reps and warrants Sand Canyon provided in connection with loans it originated. 
As a reminder, Sand Canyon did not guarantee loan performance or underlying credit losses. Rather, it's loan-related obligations pertained to valid claims for breaches of reps and warranties, typically an alleged failure to adhere to its stated underwriting guidelines. Asserted claims are reviewed by Sand Canyon on a loan-by-loan basis, including a file-by-file review of loan origination documents. Invalid claims are rejected, and claims Sand Canyon determines to be valid are satisfied. 
Because its underwriting standards were routinely adhered to and because it has completely exited the business, Sand Canyon has not been motivated to grant policy adjustments or to seek negotiated settlements. Resolution of claims through a loan-by-loan review process has served Sand Canyon well and is the approach it expects to continue. As a true subprime originator, Sand Canyon's underwriting guidelines were typically broader than those of a prime originator. 
For example, many of its originations were stated income loans that did not require the originator to take any action to validate income levels provided by the borrower. In addition, it's important to remember that parties asserting claims must demonstrate causation. In other words, Sand Canyon has no obligation, unless there was an actual breach of a rep and warranty, and if that breach materially and adversely affected the interest of an investor.  Demonstrating claim validity and causation of a material and adverse effect can be difficult. 
Since May 2008, Sand Canyon has reviewed claims on approximately 4,000 loans in the aggregate principal amount of $772 million. Of the claims it has reviewed, Sand Canyon has found about 85% be invalid. Over that period, total incurred losses on valid claims were about $70 million. 
With that context, I'll now review second quarter claim activity. During the quarter, Sand Canyon completed a review of claims in the principal amount of $61 million, and incurred losses on those claims totaled $3 million. New claims for alleged breaches of reps and warranties in the principal amount of $483 million were received in the quarter. The nature of those claims and the loans to which they relate, including loan vintage, loan performance characteristics and alleged breaches of representations and warranties, is consistent with claims received in prior periods. 
Second quarter activity included claims asserted by private label securitization trustees on behalf of bondholders of approximately $385 million. Additionally, claims totaling $85 million were asserted by monoline insurers, and approximately $14 million of claims were the result of either rescissions of mortgage insurance or asserted by other counterparties. 
All new claims were from loans originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007. Because Sand Canyon generally has up to 120 days to respond to claims, there are typically open claims at the end of any quarter for which review is pending. Total claims under review at October 31 totaled $537 million. Sand Canyon reserves for contingent losses it determines are estimable and probable to occur by assessing loan repurchase and indemnification obligations on both known claims and projections of future claims. 
After assessing observed third-party activity during the quarter, Sand Canyon recorded an increase to its reserve of $20 million. And the reserve at October 31 now stands at $143 million. At October 31, Sand Canyon had equity of approximately $287 million, in addition to its reserve. Where losses ever to exceed reserved amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon. 
We continue to believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. I agree with Bill's earlier statement: this recent activity does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's ultimate exposure to loss from rep and warrant-related claims. Approximately 90% of claims received to date have related to originations during the 2006 and 2007 calendar years, loans that were originated about 5 to 6 years ago. We assume future claim activity will relate to loans originated during these 2 years. 
We also believe that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less likely the default resulted from a rep and warranty breach and instead, was more likely a result of external factors. Our historical claim data supports that belief. Based on claim activity to date, we have observed that valid claims relate almost exclusively to loans that became delinquent within the first 24 months following origination. 
Of the loans that Sand Canyon originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007, $9 billion became delinquent in the first 24 months. However, just because a loan experiences an early default, it does not necessarily mean there is any breach of a rep and warranty. Bondholders and other market participants understood and assumed the risk for credit losses of the securities they purchased, backed by subprime loans originated by Sand Canyon. We believe that a significant portion of the current level of losses in mortgage loans originated by Sand Canyon is the result of external factors and not necessarily a defect of the loan at origination. These include unprecedented declines in home prices, historic high levels of unemployment and other macroeconomic factors. 
And finally, let me provide a reminder about corporate separateness. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity. In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block. While we won't speculate what might happen in the event of a lawsuit or a Sand Canyon bankruptcy, there have been no cases to date in which an H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon. We have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block or the interests of H&R Block's shareholders and creditors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

But let me go back to the -- what I think is potentially is the core issue. As put back claims come in, this is about loan files. This is about an individual loan. And as we've said the way we're approaching this, the way Sand Canyon is approaching this, is their -- it doesn't matter, really, who puts it back. It's about the loan that was granted to person A at that particular time and whether or not principally Sand Canyon followed underwriting standards. So I think that the characterization whether where the put back came from is, while interesting, is really not the core issue because the way we evaluate any put back is on a loan file by loan file basis. And whether or not the disclosures that Sand Canyon made at that time were appropriately followed. And so that's principally what we're looking at and we've -- as Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we've got a fair amount of history on this. And so while characterizing where I think that's appropriate for us to do that.

Next tax season is quickly approaching, and we believe we've developed the right strategy for continued market share growth in tax season 2012 and beyond. Today's announcement by Intuit that it now needs live chat tax advisors to grow TurboTax validates our confidence in the assisted tax business. We look forward to sharing our plans and outlook with you next Thursday at our Investor Conference in New York City. We hope all of you can make it. 
Now today's call will be centered on our second quarter results. Earlier, we announced a net loss from continuing operations of $0.41 per share. As we shift our focus to growing clients and market share in our core tax business, we've taken significant steps to dispose of non-core assets, such as RSM McGladrey and ExpressTax. While this has led to onetime charges in each of the past 2 quarters, we're essentially clearing the decks for long-term earnings growth and higher margins. 
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, our second quarter net loss was essentially flat to last year, and Jeff will provide more details on this later in the call. In more recent developments, I am very pleased to announce that we closed on the sale of RSM yesterday. Jeff will walk you through the details of the transaction, but the key takeaway is that the final terms and conditions were consistent to those previously announced in August. I'd like to wish our friends at McGladrey the very best. For 12 years, they were our partners and worked by our sides. I'm confident that these outstanding professionals will prosper in the years ahead. 
Another exciting development this past quarter was our renewed partnership with Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the country. We will operate in approximately 300 offices this year. And while this does not materially impact our fiscal 2012 results, we certainly hope to grow this partnership in the coming years. 
Now before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address Sand Canyon, our discontinued mortgage subsidiary. Sand Canyon saw increased third quarter -- third-party activity last quarter. In light of this activity, I believe it was prudent of them to increase the reserve for estimated losses on rep and warrant-related claims. It's important to note that as a subprime originator, Sand Canyon's reps and warranties were more limited than would be typical of Alt-A or prime originations. Because Sand Canyon is no longer in the business of originating or servicing loans, it is under no pressure to maintain any ongoing mortgage relationships. This means Sand Canyon has and will continue to review each claim on a loan-by-loan basis and will only pay valid claims. 
I want to emphasize 3 main points. First, the additional provision announced today does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's exposure to rep and warrant-related claims. This is a critical point and I hope all of you hear. Whether or not claim activity remains at elevated levels in the near future, we believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. 
Second, Sand Canyon is a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is very strong in any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments. In other words, what happens at Sand Canyon stays at Sand Canyon. We're confident that H&R Block's future will not be impacted by rep and warrant claims of Sand Canyon. 
And finally, none of this activity changes how we think about capital allocation. In fact, I am pleased that we're able to take advantage of the market volatility this past quarter to repurchase and retire more than 4% of outstanding shares at an average price of $13.61 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. As part of his remarks, Jeff will spend a good deal of time discussing Sand Canyon. We want you to be crystal clear on Sand Canyon's history, how we view them and how we're managing the situation. So now let's turn the call over to Jeff."
276601,142770056,198336,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2011",2011-12-01,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill.

Our loss increased primarily due to charges in the current quarter. And adjusting for those char",1360,"Thanks, Bill. Today, we announced a per share loss from continuing operations of $0.41 for the quarter. This compares to a per share loss of $0.36 a year ago. Our loss increased primarily due to charges in the current quarter. And adjusting for those charges, our non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $115 million or $0.38 per share was essentially flat to our adjusted loss a year ago. Primarily due to results from our Australian tax operations, revenues in our Tax Services segment grew 9% for the quarter to $121 million. The segment incurred an off-season pretax loss of $174 million compared to a loss of $154 million a year ago. Losses increased primarily due to a charge of approximately $9 million, in connection with the decision to discontinue ExpressTax and an $8 million increase in litigation costs. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Reported results now reflect both Sand Canyon and RSM McGladrey. Let me start by reviewing the details of yesterday's closing on the sale of RSM. We will receive total proceeds of approximately $575 million. That includes closing cash proceeds of $487 million, a note in the principal amount of $54 million and approximately $34 million of cash, which we expect to receive by calendar year end. M&P also assumed substantially all liabilities of the RSM business, including contingent payments and lease obligations. 
As Bill mentioned, the final terms and conditions are consistent with those previously announced in August. Differences from the previously announced purchase price of $610 million are the result of cash of approximately $35 million transferred by RSM to H&R Block prior to closing. In addition, the sale will trigger account distributions of approximately $80 million to RSM employees who are participants in an H&R Block-sponsored deferred compensation plan. 
Now let me touch on second quarter results and discontinued operations. We reported a net loss of $19 million compared with net income of $2 million a year ago. Third quarter results include a $20 million pretax charge at Sand Canyon, related to its reserve increase for estimated losses on contingent loan repurchase obligations. As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in claim activity at Sand Canyon this quarter. Before I discuss the details about that claim activity and the related reserve increase, let me take a moment to review some historical context about the reps and warrants Sand Canyon provided in connection with loans it originated. 
As a reminder, Sand Canyon did not guarantee loan performance or underlying credit losses. Rather, its loan-related obligations pertained to valid claims for breaches of reps and warranties, typically an alleged failure to adhere to its stated underwriting guidelines. Asserted claims are reviewed by Sand Canyon on a loan-by-loan basis, including a file-by-file review of loan origination documents. Invalid claims are rejected, and claims Sand Canyon determines to be valid are satisfied. 
Because its underwriting standards were routinely adhered to and because it has completely exited the business, Sand Canyon has not been motivated to grant policy adjustments or to seek negotiated settlements. Resolution of claims through a loan-by-loan review process has served Sand Canyon well and is the approach it expects to continue. As a true subprime originator, Sand Canyon's underwriting guidelines were typically broader than those of a prime originator. 
For example, many of its originations were stated income loans that did not require the originator to take any action to validate income levels provided by the borrower. In addition, it's important to remember that parties asserting claims must demonstrate causation. In other words, Sand Canyon has no obligation, unless there was an actual breach of a rep and warranty, and if that breach materially and adversely affected the interests of an investor.  Demonstrating claim validity and causation of a material and adverse effect can be difficult. 
Since May 2008, Sand Canyon has reviewed claims on approximately 4,000 loans in the aggregate principal amount of $772 million. Of the claims it has reviewed, Sand Canyon has found about 85% be invalid. Over that period, total incurred losses on valid claims were about $70 million. 
With that context, I'll now review second quarter claim activity. During the quarter, Sand Canyon completed a review of claims in the principal amount of $61 million, and incurred losses on those claims totaled $3 million. New claims for alleged breaches of reps and warranties in the principal amount of $483 million were received in the quarter. The nature of those claims and the loans to which they relate, including loan vintage, loan performance characteristics and alleged breaches of representations and warranties, is consistent with claims received in prior periods. 
Second quarter activity included claims asserted by private label securitization trustees on behalf of bondholders of approximately $385 million. Additionally, claims totaling $85 million were asserted by monoline insurers, and approximately $14 million of claims were the result of either rescissions of mortgage insurance or asserted by other counterparties. 
All new claims were from loans originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007. Because Sand Canyon generally has up to 120 days to respond to claims, there are typically open claims at the end of any quarter for which review is pending. Total claims under review at October 31 totaled $537 million. Sand Canyon reserves for contingent losses it determines are estimable and probable to occur by assessing loan repurchase and indemnification obligations on both known claims and projections of future claims. 
After assessing observed third-party activity during the quarter, Sand Canyon recorded an increase to its reserve of $20 million. And the reserve at October 31 now stands at $143 million. At October 31, Sand Canyon had equity of approximately $287 million, in addition to its reserve. Were losses ever to exceed reserved amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon. 
We continue to believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. I agree with Bill's earlier statement: this recent activity does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's ultimate exposure to loss from rep and warrant-related claims. Approximately 90% of claims received to date have related to originations during the 2006 and 2007 calendar years, loans that were originated about 5 to 6 years ago. We assume future claim activity will relate to loans originated during these 2 years. 
We also believe that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less likely the default resulted from a rep and warranty breach and instead, was more likely a result of external factors. Our historical claim data supports that belief. Based on claim activity to date, we have observed that valid claims relate almost exclusively to loans that became delinquent within the first 24 months following origination. 
Of the loans that Sand Canyon originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007, $9 billion became delinquent in the first 24 months. However, just because a loan experiences an early default does not necessarily mean there is any breach of a rep and warranty. Bondholders and other market participants understood and assumed the risk for credit losses of the securities they purchased, backed by subprime loans originated by Sand Canyon. We believe that a significant portion of the current level of losses in mortgage loans originated by Sand Canyon is the result of external factors and not necessarily a defect of the loan at origination. These include unprecedented declines in home prices, historic high levels of unemployment and other macroeconomic factors. 
And finally, let me provide a reminder about corporate separateness. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity. In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block. While we won't speculate what might happen in the event of a lawsuit or a Sand Canyon bankruptcy, there have been no cases to date in which an H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon. We have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block or the interests of H&R Block's shareholders and creditors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

And as we've said the way we're approaching this, the way Sand Canyon is approaching this, is their -- it doesn't matter, really, who puts it back. It's about the loan that was granted to person A at that particular time and whether or not principally Sand Canyon followed underwriting standards. So I think that the characterization whether where the put back came from is, while interesting, is really not the core issue because the way we evaluate any put back is on a loan file by loan file basis. And whether or not the disclosures that Sand Canyon made at that time were appropriately followed. And so that's principally what we're looking at and we've -- as Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we've got a fair amount of history on this.

Next tax season is quickly approaching, and we believe we've developed the right strategy for continued market share growth in tax season 2012 and beyond. Today's announcement by Intuit that it now needs live chat tax advisors to grow TurboTax validates our confidence in the assisted tax business. We look forward to sharing our plans and outlook with you next Thursday at our Investor Conference in New York City. We hope all of you can make it. 
Now today's call will be centered on our second quarter results. Earlier, we announced a net loss from continuing operations of $0.41 per share. As we shift our focus to growing clients and market share in our core tax business, we've taken significant steps to dispose of noncore assets, such as RSM McGladrey and ExpressTax. While this has led to onetime charges in each of the past 2 quarters, we're essentially clearing the decks for long-term earnings growth and higher margins. 
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, our second quarter net loss was essentially flat to last year, and Jeff will provide more details on this later in the call. In more recent developments, I am very pleased to announce that we closed on the sale of RSM yesterday. Jeff will walk you through the details of the transaction, but the key takeaway is that the final terms and conditions were consistent to those previously announced in August. I'd like to wish our friends at McGladrey the very best. For 12 years, they were our partners and worked by our sides. I'm confident that these outstanding professionals will prosper in the years ahead. 
Another exciting development this past quarter was our renewed partnership with Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the country. We will operate in approximately 300 offices this year. And while this does not materially impact our fiscal 2012 results, we certainly hope to grow this partnership in the coming years. 
Now before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address Sand Canyon, our discontinued mortgage subsidiary. Sand Canyon saw increased third quarter -- third-party activity last quarter. In light of this activity, I believe it was prudent of them to increase the reserve for estimated losses on rep and warrant-related claims. It's important to note that as a subprime originator, Sand Canyon's reps and warranties were more limited than would be typical of Alt-A or prime originations. And because Sand Canyon is no longer in the business of originating or servicing loans, it is under no pressure to maintain any ongoing mortgage relationships. This means Sand Canyon has and will continue to review each claim on a loan-by-loan basis and will only pay valid claims. 
I want to emphasize 3 main points. First, the additional provision announced today does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's exposure to rep and warrant-related claims. This is a critical point and I hope all of you hear. Whether or not claim activity remains at elevated levels in the near future, we believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. 
Second, Sand Canyon is a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is very strong in any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments. In other words, what happens at Sand Canyon stays at Sand Canyon. We're confident that H&R Block's future will not be impacted by rep and warrant claims of Sand Canyon. 
And finally, none of this activity changes how we think about capital allocation. In fact, I am pleased that we were able to take advantage of the market volatility this past quarter to repurchase and retire more than 4% of outstanding shares at an average price of $13.61 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. As part of his remarks, Jeff will spend a good deal of time discussing Sand Canyon. We want you to be crystal clear on Sand Canyon's history, how we view them and how we're managing the situation. So now let's turn the call over to Jeff."
276601,142770056,204749,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2011",2011-12-01,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Today, we announced a per share loss from continuing operations of $0.41 for the quarter. This compares to a per share loss of $0.36 a year ago. Our loss increased primarily due to charges in the current quarter. And adjusting for those char",1361,"Thanks, Bill. Today, we announced a per share loss from continuing operations of $0.41 for the quarter. This compares to a per share loss of $0.36 a year ago. Our loss increased primarily due to charges in the current quarter. And adjusting for those charges, our non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $115 million or $0.38 per share was essentially flat to our adjusted loss a year ago. Primarily due to results from our Australian tax operations, revenues in our Tax Services segment grew 9% for the quarter to $121 million. The segment incurred an off-season pretax loss of $174 million compared to a loss of $154 million a year ago. Losses increased primarily due to a charge of approximately $9 million in connection with the decision to discontinue ExpressTax and an $8 million increase in litigation costs. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Reported results now reflect both Sand Canyon and RSM McGladrey. Let me start by reviewing the details of yesterday's closing on the sale of RSM. We will receive total proceeds of approximately $575 million. That includes closing cash proceeds of $487 million, a note in the principal amount of $54 million and approximately $34 million of cash, which we expect to receive by calendar year end. M&P also assumed substantially all liabilities of the RSM business, including contingent payments and lease obligations. 
As Bill mentioned, the final terms and conditions are consistent with those previously announced in August. Differences from the previously announced purchase price of $610 million are the result of cash of approximately $35 million transferred by RSM to H&R Block prior to closing. In addition, the sale will trigger account distributions of approximately $80 million to RSM employees who are participants in an H&R Block-sponsored deferred compensation plan. 
Now let me touch on second quarter results and discontinued operations. We reported a net loss of $19 million compared with net income of $2 million a year ago. Current quarter results include a $20 million pretax charge at Sand Canyon, related to its reserve increase for estimated losses on contingent loan repurchase obligations. As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in claim activity at Sand Canyon this quarter. Before I discuss the details about that claim activity and the related reserve increase, let me take a moment to review some historical context about the reps and warrants Sand Canyon provided in connection with loans it originated. 
As a reminder, Sand Canyon did not guarantee loan performance or underlying credit losses. Rather, its loan-related obligations pertained to valid claims for breaches of reps and warranties, typically an alleged failure to adhere to its stated underwriting guidelines. Asserted claims are reviewed by Sand Canyon on a loan-by-loan basis, including a file-by-file review of loan origination documents. Invalid claims are rejected, and claims Sand Canyon determines to be valid are satisfied. 
Because its underwriting standards were routinely adhered to and because it has completely exited the business, Sand Canyon has not been motivated to grant policy adjustments or to seek negotiated settlements. Resolution of claims through a loan-by-loan review process has served Sand Canyon well and is the approach it expects to continue. 
As a true subprime originator, Sand Canyon's underwriting guidelines were typically broader than those of a prime originator. For example, many of its originations were stated income loans that did not require the originator to take any action to validate income levels provided by the borrower. In addition, it's important to remember that parties asserting claims must demonstrate causation. In other words, Sand Canyon has no obligation unless there was an actual breach of a rep and warranty and if that breach materially and adversely affected the interests of an investor. Demonstrating claim validity and causation of a material and adverse effect can be difficult. 
Since May 2008, Sand Canyon has reviewed claims on approximately 4,000 loans in the aggregate principal amount of $772 million. Of the claims it has reviewed, Sand Canyon has found about 85% to be invalid. Over that period, total incurred losses on valid claims were about $70 million. 
With that context, I'll now review second quarter claim activity. During the quarter, Sand Canyon completed a review of claims in the principal amount of $61 million and incurred losses on those claims totaled $3 million. New claims for alleged breaches of reps and warranties in the principal amount of $483 million were received in the quarter. The nature of those claims and the loans to which they relate, including loan vintage, loan performance characteristics and alleged breaches of representations and warranties, is consistent with claims received in prior periods. 
Second quarter activity included claims asserted by private label securitization trustees on behalf of bondholders of approximately $385 million. Additionally, claims totaling $85 million were asserted by monoline insurers, and approximately $14 million of claims were the result of either rescissions of mortgage insurance or asserted by other counterparties. All new claims were from loans originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007. 
Because Sand Canyon generally has up to 120 days to respond to claims, there are typically open claims at the end of any quarter for which review is pending. Total claims under review at October 31 totaled $537 million. Sand Canyon reserves for contingent losses it determines are estimable and probable to occur by assessing loan repurchase and indemnification obligations on both known claims and projections of future claims. 
After assessing observed third-party activity during the quarter, Sand Canyon recorded an increase to its reserve of $20 million. And the reserve at October 31 now stands at $143 million. At October 31, Sand Canyon had equity of approximately $287 million, in addition to its reserve. Were losses ever to exceed reserved amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon. We continue to believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. 
I agree with Bill's earlier statement: this recent activity does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's ultimate exposure to loss from rep and warrant-related claims. Approximately 90% of claims received to date have related to originations during the 2006 and 2007 calendar years, loans that were originated about 5 to 6 years ago. We assume future claim activity will relate to loans originated during these 2 years. 
We also believe that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less likely the default resulted from a rep and warranty breach and instead, was more likely a result of external factors. Our historical claim data supports that belief. Based on claim activity to date, we have observed that valid claims relate almost exclusively to loans that became delinquent within the first 24 months following origination. Of the loans that Sand Canyon originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007, $9 billion became delinquent in the first 24 months. 
However, just because a loan experiences an early default does not necessarily mean there is any breach of a rep and warranty. Bondholders and other market participants understood and assumed the risk for credit losses of the securities they purchased, backed by subprime loans originated by Sand Canyon. We believe that a significant portion of the current level of losses in mortgage loans originated by Sand Canyon is the result of external factors and not necessarily a defect of the loan at origination. These include unprecedented declines in home prices, historic high levels of unemployment and other macroeconomic factors. 
And finally, let me provide a reminder about corporate separateness. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity. In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block. While we won't speculate what might happen in the event of a lawsuit or a Sand Canyon bankruptcy, there have been no cases to date in which an H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon. We have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block or the interests of H&R Block's shareholders and creditors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

Today, my team and I are squarely focused on growing share, and you will see that at next week's Investor Conference. I'm optimistic that we are well positioned to build upon last year's momentum, and I'm confident that the strategy we'll share with you next week will drive sustainable long-term growth and improve shareholder returns. 
With that, we'll move to questions. As a reminder, we would like to limit questions today to matters pertaining to these quarterly results and save questions about long-term strategy, capital allocation and the coming tax season to next week's Investor Conference.

But let me go back to the -- what I think is potentially is the core issue. As putback claims come in, this is about loan files. This is about an individual loan. And as we've said, the way we're approaching this, the way Sand Canyon is approaching this, is their -- it doesn't matter, really, who puts it back. It's about the loan that was granted to person A at that particular time and whether or not principally Sand Canyon followed underwriting standards. So I think that the characterization whether where the putback came from is, while interesting, is really not the core issue because the way we evaluate any putback is on a loan file by loan file basis. And whether or not the disclosures that Sand Canyon made at that time were appropriately followed. And so that's principally what we're looking at and we've -- as Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we've got a fair amount of history on this. And so while characterizing where I think that's appropriate for us to do that.

Next tax season is quickly approaching, and we believe we've developed the right strategy for continued market share growth in tax season 2012 and beyond. Today's announcement by Intuit that it now needs live chat tax advisors to grow TurboTax validates our confidence in the assisted tax business. We look forward to sharing our plans and outlook with you next Thursday at our Investor Conference in New York City. We hope all of you can make it. 
Now today's call will be centered on our second quarter results. Earlier, we announced a net loss from continuing operations of $0.41 per share. As we shift our focus to growing clients and market share in our core tax business, we've taken significant steps to dispose of noncore assets, such as RSM McGladrey and ExpressTax. While this has led to onetime charges in each of the past 2 quarters, we're essentially clearing the decks for long-term earnings growth and higher margins. 
On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, our second quarter net loss was essentially flat to last year, and Jeff will provide more details on this later in the call. In more recent developments, I am very pleased to announce that we closed on the sale of RSM yesterday. Jeff will walk you through the details of the transaction, but the key takeaway is that the final terms and conditions were consistent to those previously announced in August. I'd like to wish our friends at McGladrey the very best. For 12 years, they were our partners and worked by our sides. I'm confident that these outstanding professionals will prosper in the years ahead. 
Another exciting development this past quarter was our renewed partnership with Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the country. We will operate in approximately 300 offices this year. And while this does not materially impact our fiscal 2012 results, we certainly hope to grow this partnership in the coming years. 
Now before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take a moment to address Sand Canyon, our discontinued mortgage subsidiary. Sand Canyon saw increased third quarter -- third-party activity last quarter. In light of this activity, I believe it was prudent of them to increase the reserve for estimated losses on rep and warrant-related claims. It's important to note that as a subprime originator, Sand Canyon's reps and warranties were more limited than would be typical of Alt-A or prime originations. And because Sand Canyon is no longer in the business of originating or servicing loans, it is under no pressure to maintain any ongoing mortgage relationships. This means Sand Canyon has and will continue to review each claim on a loan-by-loan basis and will only pay valid claims. 
I want to emphasize 3 main points. First, the additional provision announced today does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's exposure to rep and warrant-related claims. This is a critical point and I hope all of you hear. Whether or not claim activity remains at elevated levels in the near future, we believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. 
Second, Sand Canyon is a separate legal entity from H&R Block. We believe our legal position is very strong in any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments. In other words, what happens at Sand Canyon stays at Sand Canyon. We're confident that H&R Block's future will not be impacted by rep and warrant claims of Sand Canyon. 
And finally, none of this activity changes how we think about capital allocation. In fact, I am pleased that we were able to take advantage of the market volatility this past quarter to repurchase and retire more than 4% of outstanding shares at an average price of $13.61 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. As part of his remarks, Jeff will spend a good deal of time discussing Sand Canyon. We want you to be crystal clear on Sand Canyon's history, how we view them and how we're managing the situation. So now let's turn the call over to Jeff."
276601,142770056,204781,"H&R Block, Inc., Q2 2012 Earnings Call, Dec 01, 2011",2011-12-01,"Earnings Calls","H&R Block, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. Today, we announced a per share loss from continuing operations of $0.41 for the quarter. This compares to a per share loss of $0.36 a year ago.

Today, we announced a per share loss from continuing operations of $0.41 for the quarter. This compares to a per share loss of $0.36 a year ago. Our loss increased primarily due to charges in the current quarter. And adjusting for those charges, our non-GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $115 million or $0.38 per share was essentially flat to our adjusted loss a year ago. Primarily due to results from our Australian tax operations, revenues in our Tax Services segment grew 9% for the quarter to $121 million. The segment incurred an off-season pretax loss of $174 million compared to a loss of $154 million a year ago. Losses increased primarily due to a charge of approximately $9 million in connection with the decision to discontinue ExpressTax and an $8 million increase in litigation costs. 
Turning to discontinued operations. Reported results now reflect both Sand Canyon and RSM McGladrey. Let me start by reviewing the details of yesterday's closing on the sale of RSM. We will receive total proceeds of approximately $575 million. That includes closing cash proceeds of $487 million, a note in the principal amount of $54 million and approximately $34 million of cash, which we expect to receive by calendar year end. M&P also assumed substantially all liabilities of the RSM business, including contingent payments and lease obligations. 
As Bill mentioned, the final terms and conditions are consistent with those previously announced in August. Differences from the previously announced purchase price of $610 million are the result of cash of approximately $35 million transferred by RSM to H&R Block prior to closing. In addition, the sale will trigger account distributions of approximately $80 million to RSM employees who are participants in an H&R Block-sponsored deferred compensation plan. 
Now let me touch on second quarter results and discontinued operations. We reported a net loss of $19 million compared with net income of $2 million a year ago. Current quarter results include a $20 million pretax charge at Sand Canyon, related to its reserve increase for estimated losses on contingent loan repurchase obligations. As Bill mentioned, we saw an increase in claim activity at Sand Canyon this quarter. Before I discuss the details about that claim activity and the related reserve increase, let me take a moment to review some historical context about the reps and warrants Sand Canyon provided in connection with loans it originated. 
As a reminder, Sand Canyon did not guarantee loan performance or underlying credit losses. Rather, its loan-related obligations pertained to valid claims for breaches of reps and warranties, typically an alleged failure to adhere to its stated underwriting guidelines. Asserted claims are reviewed by Sand Canyon on a loan-by-loan basis, including a file-by-file review of loan origination documents. Invalid claims are rejected, and claims Sand Canyon determines to be valid are satisfied. 
Because its underwriting standards were routinely adhered to and because it has completely exited the business, Sand Canyon has not been motivated to grant policy adjustments or to seek negotiated settlements. Resolution of claims through a loan-by-loan review process has served Sand Canyon well and is the approach it expects to continue. 
As a true subprime originator, Sand Canyon's underwriting guidelines were typically broader than those of a prime originator. For example, many of its originations were stated income loans that did not require the originator to take any action to validate income levels provided by the borrower. In addition, it's important to remember that parties asserting claims must demonstrate causation. In other words, Sand Canyon has no obligation unless there was an actual breach of a rep and warranty and if that breach materially and adversely affected the interests of an investor. Demonstrating claim validity and causation of a material and adverse effect can be difficult. 
Since May 2008, Sand Canyon has reviewed claims on approximately 4,000 loans in the aggregate principal amount of $772 million. Of the claims it has reviewed, Sand Canyon has found about 85% to be invalid. Over that period, total incurred losses on valid claims were about $70 million. 
With that context, I'll now review second quarter claim activity. During the quarter, Sand Canyon completed a review of claims in the principal amount of $61 million and incurred losses on those claims totaled $3 million. New claims for alleged breaches of reps and warranties in the principal amount of $483 million were received in the quarter. The nature of those claims and the loans to which they relate, including loan vintage, loan performance characteristics and alleged breaches of representations and warranties, is consistent with claims received in prior periods. 
Second quarter activity included claims asserted by private label securitization trustees on behalf of bondholders of approximately $385 million. Additionally, claims totaling $85 million were asserted by monoline insurers, and approximately $14 million of claims were the result of either rescissions of mortgage insurance or asserted by other counterparties. All new claims were from loans originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007. 
Because Sand Canyon generally has up to 120 days to respond to claims, there are typically open claims at the end of any quarter for which review is pending. Total claims under review at October 31 totaled $537 million. Sand Canyon reserves for contingent losses it determines are estimable and probable to occur by assessing loan repurchase and indemnification obligations on both known claims and projections of future claims. 
After assessing observed third-party activity during the quarter, Sand Canyon recorded an increase to its reserve of $20 million. And the reserve at October 31 now stands at $143 million. At October 31, Sand Canyon had equity of approximately $287 million, in addition to its reserve. Were losses ever to exceed reserved amounts, those losses would be charged against the remaining equity of Sand Canyon. We continue to believe Sand Canyon's financial position is sufficient to satisfy all valid claims. 
I agree with Bill's earlier statement: this recent activity does not change how we think about Sand Canyon's ultimate exposure to loss from rep and warrant-related claims. Approximately 90% of claims received to date have related to originations during the 2006 and 2007 calendar years, loans that were originated about 5 to 6 years ago. We assume future claim activity will relate to loans originated during these 2 years. 
We also believe that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less likely the default resulted from a rep and warranty breach and instead, was more likely a result of external factors. Our historical claim data supports that belief. Based on claim activity to date, we have observed that valid claims relate almost exclusively to loans that became delinquent within the first 24 months following origination. Of the loans that Sand Canyon originated in calendar years 2006 and 2007, $9 billion became delinquent in the first 24 months. 
However, just because a loan experiences an early default does not necessarily mean there is any breach of a rep and warranty. Bondholders and other market participants understood and assumed the risk for credit losses of the securities they purchased, backed by subprime loans originated by Sand Canyon. We believe that a significant portion of the current level of losses in mortgage loans originated by Sand Canyon is the result of external factors and not necessarily a defect of the loan at origination. These include unprecedented declines in home prices, historic high levels of unemployment and other macroeconomic factors. 
And finally, let me provide a reminder about corporate separateness. Since its acquisition by H&R Block in 1997, Sand Canyon has been and continues to be operated as a separate legal entity. In addition, Sand Canyon never paid any dividends to H&R Block. While we won't speculate what might happen in the event of a lawsuit or a Sand Canyon bankruptcy, there have been no cases to date in which an H&R Block entity was held liable for the acts of Sand Canyon. We have no reason to believe that a court would disregard the legal separateness of Sand Canyon and H&R Block or the interests of H&R Block's shareholders and creditors. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for closing remarks."

But let me go back to the -- what I think is potentially is the core issue. As putback claims come in, this is about loan files. This is about an individual loan.

It's about the loan that was granted to person A at that particular time and whether or not principally Sand Canyon followed underwriting standards. So I think that the characterization whether where the putback came from is, while interesting, is really not the core issue because the way we evaluate any putback is on a loan file by loan file basis.

And so that's principally what we're looking at and we've -- as Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we've got a fair amount of history on this.
