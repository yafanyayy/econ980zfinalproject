Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2010 fourth quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.
During our call today, we will be talking about results for the full year or fourth quarter of 2010 and comparing them with the same period in 2009, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding aquisitions, which for the purposes of this presentation also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Net revenues excludes excise taxes. Operating companies income is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.
You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and operating companies income, or OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections. 
It is now my pleasure to introduce Louie Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer, who will join Louis for the question-and-answer period. Louis?"

And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. With much of the developed world still grappling with stubbornly high unemployment levels, debilitating heavy burdens and bleak budget deficits, we posted what I would characterize as a solid financial performance in 2010. Unprecedented excise tax hikes affecting six markets in particular, coupled with continued economic uncertainty spurred double-digit declines in industry volumes, further consumer down trading, a more pronounced pattern of heightened price competition and a surge in the incidence of illicit trade in those countries.
Regretfully, these factors adversely affected our organic volume performance. However, despite these challenges, we posted robust increases in our earnings per share and cash flow. Importantly, we outperformed our international competitors in terms of organic volume and market share growth.
The strategic highlight of the year was the highly promising transaction with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. This not only widened our share leadership in Asia, but I am sure will be a source of solid income growth for years to come.
Our cigarette volume rose 4.1% in 2010 to reach a level of nearly 900 billion units. Absent the creation of PMFTC in the Philippines, our organic volumes fell short of the prior year by 2.5%. The shortfall is virtually entirely attributable to significant declines in industry volumes affecting Greece, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine. Indeed, absent these six markets, which collectively suffered the volume erosion of some 14%, our volume performance in all other markets representing close to 80% of our volume base, grew at an organic rate of 1%. 
While the headline organic volume number in the fourth quarter points to a deterioration in our performance relative to the full year, this was entirely attributable to Japan and Ukraine, which suffered volume shortfalls of 43% and 35%, respectively. Absent these two markets, our fourth quarter organic volume performance was essentially equal to that of the full year.
Our market share performance, despite the challenges we faced, was solid. Indeed, our total worldwide share, excluding China and the USA, but including the business combination with Fortune Tobacco, on a pro forma basis, rose to 27.9% for the full year and 28.1% in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both OECD and non-OECD markets while exhibiting sequential improvements and hence momentum in both geographies. 
We also grew share in our 30 most profitable markets.
While our aggregate share performance was solid and broad based, we did suffer erosion in several markets, notably in Germany, Greece, Turkey and Ukraine. Steps have recently been taken or planned in all four markets to address these shortcomings. Marlboro's share momentum improved as the year unfolded, despite the challenging economic environment. This is testament to the success and continued disciplined deployment of the brand's new architecture. In virtually all instances, we're witnessing improvements in the brand's key image attributes and demographic profile, particularly in regards to the Gold pillar. Marlboro's performance in Asia was singularly robust, behind the continued success of several entries focused on the fresh pillar, such as Black Menthol and Ice Blast. Marlboro's momentum is confirmed by its six-month moving share trend shown on the chart.
L&M remains a two-pronged story. It continues to grow and is highly successful in the European Union region, but also continues to shed volume and share in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia. Plans are in place to strive to correct this. 
Net revenues of $27.2 billion were up 8.7% for the full year and 4.8% for the quarter. While on an organic basis, that is excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, they rose 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. This fell short of our mid- to long-term objectives reflecting the volume and mix erosion in the previously mentioned countries due to the abnormal excise tax increases that adversely affected each of them. Adjusted operating companies income of $11.5 billion rose 10.3% for the full year and 12.2% for the quarter. On an organic basis, the increase was 5.8% for the full year and a robust 9.9% in the fourth quarter. Not surprisingly, pricing was the key driver of our income growth with a particularly strong delivery in the fourth quarter. Our full-year pricing variants approached $1.7 billion, of which close to $600 million or 35% was recorded in the fourth quarter. I trust that these numbers will reinforce the belief that our pricing power, despite a very challenging economic environment, remains intact. 
I should highlight that the fourth quarter pricing variance was flattened by the price increase we obtained on the inventory held by our Japanese distributor on October 1. This accounted for approximately 20% of the total pricing variance in the quarter.
We are very pleased with the progress across all regions of our adjusted operating margins, excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full year, on a worldwide basis, they reached 42.6%, up 0.9 points. This reflects both our strong pricing and our continued efforts to generate productivity gains and cost savings as we completed our three-year $1.5 billion program.
Our earnings per share performance was singularly robust, exceeded our mid- to long-term targets for the third year in succession. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.87 for the full year and $0.97 for the quarter rose 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Excluding the favorable impact of currency of $0.12 for the year and $0.01 for the quarter, earnings per share rose 14% in 2010 and 18.5% in the fourth quarter.
As strong as our earnings per share performance was, it was surpassed by that of our cash flow. Indeed, our free cash flow rose by some $1.6 billion or 21.7% on a currency neutral basis to a record level of $8.7 billion. This performance was due in large part to the strict management of our working capital and in particular a reduction in our receivables and inventories, reflecting our efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows is a hallmark of our company. You may recall that at the time of our spinoff in March 2008, we set a three-year cumulative operating cash flow target of $21.7 billion. Fast forward to today, and we have handsomely exceeded that target by $3.5 billion or 16% to reach a cumulative operating cash flow of $25.2 billion, and this, despite an adverse currency impact of some $500 million. 
Our strong and growing cash flow has underpinned our ability to reward our shareholders through higher dividends in our share repurchase programs. We have increased our dividend by a cumulative total of 39.1% since the spin and by the end of December of 2010 had repurchased 334 million shares or 15.8% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin at an average price of $47.83.
While I cannot deny that 2010 was a tough year in many respects, we were able to overcome most of the significant roadblocks that were erected in our part. Our earnings per share and cash flow results were quite exceptional given the economic challenges that have yet to be profoundly resolved primarily in the Western world. It is against this fragile economic backdrop that we look to 2011. 
As disclosed in our earnings statement released this morning, we project another strong year in our key financial metrics, with a reported diluted earnings per share guidance falling within the range of $4.35 to $4.45 versus $3.92 in 2010. On an adjusted basis, compared to $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 12.5% to 15% at prevailing exchange rates, an approximately 10% to 12.5% on a constant currency basis.
We believe that our guidance appropriately reflects a cautious balance of the risks and opportunities that always accompany any projections made this early in the year. I should also highlight that this guidance assumes an underlying effective tax rate that is expected to be some 70 basis points higher than that incurred in 2010. The key risk to our earnings projection is a potential for disruptive excise tax increases and adverse movements in the structuring thereof as we painfully witnessed in 2010. While last year we faced an unprecedented number of countries that turned to tobacco to generate additional revenues by raising excise taxes to levels that went beyond any reasonable expectation. So far this year, the news on excise taxes is with one key exception relatively benign. The one exception is, of course, Mexico, with the average excise tax burden was increased on January 1 by 50% in one fell swoop. Elsewhere, other than the adverse impact of the annualization of 2010 increases, the excise tax increases that have been announced appeared to be manageable.
Furthermore and very importantly, we have witnessed a number of encouraging structural changes driven in large measure by the new excise tax directive in the European Union. Indeed, France, the Netherlands, Sweden have all increased by their specific-to-total tax ratios, and Greece had significantly improved its tax structure. In addition, in Germany, we have a new tax law that provides for reasonable increases and visibility over a five-year period.
Unemployment remains persistently high in many companies and continues to affect both industry volumes and mix. In addition, inflation, particularly as it relates to basic food commodities, remains a concern relative to consumer discretionary income levels in numerous markets. Furthermore, recent events in North Africa are likely to impact our performance, and we can only hope that this will be a temporary phenomenon. 
In light of these dynamics, we expect our organic volume performance to mirror that reported in 2010. Japan and Mexico will dampen our volume prospects in 2011 and given the economic uncertainty, we continue to project volume softness in Greece, Pakistan, Spain and Ukraine. Also we project a slightly weaker volume trend in both France and Italy, reflecting retail price increases ahead of inflation. 
Elsewhere, we anticipate a solid volume performance led by Indonesia, Korea and Russia as well as a projected recovery in Turkey.
The outcome of volume impact of the tax-driven price increase in Japan remains the single largest question mark. It will also affect our quarterly volume performance in a significant manner, with pronounced weakness in the first half and gradual but consistent improvement in the second half. While it is too early to gauge precise volume trends, January sales were modestly better than we had anticipated. And accordingly, the assumptions for Japan on which our earnings guidance is predicated, may prove to be somewhat overly cautious.
Given our share momentum and the initiatives we have planned, we anticipate another year of solid market share performance. Persistently high unemployment levels will continue to exert pressure on the premium segment in some markets, but we believe that in most instances, we can more than offset this dynamic, given the breadth of our brand portfolio.
Pricing will continue to be the key driver of our income growth. We project a price variance exceeding that recorded, [ph] driven in part by the price increase in Japan. Indeed, more than 60% of the pricing embedded in our 2011 guidance has already been announced or implemented. We anticipate some cost pressure, driven in large measure by the historical leaf tobacco price increases that will continue to affect our product costs in 2011. The more expensive materials in packaging associated with the Marlboro architecture, another premium brand offering, as well as the cost associated with the implementation of reduced cigarette ignition propensity rules in the European Union in the fourth quarter.
We will implement a number of productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the year, and we have set a target of pretax cost savings of $250 million in 2011. 
Finally, we anticipate another strong cash flow performance and share repurchases of $5 billion in 2011 in line with the level dispersed in 2010.
All in all, 2010 proved to be a difficult year, but we posted results that compares very favorably to our consumer product peers. We enter 2011 with clear momentum and exciting plans. The so-called two-speed recovery remains fragile, but we look forward to the year with cautious optimism. There is likely to be continued volatility in currency market and other uncertainties, but we have the human and financial resources as well as numerous planned initiatives to sustain our momentum and post another year of solid growth. 
Hermann and I will now be happy to answer your questions."

Let's go one by one.

Let's go one by one. As you're probably aware, in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany and has the best demographic age profile today followed by Marlboro, a lot of the market has shifted to what I call big packs and maxi packs. So big packs are 25, 24, 25 cigarettes a pack versus the traditional 19. And there's been a proliferation of now maxi packs, which are 28 cigarettes or 29 cigarettes a pack. Both big packs and maxi packs sell at a considerable discount to a conventional packaging of 19 cigarettes. Marlboro was at a competitive disadvantage because we were somewhat slow to react with the maxi pack, in particular. So in the fourth quarter, we launched the Marlboro maxi pack. It does not offer the same discount as its competitors, but still does offer some discount. And we actually saw an improvement in Marlboro's performance in the fourth quarter. So that will continue. The other thing to note is that -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we now visibility on excise taxes. There's an excise tax increase due for May 1. The structure is pretty good at the low end. The tax part is 13 euro cents a pack. At the premium end it's 4 cents a pack. So that's pretty good news. So Germany, L&M is in great shape. Marlboro is now competitive with the advent of maxi packs and let's see how things proceed. In Turkey, we were at a significant price disadvantage because we let prices at the time of the tax increase, which you may recall a significant, and not everybody followed to the extent that we led. That put us at a pretty significant competitive disadvantage, especially with a significant down trading that took place and a surge in illicit trade that accompanied the tax increase. Today, some 20% of cigarette consumption in Turkey is illicit trade. We have tried to convince the government to restructure taxes so far in that hasn't been much progress on that front, but we continue to because we optimistic that over time they will realize that it's in their interest. We the repositioned L&M in the fourth quarter and in fact our share grew in the fourth quarter in Turkey that is why I mentioned we anticipate a recovery in Turkey. In Greece, the tax structure has improved significantly with the tax reform. As you know, Greece has been a drag on the whole European Union, volume and income it remained at 3% drag for the year in terms of EU's growth. I think there's just been with the tax restructuring a tax increase across the board and we are confident that Greece will no longer be a drag and that we can continue to gain shift. Ukraine, essentially what you've seen is that over the last couple of years there have been huge success of excise tax increases such that in a two-year period, the low-priced segment has tripled in retail prices and the premium segment has doubled. So today at the low end, brands such as Bond Street, their retail price is equivalent to what the price of Parliament was two years ago. What has happened is that the market has compressed into the premium segment and the low priced segment, and the mid-priced segment is under huge pressure. In fact, we're doing very well in the premium segment and we've lost in the mid- segment and the low-priced segment, and we have plans in place to address that.

What you see is that when you pass certain thresholds, stick prices in particular and pack prices, there is a temporary slowdown in a brand's performance. There has been a new excise tax decree that came out, which clearly is manageable. Excise tax increases are essentially in line with inflation. The disappointment was that we had hoped that there would be a compression in the various tiers that hasn't quite happened as much as we had hoped, but that hopefully will happen going forward.

It appears that the Australian government remains intent on pursuing a legislation calling for plain packaging. We'll see what happens. My guess is we'll know a lot more by this summer, but there certainly seems to be a strong intent to pursue it. It's sort of defies logic because I don't think that it will affect consumption levels in any way. And furthermore, the big concern is illicit trade, which since the tax increase last summer, illicit trade has increased by 25% in Australia. So I am hopeful that the government is looking at that very closely because plain packaging will certainly not address that issue and does not, will not address smoking incidents or smoking prevalence. The U.K. has said that they would study it, but that they would have to have clear unequivocal evidence, that it would in fact address smoking prevalence or incidents and that they would have to look at very carefully the legal ramifications of such a measure with regard to constitutional issues as well as IP issues, also related to trade issues and the trade agreements and the intellectual property protection that comes with those trade agreements. So the U.K. is looking at it very sensibly. In the EU, the Gesanco [ph], the health commissioner as it were, has started a revision of the tobacco product directive and is looking at a whole slew of measures. That's probably a three- to five-year process. But as I say, I think plain packaging doesn't make any sense and we will fight plain packaging in every way possible. Does that address your question?"

Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2010 full year and fourth quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.
During our call today, we will be talking about results for the full year or fourth quarter of 2010 and comparing them with the same period in 2009, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, which for the purposes of this presentation also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Net revenues excludes excise taxes. Operating companies income is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.
You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues on operating companies' income, or OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.

With much of the developed world still grappling with stubbornly high unemployment levels, debilitatingly heavy debt burdens and bleak budget deficits, we posted, what I would characterize, as a s",2063,"Thank you, Nick. And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. With much of the developed world still grappling with stubbornly high unemployment levels, debilitatingly heavy debt burdens and bleak budget deficits, we posted, what I would characterize, as a solid financial performance in 2010. Unprecedented excise tax hikes affecting six markets in particular, coupled with continued economic uncertainty spurred double-digit declines in industry volumes, further consumer down trading, a more pronounced pattern of heightened price competition and a surge in the incidence of illicit trade in those countries.
Regretfully, these factors adversely affected our organic volume performance. However, despite these challenges, we posted robust increases in our earnings per share and cash flow. Importantly, we outperformed our international competitors in terms of the organic volume and market share growth.
The strategic highlight of the year was the highly promising transaction with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. This not only widened our share leadership in Asia, but I am sure will be a source of solid income growth for years to come. Our cigarette volume rose 4.1% in 2010 to reach a level of nearly 900 billion units. Absent the creation of PMFTC in the Philippines, our organic volumes fell short of the prior year by 2.5%. The shortfall is virtually entirely attributable to significant declines in industry volumes affecting Greece, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine. Indeed, absent these six markets, which collectively suffered  a volume erosion of some 14%, our volume performance in all other markets representing close to 80% of our volume base, grew at an organic rate of 1%. 
While the headline organic volume number in the fourth quarter points to a deterioration in our performance relative to the full year, this was entirely attributable to Japan and Ukraine, which suffered volume shortfalls of 43% and 35%, respectively. Absent these two markets, our fourth quarter organic volume performance was essentially equal to that of the full year.
Our market share performance, despite the challenges we faced, was solid. Indeed, our total worldwide share, excluding China and the USA, but including the business combination with Fortune Tobacco, on a pro forma basis, rose to 27.9% for the full year and 28.1% in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both OECD and non-OECD markets while exhibiting sequential improvements and hence momentum in both geographies. 
We also grew share in our 30 most profitable markets. While our aggregate share performance was solid and broad based, we did suffer erosion in several markets, notably in Germany, Greece, Turkey and Ukraine. Steps have recently been taken or planned in all four markets to address these shortcomings. Marlboro's share momentum improved as the year unfolded, despite the challenging economic environment. This is testament to the success and continued disciplined deployment of the brand's new architecture. 
In virtually all instances, we're witnessing improvements in the brand's key image attributes and demographic profile, particularly in regards to the Gold's pillar. Marlboro's performance in Asia was singularly robust, behind the continued success of several entries focused on the fresh pillar, such as Black Menthol and Ice Blast. Marlboro's momentum is confirmed by its six-month moving share trend shown on the chart.
L&M remains a two-pronged story. It continues to grow and is highly successful in the European Union region, but also continues to shed volume and share in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia. Plans are in place to strive to correct this. 
Net revenues of $27.2 billion were up 8.7% for the full year and 4.8% for the quarter. While on an organic basis, that is excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, they rose 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. This fell short of our mid- to long-term objectives reflecting the volume and mix erosion in the previously mentioned countries due to the abnormal excise tax increases that adversely affected each of them. 
Adjusted operating companies income of $11.5 billion rose 10.3% for the full year and 12.2% for the quarter. On an organic basis, the increase was 5.8% for the full year and a robust 9.9% in the fourth quarter. Not surprisingly, pricing was the key driver of our income growth with a particularly strong delivery in the fourth quarter. Our full-year pricing variants approached $1.7 billion, of which close to $600 million or 35% was recorded in the fourth quarter. I trust that these numbers will reinforce the belief that our pricing power, despite a very challenging economic environment, remains intact. 
I should highlight that the fourth quarter pricing variance was flattened by the price increase we obtained on the inventory held by our Japanese distributor on October 1. This accounted for approximately 20% of the total pricing variance in the quarter.
We are very pleased with the progress across all regions of our adjusted operating margins, excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full year, on a worldwide basis, they reached 42.6%, up 0.9 points. This reflects both our strong pricing and our continued efforts to generate productivity gains and cost savings as we completed our three-year $1.5 billion program.
Our earnings per share performance was singularly robust, exceeding our mid- to long-term targets for the third year in succession. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.87 for the full year and $0.97 for the quarter rose 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Excluding the favorable impact of currency of $0.12 for the year and $0.01 for the quarter, earnings per share rose 14% in 2010 and 18.5% in the fourth quarter.
As strong as our earnings per share performance was, it was surpassed by that of our cash flow. Indeed, our free cash flow rose by some $1.6 billion or 21.7% on a currency neutral basis to a record level of $8.7 billion. This performance was due in large part to the strict management of our working capital and in particular a reduction in our receivables and inventories, reflecting our efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows is a hallmark of our company. You may recall that at the time of our spinoff in March 2008, we set a three-year cumulative operating cash flow target of $21.7 billion. Fast forward to today, and we have handsomely exceeded that target by $3.5 billion or 16% to reach a cumulative operating cash flow of $25.2 billion, and this, despite an adverse currency impact of some $500 million. 
Our strong and growing cash flow has underpinned our ability to reward our shareholders through higher dividends in our share repurchase programs. We have increased our dividend by a cumulative total of 39.1% since the spin,, and by the end of December of 2010, had repurchased 334 million shares or 15.8% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin at an average price of $47.83.
While I cannot deny that 2010 was a tough year in many respects, we were able to overcome most of the significant roadblocks that were erected in our part. Our earnings per share and cash flow results were quite exceptional given the economic challenges that have yet to be profoundly resolved primarily in the Western world. It is against this fragile economic backdrop that we look to 2011. 
As disclosed in our earnings statement released this morning, we project another strong year in our key financial metrics, with a reported diluted earnings per share guidance falling within a range of $4.35 to $4.45 versus $3.92 in 2010. On an adjusted basis, compared to $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 12.5% to 15% at prevailing exchange rates, and approximately 10% to 12.5% on a constant currency basis.
We believe that our guidance appropriately reflects a cautious balance of the risks and opportunities that always accompany any projections made this early in the year. I should also highlight that this guidance assumes an underlying effective tax rate that is expected to be some 70 basis points higher than that incurred in 2010. The key risk to our earnings projection is a potential for disruptive excise tax increases and adverse movements in the structuring thereof as we painfully witnessed in 2010. 
While last year we faced an unprecedented number of countries that turned to tobacco to generate additional revenues by raising excise taxes to levels that went beyond any reasonable expectation. So far this year, the news on excise taxes is with one key exception relatively benign. The one exception is, of course, Mexico, where the average excise tax burden was increased on January 1 by 50% in one fall swoop. Elsewhere, other than the adverse impact of the annualization of 2010 increases, the excise tax increases that have been announced appeared to be manageable.
Furthermore and very importantly, we have witnessed a number of encouraging structural changes driven in large measure by the new excise tax directive in the European Union. Indeed, France, the Netherlands, Sweden have all increased by their specific-to-total tax ratios, and Greece had significantly improved its tax structure. In addition, in Germany, we have a new tax law that provides for reasonable increases and visibility over a five-year period.
Unemployment remains persistently high in numerous countries and continues to affect both industry volumes and mix. In addition, inflation, particularly as it relates to basic food commodities, remains a concern relative to consumer discretionary income levels in numerous markets. Furthermore, recent events in North Africa are likely to impact our performance, and we can only hope that this will be a temporary phenomenon. 
In light of these dynamics, we expect our organic volume performance to mirror that recorded in 2010. Japan and Mexico will dampen our volume prospects in 2011 and given the economic uncertainty, we continue to project volume softness in Greece, Pakistan, Spain and Ukraine. Also, we project a slightly weaker volume trend in both France and Italy, reflecting retail price increases ahead of inflation. Elsewhere, we anticipate a solid volume performance led by Indonesia, Korea and Russia as well as a projected recovery in Turkey.
The outcome of volume impact of the tax-driven price increase in Japan remains the single largest question mark. It will also affect our quarterly volume performance in a significant manner, with pronounced weakness in the first half and gradual but consistent improvement in the second half. While it is too early to gauge precise volume trends, January sales were modestly better than we had originally anticipated. And accordingly, the assumptions for Japan on which our earnings guidance is predicated, may prove to be somewhat overly cautious.
Given our share momentum and the initiatives we have planned, we anticipate another year of solid market share performance. Persistently high unemployment levels will continue to exert pressure on the premium segment in some markets, but we believe that in most instances, we can more than offset this dynamic, given the breadth of our brand portfolio.
Pricing will continue to be the key driver of our income growth. We project a price variance exceeding that recorded in 2010, driven in part by the price increase in Japan. Indeed, more than 60% of the pricing embedded in our 2011 guidance has already been announced or implemented. We anticipate some cost pressure, driven in large measure by the historical leaf tobacco price increases that will continue to affect our product costs in 2011. 
The more expensive materials in packaging associated with the Marlboro architecture, another premium brand offering, as well as the cost associated with the implementation of reduced cigarette ignition propensity rules in the European Union in the fourth quarter. We will implement a number of productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the year, and we have set a target of pretax cost savings of $250 million in 2011. Finally, we anticipate another strong cash flow performance and share repurchases of $5 billion in 2011 in line with the level dispersed in 2010.
All in all, 2010 proved to be a difficult year, but we posted results that compares very favorably to our consumer product peers. We enter 2011 with clear momentum and exciting plans. The so-called two-speed recovery remains fragile, but we look forward to the year with cautious optimism. There is likely to be continued volatility in currency market and other uncertainties, but we have the human and financial resources as well as numerous planned initiatives to sustain our momentum and post another year of solid growth. 
Hermann and I will now be happy to answer your questions."

Now in terms of next generation products, we have and continued to make progress, and we will be taking certain initiatives this year, but to come out with specific milestones this year is a bit early still, David. And as you know, I have always linked the two together. I think a material entry into China is somewhat dependent on the existence of next generation products."

Let's go one by one. As you're probably aware, in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany and has the best demographic age profile today followed by Mar",614,"Well, yes. Let's go one by one. As you're probably aware, in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany and has the best demographic age profile today followed by Marlboro, a lot of the market has shifted to what I call big packs and maxi packs. So big packs are 25, 24, 25 cigarettes a pack versus the traditional 19s. And there's been a proliferation of now maxi packs, which are 28 cigarettes or 29 cigarettes a pack. Both big packs and maxi packs sell at a considerable discount to a conventional packaging of 19 cigarettes. Marlboro was at a competitive disadvantage because we were somewhat slow to react with the maxi pack, in particular. So in the fourth quarter, we launched the Marlboro maxi pack. It does not offer the same discount as its competitors, but still does offer some discount. And we actually saw an improvement in Marlboro's performance in the fourth quarter. So that will continue. The other thing to note is that -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we now have visibility on excise taxes. There's an excise tax increase due for May 1. The structure is pretty good at the low end. The tax parts on is 13 euro cents a pack. At the premium end it's 4 cents a pack. So that's pretty good news. So Germany, L&M is in great shape. Marlboro is now competitive with the advent of maxi packs and let's see how things proceed. In Turkey, we were at a significant price disadvantage because we let prices at the time of the tax increase, which you may recall was significant -- and not everybody followed to the extent that we had led. That put us at a pretty significant competitive disadvantage, especially with a significant down trading that took place and the surge in illicit trade that accompanied the tax increase. Today, some 20% of cigarette consumption in Turkey is illicit trade. We have tried to convince the government to restructure their taxes. So far, there hasn't been much progress on that front, but we continue to be cautiously optimistic that over time they will realize that it's in their interest. We repositioned the L&M in the fourth quarter. And in fact, our share grew in the fourth quarter in Turkey, that is why I mentioned we anticipate a recovery in Turkey. In Greece, the tax structure has improved significantly with the tax reform. As you know, Greece has been a drag on the whole European Union, volume and income it remained a 3% drag for the year in terms of EU's growth. I think there's just been -- with the tax restructuring, a price increase across the board and we are confident that Greece will no longer be a drag and that we can continue to gain shift. Ukraine, essentially what you've seen is that over the last couple of years there have been huge success of excise tax increases such that in a two-year period, the low-priced segment has tripled in retail prices and the premium segment has doubled. So today at the low end, brands such as Bond Street, their retail price is equivalent to what the price of Parliament was two years ago. What has happened is that the market has compressed into the premium segment and the low priced segment, and the mid-priced segment is under huge pressure. In fact, we're doing very well in the premium segment and we've lost in the mid- segment and the low-priced segment, and we have plans in place to address that. Does that cover your question, David?"

The disappointment was that we had hoped that there would be a compression in the various tiers that hasn't quite happened as much as we had hoped, but that hopefully will happen going forward.

It appears that the Australian government remains intent on pursuing a legislation calling for plain packaging. We'll see what happens. My guess is we'll know a lot more by this summer, but there certainly seems to be a strong intent to pursue it. It's sort of defies logic because I don't think that it will affect consumption levels in any way. And furthermore, the big concern is illicit trade, which since the tax increase last summer, illicit trade has increased by 25% in Australia. So I am hopeful that the government is looking at that very closely because plain packaging will certainly not address that issue and does not -- will not address smoking incidents or smoking prevalence. The U.K. has said that they would study it, but that they would have to have clear unequivocal evidence, that it would in fact address smoking prevalence or incidents. And that they would have to look at very carefully the legal ramifications of such a measure with regard to constitutional issues as well as IP issues, also related to trade issues and the trade agreements and the intellectual property protection that comes with those trade agreements. So the U.K. is looking at it very sensibly. In the EU, DG SANCO, the health commissioner as it were, has started a revision of the tobacco product directive and is looking at a whole slew of measures. That's probably a three- to five-year process. But as I say, I think plain packaging doesn't make any sense and we will fight plain packaging in every way possible. Does that address your question?"

References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, which for the purposes of this presentation also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Net revenues excludes excise taxes. Operating companies income is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.
You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues on operating companies' income, or OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.

And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. With much of the developed world still grappling with stubbornly high unemployment levels, debilitatingly heavy debt burdens and bleak budget deficits, we posted, what I would characterize, as a solid financial performance in 2010. Unprecedented excise tax hikes affecting six markets in particular, coupled with continued economic uncertainty spurred double-digit declines in industry volumes, further consumer down trading, a more pronounced pattern of heightened price competition and a surge in the incidence of illicit trade in those countries.
Regretfully, these factors adversely affected our organic volume performance. However, despite these challenges, we posted robust increases in our earnings per share and cash flow. Importantly, we outperformed our international competitors in terms of the organic volume and market share growth.
The strategic highlight of the year was the highly promising transaction with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. This not only widened our share leadership in Asia, but I am sure will be a source of solid income growth for years to come. Our cigarette volume rose 4.1% in 2010 to reach a level of nearly 900 billion units. Absent the creation of PMFTC in the Philippines, our organic volumes fell short of the prior year by 2.5%. The shortfall is virtually entirely attributable to significant declines in industry volumes affecting Greece, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine. Indeed, absent these six markets, which collectively suffered  a volume erosion of some 14%, our volume performance in all other markets representing close to 80% of our volume base, grew at an organic rate of 1%. 
While the headline organic volume number in the fourth quarter points to a deterioration in our performance relative to the full year, this was entirely attributable to Japan and Ukraine, which suffered volume shortfalls of 43% and 35%, respectively. Absent these two markets, our fourth quarter organic volume performance was essentially equal to that of the full year.
Our market share performance, despite the challenges we faced, was solid. Indeed, our total worldwide share, excluding China and the USA, but including the business combination with Fortune Tobacco, on a pro forma basis, rose to 27.9% for the full year and 28.1% in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both OECD and non-OECD markets while exhibiting sequential improvements and hence momentum in both geographies. 
We also grew share in our 30 most profitable markets. While our aggregate share performance was solid and broad based, we did suffer erosion in several markets, notably in Germany, Greece, Turkey and Ukraine. Steps have recently been taken or planned in all four markets to address these shortcomings. Marlboro's share momentum improved as the year unfolded, despite the challenging economic environment. This is testament to the success and continued disciplined deployment of the brand's new architecture. 
In virtually all instances, we're witnessing improvements in the brand's key image attributes and demographic profile, particularly in regards to the Gold's pillar. Marlboro's performance in Asia was singularly robust, behind the continued success of several entries focused on the fresh pillar, such as Black Menthol and Ice Blast. Marlboro's momentum is confirmed by its six-month moving share trend shown on the chart.
L&M remains a two-pronged story. It continues to grow and is highly successful in the European Union region, but also continues to shed volume and share in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia. Plans are in place to strive to correct this. 
Net revenues of $27.2 billion were up 8.7% for the full year and 4.8% for the quarter. While on an organic basis, that is excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, they rose 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. This fell short of our mid- to long-term objectives reflecting the volume and mix erosion in the previously mentioned countries due to the abnormal excise tax increases that adversely affected each of them. 
Adjusted operating companies income of $11.5 billion rose 10.3% for the full year and 12.2% for the quarter. On an organic basis, the increase was 5.8% for the full year and a robust 9.9% in the fourth quarter. Not surprisingly, pricing was the key driver of our income growth with a particularly strong delivery in the fourth quarter. Our full-year pricing variants approached $1.7 billion, of which close to $600 million or 35% was recorded in the fourth quarter. I trust that these numbers will reinforce the belief that our pricing power, despite a very challenging economic environment, remains intact. 
I should highlight that the fourth quarter pricing variance was flattened by the price increase we obtained on the inventory held by our Japanese distributor on October 1. This accounted for approximately 20% of the total pricing variance in the quarter.
We are very pleased with the progress across all regions of our adjusted operating margins, excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full year, on a worldwide basis, they reached 42.6%, up 0.9 points. This reflects both our strong pricing and our continued efforts to generate productivity gains and cost savings as we completed our three-year $1.5 billion program.
Our earnings per share performance was singularly robust, exceeding our mid- to long-term targets for the third year in succession. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.87 for the full year and $0.97 for the quarter rose 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Excluding the favorable impact of currency of $0.12 for the year and $0.01 for the quarter, earnings per share rose 14% in 2010 and 18.5% in the fourth quarter.
As strong as our earnings per share performance was, it was surpassed by that of our cash flow. Indeed, our free cash flow rose by some $1.6 billion or 21.7% on a currency neutral basis to a record level of $8.7 billion. This performance was due in large part to the strict management of our working capital and in particular a reduction in our receivables and inventories, reflecting our efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows is a hallmark of our company. You may recall that at the time of our spinoff in March 2008, we set a three-year cumulative operating cash flow target of $21.7 billion. Fast forward to today, and we have handsomely exceeded that target by $3.5 billion or 16% to reach a cumulative operating cash flow of $25.2 billion, and this, despite an adverse currency impact of some $500 million. 
Our strong and growing cash flow has underpinned our ability to reward our shareholders through higher dividends in our share repurchase programs. We have increased our dividend by a cumulative total of 39.1% since the spin,, and by the end of December of 2010, had repurchased 334 million shares or 15.8% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin at an average price of $47.83.
While I cannot deny that 2010 was a tough year in many respects, we were able to overcome most of the significant roadblocks that were erected in our part. Our earnings per share and cash flow results were quite exceptional given the economic challenges that have yet to be profoundly resolved primarily in the Western world. It is against this fragile economic backdrop that we look to 2011. 
As disclosed in our earnings statement released this morning, we project another strong year in our key financial metrics, with a reported diluted earnings per share guidance falling within a range of $4.35 to $4.45 versus $3.92 in 2010. On an adjusted basis, compared to $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 12.5% to 15% at prevailing exchange rates, and approximately 10% to 12.5% on a constant currency basis.
We believe that our guidance appropriately reflects a cautious balance of the risks and opportunities that always accompany any projections made this early in the year. I should also highlight that this guidance assumes an underlying effective tax rate that is expected to be some 70 basis points higher than that incurred in 2010. The key risk to our earnings projection is a potential for disruptive excise tax increases and adverse movements in the structuring thereof as we painfully witnessed in 2010. 
While last year we faced an unprecedented number of countries that turned to tobacco to generate additional revenues by raising excise taxes to levels that went beyond any reasonable expectation. So far this year, the news on excise taxes is with one key exception relatively benign. The one exception is, of course, Mexico, where the average excise tax burden was increased on January 1 by 50% in one fall swoop. Elsewhere, other than the adverse impact of the annualization of 2010 increases, the excise tax increases that have been announced appeared to be manageable.
Furthermore and very importantly, we have witnessed a number of encouraging structural changes driven in large measure by the new excise tax directive in the European Union. Indeed, France, the Netherlands, Sweden have all increased by their specific-to-total tax ratios, and Greece had significantly improved its tax structure. In addition, in Germany, we have a new tax law that provides for reasonable increases and visibility over a five-year period.
Unemployment remains persistently high in numerous countries and continues to affect both industry volumes and mix. In addition, inflation, particularly as it relates to basic food commodities, remains a concern relative to consumer discretionary income levels in numerous markets. Furthermore, recent events in North Africa are likely to impact our performance, and we can only hope that this will be a temporary phenomenon. 
In light of these dynamics, we expect our organic volume performance to mirror that recorded in 2010. Japan and Mexico will dampen our volume prospects in 2011 and given the economic uncertainty, we continue to project volume softness in Greece, Pakistan, Spain and Ukraine. Also, we project a slightly weaker volume trend in both France and Italy, reflecting retail price increases ahead of inflation. Elsewhere, we anticipate a solid volume performance led by Indonesia, Korea and Russia as well as a projected recovery in Turkey.
The outcome of volume impact of the tax-driven price increase in Japan remains the single largest question mark. It will also affect our quarterly volume performance in a significant manner, with pronounced weakness in the first half and gradual but consistent improvement in the second half. While it is too early to gauge precise volume trends, January sales were modestly better than we had originally anticipated. And accordingly, the assumptions for Japan on which our earnings guidance is predicated, may prove to be somewhat overly cautious.
Given our share momentum and the initiatives we have planned, we anticipate another year of solid market share performance. Persistently high unemployment levels will continue to exert pressure on the premium segment in some markets, but we believe that in most instances, we can more than offset this dynamic, given the breadth of our brand portfolio.
Pricing will continue to be the key driver of our income growth. We project a price variance exceeding that recorded in 2010, driven in part by the price increase in Japan. Indeed, more than 60% of the pricing embedded in our 2011 guidance has already been announced or implemented. We anticipate some cost pressure, driven in large measure by the historical leaf tobacco price increases that will continue to affect our product costs in 2011. 
The more expensive materials in packaging associated with the Marlboro architecture, another premium brand offering, as well as the cost associated with the implementation of reduced cigarette ignition propensity rules in the European Union in the fourth quarter. We will implement a number of productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the year, and we have set a target of pretax cost savings of $250 million in 2011. Finally, we anticipate another strong cash flow performance and share repurchases of $5 billion in 2011 in line with the level dispersed in 2010.
All in all, 2010 proved to be a difficult year, but we posted results that compares very favorably to our consumer product peers. We enter 2011 with clear momentum and exciting plans. The so-called two-speed recovery remains fragile, but we look forward to the year with cautious optimism. There is likely to be continued volatility in currency market and other uncertainties, but we have the human and financial resources as well as numerous planned initiatives to sustain our momentum and post another year of solid growth.

Some of that was the re-evaluation of the inventory in Japan and higher prices. But even if you exclude that, you had a pretty healthy operating profit growth, presumably because you've seen the benefit of the pricing in that market and even with the volume down 40% plus in Japan. So if we assume that volume decline is about 20% for 2011 in Japan, wouldn't the profitability or profit growth impact in 2011 be much better than what you actually saw in the fourth quarter?"

Let's go one by one. As you're probably aware, in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany and has the best demographic age profile today followed by Mar",614,"Well, yes. Let's go one by one. As you're probably aware, in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany and has the best demographic age profile today followed by Marlboro, a lot of the market has shifted to what I call big packs and maxi packs. So big packs are 25, 24, 25 cigarettes a pack versus the traditional 19s. And there's been a proliferation of now maxi packs, which are 28 cigarettes or 29 cigarettes a pack. Both big packs and maxi packs sell at a considerable discount to a conventional packaging of 19 cigarettes. Marlboro was at a competitive disadvantage because we were somewhat slow to react with the maxi pack, in particular. So in the fourth quarter, we launched the Marlboro maxi pack. It does not offer the same discount as its competitors, but still does offer some discount. And we actually saw an improvement in Marlboro's performance in the fourth quarter. So that will continue. The other thing to note is that -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we now have visibility on excise taxes. There's an excise tax increase due for May 1. The structure is pretty good at the low end. The tax parts on is 13 euro cents a pack. At the premium end it's 4 cents a pack. So that's pretty good news. So Germany, L&M is in great shape. Marlboro is now competitive with the advent of maxi packs and let's see how things proceed. In Turkey, we were at a significant price disadvantage because we let prices at the time of the tax increase, which you may recall was significant -- and not everybody followed to the extent that we had led. That put us at a pretty significant competitive disadvantage, especially with a significant down trading that took place and the surge in illicit trade that accompanied the tax increase. Today, some 20% of cigarette consumption in Turkey is illicit trade. We have tried to convince the government to restructure their taxes. So far, there hasn't been much progress on that front, but we continue to be cautiously optimistic that over time they will realize that it's in their interest. We repositioned the L&M in the fourth quarter. And in fact, our share grew in the fourth quarter in Turkey, that is why I mentioned we anticipate a recovery in Turkey. In Greece, the tax structure has improved significantly with the tax reform. As you know, Greece has been a drag on the whole European Union, volume and income it remained a 3% drag for the year in terms of EU's growth. I think there's just been -- with the tax restructuring, a price increase across the board and we are confident that Greece will no longer be a drag and that we can continue to gain shift. Ukraine, essentially what you've seen is that over the last couple of years there have been huge success of excise tax increases such that in a two-year period, the low-priced segment has tripled in retail prices and the premium segment has doubled. So today at the low end, brands such as Bond Street, their retail price is equivalent to what the price of Parliament was two years ago. What has happened is that the market has compressed into the premium segment and the low priced segment, and the mid-priced segment is under huge pressure. In fact, we're doing very well in the premium segment and we've lost in the mid- segment and the low-priced segment, and we have plans in place to address that. Does that cover your question, David?"

The disappointment was that we had hoped that there would be a compression in the various tiers that hasn't quite happened as much as we had hoped, but that hopefully will happen going forward.

It appears that the Australian government remains intent on pursuing a legislation calling for plain packaging. We'll see what happens. My guess is we'll know a lot more by this summer, but there certainly seems to be a strong intent to pursue it. It's sort of defies logic because I don't think that it will affect consumption levels in any way. And furthermore, the big concern is illicit trade, which since the tax increase last summer, illicit trade has increased by 25% in Australia. So I am hopeful that the government is looking at that very closely because plain packaging will certainly not address that issue and does not -- will not address smoking incidents or smoking prevalence. The U.K. has said that they would study it, but that they would have to have clear unequivocal evidence, that it would in fact address smoking prevalence or incidents. And that they would have to look at very carefully the legal ramifications of such a measure with regard to constitutional issues as well as IP issues, also related to trade issues and the trade agreements and the intellectual property protection that comes with those trade agreements. So the U.K. is looking at it very sensibly. In the EU, DG SANCO, the health commissioner as it were, has started a revision of the tobacco product directive and is looking at a whole slew of measures. That's probably a three- to five-year process. But as I say, I think plain packaging doesn't make any sense and we will fight plain packaging in every way possible. Does that address your question?"

With much of the developed world still grappling with suddenly high employment levels, debilitating the heavy debt burdens, and bleak budget deficits, we posted what I’d characterize as a solid",2044,"Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. With much of the developed world still grappling with suddenly high employment levels, debilitating the heavy debt burdens, and bleak budget deficits, we posted what I’d characterize as a solid financial performance in 2010.
Unprecedented excise tax hikes, affecting six markets in particular, coupled with continued economic uncertainty, spurred double-digit declines in industry volumes, further consumer down trading, a more pronounced patterns of heightened price competition, and a surge in the incidence of illicit trade in those countries. Regretfully, these factors adversely affected our organic volume performance.
However, despite these challenges, we posted robust increases in our earnings per share and cash flow. Importantly, we outperformed our international competitors in terms of organic volume and market share growth.
The strategic highlight of the year was the highly promising transaction with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. This not only widened our share leadership in Asia, but I’m sure will be a source of solid income growth for years to come.
Our cigarette volume rose 4.1% in 2010 to reach a level of nearly 900 billion units. Absent the creation of PMFPC [ph] in the Philippines, our organic volume fell short of the prior year by 2.5%. Shortfall is virtually entirely attributable to significant declines in industry volumes, affecting Greece, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey, and Ukraine.
Indeed, absent these six markets, which collectively suffered a volume erosion of some 14%, our volume performance in all other markets representing close to 80% of our volume base grew at an organic rate of 1%.
While the headline organic volume number in the fourth-quarter points to a deterioration in our performance relative to the full-year, this was entirely attributable to Japan and Ukraine, which suffered volume shortfalls of 43% and 35% respectively. Absent these two markets, our fourth-quarter organic volume performance was essentially equal to that of the full-year.
Our market share performance despite the challenges we face was solid. Indeed, our total worldwide share excluding China and the USA, but including the business combination with Fortune Tobacco on a pro forma basis rose to 27.9% for the full-year and 28.1% in the fourth-quarter.
We grew share in both OECD and non-OECD markets while exhibiting sequential improvements and hence momentum in both geographies. We also grew share in our 30 most profitable markets.
While our aggregate share performance was solid and broad-based, we did suffer erosion in several markets, notably, in Germany, Greece, Turkey and Ukraine. Steps have recently been taken or are planned in all four markets to address the shortcomings.
Marlboro share momentum improved as the year unfolded despite the challenging economic environment. This is testament to the success and continued disciplined deployment of the brand’s new architecture. In virtually all instances, we’re witnessing improvements in the brands key image attributes and demographic profile, particularly, in regards to the Gold’s pillar.
Marlboro’s performance in Asia was singularly robust behind the continued success of several entries focused on the fresh pillar, such as Black Menthol and Ice Blast. Marlboro’s momentum is confirmed by its six-month moving share trend shown on the chart.
L&M remains a two-pronged story. It continues to grow and is highly successful in the European Union region, but also continues to shed volume and share in Eastern Europe, and particularly, in Russia. Plans are in place to strive to correct this.
Net revenues of $27.2 billion were up 8.7% for the full-year and 4.8% for the quarter. While on an organic basis, that is excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, they rose 3.4% and 2.8% respectively. This fell short of our mid- to long-term objective reflecting the volume and mix erosion in the previously mentioned countries, due to the abnormal excise tax increases that adversely affected each of them.
Adjusted company’s operating income of $11.5 billion rose 10.3% for the full-year and 12.2% for the quarter. On an organic basis, the increase was 5.8% for the full-year and a robust 9.9% in the fourth-quarter. Not surprisingly, pricing was the key driver of our income growth, with a particularly strong delivery in the fourth-quarter.
Our full-year pricing variance approached $1.7 billion. Of which close to $600 million or 35% was recorded in the fourth-quarter. I trust that these numbers will reinforce the belief that our pricing power despite a very challenging economic environment remains intact.
I should highlight that the fourth-quarter pricing variance was flattered by the price increase we obtained on the inventory held by our Japanese distributor on October 1. This accounted for approximately 20% of the total pricing variance in the quarter.
We’re very pleased with the progress across all regions of our adjusted operating margins, excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full-year, on a worldwide basis, they reached 42.6%, up 0.9 points. This reflects both our strong pricing and our continued efforts to generate productivity gains and cost savings, as we completed our three-year $1.5 billion program.
Our earnings per share performance was singularly robust, exceeding our mid- to long-term target for the third year in succession. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.87 for the full-year and $0.97 for the quarter rose 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Excluding the favorable impact of currency of $0.12 for the year and $0.01 for the quarter, earnings per share rose 14% in 2010 and 18.5% in the fourth-quarter.
As strong as our earnings per share performance was, it was surpassed by that of our cash flow. Indeed, our free cash flow rose by some $1.6 billion or 21.7% on a currency neutral basis to a record level of $8.7 billion. This performance was due in large part to the strict management of our working capital, and in particular, a reduction in our receivables and inventories, reflecting our efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows is a hallmark of our company. You may recall that at the time of our spin-off in March 2008, we set a three year cumulative operating cash flow target of $21.7 billion.
Fast forward to today and we have handsomely exceeded that target by $3.5 billion or 16% to reach a cumulative operating cash flow of $25.2 billion and this despite an adverse currency impact of some $500 million.
Our strong and growing cash flow has underpinned our ability to reward our shareholders through higher dividends and our share repurchase programs.
We have increased our dividends by a cumulative total of 39.1% since the spin. By the end of December 2010 had repurchased 334 million shares or 15.8% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin at an average price of $47.83.
While I cannot deny that 2010 was a tough year in many respects, we’re able to overcome most of the significant roadblocks that were erected in our path.
Our earnings per share and cash flow results were quite exceptional given the economic challenges that have yet to be profoundly resolved primarily in the western world. It is against this fragile economic backdrop that we look to 2011.
As disclosed in our earnings statement released this morning, we project another strong year in our key financial metrics with reported diluted earnings per share guidance falling within a range of $4.35 to $4.45 versus $3.92 in 2010.
On an adjusted basis compared to $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 12.5% to 15% at prevailing exchange rates, and approximately 10% to 12.5% on a constant currency basis.
We believe that our guidance appropriately reflects a cautious balance of the risks and opportunities that always accompany any projections made this early in the year. I should also highlight that this guidance assumes an underlying effective tax rate that is expected to be some 70 basis points higher than that incurred in 2010.
The key risk to our earnings projection is a potential for disruptive excise tax increases and adverse movements in the structure thereof as we painfully witnessed in 2010.
While last year we faced an unprecedented number of countries that turned to tobacco to generate additional revenues by raising excise taxes to levels that went beyond any reasonable expectation, so far this year the news on excise taxes is with one key exception relatively benign.
The one exception is, of course, Mexico with the average excise tax burden was increased on January 1 by 50% in one fell swoop. Elsewhere, other than the adverse impact of the annualization of 2010 increases, the excise tax increases that have been announced appear to be manageable.
Furthermore, and very importantly we have witnessed a number of encouraging structural changes driven in large measure by the new excise tax directive in the European Union. Indeed France, the Netherlands, Sweden, have all increased their specific to total tax ratios, and Greece has significantly improved its tax structure. In addition in Germany, we have a new tax law that provides for reasonable increases and visibility over a five-year period.
Unemployment remains persistently high in numerous countries and continues to affect both industry volumes and mix. In addition, inflation particularly as it relates to basic food commodities remains a concern relative to consumer discretionary income levels in numerous markets. Furthermore, recent events in North Africa are likely to impact our performance, and we can only hope that this will be a temporary phenomenon.
In light of these dynamics, we expect our organic volume performance to mirror that recorded in 2010. Japan and Mexico will dampen our volume prospects in 2011, and given the economic uncertainty, we continue to project volume softness in Greece, Pakistan, Spain, and Ukraine.
Also, we project a slightly weaker volume trend in both France and Italy reflecting retail price increases ahead of inflation. Elsewhere, we anticipate a solid volume performance led by Indonesia, Korea, and Russia as well as a projected recovery in Turkey.
The outcome of volume impact of the tax driven price increase in Japan remains the single largest question mark. It will also affect our quarterly volume performance in a significant manner with pronounced weakness in the first half and gradual but consistent improvement in the second half.
While it is too early to gauge precise volume trends, January sales were modestly better than we had originally anticipated. Accordingly, the assumptions for Japan on which our earnings guidance is predicated, may prove to be somewhat overly cautious.
Given our share momentum and the initiatives we have planned, we anticipate another year of solid market share performance. Persistently high unemployment levels will continue to exert pressure on the premium segment in some markets, but we believe that in most instances, we could more than offset this dynamic given the breadth of our brand portfolio.
Pricing will continue to be the key driver of our income growth. We project a price variance exceeding that recorded in 2010, driven in part by the price increase in Japan. Indeed, more than 60% of the pricing embedded in our 2011 guidance has already been announced or implemented.
We anticipate some cost pressure driven in large measure by the historical leaf tobacco price increases that will continue to affect our product cost in 2011, the more expensive materials in packaging associated with the Marlboro architecture and other premium brand offerings as well as the cost associated with the implementation of reduced cigarette ignition propensity rules in the European Union in the fourth-quarter.
We will implement a number of productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the year and we have a set a target of pre-tax cost savings of $250 million in 2011. Finally, we anticipate another strong cash flow performance and share repurchases of $5 billion in 2011, in line with the level dispersed in 2010.
All in all, 2010 proved to be a difficult year, but we posted results that compared very favorably to our consumer product peers.
We entered 2011 with clear momentum and exciting plans. The so called two-speed recovery remains fragile, but we look forward to the year with cautious optimism. There is likely to be continued volatility in currency markets and other uncertainties, but we have the human and financial resources as well as numerous plans initiatives to sustain our momentum and post another year of solid growth.
Hermann and I will now be happy to answer your questions.

As you’re probably aware in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany, and has the best demographic age profile today, followed by Marlboro.
A lot of the market has shifted to what I call big packs and maxi packs. So, big packs are 24, 25 cigarettes a pack versus the traditional 19s and there’s been a proliferation of now maxi packs, which are 28 cigarettes or 29 cigarettes a pack. Both big packs and maxi packs sell at a considerable discount to the conventional packaging of 19 cigarettes. Marlboro was at a competitive disadvantage because we were somewhat slow to react with the maxi pack in particular.
So in the fourth-quarter, we launched Marlboro Maxi Pack. It does not offer the same discount as its competitors, but still does offer some discount and we actually saw an improvement in Marlboro’s performance in the fourth-quarter, so that will continue.
The other thing to note is, as I mentioned in my remarks, we now have visibility on excise taxes. There’s an excise tax increase due from May 1. The structure is pretty good. At the low end the tax passengers on is €0.13 a pack. At the premium end it’s €0.04 a pack. So that’s pretty good news. So Germany, L&M in great shape. Marlboro is now competitive with the advent of Maxi Packs and let’s see how things proceed.
In Turkey, we were at a significant price disadvantage because we let prices at the time of the tax increase, which you may recall was significant and not everybody followed to the extent that we had led. That put us at a pretty significant competitive disadvantage, especially with the significant down trading that took place and the surge in illicit trade that accompanied the tax increase.
Today, some 20% of cigarette consumption in Turkey is illicit trade. We have tried to convince the government to restructure their taxes. So far there hasn’t been much progress on that front, but we continue to be cautiously optimistic that overtime it will realize that it’s in their interest. We repositioned L&M in the fourth-quarter and in fact, our share grew in the fourth-quarter in Turkey. That’s why I mentioned we anticipate a recovery in Turkey.
In Greece, the tax structure has improved significantly with the tax reform. As you know, Greece has been a drag on the whole European Union volume and income. They remained a 3% drag for the year in terms of the EU’s growth. I think there is just being with the tax restructuring and price increase across the board and we’re confident that Greece will no longer be a drag and that we can continue to gain share.
Ukraine, essentially, what you’ve seen is that over the last couple of years there have been huge successive excise tax increases. Such that in a two-year period the low price segment has tripled in retail prices and the premium segment has doubled. So today at the low ends, brand such as Bond Street, their retail price is equivalent to what the price of Polymer [ph] was two years ago.
What has happened is that the market has compressed into the premium segment and the low price segment and the mid price segment is under huge pressure. In fact, we’re doing very well in the premium segment, and we lost in the mid segment and the low price segment and we have plans in place to address that. Does that cover your question, David?

Consumption is up about 4% despite pricing that has been ahead of inflation across the board.

There has been a new excise tax decree that came out, which clearly is manageable, excise tax increases were essentially in line with inflation. The disappointment was that we had hoped that there would be a compression in the various tiers, that hasn’t quite happened as much as we had hoped, but that hopefully will happen going forward.
But importantly, I think the government is more and more focused on the various loopholes about certain manufacturers are using to get excise tax benefits. So, to the extent that those loopholes are closed then I think you’ll see a more pronounced shift in what you’re discussing in terms of the up trading.

It appears that the Australian government remains intent on pursuing legislation calling for plain packaging. We’ll see what happens. My guess is we’ll know a lot more by this summer, but there certainly seems to be a strong intent to pursue it. It sort of defies logic, because I don’t think that it will affect consumption levels in any way.
Furthermore, the big concern is illicit trade, which since the tax increase last summer illicit trade has increased by 25% in Australia. So, I’m hopeful that the government is looking at that very closely, because plain packaging will certainly not address that issue and will not address smoking incidence or smoking prevalence.
The U.K., I said that, they would study it, but that they would have to have clear unequivocal evidence that it would in fact address smoking prevalence or incidence and that they would have to look at very carefully. Legal ramifications of such a measure with regard to constitutional issues as well as IP issues also related to trade issues in the trade agreements and the intellectual property protection that comes with those trade agreements, so, the UK is looking at it very sensibly.
In the EU, DG SANCO, the Health Commission as it were, has started a revision of the tobacco product directive, and is looking at host slew of measures. That’s probably a three-year to five-year process. But as I said, I think plain packaging doesn’t make any sense and we’ll fight plain packaging in every way possible.

Second, just in terms of the shape of the volumes in the fourth-quarter. I just want to make sure my math is right. So, of the 5% volume decline organic, about 3 percentage points of that’s Japan I’m guessing (inaudible) right. And then just in Mexico loading into the channels, wonder what impact that would have, or was that was fairly negligible?
And finally, just in terms of sort of regulation plain packaging kind of follow on, in Uruguay, I just wondered whether you can update us on where we’re with that legal action in terms of potentially to what particular timing of an outcome of that and what sort of precedent that might set elsewhere? Thanks very much.

References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, which for the purposes of this presentation also include our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. Net revenues excludes excise taxes. Operating companies income is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.
You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues on operating companies' income, or OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.

And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. With much of the developed world still grappling with stubbornly high unemployment levels, debilitatingly heavy debt burdens and bleak budget deficits, we posted, what I would characterize, as a solid financial performance in 2010. Unprecedented excise tax hikes affecting six markets in particular, coupled with continued economic uncertainty spurred double-digit declines in industry volumes, further consumer down trading, a more pronounced pattern of heightened price competition and a surge in the incidence of illicit trade in those countries.
Regretfully, these factors adversely affected our organic volume performance. However, despite these challenges, we posted robust increases in our earnings per share and cash flow. Importantly, we outperformed our international competitors in terms of the organic volume and market share growth.
The strategic highlight of the year was the highly promising transaction with Fortune Tobacco in the Philippines. This not only widened our share leadership in Asia, but I am sure will be a source of solid income growth for years to come. Our cigarette volume rose 4.1% in 2010 to reach a level of nearly 900 billion units. Absent the creation of PMFTC in the Philippines, our organic volumes fell short of the prior year by 2.5%. The shortfall is virtually entirely attributable to significant declines in industry volumes affecting Greece, Japan, Pakistan, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine. Indeed, absent these six markets, which collectively suffered  a volume erosion of some 14%, our volume performance in all other markets representing close to 80% of our volume base, grew at an organic rate of 1%. 
While the headline organic volume number in the fourth quarter points to a deterioration in our performance relative to the full year, this was entirely attributable to Japan and Ukraine, which suffered volume shortfalls of 43% and 35%, respectively. Absent these two markets, our fourth quarter organic volume performance was essentially equal to that of the full year.
Our market share performance, despite the challenges we faced, was solid. Indeed, our total worldwide share, excluding China and the USA, but including the business combination with Fortune Tobacco, on a pro forma basis, rose to 27.9% for the full year and 28.1% in the fourth quarter. We grew share in both OECD and non-OECD markets while exhibiting sequential improvements and hence momentum in both geographies. 
We also grew share in our 30 most profitable markets. While our aggregate share performance was solid and broad based, we did suffer erosion in several markets, notably in Germany, Greece, Turkey and Ukraine. Steps have recently been taken or planned in all four markets to address these shortcomings. Marlboro's share momentum improved as the year unfolded, despite the challenging economic environment. This is testament to the success and continued disciplined deployment of the brand's new architecture. 
In virtually all instances, we're witnessing improvements in the brand's key image attributes and demographic profile, particularly in regards to the Gold's pillar. Marlboro's performance in Asia was singularly robust, behind the continued success of several entries focused on the fresh pillar, such as Black Menthol and Ice Blast. Marlboro's momentum is confirmed by its six-month moving share trend shown on the chart.
L&M remains a two-pronged story. It continues to grow and is highly successful in the European Union region, but also continues to shed volume and share in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia. Plans are in place to strive to correct this. 
Net revenues of $27.2 billion were up 8.7% for the full year and 4.8% for the quarter. While on an organic basis, that is excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, they rose 3.4% and 2.8%, respectively. This fell short of our mid- to long-term objectives reflecting the volume and mix erosion in the previously mentioned countries due to the abnormal excise tax increases that adversely affected each of them. 
Adjusted operating companies income of $11.5 billion rose 10.3% for the full year and 12.2% for the quarter. On an organic basis, the increase was 5.8% for the full year and a robust 9.9% in the fourth quarter. Not surprisingly, pricing was the key driver of our income growth with a particularly strong delivery in the fourth quarter. Our full-year pricing variants approached $1.7 billion, of which close to $600 million or 35% was recorded in the fourth quarter. I trust that these numbers will reinforce the belief that our pricing power, despite a very challenging economic environment, remains intact. 
I should highlight that the fourth quarter pricing variance was flattened by the price increase we obtained on the inventory held by our Japanese distributor on October 1. This accounted for approximately 20% of the total pricing variance in the quarter.
We are very pleased with the progress across all regions of our adjusted operating margins, excluding currency and acquisitions. For the full year, on a worldwide basis, they reached 42.6%, up 0.9 points. This reflects both our strong pricing and our continued efforts to generate productivity gains and cost savings as we completed our three-year $1.5 billion program.
Our earnings per share performance was singularly robust, exceeding our mid- to long-term targets for the third year in succession. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.87 for the full year and $0.97 for the quarter rose 17.6% and 19.8%, respectively. Excluding the favorable impact of currency of $0.12 for the year and $0.01 for the quarter, earnings per share rose 14% in 2010 and 18.5% in the fourth quarter.
As strong as our earnings per share performance was, it was surpassed by that of our cash flow. Indeed, our free cash flow rose by some $1.6 billion or 21.7% on a currency neutral basis to a record level of $8.7 billion. This performance was due in large part to the strict management of our working capital and in particular a reduction in our receivables and inventories, reflecting our efforts to optimize our supply chain.
Our ability to generate strong and predictable cash flows is a hallmark of our company. You may recall that at the time of our spinoff in March 2008, we set a three-year cumulative operating cash flow target of $21.7 billion. Fast forward to today, and we have handsomely exceeded that target by $3.5 billion or 16% to reach a cumulative operating cash flow of $25.2 billion, and this, despite an adverse currency impact of some $500 million. 
Our strong and growing cash flow has underpinned our ability to reward our shareholders through higher dividends in our share repurchase programs. We have increased our dividend by a cumulative total of 39.1% since the spin,, and by the end of December of 2010, had repurchased 334 million shares or 15.8% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin at an average price of $47.83.
While I cannot deny that 2010 was a tough year in many respects, we were able to overcome most of the significant roadblocks that were erected in our part. Our earnings per share and cash flow results were quite exceptional given the economic challenges that have yet to be profoundly resolved primarily in the Western world. It is against this fragile economic backdrop that we look to 2011. 
As disclosed in our earnings statement released this morning, we project another strong year in our key financial metrics, with a reported diluted earnings per share guidance falling within a range of $4.35 to $4.45 versus $3.92 in 2010. On an adjusted basis, compared to $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 12.5% to 15% at prevailing exchange rates, and approximately 10% to 12.5% on a constant currency basis.
We believe that our guidance appropriately reflects a cautious balance of the risks and opportunities that always accompany any projections made this early in the year. I should also highlight that this guidance assumes an underlying effective tax rate that is expected to be some 70 basis points higher than that incurred in 2010. The key risk to our earnings projection is a potential for disruptive excise tax increases and adverse movements in the structuring thereof as we painfully witnessed in 2010. 
While last year we faced an unprecedented number of countries that turned to tobacco to generate additional revenues by raising excise taxes to levels that went beyond any reasonable expectation. So far this year, the news on excise taxes is with one key exception relatively benign. The one exception is, of course, Mexico, where the average excise tax burden was increased on January 1 by 50% in one fell swoop. Elsewhere, other than the adverse impact of the annualization of 2010 increases, the excise tax increases that have been announced appeared to be manageable.
Furthermore and very importantly, we have witnessed a number of encouraging structural changes driven in large measure by the new excise tax directive in the European Union. Indeed, France, the Netherlands, Sweden have all increased by their specific-to-total tax ratios, and Greece had significantly improved its tax structure. In addition, in Germany, we have a new tax law that provides for reasonable increases and visibility over a five-year period.
Unemployment remains persistently high in numerous countries and continues to affect both industry volumes and mix. In addition, inflation, particularly as it relates to basic food commodities, remains a concern relative to consumer discretionary income levels in numerous markets. Furthermore, recent events in North Africa are likely to impact our performance, and we can only hope that this will be a temporary phenomenon. 
In light of these dynamics, we expect our organic volume performance to mirror that recorded in 2010. Japan and Mexico will dampen our volume prospects in 2011 and given the economic uncertainty, we continue to project volume softness in Greece, Pakistan, Spain and Ukraine. Also, we project a slightly weaker volume trend in both France and Italy, reflecting retail price increases ahead of inflation. Elsewhere, we anticipate a solid volume performance led by Indonesia, Korea and Russia as well as a projected recovery in Turkey.
The outcome of volume impact of the tax-driven price increase in Japan remains the single largest question mark. It will also affect our quarterly volume performance in a significant manner, with pronounced weakness in the first half and gradual but consistent improvement in the second half. While it is too early to gauge precise volume trends, January sales were modestly better than we had originally anticipated. And accordingly, the assumptions for Japan on which our earnings guidance is predicated, may prove to be somewhat overly cautious.
Given our share momentum and the initiatives we have planned, we anticipate another year of solid market share performance. Persistently high unemployment levels will continue to exert pressure on the premium segment in some markets, but we believe that in most instances, we can more than offset this dynamic, given the breadth of our brand portfolio.
Pricing will continue to be the key driver of our income growth. We project a price variance exceeding that recorded in 2010, driven in part by the price increase in Japan. Indeed, more than 60% of the pricing embedded in our 2011 guidance has already been announced or implemented. We anticipate some cost pressure, driven in large measure by the historical leaf tobacco price increases that will continue to affect our product costs in 2011. 
The more expensive materials in packaging associated with the Marlboro architecture, and other premium brand offerings, as well as the cost associated with the implementation of reduced cigarette ignition propensity rules in the European Union in the fourth quarter. We will implement a number of productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the year, and we have set a target of pretax cost savings of $250 million in 2011. Finally, we anticipate another strong cash flow performance and share repurchases of $5 billion in 2011 in line with the level dispersed in 2010.
All in all, 2010 proved to be a difficult year, but we posted results that compares very favorably to our consumer product peers. We enter 2011 with clear momentum and exciting plans. The so-called two-speed recovery remains fragile, but we look forward to the year with cautious optimism. There is likely to be continued volatility in currency markets and other uncertainties, but we have the human and financial resources as well as numerous planned initiatives to sustain our momentum and post another year of solid growth. 
Hermann and I will now be happy to answer your questions."

Let's go one by one. As you're probably aware, in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany and has the best demographic age profile today followed by Mar",614,"Well, yes. Let's go one by one. As you're probably aware, in Germany, where Marlboro has suffered partially offset by the continued growth of L&M, which is the fastest growing brand in Germany and has the best demographic age profile today followed by Marlboro, a lot of the market has shifted to what I call big packs and maxi packs. So big packs are 25, 24, 25 cigarettes a pack versus the traditional 19s. And there's been a proliferation of now maxi packs, which are 28 cigarettes or 29 cigarettes a pack. Both big packs and maxi packs sell at a considerable discount to a conventional packaging of 19 cigarettes. Marlboro was at a competitive disadvantage because we were somewhat slow to react with the maxi pack, in particular. So in the fourth quarter, we launched the Marlboro maxi pack. It does not offer the same discount as its competitors, but still does offer some discount. And we actually saw an improvement in Marlboro's performance in the fourth quarter. So that will continue. The other thing to note is that -- as I mentioned in my remarks, we now have visibility on excise taxes. There's an excise tax increase due for May 1. The structure is pretty good at the low end. The tax parts on is 13 euro cents a pack. At the premium end it's 4 cents a pack. So that's pretty good news. So Germany, L&M is in great shape. Marlboro is now competitive with the advent of maxi packs and let's see how things proceed. In Turkey, we were at a significant price disadvantage because we let prices at the time of the tax increase, which you may recall was significant -- and not everybody followed to the extent that we had led. That put us at a pretty significant competitive disadvantage, especially with a significant down trading that took place and the surge in illicit trade that accompanied the tax increase. Today, some 20% of cigarette consumption in Turkey is illicit trade. We have tried to convince the government to restructure their taxes. So far, there hasn't been much progress on that front, but we continue to be cautiously optimistic that over time they will realize that it's in their interest. We repositioned the L&M in the fourth quarter. And in fact, our share grew in the fourth quarter in Turkey, that is why I mentioned we anticipate a recovery in Turkey. In Greece, the tax structure has improved significantly with the tax reform. As you know, Greece has been a drag on the whole European Union, volume and income it remained a 3% drag for the year in terms of EU's growth. I think there's just been -- with the tax restructuring, a price increase across the board and we are confident that Greece will no longer be a drag and that we can continue to gain shift. Ukraine, essentially what you've seen is that over the last couple of years there have been huge success of excise tax increases such that in a two-year period, the low-priced segment has tripled in retail prices and the premium segment has doubled. So today at the low end, brands such as Bond Street, their retail price is equivalent to what the price of Parliament was two years ago. What has happened is that the market has compressed into the premium segment and the low priced segment, and the mid-priced segment is under huge pressure. In fact, we're doing very well in the premium segment and we've lost in the mid- segment and the low-priced segment, and we have plans in place to address that. Does that cover your question, David?"

The disappointment was that we had hoped that there would be a compression in the various tiers. That hasn't quite happened as much as we had hoped, but that hopefully will happen going forward.

It appears that the Australian government remains intent on pursuing a legislation calling for plain packaging. We'll see what happens. My guess is we'll know a lot more by this summer, but there certainly seems to be a strong intent to pursue it. It's sort of defies logic because I don't think that it will affect consumption levels in any way. And furthermore, the big concern is illicit trade, which since the tax increase last summer, illicit trade has increased by 25% in Australia. So I am hopeful that the government is looking at that very closely because plain packaging will certainly not address that issue and does not -- will not address smoking incidence or smoking prevalence. The U.K. has said that they would study it, but that they would have to have clear unequivocal evidence, that it would in fact address smoking prevalence or incidence. And that they would have to look at very carefully the legal ramifications of such a measure with regard to constitutional issues as well as IP issues, also related to trade issues and the trade agreements and the intellectual property protection that comes with those trade agreements. So the U.K. is looking at it very sensibly. In the EU, DG SANCO, the health commissioner as it were, has started a revision of the tobacco product directive and is looking at a whole slew of measures. That's probably a three- to five-year process. But as I say, I think plain packaging doesn't make any sense and we will fight plain packaging in every way possible. Does that address your question?"

We reported a very strong financial performance during the first quarter most notably an increase in our adjusted diluted EPS of 14.4%, excluding currency.The event in Japan, while distressing, only resulted in temporary l",2525,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported a very strong financial performance during the first quarter most notably an increase in our adjusted diluted EPS of 14.4%, excluding currency.
The event in Japan, while distressing, only resulted in temporary logistical disruptions for our company and did not have a material financial impact on our overall results in the quarter. Thus again, emphasizing the advantages of our businesses through the global footprint.
As reflected in February, our organic volume performance was dampened by anticipated softness in Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Spain and Ukraine as well as by the events in North Africa. Indeed, these markets collectively soften the volume erosion of 8.4 billion units or 18.5%. All other markets slightly more than 80% of our volume base grew their combined volume at an organic rate of 1%.
I am. delighted to announce that we are increasing our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011 by $0.20 to a range of $4.55 to $4.65. Compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 17.5% to 20% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 12.5% to 15%, excluding currency.  $0.10 or has the increased guidance are attributable to more favorable prevailing exchange rates. The other $0.10 are attributable to an improved business outlook in several markets, including France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Turkey, partly offset as some additional investments in marketing and sales in slightly more conservative pricing assumptions.
As you are all aware, Japan tobacco is facing significant supply disruptions as a result of the tragic events in its whole market. It is our understanding that poor supply will gradually be in place in the next few weeks. We, in turn, have taken all necessary measures to ensure that the insufficient in market inventories to supply the market and feel the anticipated temporary that is likely to occur. While we have certainly witnessed a moderate lift to our end market sales in the last few weeks, you should know that there are still competitive products available for sale in numerous retail accounts. And accordingly, it is proving difficult to go the full extent of the likely uplift in sales.  As retail stocks of our principal competitor's product disappear, we will be in a better position to determine such levels.
We anticipate that the second quarter will improve critical in this regard. It would allow us to much better read on total consumption levels and whether or not and to what extent consumers will return to their prior choice.
At this point, we face significant uncertainty but rest assured that all actions are in place to optimize our entire supply chain. We have a positive momentum in the Japanese market but our share increased by 1.4 points to 25.6% in the first quarter of this year, driven by the success of consumer innovative and Marlboro line extensions. 
Our slightly more conservative pricing assumptions are attributable to the continued economic difficulties in consumer affordability issues in such markets as Greece, Spain and Ukraine, and the need to react to certain competitive price moves such as tax absorption and repositioning, price discounting and delays and the implementation of tax driven price increases. Pricing will nevertheless remain the key driver of profitability growth at PMI and our pricing variants in 2011 is expected to surpass the level achieved last year.
Overall, our competitiveness is strong and our business is in good shape. This is notably demonstrated by the results during the first quarter in our Asia region. Volume was up 14% in the quarter and an organic basis it was down just 1.7%. Marlboro continued to perform strongly in the Asia region, with volume up 0.7% overall and by 5.5%, excluding Japan.
During the first quarter, we achieved volume and share gains in the key markets of Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. In Indonesia, we expect industry volume to grow by around 4% this year despite the potential unfavorable impact of higher food prices on consumer disposable income. Our technical entry last year into low price segment in several regions has enabled us to start to grow market share again. In Korea, we achieved a record market share of 17.8% in the first quarter. With both Marlboro and Parliament driving success. In the Philippines, we expect the industry volume this year will be broadly in line with last year following tax driven price increases in January this year. Both Marlboro and Fortune are gaining share in this promising market, and we are making good progress realizing our brand synergy transmission savings.
Our financial results in the Asia region were excellent as net revenues up by 11.6% and adjusted OCI by 34%, both excluding currency and acquisitions.
The other market in the Asia region that has been in the news recently is Australia that the government has released an exposure draft of its plain packaging bill, which would mandate plain packaging in 2012. It has opened the consultation period on the matter through June 6. PMI is firmly opposed to such omission as there is no credible evidence that it will achieve any reduction smoking rates and the government has ignored the fact that it may actually be counterproductive to public health. Plain packaging will need to price erosion over time and will further encourage the growth of illicit trade, which already increased in Australia by over 25% in 2010 according to a recent study. Plain packaging will also result in the illegal confiscation of our trademarks in trend assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties. Unlike other governments which have focused on establishing whether there is evidence to demonstrate that plain packaging would have public health benefits taking into consideration such as competition, trade and legal implication as well as the likely impact on illicit trade. The Australian government seems to be forging ahead without due consideration of any of these important conditions. PMI will take all measures it deems appropriate, including recourse to the courts if necessary to oppose the Australian government proposal.
Our overall performance was also very good in the Latin America and Canada region despite the significant impact on volume of the disruptively large excise tax increase that occurred in January in Mexico. Industry volume in Mexico during the first quarter was down by 27% though the underlying decline is estimated to have been about 14%. Marlboro and Benson & Hedges have remained resilient, with Marlboro reaching a quarterly market share of 50.3%, up 1.6 share points. Across the region, Marlboro has been performing strongly with markets share gains in all key markets. On a regional basis, strong price 15.7% increase in adjusted OCI and the 1.9 point improvement in adjusted OCI margin, both excluding currency.
While the economies of most emerging markets have now almost fully recovered, those of southern Europe remained depressed with unemployment still continuing to climb, most notably in Greece, Portugal and Spain, industry volume was down by 25% in the first quarter in Spain as the situation was exacerbated by the introduction of a total indoor smoking ban, tax driven price increases, reduction in trade inventories and a sharp increase in contraband off a low base. For the full year, the industry volumes is forecast to decline by around 15% and consumer down trading is expected to continue. It is worth noting that compared to this have introduced were repositioned plants below the kick in level of the minimum excise tax and have thus not rolled over the full effects of the most recent excise tax increase. Greece continued to be a drag on PMI results in the first quarter, with industry volume down 10%, consumer down trading due to large price gaps and a difficult comparison as this market was not impacted by a large taxa increases until the second quarter of last year.
While there has been recently structural improvements in that excise tax system, one crucial reform remains to be introduced in effective minimal excise tax. In addition, our highest specific total tax ratio would also benefit government revenues. Excluding just Spain, industry volume in the EU region in the first quarter was down 2.5%, in line with a longer-term consumption decline trends.
PMI net revenues in the EU region were down 3.5% and adjusted OCI by 2.3% in the first quarter, both excluding currency. This was driven by the lower industry volume in the decline of 0.4 share points on a regional basis. We expect our performance in the EU region to be helped this year by structural excise tax improvements implemented by governments in France, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and the U.K. following the new and improved EU excise tax directive that will be enforced through 2018. In addition, both Germany and the Czech Republic has implemented multi-year excise tax programs calling for regular reasonable increases. The first step in the German tax increase program will take place this May. PMI has announced a EUR $0.20 per pack of 19 cigarettes price increase across its portfolio while the pure pass on require this full euro cents for Marlboro and EUR $0.11 for L&M. This will be a benefit to profitability in the German market and our decision to eventually follow competitive moves by also offering discounts on large excises enabled us to regain 0.5 share points in the first quarter to 35.7% thanks to the continued to stellar performance of L&M and a stable Marlboro share. In parallel, we increased our share in the important German fine cut market by 0.9 points to 14.9%. In both Italy and France, industry volume was stable in the first quarter. In Italy, Marlboro has been performing well. Its quarterly share was down just 0.1% to 2.5% and more importantly, it's share amongst young adult smokers or YAS defined as legal age minimum 19- to 24-year-olds has been growing again following the launch of Marlboro Gold Touch and remains well above about its market share. 
In France, a slightly improved market share performance has been driven by the continued growth of the premium priced Philip Morris brand with quarterly share grew a further 0.6 points to 8.2% and the brand YAS share has increased reached 16%. More generally, we have witnessed greater resilience of Marlboro across the EU region with share of just 0.1 point in the quarter at 17.8% and notable gains in Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland. And a strong momentum continued to further 0.2 share point gain to 6.1% driven not only by Germany but also by Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.
Our volume in the EEMA region decreased by 0.8%, driven by the continued industry decline and low and share losses in the Ukraine as well as some temporary logistical disruptions in North Africa, partly offset by favorable comparisons in Romania and Turkey where the large excess tax increases in January 2010 but none this year.
Premium brands accounted for more than 40% of our regional volume for the first time since the last quarter of 2008 with increased volumes for both Marlboro and Parliament. The Russian market was influenced in the first quarter by rampant food price inflation resulting from last summer's heat wave and drought as well as the cigarette price increases. For the full year, we are forecasting industry volume will decline moderately and consumer up trading may be more modest than originally expected. Our declined in 8% and 25.5% our 2011 quarter on share was up compared with the fourth quarter but down 0.2 share points year-on-year. This was driven by the timing of the implementation of tax driven price increases as well as increased price gaps at the bottom of the market. 
In Ukraine, we have observed the market contraction and the greater polarization with growth in the Premium and Super Low Price segments. PMI is underrepresented in the latter and consequently, we lost 3.6 share points through the end of February compared to the same period in 2010. We have started to adjust the share issue by strengthening on schedule. 
The Turkish economy has been performing very strongly. During the first quarter of this year, industry volume in Turkey was done by a modest 2.1% compared to last year, and the market was significantly impacted by large tax driven price increases. Our volume increased by 10.4%, driven by Parliament, Moratti and L&M. 
Net revenues in adjusted OCI in the EEMA regions were down 8.7 and 4.4% am respectively, both excluding currency. However, also excluding the tax price influence in Q1 2010, adjusted OCI would have grown at the double digit range. 
Our good share momentum continues. In the first quarter this year, our share in our top 30 OCI markets increased by 0.5 points to 35.8%. Our market share momentum supported by the strong performance of our to key premium brands: Marlboro and Parliament. Marlboro volume declined by 2.9% in the quarter, driven by specific issues I mentioned about Japan, Mexico and Spain. In all the other markets together, Marlboro volume was up 0.5% in the quarter and the brands global market share trends continues to improve.
While many consumer goods sectors are being impacted by significant increases in the cost of raw materials, we are expecting stable U.S. dollar prices for the 2011 tobacco leaf growth, driven mainly by a larger crop in Brazil. Direct material prices are also stable so far this year despite higher energy costs. For the full year, we expect manufacturing costs to increase probably in line with inflation, partly offset by our $250 million annual productivity and cost reduction target, which we are fully on track to achieve.
Strong pricing, most notably in Japan and our continued focus and productivity improvements resulted in the increase of 2.2 points during the first quarter in PMI's adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions. Our free cash flow increased by 22.6% in the quarter to $2.2 billion and by 21.1%, excluding currency, driven by higher net earnings, lower pension contributions and lower cash exit costs. We continue to focus on reducing inventory levels, though it should be noted that year end working capital requirements remain subject to the level of tax price increases and our success in convincing elements around the world to implement strict forestalling regulations.
During the first quarter, we spent some $1.36 billion to repurchase 22.2 million shares at an average price of $61.21. We continue to expect to spend about $5 billion in total this year on share repurchase
In summary, our results this year so far has been very strong and our business outlook is favorable, though the positive impact of Japan is difficult to measure at this time. We will increase our investment behind our portfolio of leading brands and are being slightly more conservative on our pricing assumptions to ensure that we remain competitive and our key market. We have raised our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $4.55 to $4.65 to reflect our positive business momentum and more favorable exchange rates and we will continue to use our strong cash flow to generously reward our shareholders.
Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions."

I'll give you the elements but let me say in general, first that the course of there are scenarios possible and of course, scenario plannings. We have not taken the most conservative one. We have not taken the most bullish scenario that we could take. We kind of went into the sound middle ground, and that is a net-net means for the past half of the increased business guidance is attributable to Japan. Now let me give you a little bit elements there which go into, which at the same time make it so hard to give a clear cut on, but I'll try to do it best to describe the situation. Yes, year-to-date share, we said that's up 1.4 to 25.6. In March itself, the share was up 2.9 points to 26.5. So essentially it looks like we cover more than 60% of JP's temporary losses of there, but now of course to estimate today what the retention level is going to be thereafter is impossible to predict now. I would say only one thing. I would expect it to be lower given the market Japan given the Japanese consumer than it would be otherwise in another market somewhere in the world. And then when it comes to the potential volume benefits of that disruption, well of course the first question mark is how long is the disruption is going to last. So how many of the SKUs will come how quickly back into the markets, actually how efficient JP can be with the replenishment of product pipeline, then we have seen -- we have mentioned that in the prepared remarks that we have fairly high retail stocks out there higher than what we originally have thought so consumers for who are searching for their brand. So when it comes together, of course, what we made sure already in the first year for the March but mostly now in the second quarter, then of course we have the products available in the Japanese markets because the shipment number that you see is of course only the number essentially tied of course in the financials of shipments from our factories to our importer that is not the number in market sales or even of consumer uptake. So all that together, these are the elements and that gave us the conclusion I mentioned at the very beginning that leads to net result of about business guidance is assumed to be attributable to Japan."

In terms of expropriation of trademarks confiscations of our business, you raise one of the three critical facts that governments must look at it and that also Australia must look at because there are of course litigation possibilities both under Australian law and under Australia's obligations under international treaties and laws.

On one end, this is of course a country which is actually very good macroeconomic trends right now. However, when it comes to the cigarette market, then the price increase effects on the market on the consumer are simply not over yet. So for the price that we buy today low priced product you could have more than two years ago, you could have bought super premium Parliament brand so that's really was happening in the market. As a consequence of that, you really see polarization of the market. You see the Premium segment almost stable doing very, very well. Again in particular now at least you see a very competitive low-price brand and for us share losses at the very low price range so there is intense competition and really at the low end completely polarizing market in there. So that's pretty much the situation in the Ukraine. It will come down over time but it is a difficult situation right now, and there are many price promotions in place in that markets. Now moving over to Spain, while I would say Spain is the very difficult because there are too many negatives for the economy to start l. We still have stagnating GDP. We still have unemployment at 20%. Actually, 1.3 million households out of 17.3 million households in the country I was told this 1.3 million households both partners are unemployed, just to give you an impression of the problem so not surprisingly, consumer confidence is low and the only positive for the economy overall is a recovery in tourism. So in that context, it's not a surprise that the cigarette market is really depressed not to the level of the 25% that you see in the actual numbers in the first quarter because there is an important trade stock reduction in there as well, and there is the effect on the total smoking ban and what that causes this year so probably 15% is a better number for the full year. One is the also seen the market now beginning in particular in the South, we have made recent self study in the three of the cities of city of there almost 25% of the consumption were not Spanish tax paid products. So that is about double what it was a year before. That's just a snapshot that by no means is representative for Spain's total market because it is always been higher in the south than anywhere else. But that's also of course something adding into the problems and if that is a situation that is not a surprise that you see down trading in the markets even more so of course, the more war you go south the more down trading you see. So that's the situation in Spain."

My last question has to do with the Marlboro market shares in EU certainly a know so many markets make up that phone number but it strikes me as potentially troubling that you've seen two sequential quarters of market share losses from Marlboro.

Let me give you some information on Marlboro how it performs in. By variance those numbers had an over heart at the end of the day, they are part of the Marlboro franchise and we need those for incremental volumes but also for the effect on the entire brand. Now essentially going into it if you look at EU. Minus 0.1 I think it is justifiably call an overall state of performance in the EU albeit and it's true that considerable market variations in the EU. Poland would be an example of our at the market share of Marlboro nicely up more than one share point so about 10.5% share. That is clearly up trading and that is in effect but you don't see also elsewhere so there's up trading potential for Marlboro in central Europe that we call it in general. Then I would say you have markets where you have a stable situation in terms of market share Germany and Italy. They will both be down 0.1 to 21.2% and 22.5%, respectively. Then I would say you find other markets that are continuing to grow on an already high basis. That would be Belgium growing 0.7 to 25.1. And most importantly Netherlands is actually growing again 0.7 to 34.9%. That's not too bad. And then you have a loss category of markets very clearly see the effects of a down trading environment and that would be Spain, Portugal and Greece. Spain, we are down quarter 1 versus quarter 1 down 0.4. I would be even down if you compare more recently to Q3 of last year. Portugal, down 4 percentage points to 18.4 temporary again price increases due to a implementation of excise tax driven price increases of competitiveness. And Greece again down trading environment where the brand is down 2.4% to 19.3%. So down trading environment stable and growing and the number of them in up trading in central European part. I think that's the category s you find within the EU region."

We all remember the situation in 2008. That is absorbed. That's no longer the problem today. The leaf price increases for this year that we still expect will be about 2/3 of what they have been in 2010, and now they are essentially driven by the currency strength of the underlying Brazilian real in the leaf price which is Brazilian leafs. That's the most important thing. But against that, that of course also our productivity measures so that's what I can say on leaf.

We reported a very strong financial performance during the first quarter most notably, an increase in our adjusted diluted EPS of 14.4% excluding currency.The events in Japan and North Africa while distressing, only result",2544,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported a very strong financial performance during the first quarter most notably, an increase in our adjusted diluted EPS of 14.4% excluding currency.
The events in Japan and North Africa while distressing, only resulted in temporary logistical disruptions for our company and did not have a material financial impact on our overall results in the quarter. Thus, again, emphasizing the advantages of our businesses truly global footprint.
As reflected in February, our organic volume performance was dampened by anticipated softness in Japan, Mexico, Pakistan, Spain and Ukraine as well as by the events in North Africa. Indeed, these markets collectively soften the volume erosion of 8.4 billion units or 18.5%. All other markets contributing slightly more than 80% of our volume base grew their combined volume at an organic rate of 1%.
I am delighted to announce that we are increasing our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011 by $0.20 to a range of $4.55 to $4.65. Compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 17.5% to 20% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 12.5% to 15%, excluding currency. $0.10 or half the increased guidance are attributable to more favorable prevailing exchange rates. The other $0.10 are attributable to an improved business outlook in several markets, including France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Turkey, partly offset as some additional investments in marketing and sales in slightly more conservative pricing assumptions.
As you are all aware, Japan Tobacco is facing significant supply disruptions as a result of the tragic events in its whole market. It is our understanding that poor supply will gradually be in place within the next few weeks. We, in turn, have taken all necessary measures to ensure that we have sufficient in market inventories to supply the market and fill the anticipated temporary vacuum that is likely to occur. While we have certainly witnessed a moderate lift to our end market sales in the last few weeks, you should know that there are still competitive products available for sale in numerous retail accounts. And accordingly, it is proving difficult to go up to full extent of the likely uplift in sales. As retail stocks of our principal competitor's product disappear, we will be in a better position to determine such levels.
We anticipate that the second quarter will improve critical in this regard. It will allow us to have a much better read on total consumption levels and whether or not, and to what extent consumers will return to their prior brand of choice.
At this point, we face significant uncertainty. But rest assured, that all actions are in place to optimize our entire supply chain. We have a positive momentum in the Japanese market but our share increased by 1.4 points to 25.6% in the first quarter of this year, driven by the success of consumer element innovative Marlboro line extensions. 
Our slightly more conservative pricing assumptions are attributable to the continued economic difficulties in consumer affordability issues in such markets as Greece, Spain and Ukraine, and the need to react to certain competitive price moves such as selective tax absorption and repositioning, price discounting and delays and the implementation of tax driven price increases. Pricing will nevertheless remain the key driver of profitability growth at PMI, and our pricing variants in 2011 is expected to surpass the level achieved last year.
Overall, our competitiveness is strong and our business is in good shape. This is notably demonstrated by the results during the first quarter in our Asia region. Volume was up 14% in the quarter and on an organic basis it was down just 1.7%. Marlboro continued to perform strongly in the Asia region, with volume up 0.7% overall and by 5.5%, excluding Japan.
During the first quarter, we achieved volume and share gains in the key markets of Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. In Indonesia, we expect industry volume to grow by around 4% this year despite the potential unfavorable impact of higher food prices on consumer disposable income. Our technical entry last year into the low price segment in several regions has enabled us to start to grow market share again. In Korea, we achieved a record market share of 17.8% in the first quarter. With both Marlboro and Parliament driving our success. In the Philippines, we expect the industry volume this year will be broadly in line with last year following tax driven price increases in January this year. Both Marlboro and Fortune are gaining share in this promising market, and we are making good progress in realizing our brand synergy savings.
Our financial results in the Asia region were excellent, as net revenues up by 11.6% and adjusted OCI by 34%, both excluding currency and acquisitions.
The other market in the Asia region that has been in the news recently is Australia that the government has released an exposure draft of its Plain Packaging Bill, which would mandate Plain Packaging in 2012. It has opened the consultation period on the matter through June 6. PMI is firmly opposed to such emission as there is no credible evidence that it will achieve any reduction in smoking rates and the government has ignored the fact that it may actually be counter protective to public health. Plain Packaging will lead to price erosion over time and will further encourage the growth of illicit trade, which already increased in Australia by over 25% in 2010 according to a recent denied study. Plain Packaging will also result in the illegal confiscation of our trademarks and branded assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties. Unlike other governments which have focused on establishing whether there is evidence to demonstrate that plain packaging would have public health benefits taking into consideration issues such as competition, trade and legal implication as well as the likely impact on illicit trade. The Australian government seems to be forging ahead without due consideration of any of these important issues. PMI will take all measures it deems appropriate, including recourse to the courts if necessary to oppose the Australian government proposal.
Our overall performance was also very good in the Latin America and Canada region despite the significant impact on volume of the disruptively large excise tax increase that occurred in January in Mexico. Industry volume in Mexico during the first quarter was down by 27% though the underlying decline is estimated to have been about 14%. Marlboro and Benson & Hedges have remained resilient, with Marlboro reaching a quarterly market share of 50.3%, up 1.6 share points. Across the region, Marlboro has been performing strongly with markets share gains in all key markets. On a regional basis, strong pricing of 15.7% increase in adjusted OCI and the 1.9 point improvement in adjusted OCI margin, both excluding currency.
While the economies of most emerging markets have now almost fully recovered, those of Southern Europe remained depressed with unemployment still continuing to climb, most notably in Greece, Portugal and Spain. Industry volume was down by 25% in the first quarter in Spain, as the situation was exacerbated by the introduction of a total indoor smoking ban, tax driven price increases, a reduction in trade inventories and a sharp increase in contraband off a low base. For the full year, the industry volumes is forecasted to decline by around 15% and consumer down trading is expected to continue. It is worth noting that competitors have introduced or repositioned plants below the kick-in level of the minimum excise tax and have, thus, not rolled over the full effects of the most recent excise tax increase. Greece continued to be a drag on PMI results in the first quarter, with industry volume down 10%, consumer down trading due to a large price gaps and a difficult comparison as this market was not impacted by a large tax increases until the second quarter of last year.
While there has been recently structural improvements in the excise tax system, one crucial reform remains to be introduced, an effective minimum excise tax. In addition, a highest specific-to-total tax ratio would also benefit government revenues. Excluding just Spain, industry volume in the EU region in the first quarter was down 2.5%, in line with a longer-term consumption decline trends.
PMI net revenues in the EU region were down 3.5% and adjusted OCI by 2.3% in the first quarter, both excluding currency. This was driven by the lower industry volume and the decline of 0.4 share points on a regional basis. We expect our performance in the EU region to be helped this year by structural excise tax improvements implemented by governments in France, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and the U.K. following the new and improved EU excise tax directive that will be enforced through 2018. In addition, both Germany and the Czech Republic has implemented multi-year excise tax programs calling for regular reasonable increases. The first step in the German tax increase program will take place this May. PMI has announced a €0.20 per pack of 19 cigarettes price increase across its portfolio while the pure pass on require €0.04 for Marlboro and €0.11 for L&M. This will be a benefit to profitability in the German market and our decision to eventually follow competitive moves by also offering discounts on large excises enabled us to regain 0.5 share points in the first quarter to 35.7%. Thanks to the continued stellar performance of L&M and a stable Marlboro share. In parallel, we increased our share in the important German fine cut market by 0.9 points to 14.9%. In both Italy and France, industry volume was stable in the first quarter. In Italy, Marlboro has been performing well. Its quarterly share was down just 0.1% to 2.5%. And more importantly, it's share amongst young adult smokers or YAS defined as legal age minimum 19- to 24-year-olds has been growing again following the launch of Marlboro Gold Touch and remains well above about its market share. 
In France, a slightly improved market share performance has been driven by the continued growth of the premium priced Philip Morris brand, who's quarterly share grew a further 0.6 points to 8.2% and the brand YAS share has reached 16%. More generally, we have witnessed greater resilience of Marlboro across the EU region with share of just 0.1 point in the quarter at 17.8% and notable gains in Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland. And a strong momentum continued to further 0.2 share point gain to 6.1%, driven not only by Germany but also by Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.
Our volume in the EEMA region decreased by 0.8%, driven by the continued industry decline and low and share losses in the Ukraine as well as some temporary logistical disruptions in North Africa, partly offset by favorable comparisons in Romania and Turkey where the large excess tax increases in January 2010 but none this year.
Premium brands accounted for more than 40% of our regional volume for the first time since the last quarter of 2008 with increased volumes for both Marlboro and Parliament. The Russian market was influenced in the first quarter by the impact of rampant food price inflation, resulting from last summer's heat wave and drought as well as by cigarette price increases. For the full year, we are forecasting industry volume will decline moderately and consumer up trading may be more modest than originally expected. Our volume declined by 0.8% in the quarter and a 25.5%. Our 2011 quarter on share was up compared with the fourth quarter, but down 0.2 share points year-on-year. This was driven by the timing of the implementation of tax driven price increases as well as increased price gaps at the bottom of the market. 
In Ukraine, we have observed the market contraction and the greater polarization with growth in the premium and super low price segments. PMI is underrepresented in the latter and consequently, we lost 3.6 share points through the end of February compared to the same period in 2010. We have started to address the share issue by strengthening on schedule.
The Turkish economy has been performing very strongly. During the first quarter of this year, industry volume in Turkey was down by a modest 2.1% compared to last year, and the market was significantly impacted by large tax driven price increases. Our volume increased by 10.4%, driven by Parliament, Merit and L&M. 
Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the EEMA regions were down by 1.7% and 4.4%, respectively, both excluding currency. However, also excluding the tax price influence in Q1 2010, adjusted OCI would have grown at a double-digit range. 
Our good share momentum continues. In the first quarter this year, our share in our top 30 OCI markets increased by 0.5 points to 35.8%. Our market share momentum supported by the strong performance of our two key premium brands: Marlboro and Parliament. Marlboro volume declined by 2.9% in the quarter, driven by the specific issues I mentioned about Japan, Mexico and Spain. In all the other markets together, Marlboro volume was up 0.5% in the quarter and the brands global market share trends continues to improve.
While many consumer goods sectors are being impacted by significant increases in the cost of raw materials, we are expecting stable U.S. dollar prices for the 2011 tobacco leaf growth, driven mainly by a larger crop in Brazil. Direct material prices are also stable so far this year despite higher energy costs. For the full year, we expect manufacturing costs to increase probably in line with inflation, partly offset by our $250 million annual productivity and cost reduction target, which we are fully on track to achieve.
Strong pricing, most notably in Japan, as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in an increase of 2.2 points during the first quarter in PMI's adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions. Our free cash flow increased by 22.6% in the quarter to $2.2 billion and by 21.1%, excluding currency, driven by higher net earnings, lower pension contributions and lower cash exit costs. We continue to focus on reducing inventory levels, though it should be noted that year-end working capital requirements remain subject to the level of tax price increases and our success in convincing elements around the world to implement strict forestalling regulations.
During the first quarter, we spent some $1.36 billion to repurchase 22.2 million shares at an average price of $61.21. We continue to expect to spend about $5 billion in total this year on share repurchases.
In summary, our results this year so far has been very strong and our business outlook is favorable, though the positive impact of Japan is difficult to measure at this time. We will increase our investment behind our portfolio of leading brands and are being slightly more conservative on our pricing assumptions to ensure that we remain competitive in our key markets. We have raised our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $4.55 to $4.65 to reflect our positive business momentum and more favorable exchange rates, and we will continue to use our strong cash flow to generously reward our shareholders.

But let me say in general first, that, of course, there are scenarios possible, and of course, scenario plannings. We have not taken the most conservative one. We have not taken the most bullish scenario that we could take. We kind of went into the sound middle ground, and that is a net-net means for the past half of the increased business guidance is attributable to Japan. Now let me give you a little bit the elements there which go into, which at the same time make it so hard to give a clear cut on. So but I'll try to do my best to describe the situation. I mean, yes, year-to-date share, we said that's up to 1.4 to 25.6%. In March itself, the share was up 2.9 points to 26.5%. So essentially, it looks like we cover more than 60% of JP's temporary losses of there, but now of course to estimate today what the retention level is going to be thereafter is impossible to predict now. I would say only one thing, I would expect it to be lower given the market Japan, given the Japanese consumer than it would be otherwise in another market somewhere in the world. And then when it comes to the potential volume benefits of that disruption, well, of course, the first question mark is how long is the disruption going to last. So how many of the SKUs will come, how quickly back into the markets, actually how efficient JP can be with the replenishment of the product pipeline, then we have seen -- we have mentioned that in the prepared remarks that we have fairly high retail stocks out there, higher than what we originally have thought. So consumers who are searching for their brand. So when that comes together, of course, what we made sure already in the first year for the March, but mostly now in the second quarter. Then of course we have the products available in the Japanese markets because the shipment number that you see is of course only the number essentially driving of course the financials of shipments from our factories to our importer that is not the number of in market sales or even of consumer uptake. So all that together, these are the elements and that gave us the conclusion. I mentioned it at the very beginning and that leads to net result of about half of the increased business guidance is assumed to be attributable to Japan."

That is a 30% increase of a specific component, and the discussion that was very much in the media was to double the increase of its specific component eventually from 30% to 60%. So it is the start of the discussion, final decisions, I would not expect it before the end of the year, October, probably even November of this year. This has been -- this would have finalized, but what you hear there in the press is by no means final."

I mean for understandable reasons, I would not want to go into the legal strategy here, but I can give the parameters. So it's not only Australia. It's also the U.K. that go through a consultation period right now. The difference being that in Australia, it's a consultation on a draft legislation whereas in the U.K., it's a matter of concept. In Australia, the government appears to be predetermined. In the U.K., this all appears to be following a normal regular process. In terms of now expropriation of trademarks confiscations of our business, you raise one of the three critical facts that governments must look at and that also Australia must look at because there are, of course, litigation possibilities both under Australian law and under Australia's obligations under international treaties and laws. So there was on its revenues. That litigation situation and the leading situation has actually not changed compared to the time when Australia itself and also the U.K. before had been looking at the situation. And in both cases both in Australia and the U.K. the head comes to the conclusion not to implement the measure. So you would think still that whether it has no change in facts, but also should be no change in outcomes. So much of the background, but please bear with me it would not be advise to go into discussion of the leader strategy itself."

I mean, on one end, this is of course a country which has actually very good macroeconomic trends right now. However, when it comes to the cigarette market, then the price increase effects on the market on the consumer are simply not over yet. So I mean for the price that you buy today, a low priced product you could have bought a bit more than two years ago. You could have bought a super premium Parliament brand, so that's really what's happening in the market. As a consequence of that, you really see polarization of the market. You see the premium segment almost stable. Actually our share are doing very, very well. But then, in particular, in our case, you see a very competitive low-price brand and for us share losses at the very low price range, so there is intense competition really at the low end completely polarizing market in there. So that's pretty much the situation in the Ukraine. It will come down over time but it is a difficult situation right now, and there are many price promotions actually in place in that markets. Now moving over to Spain, while I would say Spain is still very difficult because there are too many negatives it's play for the economy to start with. We still have stagnating GDP. We still have unemployment at 20%. Actually, 1.3 million households out of 17.3 million households total in the country, I was told actually in this 1.3 million households both partners are unemployed, just to give you an impression of the problem. So not surprisingly, consumer confidence is low and the only positive for the economy overall is a recovery in tourism. So in that context, it's not a surprise that the cigarette market is really depressed not to the level of the 25% that you see in the actual numbers of the first quarter because there is an important trade stock reduction in there as well, and there is the effect of a total smoking ban of this year in there as well. So probably 15% is a better number for the full year. One of them also you see in the market now beginning in particular in the South, we have made a recent self study in the three of the Southern cities, Seville and Paris there almost 25% of the consumption were not Spanish tax paid products. So that is about double what it was a year before. That's just a snapshot that by no means is representative for Spain's total market because it is always been higher in the South than anywhere else. But that's also of course something adding into the problems, and in such a situation, it is not a surprise that you see down trading in the markets even more so, of course, the more you go South, the more down trading you see. So that's a good presentation in Spain."

Now essentially going into it if you look at the EU. Minus 0.1, I think I justifiably call an overall state of performance in the EU, albeit it's true that our considerable market variations within the EU. Poland would be an example where the market share of Marlboro nicely up more than one share point to about 10.5% share. That is clearly up trading and that is in effect that you will see also elsewhere. So there's up trading potential for Marlboro in central Europe that we call it in general. Then, I would say you have markets where you have a stable situation in terms of market share Germany and Italy. They will both be down 0.1 to 21.2% and 22.5%, respectively. Then I would say you find other markets that are continuing to grow on an already high basis. That would be Belgium growing 0.7 to 25.1%. And most importantly, Netherlands is growing actually again 0.7 to 34.9%. That's not too bad. And then you have a loss category of markets very clearly see the effects of a down trading environment, and therefore, would be Spain, Portugal and Greece. Spain, we are down quarter 1 versus quarter 1 down 0.4. It would be even down if you compare more recently to Q3 of last year. Portugal, down 4 percentage points to 18.4 temporary again price increases due to delayed implementation of excise tax, driven price increases of competitors. And Greece again down trading environment where the brand is down 2.4% to 19.3%. So down trading environment stable and growing in the number of sale in up trading in central European part.

The leaf price increases for this year that we still expect will be about 2/3 of what they have been in 2010, and now they are essentially driven by the currency strength of the underlying Brazilian real in the leaf price which then dollars of Brazilian leafs.

All other markets contributing slightly more than 80% of our volume base grew their combined volume at an organic rate of 1%.
I am delighted to announce that we are increasing our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011 by $0.20 to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010. This corresponds to an increase of approximately 17.5% to 20% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 12.5% to 15%, excluding currency. $0.10 or half the increased guidance are attributable to more favorable prevailing exchange rates. The other $0.10 are attributable to an improved business outlook in several markets, including France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Turkey, partly offset as some additional investments in marketing and sales in slightly more conservative pricing assumptions.
As you are all aware, Japan Tobacco is facing significant supply disruptions as a result of the tragic events in its home market. It is our understanding that food supply will gradually be in place within the next few weeks. We, in turn, have taken all necessary measures to ensure that we have sufficient in market inventories to supply the market and fill the anticipated temporary vacuum that is likely to occur. While we have certainly witnessed a moderate lift to our in market sales in the last few weeks, you should know that there are still competitive products available for sale in numerous retail accounts. And accordingly, it is proving difficult to go up to full extent of the likely uplift in sales. As retail stocks of our principal competitor's product disappear, we will be in a better position to determine such levels.
We anticipate that the second quarter will prove critical in this regard. It will allow us to have a much better read on total consumption levels and whether or not, and to what extent consumers will return to their prior brand of choice.
At this point, we face significant uncertainty. But rest assured, that all actions are in place to optimize our entire supply chain. We have a positive momentum in the Japanese market but our share increased by 1.4 points to 25.6% in the first quarter of this year, driven by the success of consumer element innovative Marlboro line extensions. 
Our slightly more conservative pricing assumptions are attributable to the continued economic difficulties in consumer affordability issues in such markets as Greece, Spain and Ukraine, and the need to react to certain competitive price moves such as selective tax absorption and repositioning, price discounting and delays in the implementation of tax driven price increases. Pricing will nevertheless remain the key driver of profitability growth at PMI, and our pricing variants in 2011 is expected to surpass the level achieved last year.
Overall, our competitiveness is strong and our business is in good shape. This is notably demonstrated by the results during the first quarter in our Asia region. Volume was up 14% in the quarter and on an organic basis it was down just 1.7%. Marlboro continued to perform strongly in the Asia region, with volume up 0.7% overall and by 5.5%, excluding Japan.
During the first quarter, we achieved volume and share gains in the key markets of Indonesia, Korea and the Philippines. In Indonesia, we expect industry volume to grow by around 4% this year despite the potential unfavorable impact of higher food prices on consumer disposable income. Our technical entry last year into the low price segment in several regions has enabled us to start to grow market share again. In Korea, we achieved a record market share of 17.8% in the first quarter. With both Marlboro and Parliament driving our success. In the Philippines, we expect the industry volume this year will be broadly in line with last year following tax driven price increases in January this year. Both Marlboro and Fortune are gaining share in this promising market, and we are making good progress in realizing our brand synergy savings.
Our financial results in the Asia region were excellent, as net revenues up by 11.6% and adjusted OCI by 34%, both excluding currency and acquisitions.
The other market in the Asia region that has been in the news recently is Australia that the government has released an exposure draft of its Plain Packaging Bill, which would mandate Plain Packaging in 2012. It has opened the consultation period on the matter through June 6. PMI is firmly opposed to such emission as there is no credible evidence that it will achieve any reduction in smoking rates and the government has ignored the fact that it may actually be counter protective to public health. Plain Packaging will lead to price erosion over time and will further encourage the growth of illicit trade, which already increased in Australia by over 25% in 2010 according to a recent Deloyed [ph] study. Plain Packaging will also result in the illegal confiscation of our trademarks and branded assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties. Unlike other governments which have focused on establishing whether there is evidence to demonstrate that plain packaging would have public health benefits taking into consideration issues such as competition, trade and legal implication as well as the likely impact on illicit trade. The Australian government seems to be forging ahead without due consideration of any of these important issues. PMI will take all measures it deems appropriate, including recourse to the courts if necessary to oppose the Australian government proposal.
Our overall performance was also very good in the Latin America and Canada region despite the significant impact on volume of the disruptively large excess tax increase that occurred in January in Mexico. Industry volume in Mexico during the first quarter was down by 27%, though the underlying decline is estimated to have been about 14%. Marlboro and Benson & Hedges have remained resilient, with Marlboro reaching a quarterly market share of 50.3%, up 1.6 share points. Across the region, Marlboro has been performing strongly with markets share gains in all key markets. On a regional basis, strong pricing of over 15.7% increase in adjusted OCI and a 1.9 point improvement in adjusted OCI margin, both excluding currency.
While the economies of most emerging markets have now almost fully recovered, those of Southern Europe remained depressed with unemployment still continuing to climb, most notably in Greece, Portugal and Spain. Industry volume was down by 25% in the first quarter in Spain, as the situation was exacerbated by the introduction of a total indoor smoking ban, tax driven price increases, a reduction in trade inventories and a sharp increase in contraband off a low base. For the full year, the industry volume in Spain is forecasted to decline by around 15% and consumer down trading is expected to continue. It is worth noting that competitors have introduced or repositioned plants below the kick-in level of the minimum excise tax and have, thus, not rolled over the full effects of the most recent excise tax increase. Greece continued to be a drag on PMI results in the first quarter, with industry volume down 10%, consumer down trading due to a large price gaps and a difficult comparison as this market was not impacted by a large tax increases until the second quarter of last year.
While there have been recently structural improvements in the excise tax system, one crucial reform remains to be introduced, an effective minimum excise tax. In addition, a highest specific-to-total tax ratio would also benefit government revenues. Excluding just Spain, industry volume in the EU region in the first quarter was down 2.5%, in line with a longer-term consumption decline trends.
PMI net revenues in the EU region were down 3.5% and adjusted OCI by 2.3% in the first quarter, both excluding currency. This was driven by the lower industry volume and the decline of 0.4 share points on a regional basis. We expect our performance in the EU region to be helped this year by structural excise tax improvements implemented by governments in France, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden and the U.K. following the new and improved EU excise tax directive that will be enforced through 2018. In addition, both Germany and the Czech Republic has implemented multi-year excise tax programs calling for regular reasonable increases. The first step in the German tax increase program will take place this May. PMI has announced a €0.20 per pack of 19 cigarettes price increase across its portfolio while the pure pass on require €0.04 for Marlboro and €0.11 for L&M. This will be a benefit to profitability in the German market and our decision to eventually follow competitive moves by also offering discounts on large excises enabled us to regain 0.5 share points in the first quarter to 35.7%. Thanks to the continued stellar performance of L&M and a stable Marlboro share. In parallel, we increased our share in the important German fine cut market by 0.9 points to 14.9%. In both Italy and France, industry volume was stable in the first quarter. In Italy, Marlboro has been performing well. Its quarterly share was down just 0.1% to 2.5%. And more importantly, it's share amongst young adult smokers or YAS defined as legal age minimum 18- to 24-year-olds has been growing again following the launch of Marlboro Gold Touch and remains well above about its market share. 
In France, a slightly improved market share performance has been driven by the continued growth of the premium priced Philip Morris brand, who's quarterly share grew a further 0.6 points to 8.2% and the brand YAS share has reached 16%. More generally, we have witnessed greater resilience of Marlboro across the EU region with share of just 0.1 point in the quarter at 17.8% and notable gains in Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland. And a strong momentum continued to further 0.2 share point gain to 6.1%, driven not only by Germany but also by Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.
Our volume in the EEMA region decreased by 0.8%, driven by the continued industry decline and low and share losses in Ukraine, as well as some temporary logistical disruptions in North Africa, partly offset by favorable comparisons in Romania and Turkey where the large excess tax increases in January 2010 but none this year.
Premium brands accounted for more than 40% of our regional volume for the first time since the last quarter of 2008 with increased volumes for both Marlboro and Parliament. The Russian market was influenced in the first quarter by the impact of rampant food price inflation, resulting from last summer's heat wave and drought as well as by cigarette price increases. For the full year, we are forecasting industry volume will decline moderately and consumer up trading may be more modest than originally expected. Our volume declined by 0.8% in the quarter and a 25.5%. Our 2011 quarter on share was up compared with the fourth quarter, but down 0.2 share points year-on-year. This was driven by the timing of the implementation of tax driven price increases as well as increased price gaps at the bottom of the market. 
In Ukraine, we have observed the market contraction and the greater polarization with growth in the premium and super low price segments. PMI is underrepresented in the latter, and consequently, we lost 3.6 share points through the end of February compared to the same period in 2010. We have started to address the share issue by strengthening on schedule.
The Turkish economy has been performing very strongly. During the first quarter of this year, industry volume in Turkey was down by a modest 2.1% compared to last year, and the market was significantly impacted by large tax driven price increases. Our volume increased by 10.4%, driven by Parliament, Merit and L&M. 
Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the EEMA region were down by 1.7% and 4.4%, respectively, both excluding currency. However, also excluding the tax price influence in Q1 2010, adjusted OCI would have grown at a double-digit range. 
Our good share momentum continues. In the first quarter this year, our share in our top 30 OCI markets increased by 0.5 points to 35.8%. Our market share momentum supported by the strong performance of our two key premium brands: Marlboro and Parliament. Marlboro volume declined by 2.9% in the quarter, driven by the specific issues I mentioned about Japan, Mexico and Spain. In all the other markets together, Marlboro volume was up 0.5% in the quarter and the brands global market share trends continues to improve.
While many consumer goods sectors are being impacted by significant increases in the cost of raw materials, we are expecting stable U.S. dollar prices for the 2011 tobacco leaf growth, driven mainly by a larger crop in Brazil. Direct material prices are also stable so far this year despite higher energy costs. For the full year, we expect manufacturing costs to increase probably in line with inflation, partly offset by our $250 million annual productivity and cost reduction target, which we are fully on track to achieve.
Strong pricing, most notably in Japan, as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in an increase of 2.2 points during the first quarter in PMI's adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions. Our free cash flow increased by 22.6% in the quarter to $2.2 billion, and by 21.1%, excluding currency, driven by higher net earnings, lower pension contributions and lower cash exit costs. We continue to focus on reducing inventory levels, though it should be noted that year-end working capital requirements remain subject to the level of tax price increases and our success in convincing elements around the world to implement strict forestalling regulations.
During the first quarter, we spent some $1.36 billion to repurchase 22.2 million shares at an average price of $61.21. We continue to expect to spend about $5 billion in total this year on share repurchases.
In summary, our results this year so far has been very strong and our business outlook is favorable, though the positive impact of Japan is difficult to measure at this time. We will increase our investment behind our portfolio of leading brands and are being slightly more conservative on our pricing assumptions to ensure that we remain competitive in our key markets. We have raised our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance by $0.20 to $4.55 to $4.65 to reflect our positive business momentum and more favorable exchange rates, and we will continue to use our strong cash flow to generously reward our shareholders.
Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions."

But let me say in general first, that, of course, there are scenarios possible, and of course, scenario plannings. We have not taken the most conservative one. We have not taken the most bullish scenario that you could take. We kind of went into the -- some middle ground, and that is a net-net means for the past half of the increased business guidance is attributable to Japan. Now let me give you a little bit the elements there which go into, which at the same time make it so hard to give a clear cut on. So but I'll try to do my best to describe the situation. I mean, yes, year-to-date share, we said that's up to 1.4 to 25.6%. In March itself, the share was up 2.9 points to 26.5%. So essentially, it looks like we cover more than 60% of JP's temporary losses of there, but now of course to estimate today what the retention level is going to be thereafter is impossible to predict now. I would say only one thing, I would expect it to be lower given the market Japan, given the Japanese consumer than it would be otherwise in another market somewhere in the world. And then when it comes to the potential volume benefits of that disruption, well, of course, the first question mark is how long is the disruption going to last. So how many of the SKUs will come, how quickly back into the markets, actually how efficient JP can be with the replenishment of the product pipeline, then we have seen -- we have mentioned that in the prepared remarks that we have fairly high retail stocks out there, higher than what we originally have thought. So consumers who are searching for their brand. So when that comes together, of course, what we made sure already in the first year for the March, but mostly now in the second quarter. Then of course we have the products available in the Japanese markets, but the shipment number that you see is of course only the number essentially driving of course the financials of shipments from our factories to our importer that is not the number of in market sales or even of consumer uptick. So all that together, these are the elements and that gave us the conclusion I mentioned it at the very beginning and that leads to net result of about half of the increased business guidance is assumed to be attributable to Japan."

And to those, you simply then have to respond and we have to protect your competitive position. I'll give you one example, maybe if you look to Russia where we had announced the price increase in December, wherein the market with new prices in January. Other competitors have made public, their decisions, later on. And still today, kind of we see now the last competitor coming into the market with new prices right now in April after an announcement in January. This is the type of thing."

In Australia, the government appears to be predetermined. In the U.K., this all appears to be following a normal regular process. In terms of now expropriation of trademarks confiscations of our business, you raise one of the three critical facts that governments must look at and that also Australia must look at because there are, of course, litigation possibilities both under Australian law and under Australia's obligations under international treaties and laws. So those are the 2 avenues. That litigation situation and the leading situation has actually not changed compared to the time when Australia itself and also the U.K. before had been looking at the situation.

It's really doing -- we are really doing well in the market again, thanks to a complete portfolio. So we are doing pretty well there in terms of shares. Mexico, well, we had expected decline there, a market reaction. If you're kind of take out of the 27% decline in that market in the first quarter, if you take out really the trade load effect over year end and if you take out also additional cylinders that you have in this quarter compared to last year, then you're either in the 14%, or say, in the 13% to 15%.

However, when it comes to the cigarette market, then the price increase effects on the market on the consumer are simply not over yet. So I mean for the price that you buy today, a low priced product you could have bought a bit more than two years ago. You could have bought a super premium Parliament brand, so that's really what's happening in the market. As a consequence of that, you really see polarization of the market. You see the premium segment almost stable. Actually our share are doing very, very well. But then, in particular, in our case, you see a very competitive low-price brand and for us share losses at the very low price range, so there is intense competition really at the low end completely polarizing market in there. So that's pretty much the situation in the Ukraine. It will come down -- calm down over time but it is a difficult situation right now, and there are many price promotions actually in place in that market. Now moving over to Spain, what I would say Spain is still very difficult because there are too many negatives at play for the economy to start with. We still have a stagnating GDP. We still have unemployment at 20%. Actually, 1.3 million households out of 17.3 million households total in the country, I was told actually in this 1.3 million households both partners are unemployed, just to give you an impression of the problem. So not surprisingly, consumer confidence is low and the only positive for the economy overall is a recovery in tourism. So in that context, it's not a surprise that the cigarette market is really depressed not to the level of the 25% that you see in the actual numbers of the first quarter because there is an important trade stock reduction in there as well, and there is the effect of a total smoking ban in all the countries of Germany [ph] of this year in there as well. So probably 15% is a better number for the full year. One filament [ph] also you see in the market now beginning in particular in the South, we have made a recent self study in 3 of the Southern cities, Seville, Malici [ph] and Paris there almost 25% of the consumption were not Spanish tax paid products. So that is about double what it was a year before. That's just a snapshot that by no means is representative for Spain's total market, it has always been higher in the South than anywhere else. But that's also of course something adding into the problems, and in such a situation, it is not a surprise that you see down trading in the market and even more so, of course, the more you go South, the more down trading you see. So that's a good presentation on Spain."

By variance, those numbers had -- I wouldn’t know by heart, but at the end of the day, they are part of the Marlboro franchise and we do those for incremental volumes but also for the halo effect on the entire brand. Now essentially going into it if you look at the EU, I’m at -0.1, I think I justifiably call an overall state of performance in the EU, albeit it's true that they are considerable market variations within the EU. Poland would be an example where the market share of Marlboro nicely up more than one share point to about 10.5% share. That is clearly up trading and that is in effect that you will see also elsewhere. So there's up trading potential for Marlboro in central Europe’ let me call it in general. Then, I would say you have markets where you have a stable situation in terms of market share Germany and Italy. They will both be down 0.1 to 21.2% and 22.5%, respectively. Then I would say you find other markets that are continuing to grow on an already high basis. That would be Belgium growing 0.7 to 25.1%. And most importantly, Netherlands is growing actually again, 0.7 to 34.9%. That's not too bad. And then you have a loss category of markets very clearly see the effects of a down trading environment, and that would be Spain, Portugal and Greece. Spain, we are down quarter 1 versus quarter 1 down 0.4. It would be even down if you compare more recently to Q3 of last year. Portugal, down 4 percentage points to 18.4, temporary again price increases due to delayed implementation of excise tax, driven price increases of competitors. And Greece again down trading environment where the brand is down 2.4% to 19.3%. So down trading environment stable and growing the number of sale and up trading invaded more the central European part. I think that's the categories that you find within the EU region."

The leaf price increases for this year that we still expect will be about 2/3 of what they have been in 2010, and now they are essentially driven by the currency strength of the underlying Brazilian real in the leaf price, which then currently is in dollars of Brazilian leaf, that's the most important thing.

We reported another very strong performance during the second quarter.  We achieved stable organic cigarette volumes. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by a strong 10.1%. Adjusted OCI excluding currency",2790,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported another very strong performance during the second quarter.  We achieved stable organic cigarette volumes. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by a strong 10.1%. Adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisition surged 16.5% and adjusted diluted EPS were 21% above the prior year's level excluding currency.
These excellent results can be attributed in particular to the Asia region with Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines all performing very strongly and higher prices in a wide range of markets.
During the second quarter, our pricing variants reached $617 million for a total of $1.1 billion during the first half of the year. In the last 3 months, we implemented or announced price increases in markets such as Nigeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia and Saudi Arabia, thus reinforcing our strong pricing momentum. Furthermore, the pricing situation in Spain improved in July.
We also have strong overall business momentum. Our share in the second quarter for our top 30 OCI markets was up 2.3 points to 38.5%. Marlboro had stable volume in the quarter on a global PMI basis as higher volume in the Asia and EEMA regions offset the impact of lower industry volume in the EU and Latin America and Canada regions. The brand share was up for stable in all 4 regions and its global share, excluding China and the U.S.A. grew by 0.4 points from 9.3%.
During the second quarter, L&M, our second largest brand, increased its volume by 3.1% accelerating its growth in the EU region and part of the EEMA region. These results were achieved by strong share growth in a wide range of markets including Egypt, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey. In light of our excellent results, strong pricing and good share in business momentum going into the second half of the year as well as a more favorable currency outlook and prevailing exchange rates, we announced today further $0.15 increase in our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011. $0.10 of the increased guidance relate to the business, the improvement being largely attributable to Japan. $0.05 relate to currency which have been noted that exchange rates may still experience some volatility over the balance of the year. The new guidance range is $4.70 to $4.80 compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 21.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 15% to 17.5% excluding currency.
Our excellent results in the first half and our favorable outlook for the second half of 2011 demonstrate the benefits of our global footprint and highlights our success with attractive acquisitions and organic volume growth over the last 10 years in Asia, the half of the world population lives. Our strong results in the second quarter reflects the strength of our management teams in these markets and especially in Japan, where I took the calculated risk to commit around the $100 million in airfreight when the extent for our brands was still difficult to judge. Our efficient yet flexible global manufacturing footprint and effective market responds enabled us to fill the void caused by the shortage and more recently products.
In the second quarter, net revenues in the Asia region grew by 27.7% excluding currency and acquisitions and adjusted OCI was 48.2% higher on the same basis. As a result, the region is now our largest contributor to these measures accounting for 35% and 36%, respectively, of PMI's net revenues and adjusted OCI during the first half of this year. And this contribution is expected to increase further as our business in the region continues to expand.
During the second quarter, PMI shipments to Japan reached 19.5 billion units, up 1.9 billion or 11% compared to the same period last year. This increase was achieved despite the unfavorable impact of the large October 2010 tax driven price increases and the boos to our shipments that occurred in the second quarter of last year ahead of that increase. Our market share has reached 42%, 17.7% points above the prior year level and 16.4 points above our share in the first quarter of 2011. As we ensure full product availability throughout the period, all our brands gained share and in particular, Lark and Marlboro. Determining exactly how the rest of the year will pan out remains very difficult due to the complex interaction market effects. These include the impact of the tax-driven price increase in October last year, the consumer and trade's prior year loading and subsequent deloading patterns, the underlying market decline, the price elasticity and leverage will diminish over time, the disruption of supplies and shortages of certain VAT products, the precise impact of our efficient response and our level of smokeless share retention once the full range of competitive products are available. The new trend for industry volume and the new base for PMI's future market share growth will not be clear until the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest.
Our business is also doing very well in Indonesia, thanks to a strong economy and a favorable comparison with a relatively soft second quarter 2010, industry volume grew an exceptional 13.9% in the second quarter of this year. For the full year, we expect the annual growth rate to be in the range of 4% to 6%. Our volume in the quarter was up by 20.7% to 22.6 billion units and our market share grew by 1.6 points to 30.2% with all our brands gaining or maintaining market share and Marlboro increasing its volume and its share within the wide Cigarette segment despite a reduction in its overall market share. The growing volume along with continual moderate price increases is driving strong profitability growth in Asia's second-largest cigarette market after China.
In Korea, we continue to achieve strong volume and share growth behind Marlboro and Parliament. Our market share grew by 3.3 points to 19.9% in the quarter with a 1 share point contribution from innovative Marlboro Menthol line extensions. Korea is 1 of the few key markets worldwide that has not increased retail prices in the past year in light of the more important need to secure excise tax reform for the long term.
PMI's organic volume in the EEMA region declined by 3.4% in the second quarter due primarily to Ukraine. For the full year, we expect our volume to be stable in the region. Net revenues were up 3.6% during Q2 excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted OCI was 4.8% higher excluding currency and acquisition driven primarily by increased volumes in Turkey and North Africa and higher prices across many markets, in particular, Russia. This was partly offset by lower volumes in Eastern Europe and additional investments in business building initiatives in Russia. These investments will further boost the momentum of Parliament, Chesterfield and Bond Street in Russia while addressing the issues surrounding Marlboro. These efforts will, however, take sometime to have a measurable impact in our market share, which declined by 0.1 point to 25.4% in the second quarter through the end of May due mainly to a temporary price disadvantage to competitive products.
At the beginning of this month, we announced to the trade further price increase of 3 rubles and Marlboro and 2 rubles on average across the rest of our portfolio. Our lowest price in the market will now be 21 rubles a pack for Optima, up 27% from a year ago. These price increases along with disposable incomes as wage increases have failed to keep pace with inflation are limiting the extent of consumer uptake. The industry volume meanwhile is expected to decline at an annualized rate of some 2% to 3% this year in line with 2010. Earlier this month, the Russian government approved its tax policy guidelines or TPG for that period of 2012 through 2014 including a detailed 3-year excise tax development plan for tobacco products. The TPG first sees that excise taxes will be indexed periodically in line with inflation and economy conditions in Russia. In addition to the excise tax increases already foreseen for January 2012 in the current law, the TPG calls for an additional increase in July 2012 of 8.3% in the specific element to 390 rubles per thousand and 10.9% in the minimum excise tax to 510 rubles per thousand. While the proposed increases are significant, we believe they should be manageable. It should, however, be highlighted that this is the first step in the process and that the plan needs to be submitted to the and the Federation council for approval. The final adoption is not expected to take place until November this year.
In Ukraine, the estimated 15% decline in industry volume in the second quarter masks an improving underlying trend as the data is distorted by the heavy trade loading that took place in the same period last year ahead of tax driven price increases. We expect the market to stabilize during the second half of the year. 
The Ukrainian market is tending to polarize with the premium and the super low price segments both expanding while several small manufacturers and illicit trade continued to grow volume. PMI's market share was down 3.5 points in the quarter to 32.1% as we are under represented in the Super Low Price segment. We have reduced the price gap between Bond Street to the bottom of the market to address this issue. Meanwhile, both Parliament and Marlboro are performing well and increase their market share during the quarter.
Overall, the Turkish market has now stabilized. Our volume grew by 12.1% in the second quarter, though it remains below the levels prior to the tax increase of January 2010. Our market share reached 44.6% in the quarter through the end of May, up 3.8 points. This impressive share improvement covers all the 3 price segments and has led by Premium Parliament, midpriced morality and low-priced L&M.  Despite the issues that continue to impact Spain and to a lesser extent, Greece, the results in the EU region in the second quarter were more positive from a number of standpoints. Industry volume decline by a modest 1.7% and was actually up in markets such as the Czech Republic, France and Germany. PMI volume was 3.1% lower due to an 8.4% decline in Greece, a 17.6% reduction in Spain and a decrease of 9.7% in Poland, the recent share at the lowest and least profitable end of the market. 
Our key brands Marlboro and L&M performed well. Marlboro's regional share was stable at 18.1% and L&M's share grew at the further 0.3 points to 6.6%. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were up 0.7% and 2.3%, respectively, excluding currency and acquisitions. While we are not entirely satisfied with this situation, there are some clear signs for renewed optimism concerning the future contribution of the EU region to PMI's profitability growth going forward.
Germany has again become one of the strongest tobacco markets in the EU. During the first half of the year, industry volume was up 1.9% for cigarettes and 4.8% for fine cut. PMI increased its market share by 0.3 and 0.4 points to 35.9% and 14.8%, respectively, during this period. L&M continues to perform very strongly, gaining a further 1 share point in the second quarter to reach a cigarette share of 10.4%. unit margin enhancing price increases has been implemented. Our remaining concern is the growth of this counted larger pack sizes while the market share of big tax defined as 22 cigarettes 25 cigarettes per pack appeared to have stabilize the share of maxi packs that is packs with over 26 cigarettes continues to increase and may receive a boost from the recent introduction of packs of 40 cigarettes.
The Spanish economy continues to suffer from high unemployment levels with few signs of improvement. Consequently, cigarette industry volumes has been contracting a double digit rates and consumers have been down trading to cheaper brands and illicit trade products. This had a special context in which price competition was exacerbated in May and June this year. However, recent developments indicate the situation has improved. 
Industry volume increased 1.8% in France and was stable and Italy during the second quarter. Our cigarette market share was up slightly in France to 40.9% as the continued growth of the Philip Morris brand also positioned in the Premium segment more than offset the slight decline of Marlboro share. At the same time following the entry of Marlboro into the categories, we also became the market leader in fine cut with a quarterly share of 25%, up 5.6 points. Our market share in Italy was down 0.7 points to 53.4%. This Marlboro down 0.3 points. This was attributable to the relative decline of the Premium segment where PMI has a 95% share. Our profitability, however, continued to improve in both markets with high single-digit increases in the quarter. Furthermore, we recently announced a EUR 0.10 price increase across our portfolio in Italy.
After increasing the specific to total component in the excise tax last December, earlier this month, the Greek government increased the minimum excise tax from 75% to 100% of the excise tax levied on the weighted average price. This implies a pass on of nearly EUR 0.50 at 20 cigarettes at the very bottom end of the market. The cigarettes retail its EUR 2.40. PMI has announced an increase in the price of its main low-priced brand, L&M 25s from EUR 3 to EUR 20 per pack. The reduction in price gaps should help the continued recovery of Marlboro's market share increase. 
Our volume in the Latin America and Canada region was 4.8% lower in the quarter, driven by a double digit market contraction in Mexico, following the large tax driven price increases at the end of last year and by the timing of shipments in Brazil. Despite the challenging pricing environment, our market share in Mexico reached 72.2% with Marlboro surging 3.8 points to reach a 52% share. 
Our business in Argentina performed very well with volume growth of over 8% and gains from Marlboro which added 0.6 points to reach a 24% market share. Net revenues for the region increased by 5.8% in the quarter, excluding currency and acquisitions, and adjusted OCI was 8.8% higher on the same basis.
On the regulatory front, the main focus remains on plain packaging. Although certain other governments had expressed their opposition to such a measure, the Australian government continues to appear intent on mandating the implementation of plain packaging in 2010 and has submitted a proposed bill to Parliament. Plain packaging will result in the illegal confiscation of our very valuable trademarks and branded assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties. We have therefore served notice of our intention to file an arbitration claim against the Australian government under the Hong Kong, Australia Bilateral Investment Treaty. We are now in a mandatory 3-month period set aside for negotiation under this procedure. Consequently, we have written to the government seeking a meeting.
Strong pricing and very moderate increases in tobacco and non-tobacco material costs as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements resulted in a 2.5 point increase in PMI's adjusted OCI margins, excluding currency and acquisitions, during the second quarter. Our free cash flow increased by $638 million or 19.4% in the quarter to $3.9 billion. Excluding currency, the increase was $402 million or 12.2%. The increase was driven mainly by our excellent business results. 
During the first half of the year, our free cash flow was up more than $1 billion to nearly $6.2 billion. During the second quarter, we spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 22.7 million shares at an average price of $68.32. Since the March 2008 spin, we have now repurchased 17.9% of the shares outstanding at that time. 
In conclusion, PMI had an excellent quarter. Our adjusted diluted EPS growth reached 21% excluding currency. Our outlook is promising with strong market share and business momentum. Pricing remains a very strong driver of profitability with Spain being a special case. We are not under any significant input cost pressures and expect to exceed our annual productivity savings target of $250 million this year. We have increased our 2011 EPS guidance by a further $0.15, bringing it to a range of $4.70 to $4.80. Compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 21.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 15% to 17.5%, excluding currency. And finally and most importantly, our cash flow continues to grow and be our focus on generously reporting our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Thank you. I will now be happy to answer questions."

Ten factories actually have been involved in the production ramp up. Our factory workers production workers actually have put in 200,000 of hours of overtime during the period, and we actually chartered the equivalent of 150 Boeing 747 cargo planes to bring 10 billion cigarettes into the market so I think we are good on that side. If you go back to really what happened in the first half of the year, as you said yourself, the full year with all the moving targets that remains to be seen. But if you look at the first half of the year, then well, you looked at the total market of 19 billion cigarettes, we had a share of about 25% January, February before the events. We have the year-to-date share of 34%, that's 9 percentage point difference or 19 billion so we're talking about 8 billion cigarettes here. You make your own estimate of the solid margins that we had in Japan. There was the airfreights, there were other costs.

During our call today, we will be talking about results for the second quarter 2011 and comparing them with the same period in 2010 unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. 
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?"
6569181,137431101,143938,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported another very strong performance during the second quarter.  We achieved stable organic cigarette volumes. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by a strong 10.1%. Adjusted OCI excluding currency",2798,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported another very strong performance during the second quarter.  We achieved stable organic cigarette volumes. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by a strong 10.1%. Adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisition surged 16.5%, and adjusted diluted EPS were 21% above the prior year's level excluding currency.
These excellent results can be attributed in particular to the Asia region with Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines all performing very strongly and higher prices in a wide range of markets.
During the second quarter, our pricing variance reached $617 million for a total of $1.1 billion during the first half of the year. In the last 3 months, we implemented or announced price increases in markets such as Nigeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Russia and Saudi Arabia, thus reinforcing our strong pricing momentum. Furthermore, the pricing situation in Spain improved in July.
We also have strong overall business momentum. Our share in the second quarter for our top 30 OCI markets was up 2.3 points to 38.5%. 
Marlboro had stable volume in the quarter on a global PMI basis as higher volume in the Asia and EEMA regions offset the impact of lower industry volume in the EU and Latin America and Canada regions. The brand share was up for stable in all 4 regions and its global share, excluding China and the U.S.A, grew by 0.4 points to 9.3%.
During the second quarter, L&M, our second largest brand, increased its volume by 3.1%, accelerating its growth in the EU region and part of the EEMA region. These results were achieved by strong share growth in a wide range of markets including Egypt, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey. 
In light of our excellent results, strong pricing and good share in business momentum going into the second half of the year as well as a more favorable currency outlook at prevailing exchange rates, we announced today a further $0.15 increase in our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011. $0.10 of the increased guidance relate to the business, the improvement being largely attributable to Japan. $0.05 relate to currency which have been noted that exchange rates may still experience some volatility over the balance of the year. The new guidance range is $4.70 to $4.80. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 21.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 15% to 17.5% excluding currency.
Our excellent results in the first half and our favorable outlook for the second half of 2011 demonstrate the benefits of our global footprint and highlights our success with attractive acquisitions and organic volume growth over the last 10 years in Asia, the half of the world population lives. 
Our strong results in the second quarter reflects the strength of our management teams in these markets and especially in Japan, where I took the calculated risk to commit around the $100 million in airfreight when the extent of the additional demand for our brands was still difficult to judge. Our efficient yet flexible global manufacturing footprint and effective market response enabled us to fill the void caused by the shortage of JT and more recently BAT products.
In the second quarter, net revenues in the Asia region grew by 27.7% excluding currency and acquisitions and adjusted OCI was 48.2% higher on the same basis. As a result, the region is now our largest contributor to these measures, accounting for 35% and 36%, respectively, of PMI's net revenues and adjusted OCI during the first half of this year. And this contribution is expected to increase further as our business in the region continues to expand.
During the second quarter, PMI shipments to Japan reached 19.5 billion units, up 1.9 billion or 11% compared to the same period last year. This increase was achieved despite the unfavorable impact of the large October 2010 tax-driven price increases and the boost to our shipments that occurred in the second quarter of last year ahead of that increase. Our market share has reached 42%, 17.7% points above the prior year level and 16.4 points above our share in the first quarter of 2011. As we ensure full product availability throughout the period, all our brands gained share and in particular, Lark and Marlboro. 
Determining exactly how the rest of the year will pan out remains very difficult due to the complex interaction of multiple factors. These include the impact of the tax-driven price increase in October last year, the consumer and trade's prior year loading and subsequent deloading patterns, the underlying market decline trend, the price elasticity and leverage will diminish over time, the disruption of JT supplies and shortages of certain BAT products, the precise impact of our efficient response, and our level of smoker share retention once the full range of competitive products are available. The new trend for industry volume and the new base for PMI's future market share growth will not be clear until the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest.
Our business is also doing very well in Indonesia. Thanks to a strong economy and a favorable comparison with a relatively soft second quarter 2010, industry volume grew an exceptional 13.9% in the second quarter of this year. For the full year, we expect the annual growth rate to be in the range of 4% to 6%. Our volume in the quarter was up by 20.7% to 22.6 billion units and our market share grew by 1.6 points to 30.2% with all our Kretek brands gaining or maintaining market share and Marlboro increasing its volume and its share within the wide Cigarette segment despite a reduction in its overall market share. The growing volume, along with continual moderate price increases, is driving strong profitability growth in Asia's second-largest cigarette market after China.
In Korea, we continue to achieve strong volume and share growth behind Marlboro and Parliament. Our market share grew by 3.3 points to 19.9% in the quarter with a 1 share point contribution from innovative Marlboro Menthol line extensions. Korea is one of the few key markets worldwide that has not increased retail prices in the past year in light of the more important need to secure excise tax reform for the long term.
PMI's organic volume in the EEMA region declined by 3.4% in the second quarter due primarily to Ukraine. For the full year, we expect our volume to be stable in the region. Net revenues were up 3.6% during Q2 excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted OCI was 4.8% higher excluding currency and acquisition driven primarily by increased volumes in Turkey and North Africa, and higher prices across many markets, in particular russia. This was partly offset by lower volumes in Eastern Europe and additional investments in business building initiatives in Russia. These investments will further boost the momentum of Parliament, Chesterfield and Bond Street in Russia while addressing the issues surrounding Marlboro. These efforts will, however, take some time to have a measurable impact on our market share, which declined by 0.1 point to 25.4% in the second quarter through the end of May due mainly to a temporary price disadvantage to competitive products.
At the beginning of this month, we announced to the trade a further price increase of RUB 3 and Marlboro and RUB 2 on average across the rest of our portfolio. Our lowest price in the market will now be RUB 21 a pack for Optima, up 27% from a year ago. These price increases, along with lower disposable incomes as wage increases have failed to keep pace with inflation, are limiting the extent of consumer uptrading. The industry volume meanwhile is expected to decline at an annualized rate of some 2% to 3% this year in line with 2010. Earlier this month, the Russian government approved its tax policy guidelines or TPG for that period 2012 through 2014, including a detailed 3-year excise tax development plan for tobacco products. The TPG foresees that excise taxes will be indexed periodically in line with inflation and economy conditions in Russia. In addition to the excise tax increases already foreseen for January 2012 in the current law, the TPG calls for an additional increase in July 2012 of 8.3% in the specific element to RUB 390 per thousand and 10.9% in the minimum excise tax to RUB 510 per thousand. While the proposed increases are significant, we believe they should be manageable. It should, however, be highlighted that this is the first step in the process and that the plan needs to be submitted to the Duma and the Federation council for approval. The final adoption of the law is not expected to take place until November this year.
In Ukraine, the estimated 15% decline in industry volume in the second quarter masks an improving underlying trend as the data is distorted by the heavy trade loading that took place in the same period last year ahead of tax-driven price increases. We expect the market to stabilize during the second half of the year. The Ukrainian market is tending to polarize with the premium and the super-low price segments both expanding while several small manufacturers and illicit trade continued to grow volume. PMI's market share was down 3.5 points in the quarter to 32.1% as we are under-represented in the super-low price segment. We have reduced the price gap between Bond Street and the bottom of the market to address this issue. Meanwhile, both Parliament and Marlboro are performing well and increased their market share during the quarter.
Overall, the Turkish market has now stabilized. Our volume grew by 12.1% in the second quarter though it remains below the levels prior to the tax increase of January 2010. Our market share reached 44.6% in the quarter through the end of May, up 3.8 points. This impressive share improvement covers all 3 price segments and is led by Premium Parliament, mid-priced Muratti and low-priced L&M. 
Despite the issues that continue to impact Spain and to a lesser extent, Greece, the results in the EU region in the second quarter were more positive from a number of standpoints. Industry volume declined by a modest 1.7% and was actually up in markets such as the Czech Republic, France and Germany. PMI volume was 3.1% lower due to an 8.4% decline in Greece, a 17.6% reduction in Spain, and a decrease of 9.7% in Poland, the reset [ph] share at the lowest and least profitable end of the market. Our key brands, Marlboro and L&M, performed well. Marlboro's regional share was stable at 18.1% and L&M's share grew at the further 0.3 point to 6.6%. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were up 0.7% and 2.3%, respectively, excluding currency and acquisitions. While we are not entirely satisfied with the situation, there are some clear signs for renewed optimism concerning the future contribution of the EU region to PMI's profitability growth going forward.
Germany has again become one of the strongest tobacco markets in the EU. During the first half of the year, industry volume was up 1.9% for cigarettes and 4.8% for fine cut. PMI increased its market share by 0.3 and 0.4 points to 35.9% and 14.8%, respectively, during this period. L&M continues to perform very strongly, gaining a further 1 share point in the second quarter to reach a cigarette share of 10.4%. Unit margin-enhancing price increases have been implemented. Our remaining concern is the growth of discounted larger pack sizes while the market share of big packs, defined as 22 to 25 cigarettes per pack, appears to have stabilized the share of maxi packs, that is packs with over 26 cigarettes, continues to increase and may receive a boost from the recent introduction of packs of 40 cigarettes.
The Spanish economy continues to suffer from high unemployment levels with few signs of improvement. Consequently, cigarette industry volumes has been contracting at double digit rates, and consumers have been downtrading to cheaper brands and illicit trade products. This has a special context in which price competition was exacerbated in May and June this year. However, recent developments indicate the situation has improved. 
Industry volume increased 1.8% in France and was stable and Italy during the second quarter. Our cigarette market share was up slightly in France to 40.9% as the continued growth of the Philip Morris brand also positioned in the Premium segment more than offset the slight decline of Marlboro share. At the same time, following the entry of Marlboro into the category, we also became the market leader in fine cut with a quarterly share of 25%, up 5.6 points. Our market share in Italy was down 0.7 points to 53.4% with Marlboro down 0.3 points. This was attributable to the relative decline of the Premium segment, where PMI has a 95% share. Our profitability, however, continued to improve in both markets with high single-digit increases in the quarter. Furthermore, we recently announced a EUR 0.10 price increase across our portfolio in Italy.
After increasing the specific to total [ph] component in its excise tax last December, earlier this month, the Greek government increased the minimum excise tax from 75% to 100% of the excise tax levied on the weighted average price. This implies a pass-on of nearly EUR 0.50 per 20 cigarettes at the very bottom end of the market. The cigarettes retail at EUR 2.40. PMI has announced an increase in the price of its main low-priced brand, L&M 25s, from EUR 3.20 to EUR 3.70 per pack. The reduction in price gaps should help the continued recovery of Marlboro's market share in Greece. 
Our volume in the Latin America and Canada region was 4.8% lower in the quarter, driven by a double-digit market contraction in Mexico, following the large tax-driven price increases at the end of last year and by the timing of shipments in Brazil. Despite the challenging pricing environment, our market share in Mexico reached 72.2%, with Marlboro surging 3.8 points to reach a 52% share. Our business in Argentina performed very well with volume growth of over 8% and gains from Marlboro which added 0.6 point to reach a 24% market share. Net revenues for the region increased by 5.8% in the quarter, excluding currency and acquisitions, and adjusted OCI was 8.8% higher on the same basis.
On the regulatory front, the main focus remains on plain packaging. Although certain other governments have expressed their opposition to such a measure, the Australian government continues to appear intent on mandating the implementation of plain packaging in 2010 and has submitted a proposed bill to Parliament. Plain packaging will result in the illegal confiscation of our very valuable trademarks and branded assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties. We have therefore served notice of our intention to file an arbitration claim against the Australian government under the Hong Kong-Australia Bilateral Investment Treaty. We are now in a mandatory 3-month period set aside for negotiation under this procedure. Consequently, we have written to the government seeking a meeting.
Strong pricing and very moderate increases in tobacco and non-tobacco material costs as well as our continued focus on productivity improvement resulted in a 2.5 point increase in PMI's adjusted OCI margins, excluding currency and acquisitions during the second quarter. 
Our free cash flow increased by $638 million or 19.4% in the quarter to $3.9 billion. Excluding currency, the increase was $402 million or 12.2%. The increase was driven mainly by our excellent business results. During the first half of the year, our free cash flow was up more than $1 billion to nearly $6.2 billion. 
During the second quarter, we spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 22.7 million shares at an average price of $68.32. Since the March 2008 spin, we have now repurchased 17.9% of the shares outstanding at that time. 
In conclusion, PMI had an excellent quarter. Our adjusted diluted EPS growth reached 21%, excluding currency. Our outlook is promising with strong market share and business momentum. Pricing remains a very strong driver of profitability, with Spain being a special case. We are not under any significant input cost pressures and expect to exceed our annual productivity savings target of $250 million this year. We have increased our 2011 EPS guidance by a further $0.15, bringing it to a range of $4.70 to $4.80. Compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 21.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 15% to 17.5%, excluding currency. And finally and most importantly, our cash flow continues to grow and be our focus on generously rewarding our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

I mean, ten factories actually have been involved in the production ramp up. Our factory workers, production workers, actually have put in 200,000 of hours of overtime during the period, and we actually chartered the equivalent of 150 Boeing 747 cargo planes to bring 10 billion cigarettes into the market. So I think we are good from that side.

We have a year-to-date share of 34%, that's 9 percentage point difference or 90 billion. So I talk about 8 billion cigarettes here. You make your own estimate of the solid margins that we have in Japan. There was the airfreights. There were other costs.

Whilst real disposable income of the people in Russia, still last year was up net of inflation, about 4% is the estimate. Now in the first half of this year, it's actually down. Inflation is ranging between 9% and 10%. Disposable income therefore probably is down about 2%. At the same time, there were a number of price increases in the market. So whilst we have not seen really uptrading to mid and premium segment to the extent people have all expected it, say 8, 9 months ago, at the end of the day from a consumer perspective, they have uptrade it. Because as I was saying in the remarks, well, our lowest price brand is now 21 rubles so prices have gone up quite a bit. In that context, we have seen last year an estimate, there is no absolute number, but a good estimate that the market was down about 2.5%. I expect something of the same nature this year and probably also going into next year but we will probably all have a better feel for that once you have seen the second half of this year."

During our call today, we will be talking about results for the second quarter 2011 and comparing them with the same period in 2010 unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. 
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.

6569181,137431101,144334,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported another very strong performance during the second quarter.  We achieved stable organic cigarette volumes. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by a strong 10.1%. Adjusted OCI excluding currency",2800,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We reported another very strong performance during the second quarter.  We achieved stable organic cigarette volumes. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by a strong 10.1%. Adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisition surged 16.5%, and adjusted diluted EPS were 21% above the prior year's level excluding currency.
These excellent results can be attributed in particular to the Asia region with Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines all performing very strongly and higher prices in a wide range of markets.
During the second quarter, our pricing variance reached $617 million for a total of $1.1 billion during the first half of the year. In the last 3 months, we implemented or announced price increases in markets such as Nigeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Egypt, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Russia and Saudi Arabia, thus reinforcing our strong pricing momentum. Furthermore, the pricing situation in Spain improved in July.
We also have strong overall business momentum. Our share in the second quarter for our top 30 OCI markets was up 2.3 points to 38.5%. 
Marlboro had stable volume in the quarter on a global PMI basis as higher volume in the Asia and EEMA regions offset the impact of lower industry volume in the EU and Latin America and Canada regions. The brand share was up for stable in all 4 regions and its global share, excluding China and the U.S.A, grew by 0.4 points to 9.3%.
During the second quarter, L&M, our second largest brand, increased its volume by 3.1%, accelerating its growth in the EU region and part of the EEMA region. These results were achieved by strong share growth in a wide range of markets including Egypt, Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey. 
In light of our excellent results, strong pricing and good share in business momentum going into the second half of the year as well as a more favorable currency outlook at prevailing exchange rates, we announced today a further $0.15 increase in our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2011. $0.10 of the increased guidance relate to the business, the improvement being largely attributable to Japan. $0.05 relate to currency which have been noted that exchange rates may still experience some volatility over the balance of the year. The new guidance range is $4.70 to $4.80. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 21.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 15% to 17.5% excluding currency.
Our excellent results in the first half and our favorable outlook for the second half of 2011 demonstrate the benefits of our global footprint and highlight our success with attractive acquisitions and organic volume growth over the last 10 years in Asia, the half of the world population lives. 
Our strong results in the second quarter reflect the strength of our management teams in these markets and especially in Japan, where I took the calculated risk to commit around $100 million in airfreight when the extent of the additional demand for our brands was still difficult to judge. Our efficient yet flexible global manufacturing footprint and effective market response enabled us to fill the void caused by the shortage of JT and more recently BAT products.
In the second quarter, net revenues in the Asia region grew by 27.7% excluding currency and acquisitions and adjusted OCI was 48.2% higher on the same basis. As a result, the region is now our largest contributor to these measures, accounting for 35% and 36%, respectively, of PMI's net revenues and adjusted OCI during the first half of this year. And this contribution is expected to increase further as our business in the region continues to expand.
During the second quarter, PMI shipments to Japan reached 19.5 billion units, up 1.9 billion or 11% compared to the same period last year. This increase was achieved despite the unfavorable impact of the large October 2010 tax-driven price increases and the boost to our shipments that occurred in the second quarter of last year ahead of that increase. Our market share has reached 42%, 17.7% points above the prior year level and 16.4 points above our share in the first quarter of 2011. As we ensured full product availability throughout the period, all our brands gained share and in particular, Lark and Marlboro. 
Determining exactly how the rest of the year will pan out remains very difficult due to the complex interaction of multiple factors. These include the impact of the tax-driven price increase in October last year, the consumer and trade's prior year loading and subsequent deloading patterns, the underlying market decline trend, the price of elasticity and whether it will diminish over time, the disruption of JT supplies and shortages of certain BAT products, the precise impact of our efficient response, and our level of smoker share retention once the full range of competitive products are available. The new trend for industry volume and the new base for PMI's future market share growth will not be clear until the fourth quarter of this year at the earliest.
Our business is also doing very well in Indonesia. Thanks to a strong economy and a favorable comparison with a relatively soft second quarter 2010, industry volume grew an exceptional 13.9% in the second quarter of this year. For the full year, we expect the annual growth rate to be in the range of 4% to 6%. Our volume in the quarter was up by 20.7% to 22.6 billion units and our market share grew by 1.6 points to 30.2% with all our Kretek brands gaining or maintaining market share and Marlboro increasing its volume and its share within the wide Cigarette segment despite a reduction in its overall market share. The growing volume, along with continual moderate price increases, is driving strong profitability growth in Asia's second-largest cigarette market after China.
In Korea, we continue to achieve strong volume and share growth behind Marlboro and Parliament. Our market share grew by 3.3 points to 19.9% in the quarter with a 1 share point contribution from innovative Marlboro Menthol line extensions. Korea is one of the few key markets worldwide where we have not increased retail prices in the past year in light of the more important need to secure excise tax reform for the long term.
PMI's organic volume in the EEMA region declined by 3.4% in the second quarter due primarily to Ukraine. For the full year, we expect our volume to be stable in the region. Net revenues were up 3.6% during Q2 excluding currency and acquisitions. Adjusted OCI was 4.8% higher excluding currency and acquisition driven primarily by increased volumes in Turkey and North Africa, and higher prices across many markets, in particular Russia. This was partly offset by lower volumes in Eastern Europe and additional investments in business building initiatives in Russia. These investments will further boost the momentum of Parliament, Chesterfield and Bond Street in Russia while addressing the issues surrounding Marlboro. These efforts will, however, take some time to have a measurable impact on our market share, which declined by 0.1 point to 25.4% in the second quarter through the end of May due mainly to a temporary price disadvantage to competitive products.
At the beginning of this month, we announced to the trade a further price increase of RUB 3 on Marlboro and RUB 2 on average across the rest of our portfolio. Our lowest price in the market will now be RUB 21 a pack for Optima, up 27% from a year ago. These price increases, along with lower disposable incomes as wage increases have failed to keep pace with inflation, are limiting the extent of consumer uptrading. Industry volume meanwhile is expected to decline at an annualized rate of some 2% to 3% this year in line with 2010. Earlier this month, the Russian government approved its tax policy guidelines or TPG for the period 2012 through 2014, including a detailed 3-year excise tax development plan for tobacco products. The TPG foresees that excise taxes will be indexed periodically in line with inflation and economy conditions in Russia. In addition to the excise tax increases already foreseen for January 2012 in the current law, the TPG calls for an additional increase in July 2012 of 8.3% in the specific element to RUB 390 per thousand and 10.9% in the minimum excise tax to RUB 510 per thousand. While the proposed increases are significant, we believe they should be manageable. It should, however, be highlighted that this is the first step in the process and that the plan needs to be submitted to the Duma and the Federation council for approval. The final adoption of the law is not expected to take place until November this year.
In Ukraine, the estimated 15% decline in industry volume in the second quarter masks an improving underlying trend as the data is distorted by the heavy trade loading that took place in the same period last year ahead of tax-driven price increases. We expect the market to stabilize during the second half of the year. The Ukrainian market is tending to polarize with the premium and the super-low price segments both expanding while several small manufacturers and illicit trade continue to grow volume. PMI's market share was down 3.5 points in the quarter to 32.1% as we are under-represented in the super-low price segment. We have reduced the price gap between Bond Street and the bottom of the market to address this issue. Meanwhile, both Parliament and Marlboro are performing well and increased their market share during the quarter.
Overall, the Turkish market has now stabilized. Our volume grew by 12.1% in the second quarter though it remains below the levels prior to the tax increase of January 2010. Our market share reached 44.6% in the quarter through the end of May, up 3.8 points. This impressive share improvement covers all 3 price segments and is led by Premium Parliament, mid-priced Muratti and low-priced L&M. 
Despite the issues that continue to impact Spain and to a lesser extent, Greece, the results in the EU region in the second quarter were more positive from a number of standpoints. Industry volume declined by a modest 1.7% and was actually up in markets such as the Czech Republic, France and Germany. PMI volume was 3.1% lower due to an 8.4% decline in Greece, a 17.6% reduction in Spain, and a decrease of 9.7% in Poland, where we should share [ph]  at the lowest and least profitable end of the market. Our key brands, Marlboro and L&M, performed well. Marlboro's regional share was stable at 18.1% and L&M's share grew at the further 0.3 point to 6.6%. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were up 0.7% and 2.3%, respectively, excluding currency and acquisitions. While we are not entirely satisfied with the situation, there are some clear signs for renewed optimism concerning the future contribution of the EU region to PMI's profitability growth going forward.
Germany has again become one of the strongest tobacco markets in the EU. During the first half of the year, industry volume was up 1.9% for cigarettes and 4.8% for fine cut. PMI increased its market share by 0.3 and 0.4 points to 35.9% and 14.8%, respectively, during this period. L&M continues to perform very strongly, gaining a further 1 share point in the second quarter to reach a cigarette share of 10.4%. Unit margin-enhancing price increases have been implemented. Our remaining concern is the growth of discounted larger pack sizes while the market share of big packs, defined as 22 to 25 cigarettes per pack, appears to have stabilized the share of maxi packs, that is packs with over 26 cigarettes, continues to increase and may receive a boost from the recent introduction of packs of 40 cigarettes.
The Spanish economy continues to suffer from high unemployment levels with few signs of improvement. Consequently, cigarette industry volumes has been contracting at double digit rates, and consumers have been downtrading to cheaper brands and illicit trade products. This is a special context in which price competition was exacerbated in May and June this year. However, recent developments indicate the situation has improved. 
Industry volume increased 1.8% in France and was stable in Italy during the second quarter. Our cigarette market share was up slightly in France to 40.9% as the continued growth of the Philip Morris brand also positioned in the Premium segment more than offset the slight decline of Marlboro share. At the same time, following the entry of Marlboro into the category, we also became the market leader in fine cut with a quarterly share of 25%, up 5.6 points. Our market share in Italy was down 0.7 points to 53.4% with Marlboro down 0.3 points. This was attributable to the relative decline of the Premium segment, where PMI has a 95% share. Our profitability, however, continue to improve in both markets with high single-digit increases in the quarter. Furthermore, we recently announced a EUR 0.10 price increase across our portfolio in Italy.
After increasing the specific to total [ph] component in its excise tax last December, earlier this month, the Greek government increased the minimum excise tax from 75% to 100% of the excise tax levied on the weighted average price. This implies a pass-on of nearly EUR 0.50 per 20 cigarettes at the very bottom end of the market, where cigarettes retail at EUR 2.40. PMI has announced an increase in the price of its main low-priced brand, L&M 25s, from EUR 3.20 to EUR 3.70 per pack. The reduction in price gaps should help the continued recovery of Marlboro's market share in Greece. 
Our volume in the Latin America and Canada region was 4.8% lower in the quarter, driven by a double-digit market contraction in Mexico, following the large tax-driven price increases at the end of last year and by the timing of shipments in Brazil. Despite the challenging pricing environment, our market share in Mexico reached 72.2%, with Marlboro surging 3.8 points to reach a 52% share. Our business in Argentina performed very well with volume growth of over 8% and gains from Marlboro which added 0.6 point to reach a 24% market share. Net revenues for the region increased by 5.8% in the quarter, excluding currency and acquisitions, and adjusted OCI was 8.8% higher on the same basis.
On the regulatory front, the main focus remains on plain packaging. Although certain other governments have expressed their opposition to such a measure, the Australian government continues to appear intent on mandating the implementation of plain packaging in 2010 and has submitted a proposed bill to Parliament. Plain packaging will result in the illegal confiscation of our very valuable trademarks and branded assets in violation of international trade laws and treaties. We have therefore served notice of our intention to file an arbitration claim against the Australian government under the Hong Kong-Australia Bilateral Investment Treaty. We are now in a mandatory 3-month period set aside for negotiation under this procedure. Consequently, we have written to the government seeking a meeting.
Strong pricing and very moderate increases in tobacco and non-tobacco material costs as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements resulted in a 2.5 point increase in PMI's adjusted OCI margins, excluding currency and acquisitions during the second quarter. 
Our free cash flow increased by $638 million or 19.4% in the quarter to $3.9 billion. Excluding currency, the increase was $402 million or 12.2%. The increase was driven mainly by our excellent business results. During the first half of the year, our free cash flow was up more than $1 billion to nearly $6.2 billion. 
During the second quarter, we spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 22.7 million shares at an average price of $68.32. Since the March 2008 spin, we have now repurchased 17.9% of the shares outstanding at that time. 
In conclusion, PMI had an excellent quarter. Our adjusted diluted EPS growth reached 21%, excluding currency. Our outlook is promising with strong market share and business momentum. Pricing remains a very strong driver of profitability, with Spain being a special case. We are not under any significant input cost pressures and expect to exceed our annual productivity savings target of $250 million this year. We have increased our 2011 EPS guidance by a further $0.15, bringing it to a range of $4.70 to $4.80. Compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an increase of approximately 21.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 15% to 17.5%, excluding currency. And finally and most importantly, our cash flow continues to grow and be our focus on generously rewarding our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

We have a year-to-date share of 34%, that's 9 percentage point difference or 90 billion. So I talk about 8 billion cigarettes here. You make your own estimate of the solid margins that we have in Japan. There was the airfreight. There were other costs.

Whilst real disposable income of the people in Russia, still last year was up net of inflation, about 4% is the estimate. Now in the first half of this year, it's actually down. Inflation is ranging between 9% and 10%. Disposable income therefore probably is down about 2%. At the same time, there were a number of price increases in the market. So whilst we have not seen really uptrading to mid and premium segment to the extent people have all expected it, say 8, 9 months ago, at the end of the day from a consumer perspective, they have uptraded. Because as I was saying in the remarks, well, our lowest price brand is now 21 rubles so prices have gone up quite a bit.

6569181,141600008,174481,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm extremely pleased to report that we achieved outstanding financial results in the third quarter. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 15.7%, and adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions",2401,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm extremely pleased to report that we achieved outstanding financial results in the third quarter. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 15.7%, and adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions was 23.7% higher. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.37 per share and grew by a remarkable 33%, excluding currency. 
While these results were boosted by the relatively easy year-on-year young comparisons in the third quarter, we comfortably surpassed all our mid- to long-term currency neutral targets even excluding the whole of our business in Japan. And year-to-date, we are well within these targets.
Our business outlook has further improved since July , fully compensating these non-favorable currency movements. This has enabled us to narrow our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance to the upper half of our previous range, namely $4.75 to $4.80, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010. This translates into an improved growth rate excluding currency of approximately 17.5% to 19%, well above our mid- to long-term currency neutral growth target and approximately 22.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates.
Our third quarter volume was exceptionally strong. We achieved an organic cigarette volume growth of 4.4%. Led by the Asia region, we have an increase of 12.6%, and EEMA was 4.8%. On a year-to-date September basis, we have achieved organic volume growth of 0.5%.
While there has been a lot of focus on Japan volume, I would like to emphasize that we achieved organic volume growth of 2.3% excluding Japan in the third quarter. Furthermore, on a year-to-date basis, the combined increase in our volume in Indonesia and Korea was nearly double that of Japan. 
Our entire brand portfolio has performed very well. Every single one of our top 10 brands achieved volume growth. Both in the third quarter and year to date, Visa international brands such as Marlboro, L&M and Parliament or medium local brands such as Fortune in the Philippines and Sampoerna A in Indonesia. 
I would like to highlight the remarkable performance of Parliament, whose volume was up 16.2% in the quarter and 9.9% year-to-date.
We are particularly pleased by the improved performance of Marlboro, which is gaining share on a global basis, excluding China and the U.S. In the quarter, Marlboro volumes increased at double-digit rates in both the Asia and the EEMA regions. On a year-to-date basis, Marlboro has gained 0.3 and a 0.5 share points, respectively, in these regions. Marlboro's slightly share decline in the EU region reflects the pressure on the premium segments on continued economic difficulties in parts of southern Europe, as well as a moderate share loss in Germany. However, the brand gain share almost notably stable in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland.
The share decline in the Latin America and Canada region marks the superb momentum of Marlboro across the region, and here's the results of the overindexation of Marlboro in Mexico. The industry volume has declined at a double-digit rate since the large tax driven price increases in December last year. This very good performance is evidenced [Audio Gap] the markets for an overall gain of 1.2 share points. 
On a regional basis, our results in Asia, the growth engine of our company, were outstanding in net revenues and adjusted OCI, both excluding currency and acquisitions up 39.1% and 75.1%, respectively. This was driven in particular by Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines. 
We also enjoyed strong performances in the other 3 regions. In EEMA, net revenues grew 11.2% and adjusted OCI, 13.8%, both excluding currency and acquisitions. In Latin America and Canada, they were up 8.3% and 9%, respectively. Our results in the EU improved this net revenues and adjusted OCI excluding currency and acquisitions up 2.2% and 3.1%, respectively.
During the third quarter, PMI shipments to Japan reached 16 billion units, up 5.1 billion or 47.1% compared to the same period last year. The increase reflects the higher market share that we have achieved this year, as well as easy comparisons due to the payback in 2010 of our distributor inventory buildup in the second quarter of last year in anticipation of increased rate in consumer purchases ahead of the October tax driven price increase. 
Our third quarter market share of 27.9% was distorted by competitive trade reloading following shortages of their products through August. We do not expect shipments to the trades to mirror consumer demand until at least the fourth quarter and possibly only in the first quarter next year. We remain, nevertheless, optimistic that we should be able to retain considerable additional market share. 
Our confidence is based on our ability to maintain an consumer uptake share in convenience stores such as Lawson at the levels slightly above 30% in September and early October after all competitive products that are available to consumers again. This compare to a pre-upgrade share in these outlets of around 26%. 
The other important element that we expect to be able to confirm in the fourth quarter is the evolution in the total markets. We now forecasted industry volume will decrease this year by no more than 15%, a much lower rate of decline than the 20% forecast at the beginning of this year.
Our business is also doing extremely well in Indonesia. Industry volume growth in the quarter was well over 10%, driven by increasing consumer purchasing power, limited inflation, higher consumer confidence and positive demographic trends. Our volume rose 22.5%, and our market share reached a record level of 31.2%, a gain of 2 share points. This very strong performance was led by Sampoerna A, which increased its market share by 0.9 points to 12.1%. Pricing remains robust, and we expect the government to continue to implement plans to simplify the excise tax structure. All these trends are very encouraging as Indonesia is a very profitable market with significant potential for further growth. 
Our market share in Russia was up slightly in the quarter through August to 25.8%, behind Parliament in premium, Chesterfield in the mid-price and Bond Street in the low-priced segment. Our volume in the third quarter was down 3.5% due to distributor inventory adjustments, as well as the impact on the total market of recent price increases. 
During the fourth quarter of this year, we expect the Russian Parliament to approve the new roadmap for excise taxes on tobacco products. This calls for increases that are higher than originally planned yet still expected to be manageable. These 2 steps in 2012.
PMI volume in Turkey rose 21.6% in the third quarter, and our market share reached 45.7%, a gain of 3.9 points led by Parliament in premium, Muratti in mid-price and L&M in the low-priced segment. 
While the market had stabilized so far this year, we expect the recently announced excessive increase in the ad valorem excise tax rate along with an ineffective minimum excise tax to cause considerable disruption. We will continue therefore to vigorously put forward our rational arguments for a more balanced excise tax structure in Turkey.
Germany has benefited from more robust market volumes since this year. Total market volume in Germany was actually up 0.3% in the quarter for cigarettes and 3.8% for fine cut, continuing the positive trend of the first half of this year. Our cigarette volume grew by 1.2% in the third quarter, and PMI gained a 0.3 share points to reach 35.2%. Thanks to the continued strong growth of L&M, which remained the fastest growing brand in the market and was able to more than offset the decline of Marlboro. PMI also gain share in the fine cut segment. 
Off even greater importance, our profitability has been enhanced but our price increase that we implemented in the second quarter of this year following the May excise tax increase. The next tax step will take place in January 2012.
We have tremendous business momentum in France, where the overall market has remained stable so far this year. In the third quarter, we further increased our market share by 0.4 points to 40.4% driven by the strong performance of our premium brands, Marlboro and Philip Morris. 
Furthermore, we achieved market leadership in the fine cut market with a share of 25.2%. Thanks to the successful launch into this segment in February this year of Marlboro. The brand reached a 6.8% segment share in the third quarter. 
Finally, we have just announced the price increase of EUR 0.30 per pack across our whole cigarette portfolio. This should enhance our profitability going forward.
Spain remains a troubled economy with very high unemployment and a difficult tobacco market. Industry cigarette volume is forecasted to decline at least 15% in 2011. The pricing situation was resolved in September, when we increased our retail prices by EUR 0.25 bringing Marlboro to its previous level of EUR 4.25 per pack and L&M to EUR 3.75. This should enable our profitability to recover.
The temporary exception of Spain, the pricing environment continues to be very favorable. This is highlighted by the $564 million in pricing variants that we achieved in the third quarter this year and the $1.6 billion year-to-date. During 2011, we have implemented or announced price increase in the majority of our key markets including Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines in Asia; Algeria, Russia, Saudi, Ukrainia in EEMA; France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain in the EU; and finally, Argentina, Brazil and Canada in the Latin America and Canada region.
Our outlook on costs remains very favorable. Current tobacco leaf crop prices are stable to slightly declining on a growth by average basis. Tobacco and direct material cost increases are very moderate and broadly in line with inflation and are being offset by our continued productivity efforts. We expect to comfortably exceed our $250 million pretax target for cost savings this year. The combination of strong pricing and limited cost increases has enabled us to continue to grow our superior adjusted OCI margins. On a PMI basis on an adjusted OCM margin, excluding currency and acquisitions, we reached 47.3% in the third quarter, a gain of 3.1 points.
One of the reasons for the absence of downward pressure on prices in our industry is the important role of excise taxes and the desire of governments to continue to grow revenues. This can be achieved through a judicious combination of reasonable tax increases, structure announcements and higher prices. There has been improvement in excess excise tax structures in several markets this year, and some countries have adopted multi-year tax plans, including Germany and Indonesia. 
While government deficit financing needs point to renewed pressure on excise taxation as a source of additional revenues, most governments appear to have understood that large disruptive excise tax increases do not improve revenue generation revenue-generating capabilities over the mid- to long-term. We do, however, expect some countries to seek to generate higher revenues by increasing VAT, which will push prices higher, though this should be manageable. Every year, there are nevertheless still a few governments that continue from time to time to introduce very large and disruptive excise tax increases. As I mentioned, this happened last week in Turkey. And additional surprises remain possible as it's still early in the process in many countries.
When it comes to plain packaging, we believe that there is no sound evidence that such a regulation would reduce consumption, smoking incidence or youth smoking or provide any other public health benefit. Indeed, plain packaging would undermine public health objectives by lowering prices and increasing illicit trade. In addition, it would violate intellectual property protections and breach international trade obligations. We, therefore, do not believe that plain packaging regulations should be widely adopted by other governments outside Australia. Though the proposed bill has not yet passed the Senate, the Australian government seems intent on ignoring these adverse consequences and on introducing such a regulation. We are, therefore, vigorously to pursuing several legal avenues to challenge this unreasonable proposal and protect our valuable brands.
During the third quarter, our free cash flow increased by $577 million or 25.6% to $2.8 billion. Excluding currency, the increase was $363 million or 16.1%. The increase was driven mainly by our excellent business results. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow was up more than $1.6 billion to $9 billion.
Our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to continue to generate the growing cash flow is reflected in the 20.3% increase in our dividend that we announced last month. As of the close on Tuesday, our dividend yield stood at the very attractive level of 4.6%. Since the spin in March 2008, we have increased the dividend by 67%, an achievement that few companies have matched over a period that included a major financial crisis, significant currency fluctuations and an acute recession. 
During the third quarter, we spent $1.4 billion to repurchase a further 21.2 million shares. Since the March 2008 spinoff, we have now used over $20 billion to repurchase nearly 400 million shares at an average price of $50.81. Over the same period, we have paid out over $14 billion in dividends. So in total, we have returned nearly $35 billion to our shareholders.
In conclusion, PMI had an outstanding third quarter. Organic volume grew by a remarkable 4.4%, the fastest growth outside Japan. This was driven by the very strong performance of all our main brands led by Marlboro and Parliament. 
Our market share momentums remains very strong. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up 15.7% and 23.7%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 33%. Pricing environment remains very favorable, and the majority of governments continue to act rationally on excise taxation. 
Our business outlook has improved further since July, enabling us to narrow our reported diluted 2011 EPS guidance to the upper half of our previous range, namely to $4.75 to $4.80, this despite recent unfavorable currency movements. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an improved growth rate of approximately 22.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 17.5% to 19% excluding currency. 
And finally, and perhaps most important, we have demonstrated again our focus on shareholder returns and shown our confidence in our bright future with the board's decision in September to increase our dividend by a further 20.3%. Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions."

I mean, it's simply the fact that, of course, the pipeline on JT's product had been empty and has been reloaded now to what ever JT considers to be a necessary level of their volumes. So in terms really of what sticks to the consumer, we simply have to wait a little bit until those shipment shares will equal really consumer offtake shares again, which has been the case in the past. For now, I really think that the consumer offtake shares which we measure in the C stores gives you the best indication. This is, of course, on a national average. This is a snapshot. And also in those stores, our shares before has been slightly higher than the national average, but we continue to see even now in the beginning also of October the very latest numbers and we, of course, look at them every week that our shares continue to be slightly above 30% with Marlboro shares in there being stable.

Now going precisely on the question on Indonesia, while we have a country, which has none of the European problems that European governments are facing, very strong macroeconomic indicators, GDP growing, inflation on the control and unemployment down, growing population, of course, as well and all that's taken together leads to a cigarette market that is year-to-date growing a bit more than 10%. I mean, this market is marching towards a total size of one-time reaching 300 billion cigarettes. So it's a huge market, actually the second most important in terms of size of Russia. At the same time, the tax outlook is manageable. Excise taxes go up. They go up slightly above inflation. They are bringing the tax tiers over time together. They are willing to do away with that loophole on using new legal entities to benefit from lower tier tax advantages, and we are having an excellent portfolio in the market, where not only Sampoerna A which is the best but also is doing fine, U Mild is growing.

I'm convinced about this is not generating really sort of mid- and long-term solid increased revenue base. They are the only one party benefiting from that would be people that sell at the very lowest end of the markets, which is not the international companies, at about 4 per pack, because at that level, the need is only 1/4 of what it is at the premium end. This doesn't make sense for the government either. At the same time, we, of course, can expect now a steep reaction at least in the first months a very steep reaction of the tax paid markets. We certainly can expect an increase in the illicit rate. These are all really straightforward rational arguments, which gives me hope that there could be a second step later in the process in this story."

First, is this really encouraging to see that we see clearly moderating total market declines? So in the quarter or also year-to-date, we talked about 3.6%, 3.7%. And actually on a year-to-date basis, half of that is just Spain. So all the other markets together are declining not even 2%. Germany is growing. France is stable, and Italy is almost stable. So that's pretty good what really austerity measures do? Well, the point really is what will unemployment do. We have seen that, of course, a steep increase in the market levels of unemployment like in Spain have an impact. I do not see Spain happening everywhere in Europe. This is very overdone. I don't think that's going to happen. Then on excise tax pressure could be, of course, I can't exclude it. But given the financing needs of those governments, I would rather see pressure on general VAT increases. In Europe that those could happen, of course, affecting all products, including our products.

Now really going to Japan in more detail, well, we can -- let's try to quantify a little bit what is the year-to-date benefit of us using this business opportunity. I think the fairest way of doing that is that you take our year-to-date shipment share, that is above 31.5%. Our going-in share prior to the events was about 25%. That's around a share gain of 6.5%. On the total market of $144 billion, that gives you a roughly $9.5 billion in volumes. You apply a very decent margins that you estimate for the Japanese markets. You did that from that substantial air freight cost that was well above $100 million. You deduct from the other cost and investments. You are right now at a the very competitive situation on the fourth quarter and we, of course, do everything that we need to do to support our brands. You take off the tax rates and you arrive at something in the range of $250 million net of tax or something in the range of $0.15 on an EPS basis. At a similar calculation at the end of the second quarter, it was about $0.10 to $0.12 then. I hope that helps."

And then I guess on the pricing side, though, because in 2011 you also saw the benefit of the price increases in Japan and the volume decline coming in better than expected. So is it fair to think about that was -- that's also a partial benefit to your 2011 earnings growth in terms of x currency basis and then the comparison and 2012 is not as positive depends I guess depending on what the tax situation unfolds in Japan?"

I think it's easy to predict that the market decline will be much more moderate than what we have seen this year because nobody expects a taxing price hike off the dimension that we have seen in October 2012. Where it stands now in terms of tax in Japan is that the tax counsel has come out with the proposed law of JPY 40 per pack to be discussed with opposition parties, which we're against. In recent discussions, we also have heard that eventually excise tax could be excluded altogether from the financing of the reconstruction package. However, let's be clear here, even at the exclusion from that package does not mean an exclusion of tax measures in the ordinary budget. So we will have to see what's going to come out in terms of tax and thereafter in terms of price because the central approval ministry of price increases is also still in place. So a lot of question marks at this point in time. We will see the outcome, but you mentioned that we will, of course, start the year in Japan from a much stronger base than we have been starting the year in 2011."

We will see there'll estimate now a new government. We will have to wait for the measures budgetary measures that was mentioned in, we would see.

The starting point for PMI at this point really is that we are having a blockbuster third quarter and that we are guiding to an excellent year 2011, i.e., we are or will be entering 2012 with really strong business momentum. Our confidence is expressed in the recent 20% dividend increase. Now going into 2012 on the key questions there, the first one we have though the financial crisis with the financial crisis trigger an economic crisis. We have had that on the call. We will see what the economies do in parts of the world. It's not going to be the same all over the world. But PMI is a company that has been able to deliver in the good and in the bad times, and we have a portfolio to do that and the good and bad times because it covers all price points. The second key question obviously is will governments make rational excise tax decision? We believe but hiccups can happen. Turkey will always happen, but net-net we think we expect them to be manageable. The third one is probably really market sizes overall. I don't expect big changes in the trains there. I mentioned before that the EU declines are moderating, that in the bigger Russian market, we see a slight decline. In the very big Indonesia market, we see strong growth. In the big Japan market, it will depend a bit on the tax. Then the other point would be, the fourth point probably is the pricing environment. Will the rational pricing environment continue? I believe yes. And I believe that Spain was the exception to the rule. And contrary to other consumer product companies, prices in the cigarette industry, our prices usually stick because governments around the world do not want to see cigarette prices coming down. The next point is you have always to do your homework and keep your costs under control, which is what we are doing as elaborated on that. Then we are a tremendous cash flow generator we have generated over the first 9 months of this year an average of $1 billion in free cash flow per month, $9 billion year-to-date. Our cash flow generation capabilities are unchanged, and also our shareholder orientation is unchanged. So and the last point I mentioned before on the question before, a global footprint always allows you to balance the good because of a global scale. So I think these are the ingredients that make up business success. And we are working hard, we have been working hard to get where we are, and we will keep working hard to deliver for our shareholders also in the future."

References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.
You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustment to earnings per share or EPS as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.
Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.

6569181,141600008,174614,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm extremely pleased to report that we achieved outstanding financial results in the third quarter. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 15.7%, and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisition",2456,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm extremely pleased to report that we achieved outstanding financial results in the third quarter. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 15.7%, and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, was 23.7% higher. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.37 per share and grew by a remarkable 33%, excluding currency. 
While these results were boosted by relatively easy year-on-year comparisons, in the third quarter, we comfortably surpassed all our mid- to long-term currency neutral targets even excluding the whole of our business in Japan. And year-to-date, we are well within these targets.
Our business outlook has further improved since July, fully compensating recent se unfavorable currency movements. This has enabled us to narrow our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance to the upper half of our previous range, namely to $4.75 to $4.80. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this translates into an improved growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 17.5% to 19%, well above our mid- to long-term currency neutral growth target and approximately 22.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates.
Our third quarter volume was exceptionally strong. We achieved an organic cigarette volume growth of 4.4%, led by the Asia region, with an increase of 12.6% and EEMA with 4.8%. On a year-to-date September basis, we have achieved organic volume growth of 0.5%.
While there has been a lot of focus on Japan volume, I would like to emphasize that we achieved organic volume growth of 2.3%, excluding Japan, in the third quarter. Furthermore, on a year-to-date basis, the combined increase in our volume in Indonesia and Korea was nearly double that of Japan. 
Our entire brand portfolio has performed very well. Every single one of our top 10 brands achieved volume growth both in the third quarter and year to date, be they international brands such as Marlboro, L&M and Parliament or leading local brands such as Fortune in the Philippines and Sampoerna A in Indonesia. I would like to highlight the remarkable performance of Parliament, whose volume was up 16.2% in the quarter and 9.9% year-to-date.
We are particularly pleased by the improved performance of Marlboro, which is gaining share on a global basis, excluding China and the U.S. In the quarter, Marlboro volumes increased at double-digit rates in both the Asia and the EEMA regions. On a year-to-date basis, Marlboro has gained 0.3 and 0.5 share points, respectively, in these regions. 
Marlboro's slightly share decline in the EU region reflects the pressure on the premium segments from continued economic difficulties in parts of Southern Europe as well as a moderate share loss in Germany. However, the brand gained share or was notably stable in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland.
The share decline in the Latin America and Canada region marks the superb momentum of Marlboro across the region, and is the result of the over-indexation of Marlboro in Mexico, where industry volume has declined at a double-digit rate since the large tax-driven price increases in December last year. This very good performance is evidenced by significant share gains in the 4 key Latin American markets: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.
Our excellent business momentum is reflected in our overall strong share performance. Year-to-date, our market share in our top 30 OCI markets was up 1.4 share points to 36.3%. In the quarter, we achieved a higher share in a clear majority of these 30 markets for an overall gain of 1.2 share points. 
On a regional basis, our results in Asia, the growth engine of our company, were outstanding with net revenues and adjusted OCI, both excluding currency and acquisitions, up 39.1% and 75.1%, respectively. This was driven in particular by Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines. 
We also enjoyed strong performances in the other 3 regions. In EEMA, net revenues grew 11.2% and adjusted OCI, 13.8%, both excluding currency and acquisitions. In Latin America and Canada, they were up 8.3% and 9%, respectively. Our results in the EU improved with net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, up 2.2% and 3.1%, respectively.
During the third quarter, PMI shipments to Japan reached 16 billion units, up 5.1 billion or 47.1% compared to the same period last year. The increase reflects the higher market share that we have achieved this year as well as easy comparisons due to the payback in 2010 of our distributor inventory buildup in the second quarter of last year in anticipation of increased trade and consumer purchases ahead of the October tax-driven price increase. 
Our third quarter market share of 27.9% was distorted by competitive trade reloading following shortages of their products through August. We do not expect shipments to the trade to mirror consumer demand until at least the fourth quarter and possibly, only in the first quarter next year. We remain, nevertheless, optimistic that we should be able to retain considerable additional market share. 
Our confidence is based on our ability to maintain a consumer offtake share in convenience stores, such as Lawson, at a level slightly above 30% in September and early October, after all competitive products were available to consumers again. This compared to a pre-earthquake share in these outlets of around 26%. 
The other important element that we expect to be able to confirm in the fourth quarter is the evolution in the total market. We now forecast that industry volume will decrease this year by no more than 15%, a much lower rate of decline than the 20% forecast at the beginning of this year.
Our business is also doing extremely well in Indonesia. Industry volume growth in the quarter was well over 10%, driven by increasing consumer purchasing power, limited inflation, higher consumer confidence and positive demographic trends. Our volume rose 22.5%, and our market share reached a record level of 31.2%, a gain of 2 share points. This very strong performance was led by Sampoerna A, which increased its market share by 0.9 points to 12.1%. Pricing remains robust, and we expect the government to continue to implement plans to simplify the excise tax structure. All these trends are very encouraging as Indonesia is a very profitable market with significant potential for further growth. 
Our market share in Russia was up slightly in the quarter through August to 25.8%, behind Parliament in premium, Chesterfield in the mid-price and Bond Street in the low-priced segment. Our volume in the third quarter was down 3.5% due to distributor inventory adjustments as well as the impact on the total market of recent price increases. 
During the fourth quarter of this year, we expect the Russian Parliament to approve the new roadmap for excise taxes on tobacco products. This calls for increases that are higher than originally planned yet still expected to be manageable, with 2 steps in 2012.
PMI volume in Turkey rose 21.6% in the third quarter, and our market share reached 45.7%, a gain of 3.9 points led by Parliament in premium, Muratti in mid-price and L&M in the low-price segment. 
While the market had stabilized so far this year, we expect the recently announced excessive increase in the ad valorem excise tax rate along with an ineffective minimum excise tax to cause considerable disruption. We will continue, therefore, to vigorously put forward our rational arguments for a more balanced excise tax structure in Turkey.
Germany has benefited from more robust market volume trends this year. Total market volume in Germany was actually up 0.3% in the quarter for cigarettes and 3.8% for fine cut, continuing the positive trend of the first quarter of this year. Our cigarette volume grew by 1.2% in the third quarter, and PMI gained 0.3 share points to reach 35.2% thanks to the continued strong growth of L&M, which remained the fastest growing brand in the market and was able to more than offset the decline of Marlboro. PMI also gain share in the fine cut segment. 
Of even greater importance, our profitability has been enhanced by the price increase that we implemented in the second quarter of this year following the May excise tax increase. The next tax step will take place in January 2012.
We have tremendous business momentum in France, where the overall market has remained stable so far this year. In the third quarter, we further increased our market share by 0.4 points to 40.4%, driven by the strong performance of our premium brands: Marlboro and Philip Morris. Furthermore, we achieved market leadership in the fine cut market, with a share of 25.2%, thanks to the successful launch into this segment in February this year of Marlboro. The brand reached a 6.8% segment share in the third quarter. 
Finally, we have just announced the price increase of EUR 0.30 per pack across our whole cigarette portfolio. This should enhance our profitability going forward.
Spain remains a troubled economy with very high unemployment and a difficult tobacco market. Industry cigarette volume is forecast to decline at least 15% in 2011. The pricing situation was resolved in September when we increased our retail prices by EUR 0.25, bringing Marlboro to its previous level of EUR 4.25 per pack and L&M to EUR 3.75. This should enable our profitability to recover.
With the temporary exception of Spain, the pricing environment continues to be very favorable. This is highlighted by the $564 million in pricing variance that we achieved in the third quarter this year and the $1.6 billion year-to-date. During 2011, we have implemented or announced price increase in the majority of our key markets including: Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines in Asia; Algeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine in EEMA; France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain in the EU; and finally, Argentina, Brazil and Canada in the Latin America and Canada region.
Our outlook on costs remains very favorable. Current tobacco leaf crop prices are stable to slightly declining on a worldwide average basis. Tobacco and direct material cost increases are very moderate and broadly in line with inflation and are being offset by our continued productivity efforts. We expect to comfortably exceed our $250 million pretax target for cost savings this year. 
The combination of strong pricing and limited cost increases has enabled us to continue to grow our superior adjusted OCI margins. On a PMI-wide basis, our adjusted OCM margin, excluding currency and acquisitions, reached 47.3% in the third quarter, a gain of 3.1 points.
One of the reasons for the absence of downward pressure on prices in our industry is the important role of excise taxes and the desire of governments to continue to grow revenues. This can be achieved through a judicious combination of reasonable excise tax increases, structural enhancements and higher prices. There has been improvements in excise tax structures in several markets this year, and some countries have adopted multi-year tax plans, including Germany and Indonesia. 
While government deficit financing needs point to renewed pressure on excise taxation as a source of additional revenues, most governments appear to have understood that large disruptive excise tax increases do not improve revenue-generating capabilities over the mid to long term. We do, however, expect some countries to seek to generate higher revenues by increasing VAT, which will push prices higher, though this should be manageable. Every year, there are, nevertheless, still a few governments that continue from time to time to introduce very large and disruptive excise tax increases. As I mentioned, this happened last week in Turkey, and additional surprises remain possible as it is still early in the budget process in many countries.
When it comes to plain packaging, we believe that there is no sound evidence that such a regulation would reduce consumption, smoking incidence or youth smoking or provide any other public health benefit. Indeed, plain packaging would undermine public health objectives by lowering prices and increasing illicit trade. In addition, it would violate intellectual property protections and breach international trade obligations. We, therefore, do not believe that plain packaging regulations should be widely adopted by other governments outside Australia. 
Though the proposed bill has not yet passed the Senate, the Australian government seems intent on ignoring these adverse consequences and on introducing such a regulation. We are, therefore, vigorously pursuing several legal avenues to challenge this unreasonable proposal and protect our valuable brands.
During the third quarter, our free cash flow increased by $577 million or 25.6% to $2.8 billion. Excluding currency, the increase was $363 million or 16.1%. The increase was driven mainly by our excellent business results. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow was up more than $1.6 billion to $9 billion.
Our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to continue to generate the growing cash flow is reflected in the 20.3% increase in our dividend that we announced last month. 
As of the close on Tuesday, our dividend yield stood at the very attractive level of 4.6%. Since the spin in March 2008, we have increased the dividend by 67%, an achievement that few companies have matched over a period that included a major financial crisis, significant currency fluctuations and an acute recession. 
During the third quarter, we spent $1.4 billion to repurchase a further 21.2 million shares. Since the March 2008 spinoff, we have now used over $20 billion to repurchase nearly 400 million shares at an average price of $50.81. Over the same period, we have paid out over $14 billion in dividends. So in total, we have returned nearly $35 billion to our shareholders.
In conclusion, PMI had an outstanding third quarter. Organic volume grew by a remarkable 4.4% with half this growth outside Japan. This was driven by the very strong performance of all our main brands led by Marlboro and Parliament. 
Our market share momentum remains very strong. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up 15.7% and 23.7%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 33%. Pricing environment remains very favorable, and the vast majority of governments continue to act rationally on excise taxation. 
Our business outlook has improved further since July, enabling us to narrow our reported diluted 2011 EPS guidance to the upper half of our previous range, namely, to $4.75 to $4.80, this despite recent unfavorable currency movements. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an improved growth rate of approximately 22.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 17.5% to 19% excluding currency. 
And finally and perhaps most important, we have demonstrated again our focus on shareholder returns and shown our confidence in our bright future with the board's decision in September to increase our dividend by a further 20.3%. 
Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions."

I mean, it's simply the fact that, of course, the pipeline on JT's product had been empty and has been reloaded now to whatever JT considers to be a necessary level of their volumes. So in terms, really, of what sticks with the consumer, we simply have to wait a little bit until those shipment shares will equal really consumer offtake shares again, which has been the case in the past. For now, I really think that the consumer offtake shares which we measure in the C-stores give you the best indication. This is, of course, not a national average. This is a snapshot. And also, in those stores, our shares before has been slightly higher than the national average. But we continue to see, even now in the beginning also of October, the very latest numbers, and we, of course, look at them every week, that our shares continue to be slightly above 30% with Marlboro shares in there being stable. So therefore, I mean, that, of course, makes us feel good about the retention shares that we will be able to keep and which will form a much better basis from which to grow going into next year."

We are also having very decent results in the other regions. Take the EEMA region. Take the Latin America region, but also take the EU region, where we have returned to OCI growth. So whilst the growth rates are the strongest in Asia, the business is doing very well also elsewhere. Now going precisely on the question on Indonesia. While we have a country which has none of the European problems that European governments are facing: Very strong macroeconomic indicators, GDP growing, inflation under control and unemployment down, growing population, of course, as well. And all that taken together leads to a cigarette market that is, year-to-date, growing a bit more than 10%. I mean, this market is marching towards a total size of -- onetime, reaching 300 billion cigarettes. So it's a huge market, actually the second most important in terms of size of Russia. At the same time, the tax outlook is manageable. Excise taxes go up. They go up slightly above inflation. They are bringing the tax tiers, over time, together. They are willing to do away with that loophole on using new legal entities to benefit from lower-tier tax advantages. And we are having an excellent portfolio in the market, where not only Sampoerna A, which is the best, but also is doing fine. U Mild is growing. So we are doing really well, and we have actually also good price points on our individual brands when it comes to the prices that those are being sold by retailers on a stick basis."

The only one party benefiting from that would be people that sell at the very lowest end of the markets, which is not the international companies, at about TRY 4 per pack, because at that level, their allover need is only 1/4 of what it is at the premium end. This doesn't make sense for the government either. At the same time, we, of course, can expect now a steep reaction -- at least in the first months, a very steep reaction of the tax paid markets.

However, there are a couple of positive aspects to the EU business, really because you asked the question in a longer context, in a 2-, 3-year context. First, it is really encouraging to see that we see clearly moderating total market declines. So in the quarter or in also year-to-date, we talk about 3.6%, 3.7%. And actually, on a year-to-date basis, half of that is just Spain. So, i.e. all the other markets together are declining not even 2%. Germany is growing. France is stable, and Italy is almost stable. So that's pretty good. What will the austerity measures do? Well, the point really is what will unemployment do. We have seen that, of course, a steep increase in dramatic levels of unemployment, like in Spain, have an impact. I do not see Spain happening everywhere in Europe. This is very overdone. I don't think that's going to happen. So then on excise tax pressure, could be. Of course, I can't exclude it. But given the financing needs of those governments, I would rather see pressure on general VAT increases. In Europe, those could happen, of course, affecting all products, including our products. That being said, a VAT increase has always been manageable at the end of the day in the past. Why wouldn't we be able to manage it -- to manage through these occasions also going into the future."

And a price skirmish in Spain, also a part -- that's part of business. What can you do? I wouldn't call this one a one-off. This is just part of the business on the good and on the bad side. Now really, going to Japan in more detail, well, we can -- let's try to quantify a little bit what is the year-to-date benefit of us ceasing this business opportunity. I think the fairest way of doing that is that you take our year-to-date shipment share. That is above 31.5%. Our going-in share prior to the events was about 25%. That's around a share gain of 6.5%. On a total market of $144 billion, that gives you roughly $9.5 billion in volumes. You apply the very decent margins that you estimate for the Japanese market. You deduct from that substantial air freight cost that was well above $100 million. You deduct from there other cost and investments. We are right now at a the very competitive situation in the fourth quarter. And we, of course, do everything that we need to do to support our brands. You take off the tax rates, and you arrive at something in the range of $250 million net of tax or something in the range of $0.15 on an EPS basis. I've done a similar calculation at the end of the second quarter. It was about $0.10 to $0.12 then. I hope that helps."

And then I guess on the pricing side, though, because in 2011 you also saw the benefit of the price increases in Japan and the volume decline coming in better than expected. So is it fair to think about that was -- that's also a partial benefit to your 2011 earnings growth in terms of x currency basis and then the comparison in 2012 is not as positive depends, I guess, depending on what the tax situation unfolds in Japan?"

I think it's easy to predict that the market decline will be much more moderate than what we have seen this year, because nobody expects a taxing price hike of f the dimension that we have seen in October 2012. Where it stands now in terms of tax in Japan is that the DPJ tax council has come out with the proposed law of JPY 40 per pack to be discussed with opposition parties, which we're against. In recent discussions, we also have heard that eventually, excise tax could be excluded altogether from the financing of the reconstruction package. However, let's be clear here. Even the exclusion from that package does not mean an exclusion of tax measures in the ordinary budget. So we will have to see what's going to come out in terms of tax and thereafter, in terms of price, because well, the central approval by the Finance Ministry of price increases is also still in place. So a lot of question marks at this point in time. We will see the outcome, but you mentioned it. I mean, we will, of course, start the year in Japan from a much stronger base than we have been starting the year in 2011."

If you move over to France, that's a different situation there. There, actually, we have 2 growing premium brands. Both Philip Morris and Marlboro are doing extremely well in an otherwise stable market. The market where we are underrepresented at the low end, clearly, is Italy. There, our share at the low price segment of the market is well below our overall total market share in the market. So it's a marketing, it's a brand challenge.

The starting point for PMI at this point really is that we are having a blockbuster third quarter and that we are guiding to an excellent year 2011, i.e. we are and will be entering 2012 with really strong business momentum. Our confidence is expressed in the recent 20% dividend increase. Now going into 2012, on the key question there, the first one, we have built the financial crisis, triggered an economy crisis. We have had that on the call. We will see what the economies do in parts of the world. It's not going to be the same all over the world. But PMI is a company that has been able to deliver in the good and in the bad times. And we have a portfolio to do that in the good and in the bad times, because it covers all price points. The second key question, obviously, is will governments make rational excise tax decisions? We believe yes, but hiccups can happen. Turkey will always happen. But net-net, we think we expect them to be manageable. The third one is probably really market sizes overall. I don't expect big changes in the trends there. I mentioned before that the EU declines are moderating, that in the big Russian market, I see only a slight decline. In the very big Indonesian market, we see strong growth. In the big Japan market, it will depend a bit on the tax. Then the other point would be -- the fourth point probably is the pricing environment. Will the rational pricing environment continue? I believe yes, that -- and I believe that Spain was the exception to the rule. And contrary to other consumer product companies, prices in the cigarette industry, our prices usually stick, because governments around the world do not want to see cigarette prices coming down. The next point is that you have always to do your homework and keep your cost under control, which is what we are doing. I have elaborated on that. Then we are a tremendous cash flow generator. We have generated, over the first 9 months of this year, an average of $1 billion in free cash flow per month, $9 billion year-to-date. Our cash flow generation capabilities are unchanged, and also, our shareholder orientation is unchanged. So -- and the last point, I mentioned it before on the question before, a global footprint always allows you to balance the bad with the good because of a global scale. So I think these are the ingredients that make up business success. And we are working hard, and we have been working hard to get where we are. And we will keep on working hard to deliver for our shareholders also in the future."

6569181,141600008,174749,"Philip Morris International, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2011",2011-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Philip Morris International Inc.","Executives","Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm extremely pleased to report that we achieved outstanding financial results in the third quarter. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 15.7%, and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisition",2454,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm extremely pleased to report that we achieved outstanding financial results in the third quarter. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 15.7%, and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, was 23.7% higher. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.37 per share and grew by a remarkable 33%, excluding currency. 
While these results were boosted by relatively easy year-on-year comparisons in the third quarter, we comfortably surpassed all our mid- to long-term currency neutral targets even excluding the whole of our business in Japan. And year-to-date, we are well within these targets.
Our business outlook has further improved since July, fully compensating recent unfavorable currency movements. This has enabled us to narrow our 2011 reported diluted EPS guidance to the upper half of our previous range, namely to $4.75 to $4.80. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this translates into an improved growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 17.5% to 19%, well above our mid- to long-term currency neutral growth target and approximately 22.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates.
Our third quarter volume was exceptionally strong. We achieved an organic cigarette volume growth of 4.4%, led by the Asia region, with an increase of 12.6% and EEMA with 4.8%. On a year-to-date September basis, we have achieved organic volume growth of 0.5%.
While there has been a lot of focus on Japan volume, I would like to emphasize that we achieved organic volume growth of 2.3%, excluding Japan, in the third quarter. Furthermore, on a year-to-date basis, the combined increase in our volume in Indonesia and Korea was nearly double that of Japan. 
Our entire brand portfolio has performed very well. Every single one of our top 10 brands achieved volume growth both in the third quarter and year to date, be they international brands such as Marlboro, L&M and Parliament or leading local brands such as Fortune in the Philippines and Sampoerna A in Indonesia. I would like to highlight the remarkable performance of Parliament, whose volume was up 16.2% in the quarter and 9.9% year-to-date.
We are particularly pleased by the improved performance of Marlboro, which is gaining share on a global basis, excluding China and the U.S. In the quarter, Marlboro volumes increased at double-digit rates in both the Asia and EEMA regions. On a year-to-date basis, Marlboro has gained 0.3 and 0.5 share points, respectively, in these regions. 
Marlboro's slightly share decline in the EU region reflects the pressure on the premium segments from continued economic difficulties in parts of Southern Europe as well as a moderate share loss in Germany. However, the brand gained share or was notably stable in Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, the Netherlands and Poland.
The share decline in the Latin America and Canada region marks the superb momentum of Marlboro across the region and is the result of the over-indexation of Marlboro in Mexico, where industry volume has declined at a double-digit rate since the large tax-driven price increases in December last year. This very good performance is evidenced by significant share gains in the 4 key Latin American markets: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico.
Our excellent business momentum is reflected in our overall strong share performance. Year-to-date, our market share in our top 30 OCI markets was up 1.4 share points to 36.3%. In the quarter, we achieved a higher share in a clear majority of these 30 markets for an overall gain of 1.2 share points. 
On a regional basis, our results in Asia, the growth engine of our company, were outstanding with net revenues and adjusted OCI, both excluding currency and acquisitions, up 39.1% and 75.1%, respectively. This was driven in particular by Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines. 
We also enjoyed strong performances in the other 3 regions. In EEMA, net revenues grew 11.2% and adjusted OCI, 13.8%, both excluding currency and acquisitions. In Latin America and Canada, they were up 8.3% and 9%, respectively. Our results in the EU improved with net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, up 2.2% and 3.1%, respectively.
During the third quarter, PMI shipments to Japan reached 16 billion units, up 5.1 billion or 47.1% compared to the same period last year. The increase reflects the higher market share that we have achieved this year as well as easy comparisons due to the payback in 2010 of our distributor inventory buildup in the second quarter of last year in anticipation of increased trade and consumer purchases ahead of the October tax-driven price increase. 
Our third quarter market share of 27.9% was distorted by competitive trade reloading following shortages of their products through August. We do not expect shipments to the trade to mirror consumer demand until at least the fourth quarter and possibly, only in the first quarter next year. We remain, nevertheless, optimistic that we should be able to retain considerable additional market share. 
Our confidence is based on our ability to maintain a consumer offtake share in convenience stores, such as Lawson, at a level slightly above 30% in September and early October, after all competitive products were available to consumers again. This compared to a pre-earthquake share in these outlets of around 26%. 
The other important element that we expect to be able to confirm in the fourth quarter is the evolution in the total market. We now forecast that industry volume will decrease this year by no more than 15%, a much lower rate of decline than the 20% forecast at the beginning of this year.
Our business is also doing extremely well in Indonesia. Industry volume growth in the quarter was well over 10%, driven by increasing consumer purchasing power, limited inflation, higher consumer confidence and positive demographic trends. Our volume rose 22.5%, and our market share reached a record level of 31.2%, a gain of 2 share points. This very strong performance was led by Sampoerna A, which increased its market share by 0.9 points to 12.1%. Pricing remains robust, and we expect the government to continue to implement plans to simplify the excise tax structure. All these trends are very encouraging as Indonesia is a very profitable market with significant potential for further growth. 
Our market share in Russia was up slightly in the quarter through August to 25.8%, behind Parliament in premium, Chesterfield in the mid-price and Bond Street in the low-priced segment. Our volume in the third quarter was down 3.5% due to distributor inventory adjustments as well as the impact on the total market of recent price increases. 
During the fourth quarter of this year, we expect the Russian Parliament to approve the new roadmap for excise taxes on tobacco products. This calls for increases that are higher than originally planned yet still expected to be manageable, with 2 steps in 2012.
PMI volume in Turkey rose 21.6% in the third quarter, and our market share reached 45.7%, a gain of 3.9 points led by Parliament in premium, Muratti in mid-price and L&M in the low-price segment. 
While the market has stabilized so far this year, we expect the recently announced excessive increase in the ad valorem excise tax rate along with an ineffective minimum excise tax to cause considerable disruption. We will continue, therefore, to vigorously put forward our rational arguments for a more balanced excise tax structure in Turkey.
Germany has benefited from more robust market volume trends this year. Total market volume in Germany was actually up 0.3% in the quarter for cigarettes and 3.8% for fine cut, continuing the positive trend of the first half of this year. Our cigarette volume grew by 1.2% in the third quarter, and PMI gained 0.3 share points to reach 35.2% thanks to the continued strong growth of L&M, which remained the fastest growing brand in the market and was able to more than offset the decline of Marlboro. PMI also gained share in the fine cut segment. 
Of even greater importance, our profitability has been enhanced by the price increase that we implemented in the second quarter of this year following the May excise tax increase. The next tax step will take place in January 2012.
We have tremendous business momentum in France, where the overall market has remained stable so far this year. In the third quarter, we further increased our market share by 0.4 points to 40.4%, driven by the strong performance of our premium brands: Marlboro and Philip Morris. Furthermore, we achieved market leadership in the fine cut market, with a share of 25.2%, thanks to the successful launch into this segment in February this year of Marlboro. The brand reached a 6.8% segment share in the third quarter. 
Finally, we have just announced the price increase of EUR 0.30 per pack across our whole cigarette portfolio. This should enhance our profitability going forward.
Spain remains a troubled economy with very high unemployment and a difficult tobacco market. Industry cigarette volume is forecast to decline at least 15% in 2011. The pricing situation was resolved in September when we increased our retail prices by EUR 0.25, bringing Marlboro to its previous level of EUR 4.25 per pack and L&M to EUR 3.75. This should enable our profitability to recover.
With the temporary exception of Spain, the pricing environment continues to be very favorable. This is highlighted by the $564 million in pricing variance that we achieved in the third quarter this year and the $1.6 billion year-to-date. During 2011, we have implemented or announced price increase in the majority of our key markets including: Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines in Asia; Algeria, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine in EEMA; France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain in the EU; and finally, Argentina, Brazil and Canada in the Latin America and Canada region.
Our outlook on costs remains very favorable. Current tobacco leaf crop prices are stable to slightly declining on a worldwide average basis. Tobacco and direct material cost increases are very moderate and broadly in line with inflation and are being offset by our continued productivity efforts. We expect to comfortably exceed our $250 million pretax target for cost savings this year. 
The combination of strong pricing and limited cost increases has enabled us to continue to grow our superior adjusted OCI margins. On a PMI-wide basis, our adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions, reached 47.3% in the third quarter, a gain of 3.1 points.
One of the reasons for the absence of downward pressure on prices in our industry is the important role of excise taxes and the desire of governments to continue to grow revenues. This can be achieved through a judicious combination of reasonable excise tax increases, structural enhancements and higher prices. There have been improvements in excise tax structures in several markets this year, and some countries have adopted multi-year tax plans, including Germany and Indonesia. 
While government deficit financing needs point to renewed pressure on excise taxation as a source of additional revenues, most governments appear to have understood that large disruptive excise tax increases do not improve revenue-generating capabilities over the mid to long term. We do, however, expect some countries to seek to generate higher revenues by increasing VAT, which will push prices higher, though this should be manageable. 
Every year, there are, nevertheless, still a few governments that continue from time to time to introduce very large and disruptive excise tax increases. As I mentioned, this happened last week in Turkey, and additional surprises remain possible as it is still early in the budget process in many countries.
When it comes to plain packaging, we believe that there is no sound evidence that such a regulation would reduce consumption, smoking incidence or youth smoking or provide any other public health benefit. Indeed, plain packaging would undermine public health objectives by lowering prices and increasing illicit trade. In addition, it would violate intellectual property protections and breach international trade obligations. We, therefore, do not believe that plain packaging regulations should be widely adopted by other governments outside Australia. 
Though the proposed bill has not yet passed the Senate, the Australian government seems intent on ignoring these adverse consequences and on introducing such a regulation. We are, therefore, vigorously pursuing several legal avenues to challenge this unreasonable proposal and protect our valuable brands.
During the third quarter, our free cash flow increased by $577 million or 25.6% to $2.8 billion. Excluding currency, the increase was $363 million or 16.1%. The increase was driven mainly by our excellent business results. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow was up more than $1.6 billion to $9 billion.
Our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to continue to generate a growing cash flow is reflected in the 20.3% increase in our dividend that we announced last month. 
As of the close on Tuesday, our dividend yield stood at the very attractive level of 4.6%. Since the spin in March 2008, we have increased the dividend by 67%, an achievement that few companies have matched over a period that included a major financial crisis, significant currency fluctuations and an acute recession. 
During the third quarter, we spent $1.4 billion to repurchase a further 21.2 million shares. Since the March 2008 spinoff, we have now used over $20 billion to repurchase nearly 400 million shares at an average price of $50.81. Over the same period, we have paid out over $14 billion in dividend. So in total, we have returned nearly $35 billion to our shareholders.
In conclusion, PMI had an outstanding third quarter. Organic volume grew by a remarkable 4.4% with half this growth outside Japan. This was driven by the very strong performance of all our main brands, led by Marlboro and Parliament. 
Our market share momentum remains very strong. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up 15.7% and 23.7%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 33%. Pricing environment remains very favorable, and the vast majority of governments continue to act rationally on excise taxation. 
Our business outlook has improved further since July, enabling us to narrow our reported diluted 2011 EPS guidance to the upper half of our previous range, namely, to $4.75 to $4.80, this despite recent unfavorable currency movements. Compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $3.87 in 2010, this corresponds to an improved growth rate of approximately 22.5% to 24% at prevailing exchange rates and approximately 17.5% to 19% excluding currency. 
And finally and perhaps most important, we have demonstrated again our focus on shareholder returns and shown our confidence in our bright future with the board's decision in September to increase our dividend by a further 20.3%. 
Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions."

So in terms, really, of what sticks with the consumer, we simply have to wait a little bit until those shipment shares will equal really consumer offtake shares again, which -- as has been the case in the past. For now, I really think that the consumer offtake shares which we measure in the C-stores give you the best indication. This is, of course, not a national average. This is a snapshot. And also, in those stores, our shares before has been slightly higher than the national average. But we continue to see, even now in the beginning also of October, the very latest numbers, and we, of course, look at them every week, that our shares continue to be slightly above 30% with Marlboro shares in there being stable.

So whilst the growth rates are the strongest in Asia, the business is doing very well also elsewhere. Now going precisely on the question on Indonesia. While we have a country which has none of the European problems that European governments are facing: Very strong macroeconomic indicators, GDP growing, inflation under control and unemployment down, growing population, of course, as well. And all that taken together leads to a cigarette market that is, year-to-date, growing a bit more than 10%. I mean, this market is marching towards a total size of, probably at one time, reaching 300 billion cigarettes. So it's a huge market, actually the second most important in terms of size of Russia. At the same time, the tax outlook is manageable. Excise taxes go up. They go up slightly above inflation. They are bringing the tax tiers, over time, together. They are willing to do away with that loophole on using new legal entities to benefit from lower-tier tax advantages. And we are having an excellent portfolio in the market, where not only Sampoerna A, which is the best, but also Dji Sam Soe is doing fine. U Mild is growing. So we are doing really well, and we have actually also good price points on our individual brands when it comes to the prices that those are being sold by retailers on a stick basis."

The only one party benefiting from that would be people that sell at the very lowest end of the markets, which is not the international companies, at about TRY 4 per pack, because at that level, their allover need is only 1/4 of what it is at the premium end. This doesn't make sense for the government either. At the same time, we, of course, can expect now a steep reaction -- at least in the first months, a very steep reaction of the tax paid markets.

However, there are a couple of positive aspects to the EU business, really, because you asked the question in a longer context, in a 2-, 3-year context.

And actually, on a year-to-date basis, half of that is just Spain. So, i.e. all the other markets together are declining not even 2%. Germany is growing. France is stable, and Italy is almost stable. So that's pretty good. What will the austerity measures do? Well, the point really is what will unemployment do. We have seen that, of course, a steep increase in dramatic levels of unemployment, like in Spain, have an impact. I do not see Spain happening everywhere in Europe. This is very overdone. I don't think that's going to happen. So then on excise tax pressure, could be. Of course, I can't exclude it. But given the financing needs of those governments, I would rather see pressure on general VAT increases. In Europe, those could happen, of course, affecting all products, including our products.

Now really, going to Japan in more detail, well, we can -- let's try to quantify a little bit what is the year-to-date benefit of us seizing this business opportunity. I think the fairest way of doing that is that you take our year-to-date shipment share. That is about 31.5%. Our going-in share prior to the events was about 25%. That's a rounded share gain of 6.5%. On a total market of $144 billion, that gives you roughly $9.5 billion in volumes. You apply the very decent margins that you estimate for the Japanese market. You deduct from that substantial air freight cost that was well above $100 million. You deduct from there other cost and investments. We are right now at a very competitive situation in the fourth quarter. And we, of course, do everything that we need to do to support our brands. You take off the tax rates, and you arrive at something in the range of $250 million net of tax or something in the range of $0.15 on an EPS basis. I have done a similar calculation at the end of the second quarter. It was about $0.10 to $0.12 then. I hope that helps."

And then I guess on the pricing side, though, because in 2011 you also saw the benefit of the price increases in Japan and the volume decline coming in better than expected. So is it fair to think about that was -- that's also a partial benefit to your 2011 earnings growth in terms of x currency basis and then the comparison in 2012 is not as positive, I guess, depending on what the tax situation unfolds in Japan."

I think it's easy to predict that the market decline will be much more moderate than what we have seen this year, because nobody expects a tax and price hike of the dimension that we have seen in October 2012. Where it stands now in terms of tax in Japan is that the DPJ tax council has come out with a proposed law of JPY 40 per pack to be discussed with opposition parties, which we're against. In recent discussions, we also have heard that eventually, excise tax could be excluded altogether from the financing of the reconstruction package. However, let's be clear here. Even an exclusion from that package does not mean an exclusion of tax measures in the ordinary budget. So we will have to see what's going to come out in terms of tax and thereafter, in terms of price, because well, the central approval by the Finance Ministry of price increases is also still in place. So a lot of question marks at this point in time. We will see the outcome, but you mentioned it. I mean, we will, of course, start the year in Japan from a much stronger base than we have been starting the year in 2011."

And then, Hermann, just following up on David's question about EU region. I guess just in terms of the persistent market share losses that you've been experiencing and obviously, more the macro challenges and the fact that you're more exposed to the premium segment than others, are you rethinking sort of your brand portfolio strategy in any meaningful way to be a little bit more aggressive in some of the value segment?

Now in the European context, we have seen a number of markets, their brands over the last years have been repositioned to the low end. We have answered that in the markets, where it was necessary, this brand out of our portfolio. I mean, Germany is a much different situation than it has been a couple of years ago. We have Marlboro there. Yes, but we also have today there an L&M, the fastest growing brand in the market. The market -- the brand with the highest young adult smoker share in the market, and we are right now complementing that with Chesterfield at the same price level in the German market. Taken all together, well, the market share in the German market actually has been growing. So our team there, and we have a very strong team in Germany, is doing an excellent job, and it begins to pay off. If you move over to France, that's a different situation there. There, actually, we have 2 growing premium brands. Both Philip Morris and Marlboro are doing extremely well in an otherwise stable market. The market where we are underrepresented at the low end, clearly, is Italy, where our share at the low price segment of the market is well below our overall total market share in the market. So it's a marketing, it's a brand challenge. It's a sales challenge, but we have the portfolio to do something there. And it's not that we wake up to it now. We do something already for the last years."

I seem to recall there could be a change there that potentially helps. And then just in Korea, obviously, good share gains there. But I just wanted to confirm that you're still pricing slightly below BAT and JT in that marketplace. I think they're pricing up earlier in the year. And then finally for me, just on cost saves. Obviously, you made the point on the presentation that you're confident of exceeding the current plans this year. I just wondered whether you can give us any kind of indications on what plans might be for next year in terms of whether more cost saving or similar levels of cost saving as you're achieving in 2011."

Yes, there is a new excise tax law there which should provide a more level playing field over time. It's not immediately. It is phased in over time and that system then would eliminate the -- I only can call it absurd difference in taxation linked to packaging, if the cigarette is in a box or in a soft pack. So yes, a level playing field is always something good for us and beneficial and fairer going forward. Moving over to Korea. As I have said before, I mean, the real challenge in Korea also is to find a multi-year tax plan and tax structure plan in that market, and that actually prevails for us over short-term profitability considerations. And the third one on cost savings. Well, we have had a one-year target, because that keeps an organization focused. You'll see that the focus has paid off. As we expect, it's too early to say for next year. But yes, there will be a target for next year as well. We will talk about that in February."

When you come to -- when we talk about overall volumes that the Russian market has slightly declined last year at about 2%, I would say. For this year, I would expect a little less than 2%. But there is, of course, the consequence also of the fairly frequent price increases that happened in the market. So in that sense, consumers have been forced to upgrade quite a bit because prices over the last 3 years have come up quite a bit at the low end. This would be a combined average growth of the prices in the range of 25%."

However, thanks to our global footprint, we have always been able to balance the unexpected bad with unexpected good. So I think that should be the case going forward as well. That's simply the advantage of such a broad global footprint as we have it."

The starting point for PMI at this point really is that we are having a blockbuster third quarter and that we are guiding to an excellent year 2011, i.e. we are and will be entering 2012 with really strong business momentum. Our confidence is expressed in the recent 20% dividend increase. Now going into 2012, on the key question there, the first one, we have built the financial crisis, triggered an economy crisis. We have had that on the call. We will see what the economies do in parts of the world. It's not going to be the same all over the world. But PMI is a company that has been able to deliver in the good and in the bad times. And we have a portfolio to do that in the good and in the bad times, because it covers all price points. The second key question always is will governments make rational excise tax decisions? We believe yes, but hiccups can happen. Turkey will always happen. But net-net, we think we expect them to be manageable. The third one is probably really market sizes overall. I don't expect big changes in the trends there. I mentioned before that the EU declines are moderating, that in the big Russian market, I see only a slight decline. In the very big Indonesian market, we see strong growth. In the big Japan market, it will depend a bit on the tax. Then the other point would be -- the fourth point probably is the pricing environment. Will the rational pricing environment continue? I believe yes, that -- and I believe that Spain was the exception to the rule. And contrary to other consumer product companies, prices in the cigarette industry, our prices usually stick, because governments around the world do not want to see cigarette prices coming down. The next point is that you have always to do your homework and keep your cost under control, which is what we are doing. I have elaborated on that. Then we are a tremendous cash flow generator. We have generated, over the first 9 months of this year, an average of $1 billion in free cash flow per month, $9 billion year-to-date. Our cash flow generation capabilities are unchanged, and also, our shareholder orientation is unchanged. So -- and the last point, I mentioned it before on the question before, our global footprint always allows you to balance the bad with the good because of a global scale. So I think these are the ingredients that make up business success. And we are working hard, and we have been working hard to get where we are. And we will keep on working hard to deliver for our shareholders also in the future."
