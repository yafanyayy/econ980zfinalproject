During the 2010 fourth quarter, Kirby Inland Marine tank barge fleet experienced high 80% utilization for the third consecutive quarter. This is higher than we expected that the first of this year and higher than all comparable 2009 levels.
During the fourth quarter, 67% of our revenue came from serving our petrochemical consumer base. Low price natural gas continued to improve the US petrochemical complex with a competitive advantage against most foreign producers. This seed stock [phonetic] advantage helped maintain US petrochemical production to high levels during the second half of 2010 and consequently the volume of the basic chemicals that we transport between domestic processing plants and terminal for exportation remain sufficient to produce high 80% utilization of a petrochemical fleet during the fourth quarter.
Our black oil fleet, which produced 18% of our fourth quarter revenue, also remained at high 80% utilization levels. Volumes were driven by shipments of refinery feed stocks and intermediates between domestic refineries and terminal reporting both normal and turnaround operations. And the continued export of heavy fuel oil.
Revenue from our long-term contracts having one year duration or longer totaled 75% of our revenue in the mix of time charter and affreightment business was 50:50. Kirby’s Inland Marine customers expressed increased optimism about their business during the second half of 2010 and this continued thus far in 2011 as we are generally performing better financially.
With respect to price, Kirby’s term contract renewals bottomed out in the third quarter of 2009, and it remained generally flat throughout 2010. During the fourth quarter we have been a successful in some cases achieving some modest price increases when contracts are renewed.
Additionally, our multiyear contracts have escalators based on labor in PPI, Producer Price Index. Some of these contracts are adjusted each January. And while these adjustments were flat in January of 2010 and January of 2011, these annual escalators provided in rate increases in the 1% to 2% range.
Stock pricing for the fourth quarter, which includes the price of fuel were slightly positive compared to the third quarter. We continue to invest in our fleet in both in terms of new constructions and upgrading existing barges and boats. This program is improved to a liability of fleet, improved customer service and as reduced the amount of shipyard cost and out of service days.
David will provide you with some detail on additions and retirement to the fleet during the year in just a moment. First, I will turn the call back to Joe to discuss the diesel engine services operations.

In addition, the segment benefited from several overhauls in the inland marine transportation market. We continue to see weak service and direct part sales across the majority of our Gulf Coast oil service market, as customers continue to defer maintenance projects. Also continued to see some pricing pressure in our Gulf Coast operations as our competitors did for reduced levels of service work and part sales.
With about 20% to 25% of the diesel engine service, historic revenues coming from the Gulf Coast oil service industry, the moratorium on deep water drilling, new safety regulations, which are beginning to rollout, which will effect drilling operations and the delays that are continuing to occur, issuing offshore drilling permits. All of this affects this market.
Now, we do anticipate this market to slowly improve during 2010 as the industry kind of understands what they are facing with respect to new regulations and the administration begins to issue more drilling permits.
I will comeback the end of the prepared remarks and talk about the outlook for both the quarter of the year that now I want to turn the call over David to talk about the financial side of the business.

The segment’s operating",1008,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone. Let me provide a few details on our financial results and capital spending plans. Kirby’s marine transportation revenue was 7% above the operating income 3% below the 2009 fourth quarter. The segment’s operating margin was 21.2% compared to 23.6% in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the 2010 year the segment operating margin was 21.1% compared 23.6% in 2009. The lower margins reflected the continued impact of lower term and spot contract pricing that rolled through in 2009 and first part of 2010. The lower margins are also reflect a 16% increase in fuel prices for the fourth quarter and 29% increase for the year. This was partially offset by the benefit of our cost reduction and efficiency initiatives that we implemented in 2009 and part of 2010. As Greg mentioned, for the second half of 2010 term contracts stabilized and spot prices were up slightly.
Being able to maintain the 20% plus operating margin in our marine transportation structure in this economic environment and through what we hope is the bottom of the cycle, reflects our success in reducing cost. Now, we have been able to maintain our focus on the customers in our operating safety and efficiency while achieving this cost reduction.
In the Diesel Engine Services business revenue was 26% above than the operating income 81% above last year’s fourth quarter. The 2009 fourth quarter operating income included $916,000 charge for staff reductions and a $471,000 increase per doubtful accounts.
The operating margin was 12.8% this quarter compared with 8.9% reported in 2009. The results reflect a continued strong power generation market through engine set upgrade projects and improved parts and engine sales along with some strong maintenance programs for some of our inland marine customers. As Joe mentioned, these positive markets were offset by the continued weak Gulf Coast oil services market as customers to continue did the further maintenance project. The 12.8% operating margin for the fourth quarter and a 10.6% margin for the year reflected the cost initiatives that we have taken and the stronger the power generation services market as well as the in the marine market.
Maintaining an operating margin above 10% in the service business where 20% to 25% of our historical revenue is tied to the Gulf Coast oil service market reflects the emphasis we have placed on reducing cost and focusing on stronger areas of the diesel engine services business.
On the corporate side of things we continue to generate significant cash during the 2010 fourth quarter and for the year with EBITDA at $79 million for the quarter and $295 million for the year. At December 31, we had a $196 million of cash or cash equivalents and currently we have $209 million in cash. Our capital spending for 2010 totaled a $137 million, which included $74 million for new tank barges and tow boats, and $63 million primarily for capital upgrade to the existing fleet.
During 2010, taking advantage of better ship yard prices, we took delivery at 53 new 10,000 barrel tank barges, four new 30,000 barrels barges and five 10,000 barrel charted barges and one 30,000 barrels charger barge adding approximately 800,000 barrels of capacity. However, during 2010, we were retired 89 tank barges and returned 12 charted tank barges, there by reducing our overall capacity by approximately 1.6 million barrels. So net net capacity for the year declined 800,000 barrels. This declined is partly due to timing of deliveries of capacity and the capacity will come back up some in 2011, I will comment about that in more detail in a minute.
As of December 31, we operated 825 tank projects with a capacity of 15.9 million barrels compared with our tank barge count of 918 with a capacity of 17.5 million barrels in June of 2008. A benefit of our recent capital spending is reduced is average fleet age as Greg mentioned earlier, at December 31, 2007, the average age of our tank flee was 24 years. Today the average age is 20.3 years, a significant decrease. This improvement in the average age of our tank barge fleet means the significant amount spent annually on maintaining all the barges will be reduced will be reduced.
Moving to 2011 capital spending plans, we plan on building 40 new tank projects with a capacities of about 1.1 million barrels. We also plan on continuing to retire older barges. Net net we currently plan on adding approximately 300,000 barrels to over all capacity through 2011
That would bring our total capacity back is 16.2 million barrels by the end of 2011. In addition to tank barges we plan on building 3 1,800 horse power tow boats for delivery in 2011 and 2012.
Our capital spending guidance for 2011 is currently in the range of $170 million to $180 million. That includes $100 million for the construction of 40 tank barges and the three tow boats I just mentioned. All of that is based on current steel prices and projected delivery schedules.
From June through the end of October we repurchased 618,000 shares of Kirby stock at a average price of $38.48. The shares were purchased to a combination of open market purchases and through a stock trading plan entered into with a brokerage firm pursuant to rule 10b51. The 10b51program was applicable for second and third quarter and our year end Kirby imposed black out period, during our press release period, and effective January 31 at the end of fourth quarter black out period we will have approximately 1.7 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.
Finally, in November of last year, November 2010, we extended our $250 million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks by entering into a amended agreement. The amendment extends maturity of the from June 2011 to November of 2015. The facility provides for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR and currently the company has no outstanding borrowings under the facility. 
Now, Joe, I will turn back to you.

This comprises with $0.46 per share recorded in 2010 first quarter which includes $0.05 per share for early retirements as well as some staff reductions. For the quarter, we were forecasting that our overall equipment utilization levels will be consistent with the fourth quarter in the mid to high 80% range and the pricing would also stay in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that US petrochemical production both domestic use and exports will continue to remain strong based on continued low US natural gases prices. In addition, our guidance assumes the Gulf Coast the refinery utilization will be about where it is today. That being said, the difference between the low end for the first quarter guidance $0.57 per share and high end of $0.62 per share is equipment utilization levels and delay caused by the severity of weather conditions experienced in the quarter.
Weather is always an issue during the quarter, during January we saw ice affecting navigation on both the Illinois River as well as the upper reaches of the Ohio River. Both of these rivers remain open but ice has impacted transit times. Along the lower river system and on the canal, we can expect fog and winds to reduce our efficiency. It’s too early to predict the severity of these weather conditions for the quarter but we think we have captured them in the forecasted range we have given.
Both our low end and high end first quarter guidance assumes diesel engine service operation will continue to see a favorable power generation business as well as favorable marine markets in the Mid West area, but will continue to face some challenges on the Gulf Coast.
For our year guidance this year ranges $2.35 to $2.55 per share, that’s 9% to 19% above the $2.15 reported in 2010 depending where you were on the range. The projected improvement both low and high end is based on continued strength of petrochemical industry and continued favorable equipment utilization rates. At the low end of the range guidance assumes equipment utilization will track the fourth quarter’s utilization levels throughout the year and term end contracts pricing will improve somewhat a beginning in the second half o 2011.
The high end of the range guidance assumes some continued modest improvement in equipment utilization as year progresses some industry wide tank barge capacity level reduction and modest improvements term and spot contract closing through out the year.
In the diesel engine segment we look for a continued favorable power generation market and a slightly marine transportation market, and a slow recovery in the Gulf Coast oil service business as 2011 progresses but anticipate that won’t happen until the lateral part of 2011.
As I stated in third quarter of conference call, Kirby and our industry challenge is now to move pricing. Based on the current strength of the petrochemical industry and higher industry wide utilization levels, the environment for higher industry wide pricing is better. We saw some selected modest price increases on several contrast renewed during the quarter.
Low natural gas prices which is used as the key feedstock for the United States petrochemical industry is indeed a game changer. The United States Petrochemical industry is globally competitive and this global competitiveness appears sustainable. Sustainable natural gas prices at current or slightly above the levels that we’re seeing will ultimately provide the confidence that will lead some capacity expansion which will in turn to drive higher petrochemical volumes. Long term this is very positive for our business.
As David noted, Kirby is in great financial shape. We have consistent strong free cash flow, a great balance sheet, little debt, favorable interest rates and currently $109 million sitting on our balance sheet.
We are in a great position to acquire companies in both our marine transportation and additional engine service segments, build new equipment and continue to opportunistically purchase our stock when that’s appropriate.
I want to come back and correct the guidance, the guidance that I gave you on the first quarter ranges $0.56 to $0.61 cents, not $0.57 to $0.62 cents but the annual guidance is the same.
Operator, we’re now ready to open a call up for questions.

Yesterday evening we announced several important management changes at Kirby, which we believe will enhance our ability to manage our growing business.  Greg Binion, who will be on this call, was elected President and Chief Operating Officer of Kirby, having served as President of Kirby Inland Marine, our principal marine transportation subsidiary since 2008.  Kirby has grown significantly this year through acquisitions, and I know that through Greg’s leadership, these newly acquired companies will be effectively and efficiently integrated into Kirby. 
Bill Ivey replaces Greg as President of Kirby Inland Marine. Bill has served as the Executive Vice-President of Marketing for Kirby Inland Marine since 1999. Yesterday we also reported net earnings for Q1 2011 of $0.60 per share, compared to Q1 2010 net earnings of $0.46 per share. The 2010 Q1 included a $0.05 per share charge for early retirements and short staff reductions. 
2011 has been an active year for Kirby on the acquisition front, and I want to briefly bring you up to date on where we are with respect to these acquisitions. The purchase in February of a 51% interest from Kinder Morgan of a barge shipping and fleeting operation in the Houston ship channel has now been fully integrated into our canal operations, is performing well and was slightly accretive to our Q1 earnings. 
In February, our purchase of a ship bunkering operation from Enterprise Marine Services with operations principally in Florida but also in Mobile and Houston, had been fully integrated into our black oil and bunkering segment, and also is performing well and accretive to our Q1 earnings. We completed the acquisition of United Holdings, a land based diesel engine and service provider, and well service equipment manufacturer on April 15 this year, and have begun the process of integrating this operation into Kirby as well. 
United will be accretive to our Q2 and year earnings.  Finally, the acquisition of K-Sea transportation is proceeding about as planned. We’ve received early termination of our Hart-Scott-Rodino filing; the financing of the acquisition will be in place by closing.  Financing will be a five year, $540 million senior unsecured term loan with a syndicate of banks.  The form S-4 registration statement will be filed with the Security and Exchange Commission in the near future.  After the SEC approves the S-4, proxy statements prospective and prospectus will be mailed to the K-Sea unit holders for voting on the merger of K-Sea into Kirby.  We anticipate that this acquisition or transaction will close sometime in Q3. 
I’m now going to turn the call over to Greg to recap our marine transportation operation for Q1.

During the 2011 Q1, Kirby petro-chemical and black oil fleets achieved utilization rates in the low 90% range. These are the highest utilization rates since Q3 2008. Utilization was driven both by difficult operating conditions and also by improved customer demand. During the quarter, about 65% of our marine transportation revenue was produced serving our petro-chemical customer base. 
Low price natural gas continues to provide domestic petro-chemical production with a competitive advantage to global markets.  This feed stock advantage has resulted in improved volumes of domestically produced petro-chemicals and increased consumption of feed stocks. Our black oil fleet, which produces 20% of revenue experienced improved demand at the margin by refinery maintenance activities and the continued exportation of heavy fuel oil.
Our Q1 revenues from our long term contracts, that is over one year in duration total 75%, and our mix of time charter and our freightment business was at 50% per each. With respect to pricing during Q1, we were successful in securing modest price increases when term contracts were renewed. Additionally, our multi year contracts have annual escalations based on labor and the producer price index. Some of these adjust each January, and this year’s adjustment provided a rate increase in the 1 to 2% range. 
Spot pricing for Q1 was higher, due to the 15.7% increase in fuel prices quarter over quarter, and also improved for market conditions. When you compare our current spot pricing against contract rates, spot pricing is currently in the mid to high single digits above contract. We continue to invest in our fleet, both in terms of new construction and upgrading our existing barges.  The program continues to improve the reliability of the fleet, improves customer service, and reduces the amount of shipyard cost and out of service days. David will provide you will some additional detail on fleet additions and retirements in a moment, after Joe’s comments on the diesel engine services segment. I will now turn the call back over to Joe.

The United transaction, of course, closed at the beginning of Q2. During Q1, the segment benefitted from continued strong prior generation markets with several engine generator upgrade projects and also strong parts and engine sales in this part of the business. Additionally, the segment benefitted from high levels of maintenance in the mid west, which typically occur during Q1, and better business levels on the West Coast.
We continue to see weak service and sales across the majority of our Gulf Coast oil service market, as our customers continue maintenance projects, we do expect that this part of the business, the Gulf Coast Oil Service part, to improve later in the year.  The Gulf Cost high speed business also remains very competitive due to the reduced levels of service work and parts sales.  We anticipate, as I said, this market to do better at the latter half of the year. 
I’m going to come back later and talk about the outlook for Q2 as well as the full year outlook, and I’ll also comment on United’s anticipated performance and contribution to Kirby’s earnings for the full year, but right now I’m going to turn the call over to David.

Kirby’s Inland Marine, or Kirby’s marine transportation revenue was 10% above and operating income 24% above the 2010 Q1. The segment’s operating margin was 21.8% compared with 19.3% for Q1 2010. If you correct Q1 2010, or you back out the retirement and staff reduction charge taken, the margin was 20.5%. 
The higher margin reflected the improved petro-chemical and black oil products demand and equipment utilization, as well as modestly higher term and spot contract pricing during Q1, and our ongoing cost reduction and efficiency initiatives.  These positive factors were partially offset by the 24% increase in diesel fuel prices, seen year over year, and the impact of increased delay days from difficult weather and high water issues. 
Diesel engine services revenue was 18% and operating income 31% above last year’s Q1. The operating margin was 11.5% compared with 10.4% reported in 2010 Q1. The margins were better primarily due to project timing, and you should continue to expect full year margins ex-United, in the engine business to be in the 10% range. 
We expect margins in both of our segments to come down slightly and modestly in the next few quarters as we bring in the acquisitions of K-Sea and United. We continue to generate significant cash during the 2011 Q1, with EBITDA of $80.4 million.  At March 31, we had $172 million of cash and cash equivalents, and this was after paying $58.5 million for two of the acquisitions made in February. Our capital spending for 2011 Q1 totaled $31.1 million, which included $12.7 million for new tank barges and towboats, and $18.4 million for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
During the Q1 2011, we took delivery of five new 30,000 barrel tank barges, and three 10,000 barrel charter barges, adding approximately 175,000 barrels capacity.  However, during Q1, we moved 23 barges to inactive status and returned one charter tank barge, thereby reducing our overall active capacity by approximately 400,000 barrels. We did add 21 tank barges with the purchase of the ship bunkering operation of Enterprise in February, which added approximately 400,000 barrels of capacity, so net/net, our active tank barge fleet increased approximately 175,000 barrels during Q1 2011.
As of March 31, we operated 829 tank barges with a total capacity of 16.1 million barrels. For the remainder of 2011, we plan on taking delivery of 35 new tank barges with a capacity of approximately 950,000 barrels.  We also plan to continue retiring older barges.  Net/net, by the end of 2011, we plan on bringing our total capacity to approximately 16.5 million barrels. 
In addition to tank barges, we are building three 1800 horsepower tow boats for delivery in 2011 and 2012.  We have also signed a contract for the construction of an offshore, integrated dry bulk barge and tugboat unit for use under long term contract with a Florida utility, and a cement manufacturer moving coal from the Mississippi River to Tampa, Florida, and a backhaul of limestone rock to Mobile, Alabama. The cost of this new unit is approximately $50 million and is scheduled to be completed in the 2012 Q2. We anticipate signing a contract in the near future for another offshore unit for approximately the same price. 
These new units are replacing existing older units.  Our capital spending guidance for 2011 is currently $220 million to $230 million, including $100 million for the construction of the 40 tank barges and three inland tow boats, and approximately $36 million in progress payment on the construction of the integrated offshore dry bulk and tow unit.  The construction prices are based on current fuel prices and projected delivery schedules.  If we sign the contract for the second offshore unit, we anticipate spending an additional $15 million on progress payments this year.  I’ll now turn the call back to Joe.

This compares with $0.54 per share reported in the 2010 Q2. This guidance range is larger than we typically give.  The reason for this is we know that our results will be negatively impacted by the current high water and lock issues on the Mississippi River system due to heavy rain in the Midwest. Our guidance is based on what we know today.  The Ohio River north of Paducah, Kentucky is closed due to high water and a lock closure, and could remain closed for up to ten days. 
There is also high water and flooding on the upper Mississippi River above St. Louis.  We know that this high water level on the Ohio River and the upper Mississippi River will make its way into the lower Mississippi River, further exacerbating the situation.  We already have daylight only travel restrictions and assist requirements on sections of the lower Mississippi River, and we expect these regulations to increase as conditions worsen. 
It could very well be the latter part of Q2 before we see conditions return to normal.  Again, based on what we know today, we are currently estimating that the high water conditions could impact our Q2 results by as much as $0.02 to $0.07 per share, depending on the severity and the length of the high water event. For Q2, we are forecasting that our utilization of our petro-chemical and black oil fleets will range in the low to mid 90% level, and pricing will continue to modestly improve. Our guidance assumes that the US petro-chemical production for both domestic use and export will remain strong based on continued low US natural gas prices. 
In addition, our guidance assumes that the Gulf Cost Refinery utilization will remain stable and will continue to export diesel oil and heavy fuel oil. Both our low end and high end quarter guidance assumes our historical diesel engine service operation will continue to see favorable current generation markets, stable marine markets, but will still face some stress and challenge in the Gulf Coast Oil Service market. We expect United Holdings to be busy and to make a contribution to our 2011 earnings.  The demand for hydraulic fraking equipment remains very strong. 
Our 2011 year guidance was raised and narrowed to $2.70 to $2.90 from our previous guidance of $2.55 to $2.80 per share, an improvement when compared to the $2.15 reported for the 2010 year. Our high end guidance assumes continued strong petro-chemical and black oil demand with equipment utilizations remaining about where they are today, in a low to mid 90% range, and with a continued modest improvement in term and spot contract pricing. 
Our low end guidance assumes some deterioration in demand, utilization backing up to the mid to high 80% level, and spot and term pricing not improving until the latter part of the year. Both our low end and high end guidance factors in an estimated impact of high water lock issues on our Inland Tank Storage business.  Our low and high end range assumes our diesel engine service segment will continue to face the challenges in the Gulf Coast Oil Services market and as I indicated earlier, some gradual improvement toward the end of the year, and assumes stable marine and power generation margins. In addition, both our low and high end guidance assumes accretive earnings from United Holdings in the 20% to 25% range for the year.  It also assumes the K-Sea acquisition will close sometime in Q3, and K-Sea’s earnings contribution will be offset by one time merger transaction fees of approximately $0.05 per share.

Two to four, four to six, six to eight, and at the end it was 8% to 10%.  I actually think that that’s going to be compressed this time around, and I would expect if these utilization rates hold, it’ll be a little quicker recovering some of that lost pricing in this cycle.  Part of that is that the cycle was, frankly, a lot shorter than the last one, and the duration of it was I think a surprise to everybody.  I think most people expected kind of a U-shaped recovery, and what we got was a pretty sharp V-shaped recovery.

But you know, K-Sea is in a challenging market, we think that that market is going to improve over time, partly driven by capacity leaving and partly driven just by some changes in the refined products distribution on the East Coast.  So it has to do with opening multiple refineries, some of it has to do with pipeline capacity expansion; but other than that, I just don’t want to be more specific.  Once we own them, we’ll be more specific with where we think that markets going.

As for river conditions driving pricing, certainly when you get utilization rates where they are today, pricing is going to increase.  At first modestly, then if they stay at these levels, more significantly, because there are going to be requirements that are uncovered.  But the operating conditions that we’re seeing today are going to be normalized by the summer, so we’ll just have to see where industry utilization shuttles out. Intuitively, we think it’s going to be less than current levels because we’ve really been experiencing from the beginning of the year, operating conditions that made the system less efficient and drove utilization up.

Typically, again, we’ve talked about this; at the bottom of the market nobody wants to sell.  They don’t want to sell because they can’t get adequate pricing for their business.

Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Late yesterday we announced record setting net earnings for the 2011 fourth quarter of $0.94 per share, which reflects a 65% improvement over the $0.57 per share reported for the 2010 third quarter.
This quarter, we also closed the acquisition of K-Sea Transportation on July 1st. K-Sea is a coastwise and local tank barge operator with a diverse geographic footprint, operating on the east, west and Gulf Coast as well as the Great Lakes and in Alaska and Hawaii and owns one of the younger fleets in the U.S. coastwise tank barge business.
The K-Sea fleet consists of 57 tank barges, 54 which are double hull with an average age of about nine years and 63 tugboats. K-Sea's total tank barge capacity is 3.8 million barrels.
Our record third quarter results reflects a strong inland tank barge transportation market. Accretive operating earnings from K-Sea a robust land-based diesel engine service business and an improved marine and stable power generation service business.
Original earnings guidance range for the third quarter was $0.82 to $0.87 per share. On September 19th, we announced that we expected our third quarter results to exceed $0.90 per share. Yesterday, we announced $0.94 per share. Stronger than expected petrochemical volumes stable, domestic refinery production held by some export volumes, favorable weather, higher term and contract rates all impacted our results for the third quarter.
Development of U.S. shale formations for oil and gas, not only drove our land-based diesel engine service business, but also a low price natural gas is driving U.S. petrochemical volumes and the liquids coming out of these formations are providing black oil volumes to move, all very positive.
As we expected, and as we've commented on before K-Sea's accretive operating results were generally offset by investment banking and legal fees, higher interest expense and the dilutive effect of the issuance of 1.9 million shares that Kirby stock associated with this acquisition.
For the third quarter K-Sea's equipment utilization rate was in the mid to high 70% range. The Atlantic Pacific and Hawaii fleets experienced good equipment utilization rates. The New York harbor-based fleet reflected lower utilization rates due to some overcapacity principally on the bunker market. With respect to pricing, contracts in this market renewed basically as expiring, but spot contract rates improved in the low to single-digit percentage range.
During the 2011, third quarter approximately 60% of K-Sea's coastwise and local revenue was under contract and 40% was in the stock market. A time charter is represented about 90% of the revenues under term contracts in the third quarter.
With respect to K-Sea, we are working with Tim Casey and his management team integrating K-Sea were appropriate into Kirby. We expect this integration process will be completed early next year. K-Sea's market is certainly more difficult that are in the transportation business. We're pleased with our their progress and believe that this business should continue to improve over the next couple of years as single hull vessels leave the market and volumes improve.
I'll come back at the end of end of our prepared remarks and talk and about our fourth quarter forecast as well as the full year outlook. Now we're going to turn the call over to Greg for a recap of our - and the marine transportation business and diesel engine services business also.

The domestic petrochemical industry continues benefit from low price of natural gas providing it with the competitive advantage to global markets.
This feedstock advantage continued to provide us with improved volumes at domestically produce petrochemicals for a domestic consumption and also for exportation. Kirby's black oil fleet continues to see strong demand driven by stable refinery output and the exportation of heavy fuel oil.
In addition, we are benefiting from some new incremental demand driven by the movements of crude oil produced from South Texas, Eagle Ford shale formations from the Corpus Christi area, the Houston, and the South Louisiana refineries. And also, Canadian crude oil movements from St. Louis area to refineries in lower Mississippi River as well.
We expect the movements by crude by barge will continue as shale formations are further developed. The agricultural chemical market was also very strong during the latter half of the third quarter with the traditional Midwest fall filled. During 2011, third quarter Kirby and marine's petrochemical and black oil fleets achieved utilizations in the low to mid 90% range.
In our inland markets revenues from long-term contracts that is, one-year or longer in duration remained at 75% and the mix of time charter and freightment business continued at approximately 54% and 46% respectively. 
Moving to inland marine transportation pricing, contracts that were renewed during the third quarter achieved price increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range when compared with the 2010 third quarter. This compares with the low to mid single digit range achieved in the 2011, first and second quarters compared to the - for contracts renewed during the period of the 2010 corresponding quarters.
During the third quarter, spot pricing which includes the price of fuel increased in the high single to low double-digit ranges compared with 2011 second quarter. We continue to invest in our inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading our existing barges. This program continues to improve the flexibility of the fleet, improves customer service and reduces shipyard days and out of service days.
During the 2011 first nine months we took delivery of 32 new 30,000 barrel tank barges and 5,000 to 10,000 barrel charter barges, adding about 955,000 barrels of capacity. Offsetting this during the first nine months we retired 51 tank barges in return four charter tank barges, thereby reducing our overall active fleet by about 980,000 barrels.
We added 20 tank barges with the purchase of ship bunkering operating of the enterprise in February, adding approximately 400,000 barrels of capacity. So in net-net, our active tank barge fleet increased by approximately 375,000 barrels during 2011 first nine months. As of September 30, we operated 827 tank barges with the capacity of 16.3 million barrels.
For the 2011 fourth quarter, we are planning on taking delivery of eight new tank barges with the capacity of about 200,000 barrels. We also plan on continuing to retire older barges. So net-net at the end of 2011, our total inland tank barge capacity should remain at 16.3 million barrels.
In addition to inland tank barges, we are building six 2,000 horsepower inland towboats with two scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2011 and four scheduled for 2012 delivery.
We are also building two offshore articulated dry bulk tug barge units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million and their scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2012. We'll make progress payments on these two units totaling about $35 million during 2011 with the balance in 2012.
In addition to two offshore units I just noted, Kirby's 2012 new constructions will consist of 52 inland tank barges with the total capacity of about 930,000 barrels. The cost is about $95 million, the majority of which will be expended in 2012.
For 2011, we anticipated that industry-wide, about 150 tank barges will be delivered into service, 40 of which are for Kirby and we've been estimating that about 150 older tank barges would be retired from service.
Due to the improved demand for inland petrochemicals and black oil barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment, during 2011, we estimated approximately 200 tank barges are currently on order industry-wide for delivery throughout 2012. In offset, and it will be offset to some degree depending on market conditions by retirements.
Short to medium term, we do not see this is a problem for Kirby as current 2011 and projected 2012 petrochemical and refinery production level increase crude oil movements in the current tank barge utilization level support these new additions.
Turning to the diesel engine services segment, our April 15, acquisition of United continued to have a significant impact before the third quarter revenues and operating results. United contributed approximately 75% of the diesel engine services segment revenue during the third quarter achieving an operating margin in the high single-digits.
United's revenue and operating margins continued to be better than we originally expected. United's manufacturing of hydraulic fracturing equipment and sale and service of transmissions and diesel engines were above our expectations as exploration and development of the United States shale formations continues at a rapid pace.
Our Legacy diesel engine services segment also benefited from continued strong power generation market with engine generator set upgrade projects and strong parts and engine sales.
Our service to the inland marine operators improved during the third quarter, a reflection of the improved inland liquid marine transportation market and maintenance on river vessels prior to the Midwest fall harvest.
I'll now turn the call over to David.

Good morning, everyone. Let me provide a few financial details. Kirby's marine transportation revenues were 51% above and operating income 52% above the 2010 third quarter.
The marine segments operating margin was 22.2% compared with 22.1% for the third quarter of 2010. The significant increase in both revenues and operating income included continued strong performance from our inland marine transportation sector with high equipment utilization levels and favorable pricing as Greg mentioned.
Our legacy marine transportation sector achieved an operating margin in the mid 20% range during the third quarter. The segment revenue increase included K-Sea, which contributed approximately 20% of the third quarter's marine transportation revenues. As expected, K-Sea was accretive to our third quarter operating income. For the third quarter, K-Sea's operating margin was in the low double digit range.
Our diesel engine services revenues increased 338% and operating income 371% above last year's third quarter with the increase predominantly due to the acquisition of the United on April 15.
The segment's operating margin was 10% compared with 9.3% reported for the 2010 third quarter. As Greg reported, United's revenues and operating results were better than we expected both from the service and manufacturing sectors and the operating margin in the high single digit range was higher than historical United operating margin, as the higher volume leverage flowed through to the bottom line.
Kirby's legacy third quarter diesel engine services operating margins was strong due to timing of several power generation projects and the improved inland marine market, which helped the segment's overall margins.
We continue to generate significant cash during the first nine months of the year, with EBITDA of $308 million. Our capital spending for the first nine months was $163.2 million and consisted of $110.1 million for new tank barges and towboats as well as progress payments on the two new offshore bulk dry barges that Greg mentioned. And then, another $53 million for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. Capital expenditure for K-Sea's and United during the third quarter were minimal.
Our capital spending guidance for 2011 remains in the range of $225 million to $235 million, which includes approximately $120 million for construction of new equipment. As you know, we financed the K-Sea's acquisition with a new $540 million unsecured term loan and approximately 1.9 million shares of Kirby common stock.
The term loan was founded as July 1st the closing date of the K-Sea acquisition. As of September 30th, the term loan balance was $513 million. Also as of September 30th, we had $83 million outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility. This morning, our revolvers outstanding balance was $33 million, since the acquisition of K-Sea, our peak debt hit $860 million, but as of yesterday it was $747 million, a reduction from the peak of $113 million.
Based on our current cash flow productions with no further acquisitions and tank barges in towboat construction at levels equal to scheduled retirements, we would anticipate being debt free some time during the year of 2014. Let me be clear we do not anticipate this happening, as historically Kirby has done the major consolidator in the inland tank barges sector. And now being the largest operator in the 180,000 barrel coastwise trade, we believe we will be able to entertain consolidation opportunities in that area as well.
As of September 30th, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 36% compared with 20.5% at June 30th. This reflects the new term on associated with K-Sea acquisition, less some debt repayments during the quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Joe.

Thank you, David, I want to give you some insight with respect to the fourth quarter. Yesterday afternoon we announced our 2011 fourth quarter guidance range of $0.97 per share to $1.02 per share.

Yesterday afternoon we announced our 2011 fourth quarter guidance range of $0.97 per share to $1.02 per share. This compare to $0.59 per share reported for 2010 fourth quarter.
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that the U.S. petrochemical production for both domestic use and export will remain relatively strong based on continued low U.S. natural gas prices and we will continue to export some diesel fuels as well as heavy oil.
We are forecasting for the fourth quarter in the marine transportation utilization levels to be in the low 90% range. This is one or two percentage point off of the full utilization levels or practical of full utilization about 95%.
The third quarter was a very frothy driven by low inventory levels which were the result of infrastructure issues caused by the flood in the second quarter. The market is returning to more normal levels. Still high utilization and with rate momentum but not quite a frothy environment we saw at the beginning of the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we do anticipate higher results from our four offshore drive boat units as all four of those units are fully employed for the quarter. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes positive operating results from K-Sea. However, anticipated winter weather conditions the seasonality in there Alaska and Great Lakes business and interest expense coupled with the impact on EPS on issuing the 1.9 million shares associated with this acquisition will offset most of K-Sea's contribution operating income for the quarter.
For diesel engine, the service sector, our guidance assumes continued strong land-based manufacturing and service levels from United, generally inline with how United perform during the third quarter.
We anticipate our Legacy diesel engine market will be inline with the third quarter and our power generation market will have a fewer engine generator upgrade projects and some lower parts in engine sales. We also anticipate our Gulf Coast oil service market to reflect continued modest improvement during the fourth quarter.
Our 2011 guidance range was raised and tightened to a new level of $3.30 per share to $3.35 per share. Our previous guidance levels had been $3 to $3.10 per share and of course much improved from the $2.15 reported last year. Our previous record year and this is a historical record for Kirby was in 2008 when we reported $2.91 per share. Now, obviously we are very pleased with our operating results thus far this year.
The acquisitions we have made positions Kirby in markets which we believe will perform well and have growth opportunity. We are rapidly paying down our debt as David mentioned $113 million already from peak debt levels, at least as of yesterday.
Our two businesses, which are in more challenging markets are K-Sea and our Legacy diesel engine business will continue to improve as capacity tightens and volumes expand for K-Sea and drilling activity increases in the Gulf of Mexico for our Legacy diesel engine business.

Four or five years ago you would count number of barges. Actually moving crude oil, one or two hands. Today there are close to we think about 140, 150 barges that are inlet barges that are directly involved in moving crude oil and some offshore equipment also moving crude oil. The movements are mostly down river, moments of Canadian crude oil to Baton Rouge marines refineries and then Eagle Ford liquids move to the Houston, Port Arthur and New Orleans markets.
We think, if that's going to continue to grow that production levels are estimated to be four to five times what they are currently. And that's both in Eagle Ford and Balkan. We also think that Canadian crude movements are going to grow. Some of the Eagle Ford movements will be ultimately kind of medium term moved by pipeline. But we think that the way these volumes are growing and where the pipelines are placed. There is still going to be some significant amount that will be moved by water and don't really, we frankly these - the number of barges involved we think you know, going forward you'll have at least that many in the short-term even more in the long-term, you know it, there is enough flexibility of barging gives and enough limitation in the pipeline to keep that demand pretty strong.
As it - will replace in terms of volume refined products been moved? Well for Kirby we've already moved more black oil. But specifically, to crude oil it's possible, I think it's possible that you'll see the movement of crude oil equal to maybe the number of barrels that are currently moved for refined products.

So, that's what driven the out performance versus expectations.
In terms of revenue growth, it is in the oil service patch right. They do tend to have boom-bust cycles and you do see that in equipment and we do expect at some point that this will turn down and that's why we are really trying to focus on the service side business to grow that up before the eventual downturn comes. But that said, it feels to us that this frac opportunity in the natural gas and cheap liquids are on the path to energy independence for the U.S. and given that we think this trend is going to stay here for a while. Now how does that translate into revenue growth going forward? It's really hard for us to put a number on it right now. I would say for just in the near term 2012 looks on part to 2011 on a full year basis and maybe up some, we are still tanking orders now for 2012 and it's still fairly strong.

We would rather do that then take a short term opportunity that we don’t think is sustainable now.
Having said that, I do think that the volume that we are seeing today particularly coming out of the Eagle Ford and Canadian crude that is being exported into the (Bad Ridge) area, that volume is sustainable. The issue is how much more volume is going to be sustainable over the long run as the gathering systems are put in. With respect to the (Bad Ridge) movement there isn’t really a lot of talk about a pipeline there, but the Eagle Ford gathering systems that - we are going to go in that’s going to take some of that volume.

Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Late yesterday, we announced record-setting net earnings for the 2011 third quarter of $0.94 per share, which reflects a 65% improvement over the $0.57 per share reported for the 2010 third quarter.
This quarter, we also closed the acquisition of K-Sea Transportation on July 1st. K-Sea is a coastwise and local tank barge operator with a diverse geographic footprint, operating on the East, West and Gulf Coast, as well as the Great Lakes and in Alaska and Hawaii and owns one of the younger fleets in the U.S. coastwise tank barge business.
The K-Sea fleet consists of 57 tank barges, 54 which are double hull with an average age of about 9 years and 63 tugboats. K-Sea's total tank barge capacity is 3.8 million barrels.
Our record third quarter results reflect a strong inland tank barge transportation market. Accretive operating earnings from K-Sea a robust land-based diesel engine service business and an improved marine and stable power generation service business.
Original earnings guidance range for the third quarter was $0.82 to $0.87 per share. On September 19, we announced that we expected our third quarter results to exceed $0.90 per share. Yesterday, we announced $0.94 per share. Stronger than expected petrochemical volumes, stable domestic refinery production held by some export volumes, favorable weather, higher term and contract rates all impacted our results for the third quarter.
Development of U.S. shale formations for oil and gas not only drove our land-based diesel engine service business, but also a low price natural gas is driving U.S. petrochemical volumes and the liquids coming out of these formations are providing black oil volumes to move, all very positive.
As we expected, and as we've commented on before, K-Sea's accretive operating results were generally offset by investment banking and legal fees, higher interest expense and the dilutive effect of the issuance of 1.9 million shares of Kirby stock associated with this acquisition.
For the third quarter K-Sea's equipment utilization rate was in the mid to high-70% range. The Atlantic Pacific and Hawaii fleets experienced good equipment utilization rates. The New York harbor-based fleet reflected lower utilization rates due to some overcapacity principally on the bunker market. With respect to pricing, contracts in this market renewed basically as expiring, but spot contract rates improved in the low to single-digit percentage range.
During the 2011 third quarter, approximately 60% of K-Sea's coastwise and local revenue was under contract and 40% was in the stock market. A time charter is represented about 90% of the revenues under term contracts in the third quarter.
With respect to K-Sea, we're working with Tim Casey and his management team integrating K-Sea where appropriate into Kirby. We expect this integration process will be completed early next year. K-Sea's market is certainly more difficult than our inland transportation business. We're pleased with their progress and believe that this business should continue to improve over the next couple of years as single hull vessels leave the market and volumes improve.
I'll come back at the end of end of our prepared remarks and talk about our fourth quarter forecast as well as the full year outlook. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Greg for a recap of our inland marine transportation business and diesel engine service business also."

The domestic petrochemical industry continues the benefit from low price natural gas, providing it with the competitive advantage to global markets.This feedstock advantage continued to provide us with improved v",946,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning to all. The domestic petrochemical industry continues the benefit from low price natural gas, providing it with the competitive advantage to global markets.
This feedstock advantage continued to provide us with improved volumes at domestically produced petrochemicals for domestic consumption and also for exportation. Kirby's black oil fleet continues to see strong demand, driven by stable refinery output and the expansion of -- excuse me, I mean exportation of heavy fuel oil.
In addition, we're benefiting from some new incremental demand driven by the movements of crude oil produced from South Texas, Eagle Ford shale formations from the Corpus Christi area, the Houston, and the South Louisiana refineries. And also, Canadian crude oil movements from the St. Louis area to refineries in the lower Mississippi River as well. We expect the movements by -- of crude by barge will continue as shale formations are further developed. 
The agricultural chemical market was also very strong during the latter half of the third quarter with the traditional Midwest fall fill. During 2011, third quarter Kirby inland marine's petrochemical and black oil fleets achieved utilizations in the low to mid-90% range.
In our inland markets revenues from long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remained at 75%. And the mix of time charter and the freightment business continued at approximately 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moving to inland marine transportation pricing, contracts that were renewed during the third quarter achieved price increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range when compared with the 2010 third quarter. This compares with the low to mid-single digit range achieved in the 2011, first and second quarters compared to the -- for contracts renewed during the period of the 2010 corresponding quarters.
During the third quarter, spot pricing which includes the price of fuel, increased in the high single to low double-digit range compared with the 2011 second quarter. We continue to invest in our inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading our existing barges. This program continues to improve the flexibility of the fleet, improves customer service and reduces shipyard days and out of service days.
During the 2011 first 9 months, we took delivery of 32 new 30,000-barrel tank barges and 5,000- to 10,000-barrel charter barges, adding about 955,000 barrels of capacity. Offsetting this during the first 9 months, we retired 51 tank barges and returned 4 charter tank barges, thereby reducing our overall active fleet by about 980,000 barrels.
We added 20 tank barges with the purchase of the ship bunkering operation of enterprise in February, adding approximately 400,000 barrels of capacity. So net-net, our active tank barge fleet increased by approximately 375,000 barrels during the 2011 first 9 months. As of September 30, we operated 827 tank barges with the capacity of 16.3 million barrels.
For the 2011 fourth quarter, we're planning on taking delivery of 8 new tank barges with the capacity of about 200,000 barrels. We also plan on continuing to retire older barges. So net-net, at the end of 2011, our total inland tank barge capacity should remain at 16.3 million barrels.
In addition to inland tank barges, we're building 6 2,000-horsepower inland towboats, with 2 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 4 scheduled for 2012 delivery.
We are also building 2 offshore articulated dry bulk tug barge units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million and they are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2012. We'll make progress payments on these 2 units, totaling about $35 million during 2011 with the balance in 2012.
In addition to the 2 offshore units I just noted, Kirby's 2012 new construction will consist of 52 inland tank barges with the total capacity of about 930,000 barrels. The cost is about $95 million, the majority of which will be expended in 2012.
For 2011, we anticipated that industry-wide, about 150 tank barges will be delivered into service, 40 of which are for Kirby, and we've been estimating that about 150 older tank barges would be retired from service.
Due to the improved demand for inland petrochemical and black oil barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment, during 2011, we estimated approximately 200 tank barges are currently on order industry-wide for delivery throughout 2012. In offset -- and it will be offset to some degree depending on market conditions by retirements.
Short to medium term, we do not see this is a problem for Kirby as current 2011 and projected 2012 petrochemical and refinery production levels increase crude oil movements, and the current tank barge utilization levels support these new additions.
Turning to the diesel engine services segment, our April 15, acquisition of United continued to have a significant impact on Kirby's third quarter revenues and operating results. United contributed approximately 75% of the diesel engine services segment revenue during the third quarter, achieving an operating margin in the high single digits.
United's revenue and operating margins continued to be better than we originally expected. United's manufacturing of hydraulic fracturing equipment and sale and service of transmissions and diesel engines were above our expectations as exploration and development of the United States shale formations continues at a rapid pace.
Our legacy diesel engine services segment also benefited from continued strong power generation market with engine generator set upgrade projects and strong parts and engine sales.
Our service to the inland marine operators improved during the third quarter, a reflection of the improved inland liquid marine transportation market and maintenance on river vessels prior to the Midwest fall harvest.
I'll now turn the call over to David."

Good morning, everyone. Let me provide a few financial details. Kirby's marine transportation revenues were 51% above and operating income 52% above the 2010 third quarter.
The marine segments operating margin was 22.2% compared with 22.1% for the third quarter of 2010. The significant increase in both revenues and operating income included continued strong performance from our inland marine transportation sector, with high equipment utilization levels and favorable pricing, as Greg mentioned.
Our legacy marine transportation sector achieved an operating margin in the mid 20% range during the third quarter. The segment revenue increase included K-Sea, which contributed approximately 20% of the third quarter's marine transportation revenues. As expected, K-Sea was accretive to our third quarter operating income. For the third quarter, K-Sea's operating margin was in the low double-digit range.
Our diesel engine services revenues increased 338% and operating income, 371%, above last year's third quarter, with the increase predominantly due to the acquisition of United on April 15.
The segment's operating margin was 10% compared with 9.3% reported for the 2010 third quarter. As Greg reported, United's revenues and operating results were better than we expected, both from the service and manufacturing sectors, and their operating margin in the high single digit range was higher than historical United operating margin as the higher volume leverage flowed through to the bottom line.
Kirby's legacy third quarter diesel engine services operating margins were strong due to timing of several power generation projects and the improved inland marine market, which helped the segment's overall margins.
We continue to generate significant cash during the first 9 months of the year, with EBITDA of $308 million. Our capital spending for the first 9 months was $163.2 million and consisted of $110.1 million for new tank barges and towboats, as well as progress payments on the 2 new offshore bulk dry barges that Greg mentioned, and then another $53 million for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. Capital expenditures for K-Sea's and United during the third quarter were minimal.
Our capital spending guidance for 2011 remains in the range of $225 million to $235 million, which includes approximately $120 million for construction of new equipment. As you know, we financed the K-Sea acquisition with a new $540 million unsecured term loan and approximately 1.9 million shares of Kirby common stock. The term loan was funded as July 1, the closing date of the K-Sea acquisition. 
As of September 30, the term loan balance was $513 million. Also as of September 30, we had $83 million outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility. This morning, our revolver's outstanding balance was $33 million, since the acquisition of K-Sea, our peak debt hit $860 million. But as of yesterday it was $747 million, a reduction from the peak of $113 million.
Based on our current cash flow projections with no further acquisitions and tank barge in towboat construction at levels equal to scheduled retirements, we would anticipate being debt-free some time during the year of 2014. But let me be clear, we do not anticipate this happening as, historically, Kirby has been the major consolidator in the inland tank barges sector. And now being the largest operator in the 180,000-barrel coastwise trade, we believe we will be able to entertain consolidation opportunities in that area as well.
As of September 30, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 36% compared with 20.5% at June 30. This reflects the new term loan associated with the K-Sea acquisition, less some debt repayments during the quarter. 
I will now turn the call back to Joe."

I want to give you some insight with respect to the fourth quarter. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2011 fourth quarter guidance range of $0.97 per share to $1.02 per share. This compares with $0.59 per share reported for 201",523,"Okay. Thank you, David. I want to give you some insight with respect to the fourth quarter. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2011 fourth quarter guidance range of $0.97 per share to $1.02 per share. This compares with $0.59 per share reported for 2010 fourth quarter.
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that the U.S. petrochemical production for both domestic use and export will remain relatively strong based on a continued low U.S. natural gas prices, and we will continue to export some diesel fuel as well as heavy oil.
We are forecasting for the fourth quarter inland marine transportation utilization levels to be in the low 90% range. This is 1 or 2 percentage points off of the full utilization levels, or practical of full utilization is about 95%.
The third quarter was a very frothy, driven by low inventory levels which were the result of infrastructure issues caused by the flood in the second quarter. The market is returning to more normal levels, still high utilization and rate -- and with rate momentum, but not quite the frothy environment we saw at the beginning of the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we do anticipate higher results from our 4 offshore drive boat units as all 4 of those units are fully employed for the quarter. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes positive operating results from K-Sea. However, the anticipated winter weather conditions, the seasonality in their Alaska and the Great Lakes business and interest expense coupled with the impact on EPS on issuing the 1.9 million shares associated with this acquisition will offset most of K-Sea's contribution to operating income for the quarter.
For diesel engine, the service sector, our guidance assumes continued strong land-based manufacturing and service levels from United, generally inline with how United perform during the third quarter.
We anticipate our legacy diesel engine market will be inline with the third quarter, and our power generation market will have a fewer engine generator upgrade projects and some lower parts in engine sales. We also anticipate our Gulf Coast oil service market to reflect continued modest improvement during the fourth quarter.
Our 2011 guidance range was raised and tightened to a new level of $3.30 per share to $3.35 per share. Our previous guidance levels had been $3 to $3.10 per share, and of course much improved from the $2.15 reported last year. Our previous record year and this is a historical record for Kirby, was in 2008 when we reported $2.91 per share. Now, obviously, we're very pleased with our operating results thus far this year.
The acquisitions we've made position Kirby in markets which we believe will perform well and have growth opportunity. We're rapidly paying down our debt, as David mentioned, $113 million already from peak debt levels, at least as of yesterday.
Our 2 businesses, which are in more challenging markets, K-Sea and our legacy diesel engine business, will continue to improve as capacity tightens and volumes expand for K-Sea and drilling activity increases in the Gulf of Mexico for our legacy diesel engine business.
Operator, I think we will now open the call for questions."

Four, five years ago you could count the number of barges, actually moving crude oil, 1 or 2 hands. Today, there are close to we think about 140, 150 barges that are -- inland barges that are directly involved in moving crude oil and some offshore equipment also moving crude oil. The movements are mostly down river, movements of Canadian crude oil to Baton Rouge refineries. And then Eagle Ford liquids move to the Houston, Port Arthur and New Orleans markets. We think, if that's going to continue to grow that production levels are estimated to be 4 to 5x what they are currently. And that's both in Eagle Ford and Balkan. We also think that Canadian crude movements are going to grow. Some of the Eagle Ford movements will be ultimately, kind of medium term, moved by pipeline. But we think that the way these volumes are growing and where the pipelines are placed, there is still going to be some significant amount that will be moved by water and don't really -- we frankly these -- the number of barges involved, we think, going forward you'll have at least that many in the short term even more in the long term, it -- there's enough flexibility barging gives and enough limitation in the pipeline to keep that demand pretty strong.
As it -- will replace in terms of volume refined products being moved? Well, for Kirby, we've already moved more black oil. But specifically, to crude oil, it's possible. I think it's possible that you'll see the movement of crude oil equal to maybe the number of barrels that are currently moved for refined products. Probably a little too early to tell but, you feel pretty good about it."

Yes, what's driving it beyond expectations is that they've ramped up their manufacturing capability a lot faster and a lot better than we had anticipated when we bought them. The management team there has been very focused and have done an excellent job getting the throughput to the facility. And obviously, we talked little bit about the margins were a little better than we expected there and you can see it in the volumes also. So that's what's driven the out performance versus expectations. In terms of revenue growth, it is in the oil service patch, right? They do tend to have boom-bust cycles and you do see that in equipment, and we do expect at some point that this will turn down. And that's why we're really trying to focus on the service side of the business, to grow that up before the eventual downturn comes. But that said, it feels to us that this frac opportunity in the natural gas and cheap liquids are on the path to energy independence for the U.S. And given that, we think this trend is going to stay here for a while. Now, how does that translate into revenue growth going forward? It's really hard for us to put a number on it right now. I would say for just in the near term, 2012 looks on par to 2011 on a full year basis and maybe up some. We're still taking orders now for 2012 and it's still fairly strong."

Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Late yesterday, we announced record-setting net earnings for the 2011 third quarter of $0.94 per share, which reflects a 65% improvement over the $0.57 per share reported for the 2010 third quarter.
This quarter, we also closed the acquisition of K-Sea Transportation on July 1st. K-Sea is a coastwise and local tank barge operator with a diverse geographic footprint, operating on the East, West and Gulf Coast, as well as the Great Lakes and in Alaska and Hawaii and owns one of the younger fleets in the U.S. coastwise tank barge business.
The K-Sea fleet consists of 57 tank barges, 54 which are double hull with an average age of about 9 years and 63 tugboats. K-Sea's total tank barge capacity is 3.8 million barrels.
Our record third quarter results reflect a strong inland tank barge transportation market. Accretive operating earnings from K-Sea a robust land-based diesel engine service business and an improved marine and stable power generation service business.
Original earnings guidance range for the third quarter was $0.82 to $0.87 per share. On September 19, we announced that we expected our third quarter results to exceed $0.90 per share. Yesterday, we announced $0.94 per share. Stronger than expected petrochemical volumes, stable domestic refinery production held by some export volumes, favorable weather, higher term and contract rates all impacted our results for the third quarter.
Development of U.S. shale formations for oil and gas not only drove our land-based diesel engine service business, but also a low price natural gas is driving U.S. petrochemical volumes and the liquids coming out of these formations are providing black oil volumes to move, all very positive.
As we expected, and as we've commented on before, K-Sea's accretive operating results were generally offset by investment banking and legal fees, higher interest expense and the dilutive effect of the issuance of 1.9 million shares of Kirby stock associated with this acquisition.
For the third quarter K-Sea's equipment utilization rate was in the mid to high-70% range. The Atlantic Pacific and Hawaii fleets experienced good equipment utilization rates. The New York harbor-based fleet reflected lower utilization rates due to some overcapacity principally on the bunker market. With respect to pricing, contracts in this market renewed basically as expiring, but spot contract rates improved in the low to single-digit percentage range.
During the 2011 third quarter, approximately 60% of K-Sea's coastwise and local revenue was under contract and 40% was in the stock market. A time charter is represented about 90% of the revenues under term contracts in the third quarter.
With respect to K-Sea, we're working with Tim Casey and his management team integrating K-Sea where appropriate into Kirby. We expect this integration process will be completed early next year. K-Sea's market is certainly more difficult than our inland transportation business. We're pleased with their progress and believe that this business should continue to improve over the next couple of years as single hull vessels leave the market and volumes improve.
I'll come back at the end of end of our prepared remarks and talk about our fourth quarter forecast as well as the full year outlook. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Greg for a recap of our inland marine transportation business and diesel engine service business also."

The domestic petrochemical industry continues the benefit from low price natural gas, providing it with the competitive advantage to global markets.
This feedstock advantage continued to provide us with improved volumes at domestically produced petrochemicals for domestic consumption and also for exportation. Kirby's black oil fleet continues to see strong demand, driven by stable refinery output and the expansion of -- excuse me, I mean exportation of heavy fuel oil.
In addition, we're benefiting from some new incremental demand driven by the movements of crude oil produced from South Texas, Eagle Ford shale formations from the Corpus Christi area, the Houston, and the South Louisiana refineries. And also, Canadian crude oil movements from the St. Louis area to refineries in the lower Mississippi River as well. We expect the movements by -- of crude by barge will continue as shale formations are further developed. 
The agricultural chemical market was also very strong during the latter half of the third quarter with the traditional Midwest fall fill. During 2011, third quarter Kirby inland marine's petrochemical and black oil fleets achieved utilizations in the low to mid-90% range.
In our inland markets revenues from long-term contracts, that is one year or longer in duration, remained at 75%. And the mix of time charter and the freightment business continued at approximately 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moving to inland marine transportation pricing, contracts that were renewed during the third quarter achieved price increases in the mid-to-high single-digit range when compared with the 2010 third quarter. This compares with the low to mid-single digit range achieved in the 2011, first and second quarters compared to the -- for contracts renewed during the period of the 2010 corresponding quarters.
During the third quarter, spot pricing which includes the price of fuel, increased in the high single to low double-digit range compared with the 2011 second quarter. We continue to invest in our inland fleet both in terms of new construction and upgrading our existing barges. This program continues to improve the flexibility of the fleet, improves customer service and reduces shipyard days and out of service days.
During the 2011 first 9 months, we took delivery of 32 new 30,000-barrel tank barges and 5,000- to 10,000-barrel charter barges, adding about 955,000 barrels of capacity. Offsetting this during the first 9 months, we retired 51 tank barges and returned 4 charter tank barges, thereby reducing our overall active fleet by about 980,000 barrels.
We added 20 tank barges with the purchase of the ship bunkering operation of enterprise in February, adding approximately 400,000 barrels of capacity. So net-net, our active tank barge fleet increased by approximately 375,000 barrels during the 2011 first 9 months. As of September 30, we operated 827 tank barges with the capacity of 16.3 million barrels.
For the 2011 fourth quarter, we're planning on taking delivery of 8 new tank barges with the capacity of about 200,000 barrels. We also plan on continuing to retire older barges. So net-net, at the end of 2011, our total inland tank barge capacity should remain at 16.3 million barrels.
In addition to inland tank barges, we're building 6 2,000-horsepower inland towboats, with 2 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 4 scheduled for 2012 delivery.
We are also building 2 offshore articulated dry bulk tug barge units for use under long-term contracts. The cost of these units is approximately $100 million and they are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2012. We'll make progress payments on these 2 units, totaling about $35 million during 2011 with the balance in 2012.
In addition to the 2 offshore units I just noted, Kirby's 2012 new construction will consist of 52 inland tank barges with the total capacity of about 930,000 barrels. The cost is about $95 million, the majority of which will be expended in 2012.
For 2011, we anticipated that industry-wide, about 150 tank barges will be delivered into service, 40 of which are for Kirby, and we've been estimating that about 150 older tank barges would be retired from service.
Due to the improved demand for inland petrochemical and black oil barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment, during 2011, we estimated approximately 200 tank barges are currently on order industry-wide for delivery throughout 2012. In offset -- and it will be offset to some degree depending on market conditions by retirements.
Short to medium term, we do not see this is a problem for Kirby as current 2011 and projected 2012 petrochemical and refinery production levels increase crude oil movements, and the current tank barge utilization levels support these new additions.
Turning to the diesel engine services segment, our April 15, acquisition of United continued to have a significant impact on Kirby's third quarter revenues and operating results. United contributed approximately 75% of the diesel engine services segment revenue during the third quarter, achieving an operating margin in the high single digits.
United's revenue and operating margins continued to be better than we originally expected. United's manufacturing of hydraulic fracturing equipment and sale and service of transmissions and diesel engines were above our expectations as exploration and development of the United States shale formations continues at a rapid pace.
Our legacy diesel engine services segment also benefited from continued strong power generation market with engine generator set upgrade projects and strong parts and engine sales.
Our service to the inland marine operators improved during the third quarter, a reflection of the improved inland liquid marine transportation market and maintenance on river vessels prior to the Midwest fall harvest.
I'll now turn the call over to David."

Let me provide a few financial details. Kirby's marine transportation revenues were 51% above and operating income 52% above the 2010 third quarter.The marine segments operating margin was 22.2% compared with 22.",599,"Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Let me provide a few financial details. Kirby's marine transportation revenues were 51% above and operating income 52% above the 2010 third quarter.
The marine segments operating margin was 22.2% compared with 22.1% for the third quarter of 2010. The significant increase in both revenues and operating income included continued strong performance from our inland marine transportation sector, with high equipment utilization levels and favorable pricing, as Greg mentioned.
Our legacy marine transportation sector achieved an operating margin in the mid 20% range during the third quarter. The segment revenue increase included K-Sea, which contributed approximately 20% of the third quarter's marine transportation revenues. As expected, K-Sea was accretive to our third quarter operating income. For the third quarter, K-Sea's operating margin was in the low double-digit range.
Our diesel engine services revenues increased 338% and operating income, 371%, above last year's third quarter, with the increase predominantly due to the acquisition of United on April 15.
The segment's operating margin was 10% compared with 9.3% reported for the 2010 third quarter. As Greg reported, United's revenues and operating results were better than we expected, both from the service and manufacturing sectors, and their operating margin in the high single digit range was higher than historical United operating margin as the higher volume leverage flowed through to the bottom line.
Kirby's legacy third quarter diesel engine services operating margins were strong due to timing of several power generation projects and the improved inland marine market, which helped the segment's overall margins.
We continue to generate significant cash during the first 9 months of the year, with EBITDA of $308 million. Our capital spending for the first 9 months was $163.2 million and consisted of $110.1 million for new tank barges and towboats, as well as progress payments on the 2 new offshore bulk dry barges that Greg mentioned, and then another $53 million for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. Capital expenditures for K-Sea's and United during the third quarter were minimal.
Our capital spending guidance for 2011 remains in the range of $225 million to $235 million, which includes approximately $120 million for construction of new equipment. As you know, we financed the K-Sea acquisition with a new $540 million unsecured term loan and approximately 1.9 million shares of Kirby common stock. The term loan was funded as July 1, the closing date of the K-Sea acquisition. 
As of September 30, the term loan balance was $513 million. Also as of September 30, we had $83 million outstanding under our $250 million revolving credit facility. This morning, our revolver's outstanding balance was $33 million, since the acquisition of K-Sea, our peak debt hit $860 million. But as of yesterday it was $747 million, a reduction from the peak of $113 million.
Based on our current cash flow projections with no further acquisitions and tank barge in towboat construction at levels equal to scheduled retirements, we would anticipate being debt-free some time during the year of 2014. But let me be clear, we do not anticipate this happening as, historically, Kirby has been the major consolidator in the inland tank barges sector. And now being the largest operator in the 180,000-barrel coastwise trade, we believe we will be able to entertain consolidation opportunities in that area as well.
As of September 30, our debt to total capitalization ratio was 36% compared with 20.5% at June 30. This reflects the new term loan associated with the K-Sea acquisition, less some debt repayments during the quarter. 
I will now turn the call back to Joe."

I want to give you some insight with respect to the fourth quarter. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2011 fourth quarter guidance range of $0.97 per share to $1.02 per share. This compares with $0.59 per share reported for 201",525,"Okay. Thank you, David. I want to give you some insight with respect to the fourth quarter. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2011 fourth quarter guidance range of $0.97 per share to $1.02 per share. This compares with $0.59 per share reported for 2010 fourth quarter.
Our fourth quarter guidance assumes that the U.S. petrochemical production for both domestic use and export will remain relatively strong based on a continued low U.S. natural gas prices, and we will continue to export some diesel fuel as well as heavy oil.
We are forecasting for the fourth quarter inland marine transportation utilization levels to be in the low 90% range. This is 1 or 2 percentage points off of the full utilization levels, or practical of full utilization is about 95%.
The third quarter was a very frothy, driven by low inventory levels which were the result of infrastructure issues caused by the flood in the second quarter. The market is returning to more normal levels, still high utilization and rate -- and with rate momentum, but not quite the frothy environment we saw at the beginning of the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we do anticipate higher results from our 4 offshore drive boat units as all 4 of those units are fully employed for the quarter. Our fourth quarter guidance assumes positive operating results from K-Sea. However, the anticipated winter weather conditions, the seasonality in their Alaska and the Great Lakes business and interest expense coupled with the impact on EPS on issuing the 1.9 million shares associated with this acquisition will offset most of K-Sea's contribution to operating income for the quarter.
For diesel engine, the service sector, our guidance assumes continued strong land-based manufacturing and service levels from United, generally in line with how United perform during the third quarter.
We anticipate our legacy diesel engine market will be in line with the third quarter, and our power generation market will have a fewer engine generator upgrade projects and some lower parts in engine sales. We also anticipate our Gulf Coast oil service market to reflect continued modest improvement during the fourth quarter.
Our 2011 guidance range was raised and tightened to a new level of $3.30 per share to $3.35 per share. Our previous guidance levels had been $3 to $3.10 per share, and of course much improved from the $2.15 reported last year. Our previous record year and this is a historical record for Kirby, was in 2008 when we reported $2.91 per share. Now, obviously, we're very pleased with our operating results thus far this year.
The acquisitions we've made position Kirby in markets which we believe will perform well and have growth opportunity. We're rapidly paying down our debt, as David mentioned, $113 million already from peak debt levels, at least as of yesterday.
Our 2 businesses, which are in more challenging markets, K-Sea and our legacy diesel engine business, will continue to improve as capacity tightens and volumes expand for K-Sea and drilling activity increases in the Gulf of Mexico for our legacy diesel engine business.

Four, 5 years ago you could count the number of barges, actually moving crude oil, 1 or 2 hands. Today, there are close to we think about 140, 150 barges that are -- inland barges that are directly involved in moving crude oil and some offshore equipment also moving crude oil. The movements are mostly down river, movements of Canadian crude oil to Baton Rouge refineries. And then Eagle Ford liquids move to the Houston, Port Arthur and New Orleans markets. We think, if that's going to continue to grow that production levels are estimated to be 4 to 5x what they are currently. And that's both in Eagle Ford and Balkan. We also think that Canadian crude movements are going to grow. Some of the Eagle Ford movements will be ultimately, kind of medium term, moved by pipeline. But we think that the way these volumes are growing and where the pipelines are placed, there is still going to be some significant amount that will be moved by water and don't really -- we frankly these -- the number of barges involved, we think, going forward you'll have at least that many in the short term even more in the long term, it -- there's enough flexibility barging gives and enough limitation in the pipeline to keep that demand pretty strong. As it -- will replace in terms of volume refined products being moved? Well, for Kirby, we've already moved more black oil. But specifically, to crude oil, it's possible. I think it's possible that you'll see the movement of crude oil equal to maybe the number of barrels that are currently moved for refined products. Probably a little too early to tell but, you feel pretty good about it."

Yes, what's driving it beyond expectations is that they've ramped up their manufacturing capability a lot faster and a lot better than we had anticipated when we bought them. The management team there has been very focused and have done an excellent job getting the throughput to the facility. And obviously, we talked little bit about the margins were a little better than we expected there and you can see it in the volumes also. So that's what's driven the outperformance versus expectations. In terms of revenue growth, it is in the oil service patch, right? They do tend to have boom-bust cycles and you do see that in equipment, and we do expect at some point that this will turn down. And that's why we're really trying to focus on the service side of the business, to grow that up before the eventual downturn comes. But that said, it feels to us that this frac opportunity in the natural gas and cheap liquids are on the path to energy independence for the U.S. And given that, we think this trend is going to stay here for a while. Now, how does that translate into revenue growth going forward? It's really hard for us to put a number on it right now. I would say for just in the near term, 2012 looks on par to 2011 on a full year basis and maybe up some. We're still taking orders now for 2012 and it's still fairly strong."
