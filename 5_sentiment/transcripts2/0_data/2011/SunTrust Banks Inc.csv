I'd also like to thank Steve Shriner, who is on the phone this morning as well. He has accepted the position of Chief Retail Credit Officer in our Corporate Risk group. And I want to thank Steve for great work over the past two years. 
And before discussing the fourth quarter, I would like to take a moment to share a few accomplishments SunTrust in 2010 as we finish the year on a much more positive note than it began. A few examples. We returned to profitability during the year and posted a full year profit before preferred dividends. Our low-cost deposits grew 10% over the course of the year and demonstrating our success in increasing client loyalty and growing market share. Revenue expanded and benefited from a 17 basis point expansion in the net interest margin, as well as from solid performance from several of our key businesses. Credit quality improved throughout the year with quarterly declines in net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonperforming loans. And our capital ratios remain strong and even expanded.
Now turning to the fourth quarter, our earnings of $114 million or $0.23 per share improved compared to last year, as well as last quarter, mostly driven by lower provision with the result of improved credit quality and solid revenue. We're pleased with the diversity of our revenue sources and continue to improve credit quality. Net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined compared to the third quarter and are significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2009.
While our financial performance is still not to the level that we are at shareholders desire, we did make additional progress in demonstrating improved results and in executing our strategies to drive longer-term growth. The operating environment unquestionably remains challenging and obviously, it's been an active period from a regulatory and legislative standpoint. 
So let's turn to Slide 4. As we've said previously, financial regulation will impact our financial results going forward. Some new proposals were issued during the quarter, and the effects of certain aspects of regulatory reform are becoming clearer. This slide highlights selected items of interest, though it's not intended to be all-inclusive. Our guidance regarding deposit service charges, Reg E issues and derivatives remains unchanged and outlined in the chart. It appears the Fed certainly follow the letter of the Dodd-Frank law, with its recent proposal on debit interchange. Like most in the industry, we are very concerned about any government efforts to impose price controls. We additionally believe the Fed's proposal does not adequately recognize many of the costs associated with providing debit card services. We, of course, have been actively working to make our views known to the regulators, as well as to Congress.
The regulation is still in the comment period, and we're hopeful that any final regulation takes into account a less narrow interpretation of costs that will include at a minimum fraud losses and fraud prevention costs and servicing costs associated with operating a debit card business. Should the proposed rules be enacted then we obviously expect a material impact to this revenue stream beginning in the second half of 2011. I would note that the approximately 75% of revenue estimate does not take into account actions that we are pursuing to help mitigate this decline.
Turning to the current deposit insurance proposal. The calculation will be based on net assets not on deposits, which will obviously raise our assessment base. That said the cancellation also become more complex and sensitive to a variety of trailing trends and factors such as credit concentration, risks and earnings. If the proposal is adopted as it is today, we expect that over time, the higher assessment base will be partially mitigated as improving operating trends are reflected in the calculation.
While all of this may lead to some volatility in our quarterly expenses, we do not expect a significant increase in our 2011 expense base. With respect to capital as we disclosed last quarter, our Tier 1 common ratio is in excess of 8% currently above the 2019 Basel III 7% requirements. Based upon our understanding of the Basel III calculation, we expect a modest benefit to our Tier 1 common ratio, which I'll cover shortly. And lastly, we currently expect about 170 basis points impact to our Tier 1 capital ratio over a three-year period, beginning in 2013 from the Collins amendment. 
So let's take a minute and look at capital on Slide 5. Our regulatory capital ratio has increased again this quarter as they have in previous quarters as highlighted on the slide. Estimated Tier 1 common increased to a healthy 8.08%. The tangible common equity ratio and book values per share declined modestly due to declines in unrealized gains from rising rates during the quarter.
But before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment to offer some context on Basel III on Slide 6. The bottom line has been our Tier 1 common ratio today already exceeds the Basel III standard that will not be affected until 2019. Our Tier 1 common ratio increases approximately 30 basis points under the Basel III calculation to 8.4% or about $1.9 million more than the 7% standard. As you know, the Basel III framework is one of the lenses for which the Federal Reserve will be re-evaluating bank's capital plans submitted as part of a comprehensive capital plan review process. SunTrust submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early January as requested. Given that the Federal Reserve's review of that plan is still in process and that it is a confidential regulatory exam, we won't be providing any specifics contained in the plan today.
I will, however, offer a few high level thoughts on prioritization of future capital actions. As we have said, we have been and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support the future growth opportunities and to be consistent with our responsibilities to shareholders. We plan to continue making these investments in order to grow the business. And at the same time, we also recognize the value of returning capital to shareholders and in that regard, our priorities are repaying TARP and in due time after that, increasing the common dividend.
I'll now take a moment to comment on TARP. Our repayment strategy has been very deliberate, and it has had the best interest of our shareholders in mind. We believe our patience has been appropriate as it has enabled us to deliver meaningful improvements in our performance, which among other things has resulted in an increased stock price. I do ultimately expect that we will have to issue some equity to exit TARP as that has been in the press statement today. You may have noted that third [ph] highlighted its pro forma Tier 1 common ratio of 9% in its announcement. Several of our other large bank peers are also currently around this level. To the extent that peer review and/or a 9% number are relevant, a more modest capital raise for SunTrust than we've seen it in some present transactions might be required. There is now a quantitative framework through which TARP repayment is going to be evaluated, and that being the Fed's comprehensive capital plan review. We're certainly supportive of this review process, and it is expected to be completed by late March.
We expect that our 8.4% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio and our reduced risk profile will serve us well in this process. That said, this is obviously a very comprehensive review that the Fed is conducting and we don't have the results as yet. Once the review process is complete, we'll be in a better position to re-evaluate our repayment options and the appropriate timing.
Looking forward, we believe SunTrust is well positioned as we enter 2011. Our efforts to drive improved operational execution and client loyalty are yielding results and will remain a priority for us. We're taking advantage of opportunities in our markets, and we'll continue to make investments and make client loyalty and growth in primary relationships, the three areas that we believe drive market share growth and ultimately, higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders. 
And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Mark for more detail on financial results."

This represents a $0.06 incre",2472,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with a review of the summary income statement on Slide 7. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.23 per share. This represents a $0.06 increase from the $0.17 per share that we reported in the third quarter. Results were driven by a decline in the provision due to improved credit quality, as well as stable revenue relative to the strong results that we reported last quarter.
We'll discuss the quarter in more depth on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit a few of the highlights. Net interest income increased 2% or $28 million relative to the third quarter and grew 7% or $89 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by the continued favorable shift in the deposit mix and lower deposit pricing. We also saw a modest increase in loan balances in the quarter. The provision declined $103 million or 17% from the third quarter due to lower net charge-offs and a modest reduction in the allowance. Non-interest income declined sequentially significantly by $5 million or about 1% as Mortgage revenue was lower on the heels of the strong refinance activities that occurred in the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher trading income, as well as increases in other market-sensitive revenues.
Non-interest expenses increased $49 million or 3% from the prior quarter due primarily to investments in the business, including technology, marketing and personnel, as well as higher incentive compensation in certain business lines. As we've done in the past, we adjust for several items including securities and mark-to-market gains when presenting our core revenue and expense figures. The total net adjustments this quarter contributed $88 million to pretax earnings. So even excluding these items, we delivered another profitable quarter before and after TARP dividends, consistent with our guidance in December.
For the full year 2010, we reported positive net income before preferred dividends of $189 million and a net loss to common shareholders of $87 million or $0.18 per share. As Jim mentioned, both of these results improved meaningfully compared to 2009, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2009.
Our results for the full year and for the fourth quarter are still not near the levels where we would like them to be. But we are pleased with the progress that we made over the course of 2010, and we believe that we're well positioned as we enter 2011 to realize further improvement in our financial performance. 
With that, let's shift to Slide 8 for a review of loans and deposits. Average loan balances, excluding non-accruals, were up $1.9 billion or 2% as compared to the third quarter. Growth was driven by higher commercial and consumer loans, which more than offset our continued efforts to manage down the construction portfolio. Growth within the commercial category was split between large corporate and smaller commercial clients. Within our Corporate and Investment Banking business unit, growth came from higher balances in our asset-backed commercial paper conduit facility, while utilization rates overall remain stable and at relatively low levels. Growth in diversified commercial banking was due to a 2 percentage point pick up in utilization rates. It is too early to declare this increase a trend as it was likely some year-end inventory building that contributed to it but we were pleased to see higher demand in this area that we are targeting for future learned growth.
Average balance growth within the consumer direct category was largely from the consolidation of an approximate $500 million student loan securitization, which occurred at the end of the third quarter. Consumer indirect growth came primarily from auto loan purchases that occurred during both the third and fourth quarters, including an approximate $900 million portfolio acquisition that we closed in December.
We have been opportunistic with these transactions as we have found them to have attractive return and credit characteristics. Now turning to deposits. We continue to see a favorable shift in the mix towards low-cost accounts. DDA, NOW and money market accounts all increased 5% sequentially. These categories grew a combined $4.3 billion over their average balance levels in the third quarter, while higher cost time deposits declined almost $2 billion. This shift help drive further expansion in our net interest margin, which I'm going to discuss here in a minute.
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, low-cost deposits grew 10% or $8.5 billion. Concurrently, higher cost, time and wholesale deposit sources declined 25% or about the same amount, $8.4 billion. While we acknowledge that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients holding higher levels of liquidity, we also believe that the growth is the direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our clients banking experience and to drive households and market share growth.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of the securities portfolio. Our total available-for-sale portfolio stood at $26.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down $3.4 billion from the end of the third quarter. In anticipation of higher interest rates, we decreased the investment portfolio's risk profile through the sale of longer-dated securities and recognize $64 million in securities gains in the process. The sales were primarily in agency mortgage-backed and treasury securities. And going forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk to a further steeping of the yield curve through additional repositioning. Despite the significant increase of rates during the quarter, net realized gain in the bond portfolio was approximately $440 million albeit down from $830 million at the end of the third quarter.
Now I'm going to move to margin on Slide 10. The net interest margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up three basis points sequentially to 3.44%. The expansion was once again driven by a lower funding costs, the direct result of our low-cost deposit growth and continued management of our rates paid by product and by market. Relative to the prior year, margin is up 17 basis points, and this improvement was primarily caused by 38 basis point decline and rates paid on our interest very liabilities. While earning asset yield were down about 17 basis points due to the low rate environment, our strong focus on loan pricing and our Commercial Loans swap position both helped mitigate the impact of lower rates. We expect the margin as we move into 2011 to remain relatively stable in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, and the risks and opportunities to this view are listed on this slide.
Let's transition now to provision on Slide 11. Tom Freeman will cover credit quality in detail shortly so I'll be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $512 million, down $103 million from the third quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined by $69 million or about 10% in the quarter, the largest improvement is coming in residential Mortgage and construction. 
Additional credit metrics such as nonperforming loans nonperforming assets and early stage delinquencies all declined in the quarter. As such, the allowance was reduced by $112 million, and that reduction combined with loan growth reduced the allowance to loans ratio by 11 basis points. 
Let's move now to non-interest income on Slide 12. On a reported basis, non-interest income was down 1% sequentially but up 39% from the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments can be found in the appendix. And after these adjustments, non-interest income while down 6% sequentially was up 30% from the prior year. Now there were three significant swings in our sequential quarter fee income, which you see listed at the bottom of the page, including declines in Mortgage production and servicing and an increase in trading. Note that these items are also reported on an adjusted basis in order to be consistent with the figures presented at the top of the page. 
Adjusted Mortgage production declined about $90 million as rising interest rates resulted in a decline in locked loan volume, as well as reduced production margins. Mortgage servicing declined $64 million as rate volatility during the quarter led to reduced hedge performance and an increase in prepayment activity. Adjusted trading income increased $76 million. Now this was primarily due to the $59 million fair value loss that we recognized in the third quarter on our indexed link CDs and as we discussed last quarter, that was an unusually high loss and it compares to a $5 million gain recognized during the fourth quarter.
Our consumer and commercial fee income categories also generally performed well, and most notably, investment banking income posted another record quarter and eclipsed the $100 million mark for the period. Syndications accounted for an atypically high proportional of the revenue this quarter as a number of transactions were closed toward the end of the year on robust deal flow. Trust and retail investment income also increased sequentially, while deposit service charges declined due to the full quarter impact of Reg E. Overall, we were pleased that the diversity of our revenue sources enabled us to post strong year-over-year fee growth and solid sequential results amidst lower Mortgage volume and reduced deposit service charges.
Let's now turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of Mortgage repurchase trends. We have altered this slide compared to previous quarters in order to provide you some additional color on this topic. The top left portion shows that the income statement impact of Mortgage repurchases decreased to $85 million in the fourth quarter, down $10 million from the third quarter, while charge-offs increased $9 million as expected. The Mortgage repurchase reserve was reduced modestly, which is consistent with the declines experienced during the quarter, in both the pending demands and newly purchase request volumes, which topics we'll shift our attention to next. As depicted in the top right, pending demands declined by $27 million or about 8% to $293 million at the end of the quarter. I'll come back to the non-agency figures that you see in just a minute.
The bottom left chart depicts repurchase request volume by vintage. In total, repurchased volume was down $30 million in the quarter. The 2006 and 2007 vintages continue to comprise the bulk of the request though 2007 request were down $26 million sequentially. And as we've indicated previously, new demands can be volatile and are difficult to forecast, but we do expect over time that normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in request from the 2006 and 2007 vintages. And as that occurs, we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities as newer vintages exhibit more favorable credit characteristics. If we are correct in these assumptions, then we would expect a reduced income statement impact from Mortgage repurchases in 2011 versus what we experienced in 2010. 
Now before covering the final part of the slide, let me discuss our non-agency exposure. As we indicated last quarter, we have about $17 billion in unpaid principal balances on non-agency loans that we originated in 2005 through 2007 and subsequently sold or securitized. As you can see on the slide, we have a modest amount of pending demand on the non-agency products, and we've also been receiving a small amount of repurchase request volume of about $10 million to $15 million in recent quarters. As such, while our losses have not been material, this experienced has been factored into our Mortgage repurchase reserve process.
Let me finish up on this slide with a quick explanation of the bottom right box. There's been a lot of talk in the industry recently about lifetime loss estimates. The information presented here may be useful to you in deriving your own estimates for our lifetime losses, as well as our remaining exposure. You can see that we have $114 billion in remaining UPB on loans that we sold between 2005 and 2010. The $17 billion in non-agency loans is included within that figure. You also see depicted on the slide that to date, we have recognized approximately $1 billion in losses through the income statement, which includes more than $700 million net charge-offs and the current $265 million in reserves for future losses.
With that background, let's shift gears and go to Slide 14 for a review of expenses. Non-interest expenses up 3% when compared to the third quarter and 7% versus the prior year. Adjusting for losses on debt extinguishment and write-downs in our affordable housing unit, both of which we listed in the appendix, the growth rates are 3% and 8%, respectively. The increased expenses in both periods are due to the three drivers that you see at the bottom of the page, employee compensation, outside processing and software and marketing. 
Focusing on the sequential quarter, our adjusted non-interest expense was up $46 million in total, in the increase in these three highlighted drivers was $59 million. Broadly speaking, increases related to investments that we've made to drive our business, but I'll provide some additional detail here. Employee compensation and benefits was up $29 million due to higher salaries and increased incentive compensation. Salary increases were largely the result of hiring within our technology, Mortgage and client support areas. The incentive compensation increase was driven by the strong full year performance within certain business lines. Outside processing and software increased $17 million due to client acquisition and risk management technology projects, as well as higher transaction volumes. And the marketing and customer development increase of $13 million was due to over investments to grow our business, and we have been very pleased with the results to date.
In the appendix, you will also see detail of our credit related non-interest expenses, which also increased $9 million in the quarter, driven by $13 million in additional other real estate expenses. As we discussed in prior quarters, we are seeking to balance investments in the business with our expense discipline. Our full year expense growth is reflective of that balance. When you exclude non-core items like the 2009 goodwill impairment, our adjusted non-interest expenses increased about 3% over 2009, whereas revenue grew approximately 5%. And looking to the first quarter of 2011, we do expect an increase in personnel expenses due to the seasonal increase in employee benefit costs. However, we expect declines in other line items to offset this impact such that total non-interest expenses will be flat to down in the quarter. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality."

I'll begin today's review of our asset quality on Slide 15. As you heard from Mark and Jim, the overall theme of our credit message this morning is that asset quality continue to improve during the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs, provisi",1890,"Thank you, Mark. I'll begin today's review of our asset quality on Slide 15. As you heard from Mark and Jim, the overall theme of our credit message this morning is that asset quality continue to improve during the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs, provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all decreased. In fact, as you can see on the right-hand side of this slide, every key credit quality metric on this slide improved from the second quarter in a row. Net charge-offs declined 10% from the third quarter to $621 million, and the corresponding annualized charge-off rate declined to 2.14%. Provision expense declined primarily as a result of lower charge-offs, driven by improving credit quality. As a result of current quarter asset quality trends and an outlook for continued improvement, the allowance for loan losses was reduced by $112 million. This compares to a $70 million reduction in reserves in the third quarter.
The allowance to loan ratio ended the quarter at a healthy 2.58% of loans. Loan loss reserves declined on both an absolute and a relative basis for three reasons. First, as Mark noted earlier, high-risk portfolio balances continue to decline. Second, charge-offs associated with some of these higher risk portfolios such as construction absorbed some of the reserves. Third, emerging risk moderated.
The loan production that replaces run off and the generating the portfolio growth is higher-quality commercial and consumer loans and federally guaranteed student Mortgage loans. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined during the quarter by $263 million and $300 million, respectively or by 6%. This is the six consecutive quarter of decline in nonperforming loans. 
Ongoing resolution of problem assets continue to drive declines in nonperforming loans. In addition, real estate assets are moderating as we continue to aggressively dispose of properties want to have clear title. As a result, on real estate plus other repossessed assets have remained consistently low as a percentage of declining NPAs. A key leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans is 30 to 89 day delinquencies. These early-stage delinquencies declined again during the quarter to 90 basis points after excluding government-guaranteed student loans and voluntary Ginnie Mae purchases. This leading indicator future asset quality as significantly since the beginning of 2009. During this time, the economy and employment conditions have improved somewhat but remained sluggish overall. As a result, we don't expect significant further improvement in early-stage delinquencies until economic conditions improve.
Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of asset by product. This slide provides net charge-offs and early-stage delinquency metrics by loan type. It illustrates at a more granular level our overall asset quality has improved and that asset quality issues remained concentrated in the residential real estate and construction portfolios. More specific takeaways from this slide are that while total portfolio balances increased over $900 million, a higher risk residential and construction portfolios declined by nearly $1.3 billion. 
Charge-offs remain stable in most portfolios, declined meaningfully in Mortgage and construction and increased modestly in commercial. Overall, early-stage delinquency was broadly stable to down among the portfolio's. Now let's focus on the individual portfolios beginning with commercial. This portfolio continues to perform well. Balances grew. Net charge-offs increased somewhat, and early-stage delinquencies remain very low. We do not believe that the $29 million increased commercial charge-offs is indicative of the trend, and it was accompanied by a 20% increase in commercial non-accrual loans.
Charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio were stable compared to last quarter's 1% of loans on an annualized basis. Early-stage delinquency declined significantly, and the level of non-accrual loans increased somewhat. The current Commercial Real Estate correction continues, and we expect some variability in the performance as this cycle plays out.
However, as I've said many times during these calls, we continue to believe this portfolio will perform comparatively well, given its composition. Today, our performance expectations have been met. On an absolute basis, the bulk of our charge-offs continue to come from residential Mortgage, home equity and construction portfolios. Combined these three portfolio produced slightly over 70% of our fourth quarter net losses. However, these portfolios are also driving the sequential quarterly improvement in net charge-offs. 
Net losses in these portfolios decline nearly $100 million compared to last quarter. But the majority of improvement coming from residential mortgages. Quarterly variability and construction losses is to be expected as we continue to work through the remaining risk in our portfolio. Charge-off trends in Mortgage and home equity tend to be less variable from quarter-to-quarter and on the product of declining delinquencies in stabilizing home values. Asset quality in the consumer portfolios was basically stable. Charge-off ratios in the direct and indirect portfolios remained roughly 60 basis points on an annualized basis and declined to less than 6% in our small credit card book. Early-stage delinquencies were flat compared to last quarter in all but the Student Loan portfolio. While delinquencies in the student loan portion of the direct portfolio increased to 8.3%, this portfolio consists predominantly of lower risk, government-guaranteed loans, which is evident in the charge-off ratio of less than 50 basis points.
Next I'm going to briefly talk about the higher risk residential Mortgage, home equity and construction portfolios, which are detailed on the next few slides. These portfolios have generally exhibited declining balances and stable to improving risk over the course of 2010, and our performance in the fourth quarter was no different. My comments are going to be brief because we have provided these details in each quarter throughout the cycle and are fundamentally less to say at this point. I'll take the opportunity, however, to point out some key changes over time. 
Please turn to Slide 17 in our residential Mortgage portfolio. Asset quality in the residential Mortgage portfolio remains stable during the fourth quarter. As mentioned a moment ago, charge-offs declined meaningfully. On this slide, you can see that balances in nonperforming loans trended down within each of the Mortgage portfolios, most notably within the higher risk segments. Early-stage delinquencies increased marginally, and we believe seasonally in most Mortgage portfolio segments.
Our outlook for the residential Mortgage portfolio remains consistent with the view expressed last quarter. Past delinquency trends suggest reduced frequency of default over the next couple of quarters. We expect home prices to remain soft overall trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in others. We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to declining nonperforming loan and charge-off levels over the near term.
While this perspective be on the next quarter or two, it's important to note that the material improvement in the risk profile of this portfolio over the last three years. The total portfolio has declined $1.2 billion or less than 4% over the last three years. However, the highest risk elements in the portfolio all take seconds through prime seconds on this slide have been managed down by over $5 billion or 50% since the end of 2007. Net growth in the core portfolio of $3.6 billion during this time has been in the form of mortgages guaranteed by the federal government.
At year-end 2010, $3.8 billion or nearly 15% of the core Mortgage portfolio was backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA. Including voluntary Ginnie Mae Mortgage repurchases, federally guaranteed mortgages totaled $4.5 billion. 
Moving to Slide 18 and home equity lines of credit. The home equity portfolio asset quality was basically stable, while higher risk balances continue to decline. Charge-offs increased by $4 million and the net charge-offs ratio rose modestly to 3.39%. Roughly half of the increase in ratio was driven by higher net charge-offs, while the other half was attributable to lower portfolio balances. Declines in early exchange delinquency were concentrated in the higher risk portfolios.
Balances in this portfolio have declined roughly 9% over the last two years and are flat compared to three years ago. Run-off has been concentrated in the higher risk portfolios where no new production has occurred and little or no line availability exists. 
Now if you will turn to Slide 19, I will talk about our construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce exposure to high-risk construction, with balances dropping another 13% during the fourth quarter. Charge-offs declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. However, charge-offs are expected to remain elevated and uneven as we work through the remainder of the risk in this portfolio.
As you can see on the slide, residential regulated construction has been the most problematic, which 80% of the nonperforming loan comprised of construction deferred, residential construction and land loans. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased for the third straight quarter. While there may be some variability, we generally expect this trend of declining nonperforming loans to continue as we aggressively pursue workouts and transition foreclosed assets to other real estate owned and ultimately dispositions.
The construction portfolio also warrants a little historical perspective. Balances of $3.8 billion are down nearly $10 billion or 72% since the end of 2007. This reduction in outstanding balances was accomplished with $1.1 billion of cumulative charge-offs over the three-year period. With 29% of the remaining portfolio in nonperforming status and appropriate reserve, we believe we are well positioned to manage the remaining risk in this portfolio.
Next I'm going to review the portfolio of restructured loans on Slide 20 of today's presentation. The vast majority of SunTrust restructured loans continue to be loans that were modified to assist individual consumers experiencing financial difficulty. 97% of our accruing loan modification benefit customers by reducing interest rates and terms on mortgage and consumer loans. The payment performance of these accruing restructured loans continues to be good to 86% current on principal and interest savings.
Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up approximately $100 million from the third quarter. Growth in accruing TDRs slowed again in the current quarter as the volume of nearly delinquent loans eligible for restructured continue to decline. The balance of non-accruing TDRs remain basically unchanged compared to the third quarter. 2/3 of the non-accruing balances are restructured Mortgage and consumer loans. The majority of SunTrust modifications on loans to business entities are classified as non-accrual. At the end of the fourth quarter, roughly 1/3 of non-accruing TDRs were loans to business clients. Of those, $213 million were loans to the commercial real estate line of business clients. 
Before turning the call back to Chris, I'm going to provide a brief summary of today's asset quality review on Slide 21. Overall, improvement in asset quality continued in the fourth quarter. Improvements in asset quality metrics was broad-based. Provision expense charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early stage delinquencies all declined.
Individual portfolios showed generally stable to improving trends. Risk remains concentrated in the residential real estate and construction portfolios. Balances and charge-offs in these higher risk portfolios were stable to declining during the fourth quarter. Accruing TDRs are primarily related to Mortgage and consumer loans. Solid payment performance continued and the pace of new modifications has slowed. Our asset quality outlook for the first quarter of 2011 is for a modest decline in charge-offs and nonperforming loans as compared to the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris."

And I want to thank Steve for a great work over the past few years. 
And before discussing the fourth quarter, I would like to take a moment to share a few accomplishments of SunTrust in 2010, as we finish the year on a much more positive note than it began. A few examples. We returned to profitability during the year and posted a full year profit before preferred dividends. Our low-cost deposits grew 10% over the course of the year and demonstrating our success in increasing client loyalty and growing market share. Revenue expanded and benefited from a 17 basis point expansion in the net interest margin, as well as from solid performance from several of our key businesses. Credit quality improved throughout the year with quarterly declines in net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonperforming loans. And our capital ratios remains strong and even expanded.
Returning to the fourth quarter, our earnings of $114 million or $0.23 per share improved compared to last year, as well as last quarter, mostly driven by a lower provision with the result of improved credit quality and solid revenue. We're pleased with the diversity of our revenue sources and continued to improvement in credit quality. Net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined compared to the third quarter and are significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2009.
While our financial performance is still not to the level that we are as shareholders desire, we did make additional progress in demonstrating improved results and in executing our strategies to drive a longer-term growth. The operating environment unquestionably remains challenging and obviously, it's been an active period from a regulatory and legislative standpoint. 
So let's turn to Slide 4. As we've said previously, financial regulation will impact our financial results going forward. Some new proposals were issued during the quarter, and the effects of certain aspects of regulatory reform are becoming clearer. This slide highlights selected items of interest, though it's not intended to be all-inclusive. Our guidance regarding deposit of service charges, Reg E issues and derivatives remains unchanged and outlined in the chart. It appears the Fed certainly follow the letter of the Dodd-Frank law, with its recent proposal on debit interchange. Like most in the industry, we are very concerned about any government efforts to impose price controls. And we additionally believe that Fed's proposal does not adequately recognize many of the costs associated with providing debit card services. We, of course, have been actively working to make our views known to the regulators, as well as to Congress.
The regulation is still in the comment period, and we're hopeful that any final regulation takes into account, a less narrow interpretation of the costs that were going to include at a minimum fraud losses, fraud prevention costs and servicing costs associated with operating a debit card business. Should the proposed rules be enacted then we obviously expect a material impact to this revenue stream beginning in the second half of 2011. I would note that the approximately 75% revenue estimate does not take into account actions that we are pursuing to help mitigate this decline.
Turning to the current deposit insurance proposal. The calculation will be based on net assets not on deposits, which will obviously raise our assessment base. With that said the calculation will also become more complex and sensitive to a variety of trailing trends and factors such as credit concentration, its risks and earnings. If the proposal is adopted as it is today, we expect that over time, the higher assessment base will be partially mitigated as improving operating trends are reflected in the calculation.
While all of this may lead to some volatility in our quarterly expenses, we do not expect a significant increase in our 2011 expense base. With respect to capital as we disclosed last quarter, our Tier 1 common ratio is in excess of 8% currently above the 2019 Basel III 7% requirement. Based upon our understanding of the Basel III calculation, we expect a modest benefit to our Tier 1 common ratio, which I'll cover shortly. And lastly, we currently expect about 170 basis points impact to our Tier 1 capital ratio over a three-year period, beginning in 2013 from the Collins amendment. 
So let's take a minute and look at capital on Slide 5. Our regulatory capital ratios increased again this quarter as they have in previous quarters as highlighted on the slide. Estimated Tier 1 common increased to a healthy 8.08%. The tangible common equity ratio and book values per share declined modestly due to declines in unrealized gains from rising rates during the quarter.
But before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment to offer some context on Basel III on Slide 6. The bottom line is that our Tier 1 common ratio today already exceeds the Basel III standard that will not be effective until 2019. Our Tier 1 common ratio increases approximately 30 basis points under the Basel III calculation to 8.4% or about $1.9 billion more than the 7% standard. 
As you know, the Basel III framework is one of the lenses for which the Federal Reserve will be re-evaluating bank's capital plans submitted as part of the comprehensive capital plan review process. SunTrust submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early January as requested. Given that the Federal Reserve's review of that plan is still in process and that it is a confidential regulatory exam, we won't be providing any specifics contained in the plan today.
I will, however, offer a few high level thoughts on prioritization of future capital actions. As we have said, we have been and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support the future growth opportunities and to be consistent with our responsibilities to shareholders. We plan to continue making these investments in order to grow the business. And at the same time, we also recognize the value of returning capital to shareholders. And in that regard, our priorities are repaying TARP and in due time after that, increasing the common dividend.
I'll now take a moment to comment on TARP. Our repayment strategy has been very deliberate, and it has had the best interest of our shareholders in mind. We believe our patience has been appropriate as it has enabled us to deliver meaningful improvements in our performance, which among other things has resulted in an increased stock price. I do ultimately expect that we will have to issue some equity to exit TARP as that have been the precedent today. You may have noted that Fifth Third highlighted its pro forma Tier 1 common ratio of 9% in its announcement. Several of our other large bank peers are also currently around this level. To the extent that peer review and/or a 9% number are relevant, a more modest capital raise for SunTrust than we've seen in some precedent transactions might be required. There is now a quantitative framework through which TARP repayment is going to be evaluated, and that being the Fed's comprehensive capital plan review. We're certainly supportive over this review process, and it is expected to be completed by late March.
We expect that our 8.4% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio and our reduced risk profile will serve us well in this process. That said, this is obviously a very comprehensive review that the Fed is conducting and we don't have the results yet. Once the review process is complete, we'll be in a better position to re-evaluate our repayment options and the appropriate timing.
Looking forward, we believe SunTrust is well positioned as we enter 2011. Our efforts to drive improved operational execution and client loyalty are yielding results and will remain a priority for us. We're taking advantage of opportunities in our markets, and we'll continue to make investments and teammate engagement, client loyalty and growth in primary relationships, the three areas that we believe drive market share growth and ultimately, high levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders. 
And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Mark for more detail on financial results."
305901,117817153,93740,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2011",2011-01-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with the review of the summary income statement on Slide 7. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.23 per share. This represents a $0.06 inc",2480,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with the review of the summary income statement on Slide 7. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.23 per share. This represents a $0.06 increase from the $0.17 per share that we reported in the third quarter. Results were driven by a decline in the provision due to improved credit quality, as well as stable revenue relative to the strong results that we reported last quarter.
We'll discuss the quarter in more depth on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit a few of the highlights. Net interest income increased 2% or $28 million relative to the third quarter and grew 7% or $89 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by the continued favorable shift in the deposit mix and lower deposit pricing. We also saw a modest increase in loan balances in the quarter. The provision declined $103 million or 17% from the third quarter due to lower net charge-offs and a modest reduction in the allowance. Noninterest income declined sequentially by $5 million or about 1% as Mortgage revenue was lower on the heels of the strong refinance activities that occurred in the third quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher trading income, as well as increases in other market-sensitive revenues.
Noninterest expenses increased $49 million or 3% from the prior quarter due primarily to investments in the business, including technology, marketing and personnel, as well as higher incentive compensation in certain business lines. As we have done in the past, we adjust for several items including securities and mark-to-market gains when presenting our core revenue and expense figures. The total net adjustments this quarter contributed $88 million to pretax earnings. So even excluding these items, we delivered another profitable quarter before and after TARP dividends, consistent with our guidance in December.
For the full year 2010, we reported positive net income before preferred dividends of $189 million and a net loss to common shareholders of $87 million or $0.18 per share. As Jim mentioned, both of these results improved meaningfully compared to 2009, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2009.
Our results for the full year and for the fourth quarter are still not near the levels where we would like them to be. But we are pleased with the progress that we made over the course of 2010, and we believe that we're well positioned as we enter 2011 to realize further improvement in our financial performance. 
With that, let's shift to Slide 8 for a review of loans and deposits. Average loan balances, excluding nonaccruals, were up $1.9 billion or 2% as compared to the third quarter. Growth was driven by higher commercial and consumer loans, which more than offset our continued efforts to manage down the Construction portfolio. Growth within the commercial category was split between large corporate and smaller commercial clients. Within our Corporate and Investment Banking business unit, growth came from higher balances in our asset-backed commercial paper conduit facility, while utilization rates overall remain stable and at relatively low levels. Growth in diversified commercial banking was due to a 2 percentage point pick up in utilization rates. It is too early to declare this increase a trend as it was likely some year-end inventory building that contributed to it, but we were pleased to see higher demand in this area that we are targeting for future loan growth.
Average balance growth within the consumer direct category was largely from the consolidation of an approximate $500 million student loan securitization, which occurred at the end of the third quarter. Consumer indirect growth came primarily from auto loan purchases that occurred during both the third and fourth quarters, including an approximate $900 million portfolio acquisition that we closed in December.
We have been opportunistic with these transactions as we have found them to have attractive return and credit characteristics. Now turning to deposits. We continue to see a favorable shift in the mix towards low-cost accounts. DDA, NOW and Money Market Accounts all increased 5% sequentially. These categories grew a combined $4.3 billion over their average balance levels in the third quarter, while higher cost time deposits declined almost $2 billion. This shift helped drive further expansion on our net interest margin, which I'm going to discuss here in a minute.
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, low-cost deposits grew 10% or $8.5 billion. Concurrently, higher cost, time and wholesale deposit sources declined 25% or about the same amount, $8.4 billion. While we acknowledge that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients holding higher levels of liquidity, we also believe that the growth is the direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our client's banking experience and to drive households and market share growth.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of the securities portfolio. Our total available-for-sale portfolio stood at $26.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down $3.4 billion from the end of the third quarter. In anticipation of higher interest rates, we decreased the investment portfolio's risk profile through the sale of a longer-dated securities and recognize $64 million in securities gains in the process. The sales were primarily an agency mortgage-backed and treasury securities. And going forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk to a further steeping of the yield curve through additional repositioning. Despite the significant increase in rates during the quarter, the unrealized gain in the bond portfolio was approximately $440 million albeit down from $830 million at the end of the third quarter.
Now I'm going to move to margin on Slide 10. The net interest margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up three basis points sequentially to 3.44%. The expansion was once again driven by a lower funding costs, the direct result of our low-cost deposit growth and continued management of our rates paid by product and by market. Relative to the prior year, margin is up 17 basis points, and this improvement was primarily caused by a 38 basis point decline in rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. While earning asset yields were down about 17 basis points due to the low rate environment, our strong focus on loan pricing and our Commercial Loans swap position both help to mitigate the impact of lower rates. We expect the margin as we move into 2011 to remain relatively stable in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, and the risks and opportunities to this view are listed on the slide.
Let's transition now to provision on Slide 11. Tom Freeman will cover credit quality in detail shortly so I'll be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $512 million, down $103 million from the third quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined by $69 million or about 10% in the quarter, but the largest improvement is coming in residential Mortgage and construction. 
Additional credit metrics such as nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early stage delinquencies all declined in the quarter. As such, the allowance was reduced by $112 million, and that reduction combined with loan growth reduced the allowance to loans ratio by 11 basis points. 
Let's move now to noninterest income on Slide 12. On a reported basis, noninterest income was down 1% sequentially but up 39% from the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments can be found in the appendix. And after these adjustments, noninterest income while down 6% sequentially was up 30% from the prior year. 
Now there were three significant swings in our sequential quarter fee income, which you see listed at the bottom of the page, including declines in Mortgage production and servicing and an increase in trading. Note that these items are also reported on an adjusted basis in order to be consistent with the figures presented at the top of the page. 
Adjusted Mortgage production declined about $90 million as rising interest rates resulted in a decline in locked loan volume, as well as reduced production margins. Mortgage servicing declined $64 million as rate volatility during the quarter led to reduced hedge performance and an increase in prepayment activity. Adjusted trading income increased $76 million. Now this was primarily due to the $59 million fair value loss that we recognized in the third quarter on our indexed link CDs and as we discussed last quarter, that was an unusually high loss and it compares to a $5 million gain recognized during the fourth quarter.
Our consumer and commercial fee income categories also generally performed well. And most notably, investment banking income posted another record quarter and eclipsed the $100 million mark for the period. Syndications accounted for an atypically high proportion of the revenue this quarter, as a number of transactions were closed toward the end of the year on robust deal flow. Trust and retail investment income also increased sequentially, while deposit service charges declined due to the full quarter impact of Reg E. Overall, we were pleased that the diversity of our revenue sources enabled us to post strong year-over-year fee growth and solid sequential results amidst lower Mortgage volume and reduced deposit service charges.
Let's now turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of Mortgage repurchase trends. We've altered this slide compared to previous quarters in order to provide you some additional color on this topic. The top left portion shows that the income statement impact of Mortgage repurchases decreased to $85 million in the fourth quarter, down $10 million from the third quarter, while charge-offs increased $9 million as expected. The Mortgage repurchase reserve was reduced modestly, which is consistent with the declines experienced during the quarter, in both the pending demands and new repurchase request volume, which of the topics will shift our attention to next. As depicted in the top right, pending demands declined by $27 million or about 8% to $293 million at the end of the quarter. And I'll come back to the non-agency figures that you see in just a minute.
The bottom left chart depicts repurchase request volume by vintage. In total, repurchase volume was down $30 million in the quarter. The 2006 and 2007 vintages continue to comprise the bulk of the request, though 2007 request were down $26 million sequentially. And as we've indicated previously, new demands can be volatile and are difficult to forecast, but we do expect over time, that normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in request from the 2006 and 2007 vintages. And as that occurs, we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities as newer vintages exhibit more favorable credit characteristics. If we are correct in these assumptions, then we would expect a reduced income statement impact from Mortgage repurchases in 2011 versus what we experienced in 2010. 
Now before covering the final part of this slide, let me discuss our non-agency exposure. As we indicated last quarter, we have about $17 billion in unpaid principal balances on non-agency loans that we originated in 2005 through 2007 and subsequently sold or securitized. As you can see on the slide, we have a modest amount of pending demand on the non-agency products, and we've also been receiving a small amount of repurchase request volume of about $10 million to $15 million in recent quarters. As such, while our losses have not been immaterial, this experience has been factored into our Mortgage repurchase reserve process.
Let me finish up on this slide with a quick explanation of the bottom right box. There's been a lot of talk in the industry recently about lifetime loss estimates. The information presented here may be useful to you in deriving your own estimates for our lifetime losses, as well as our remaining exposure. You can see that we have $114 billion in remaining UPB on loans that we sold between 2005 and 2010. The $17 billion in non-agency loans is included within that figure. You also see depicted on the slide that to date, we have recognized approximately a $1 billion in losses through the income statement, which includes more than $700 million in charge-offs and the current $265 million in reserves for future losses.
With that background, let's shift gears and go to Slide 14 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense was up 3% when compared to the third quarter and 7% versus the prior year. Adjusting for losses on debt extinguishment and write-downs in our affordable housing unit, both of which we've listed in the appendix, the growth rates are 3% and 8%, respectively. The increased expenses in both periods are due to the three drivers that you see at the bottom of the page, employee compensation, outside processing and software and marketing. 
Focusing on the sequential quarter, our adjusted noninterest expense was up $46 million in total, and the increase in these three highlighted drivers was $59 million. Now broadly speaking, the increases relate to investments we've made to drive our business, but I'll provide some additional detail here. 
Employee compensation and benefits was up $29 million due to higher salaries and increased incentive compensation. Salary increases were largely the result of hiring within our technology, Mortgage and client support areas. The incentive compensation increase was driven by the strong full year performance within certain business lines. Outside processing and software increased $17 million due to client acquisition and risk management technology projects, as well as higher transaction volumes. And the marketing and customer development increase of $13 million was due to over investments to grow our business, and we have been very pleased with the results to date.
In the appendix, you will also see detail of our credit related non expenses, which also increased $9 million in the quarter, driven by $13 million in additional other real estate expenses. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we are seeking to balance investments in the business with our expense discipline. Our full year expense growth is reflective of that balance. When you exclude non-core items like the 2009 goodwill impairment, our adjusted noninterest expenses increased about 3% over 2009, whereas revenue grew approximately 5%. And looking to the first quarter of 2011, we do expect an increase in personnel expenses due to the seasonal increase in employee benefits costs. However, we expect declines in other line items to offset this impact such the total noninterest expenses will be flat to down in the quarter. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality."

Net charge-offs, provisi",1904,"Thank you, Mark. I'll begin today's review of our asset quality on Slide 15. As you heard from Mark and Jim, the overall theme of our credit message this morning is that asset quality continue to improve during the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs, provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all decreased. In fact, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, every key credit quality metric on the slide improved for the second quarter in a row. Net charge-offs declined 10% from the third quarter to $621 million, and the corresponding annualized charge-off rate declined to 2.14%. Provision expense declined primarily as a result of lower charge-offs, driven by improving credit quality. As a result of current quarter asset quality trends and an outlook for continued improvement, the Allowance for Loan Losses was reduced by a $112 million. This compares to a $70 million reduction in reserves in the third quarter.
The allowance to loan ratio ended the quarter at a healthy 2.58% of loans. Loan loss reserves declined on both an absolute and a relative basis for three reasons: First, as Mark noted earlier, high-risk portfolio balances continue to decline; second, charge-offs associated with some of these higher risk portfolios such as construction absorbed some of the reserves; third, emerging risk moderated.
The loan production that replaces run off and is generating net portfolio growth is higher-quality commercial and consumer loans and federally guaranteed student Mortgage loans. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined during the quarter by $263 million and $300 million, respectively or by 6%. This is the six consecutive quarter of decline in nonperforming loans. 
Ongoing resolution of problem assets continue to drive declines in nonperforming loans. In addition, owned real estate assets are moderating as we continue to aggressively dispose of the properties once we have a clear title. As a result, on real estate plus other repossessed assets have remained consistently low as a percentage of declining NPAs. A key leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans is 30 to 89 day delinquencies. These early-stage delinquencies declined again during the quarter to 90 basis points after excluding government-guaranteed student loans and voluntary GNMA Mortgage purchases. This leading indicator of future asset quality has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2009. During this time, the economy and employment conditions have improved somewhat, but remained sluggish overall. As a result, we don't expect significant further improvement in early-stage delinquencies until economic conditions improve.
Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of asset quality by product. This slide provides net charge-offs and early-stage delinquency metrics by loan type. It illustrates at a more granular level our overall asset quality has improved and that asset quality issues remained concentrated in the Residential Real Estate and Construction portfolios. More specific takeaways from this slide are that while total portfolio balances increased over $900 million, a higher risk Residential and Construction portfolios declined by nearly $1.3 billion. 
Charge-offs remain stable in most portfolios, declined meaningfully in Mortgage and Construction and increased modestly in Commercial. Overall, early-stage delinquency was broadly stable to down among the portfolios. 
Now let's focus on the individual portfolios beginning with Commercial. This portfolio continues to perform well. Balances grew. Net charge-offs increased somewhat, and early-stage delinquencies remain very low. We do not believe that the $29 million increase in commercial charge-offs is indicative of the trend, and it was accompanied by a 20% increase in Commercial nonaccrual loans.
Charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio were stable compared to last quarter's 1% of loans on an annualized basis. Early-stage delinquency declined significantly, and then level of nonaccrual loans increased somewhat. The current Commercial Real Estate correction continues, and we expect some variability in the performances as this cycle plays out.
However, as I've said many times during these calls, we continue to believe this portfolio will perform comparatively well, given this composition. To date, our performance expectations have been met. On an absolute basis, the bulk of our charge-offs continue to come from Residential Mortgage, Home Equity and Construction portfolios. Combined these three portfolio produced slightly over 70% of our fourth quarter net losses. However, these portfolios are also driving the sequential quarterly improvement in net charge-offs. 
Net losses in these portfolios decline nearly $100 million compared to last quarter. But the majority of the improvement coming from Residential mortgages. Quarterly variability and construction losses is to be expected as we continue to work through the remaining risk in this portfolio. Charge-off trends in consumer, Mortgage and Home Equity tend to be less variable from quarter-to-quarter and on the product of declining delinquencies in stabilizing home values. 
Asset quality in the consumer portfolios was basically stable. Charge-off ratios in the direct and indirect portfolios remained roughly 60 basis points on an annualized basis and declined to less than 6% in our small credit card book. Early-stage delinquencies were flat compared to last quarter in all but the student loan portfolio. While delinquencies in the student loan portion of the direct portfolio increased to 8.3%. This portfolio consists predominantly of lower risk, government-guaranteed loans, which is evident in the charge-off ratio of less than 50 basis points.
Next I'm going to briefly talk about the higher risk Residential Mortgage, Home Equity and Construction portfolios, which are detailed on the next few slides. These portfolios have generally exhibited declining balances and stable to improving risk over the course of 2010, and their performance in the fourth quarter was no different. My comments are going to be brief because we have provided these details in each quarter throughout the cycle and are fundamentally less to say at this point. I will take the opportunity, however, to point out some key changes over time. 
Please turn to Slide 17 in our Residential Mortgage portfolio. Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio remains stable during the fourth quarter. As mentioned a moment ago, charge-offs declined meaningfully. On this slide, you can see that balances in nonperforming loans trended down within each of the Mortgage portfolios, most notably within the higher risk segments. Early-stage delinquencies increased marginally, and we believe seasonally in most Mortgage portfolio segments.
Our outlook for the Residential Mortgage portfolio remains consistent with the view we expressed last quarter. Past delinquency trends suggest reduced frequency of default over the next couple of quarters. We expect home prices to remain soft overall trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in others. We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to declining nonperforming loan and charge-off levels over the near term.
While this perspective would be on the next quarter or two, it's important to note that the material improvement in the risk profile of this portfolio over the last three years. The total portfolio has declined $1.2 billion or less than 4% over the last three years. However, the highest risk elements in the portfolio, Alt-A seconds through prime seconds on the slide have been managed down by over $5 billion or 50% since the end of 2007. Net growth in the core portfolio of $3.6 billion during this time has been in the form of mortgages guaranteed by the federal government.
At year-end 2010, $3.8 billion or nearly 15% of the core Mortgage portfolio was backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA. Including voluntary GNMA Mortgage repurchases, federally guaranteed mortgages totaled $4.5 billion. 
Moving to Slide 18 in Home Equity lines of credit. The Home Equity portfolio asset quality was basically stable, while higher risk balances continue to decline. Charge-offs increased by $4 million and the net charge-off ratio rose modestly to 3.39%. Roughly half of the increase in new ratio was driven by higher net charge-offs, while the other half was attributable to lower portfolio balances. Declines in early exchange delinquency were concentrated in the higher risk portfolios.
Balances in this portfolio have declined roughly 9% over the last two years and are flat compared to three years ago. Run-off has been concentrated in the higher risk portfolios where no new production has occurred and little or no line availability exists. 
Now if you will turn to Slide 19, I will talk about our Construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce exposure to high-risk construction, with balances dropping another 13% during the fourth quarter. Charge-offs declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. However, charge-offs were expected to remain elevated and uneven as we work through the remainder of the risk in this portfolio.
As you can see on the slide, residential regulated construction has been the most problematic, with 80% of the nonperforming loan comprised of construction deferred, residential construction and land loans. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased for the third straight quarter. While there may be some variability, we generally expect this trend of declining nonperforming loans to continue as we aggressively pursue workouts and transition foreclosed assets to other real estate owned and ultimately disposition.
The Construction portfolio also warrants a little historic perspective. Balances of $3.8 billion are down nearly $10 billion or 72% since the end of 2007. This reduction in outstanding balances was accomplished with $1.1 billion of cumulative charge-offs over the three-year period. With 29% of the remaining portfolio in nonperforming status and appropriate reserve, we believe we are well positioned to manage the remaining risk in this portfolio.
Next I'm going to review the portfolio of restructured loans on Slide 20 of today's presentation. The vast majority of SunTrust restructured loans continue to be loans that were modified to assist individual consumers experiencing financial difficulty. 97% of our accruing loan modifications benefit customers by reducing interest rates and exempting terms on mortgage and consumer loans. The payment performance of these accruing restructured loans continues to be good with 86% current on principal and interest savings.
Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up approximately $100 million from the third quarter. Growth in accruing TDRs slowed again in the current quarter as the volume of nearly delinquent loans eligible for restructure continue to decline. The balance of non-accruing TDR remain basically unchanged compared to the third quarter. 2/3 of the nonaccruing balances are restructured Mortgage and consumer loans. The majority of SunTrust modifications on loans to business entities are classified as nonaccrual. At the end of the fourth quarter, roughly 1/3 of nonaccruing TDRs were loans to business clients. Of those, $213 million were loans to the commercial real estate line of business clients. 
Before turning the call back to Chris, I'm going to provide a brief summary of today's asset quality review on Slide 21. Overall, improvement in asset quality continued in the fourth quarter. Improvements in asset quality metrics was broad-based. Provision expense charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early stage delinquencies all declined.
Individual portfolios showed generally stable to improving trends. Risk remains concentrated from the Residential Real Estate and Construction Portfolios. Balances and charge-offs in these higher risk portfolios were stable to declining during the fourth quarter. Accruing TDRs are primarily related to Mortgage and consumer loans. Solid payment performance continued and the pace of new modifications has slowed. Our asset quality outlook for the first quarter of 2011 is for a modest decline in charge-offs and nonperforming loans as compared to the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris."

And I want to thank Steve for a great work over the past few years. 
And before discussing the fourth quarter, I would like to take a moment to share a few accomplishments of SunTrust in 2010, as we finish the year on a much more positive note than it began. A few examples. We returned to profitability during the year and posted a full year profit before preferred dividends. Our low-cost deposits grew 10% over the course of the year and demonstrating our success in increasing client loyalty and growing market share. Revenue expanded and benefited from a 17 basis point expansion in the net interest margin, as well as from solid performance from several of our key businesses. Credit quality improved throughout the year with quarterly declines in net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonperforming loans. And our capital ratios remains strong and even expanded.
Returning to the fourth quarter, our earnings of $114 million or $0.23 per share improved compared to last year, as well as last quarter, mostly driven by a lower provision with the result of improved credit quality and solid revenue. We're pleased with the diversity of our revenue sources and continued to improvement in credit quality. Net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined compared to the third quarter and are significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2009.
While our financial performance is still not to the level that we are as shareholders desire, we did make additional progress in demonstrating improved results and in executing our strategies to drive a longer-term growth. The operating environment unquestionably remains challenging and obviously, it's been an active period from a regulatory and legislative standpoint. 
So let's turn to Slide 4. As we've said previously, financial regulation will impact our financial results going forward. Some new proposals were issued during the quarter, and the effects of certain aspects of regulatory reform are becoming clearer. This slide highlights selected items of interest, though it's not intended to be all-inclusive. Our guidance regarding deposit of service charges, Reg E issues and derivatives remains unchanged and outlined in the chart. It appears the Fed certainly follow the letter of the Dodd-Frank law, with its recent proposal on debit interchange. Like most in the industry, we are very concerned about any government efforts to impose price controls. And we additionally believe that Fed's proposal does not adequately recognize many of the costs associated with providing debit card services. We, of course, have been actively working to make our views known to the regulators, as well as to Congress.
The regulation is still in the comment period, and we're hopeful that any final regulation takes into account, a less narrow interpretation of the costs that were going to include at a minimum fraud losses, fraud prevention costs and servicing costs associated with operating a debit card business. Should the proposed rules be enacted then we obviously expect a material impact to this revenue stream beginning in the second half of 2011. I would note that the approximately 75% revenue estimate does not take into account actions that we are pursuing to help mitigate this decline.
Turning to the current deposit insurance proposal. The calculation will be based on net assets not on deposits, which will obviously raise our assessment base. With that said the calculation will also become more complex and sensitive to a variety of trailing trends and factors such as credit concentration, its risks and earnings. If the proposal is adopted as it is today, we expect that over time, the higher assessment base will be partially mitigated as improving operating trends are reflected in the calculation.
While all of this may lead to some volatility in our quarterly expenses, we do not expect a significant increase in our 2011 expense base. With respect to capital as we disclosed last quarter, our Tier 1 common ratio is in excess of 8% currently above the 2019 Basel III 7% requirement. Based upon our understanding of the Basel III calculation, we expect a modest benefit to our Tier 1 common ratio, which I'll cover shortly. And lastly, we currently expect about 170 basis points impact to our Tier 1 capital ratio over a three-year period, beginning in 2013 from the Collins amendment. 
So let's take a minute and look at capital on Slide 5. Our regulatory capital ratios increased again this quarter as they have in previous quarters as highlighted on the slide. Estimated Tier 1 common increased to a healthy 8.08%. The tangible common equity ratio and book values per share declined modestly due to declines in unrealized gains from rising rates during the quarter.
But before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment to offer some context on Basel III on Slide 6. The bottom line is that our Tier 1 common ratio today already exceeds the Basel III standard that will not be effective until 2019. Our Tier 1 common ratio increases approximately 30 basis points under the Basel III calculation to 8.4% or about $1.9 billion more than the 7% standard. 
As you know, the Basel III framework is one of the lenses for which the Federal Reserve will be re-evaluating bank's capital plans submitted as part of the comprehensive capital plan review process. SunTrust submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early January as requested. Given that the Federal Reserve's review of that plan is still in process and that it is a confidential regulatory exam, we won't be providing any specifics contained in the plan today.
I will, however, offer a few high level thoughts on prioritization of future capital actions. As we have said, we have been and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support the future growth opportunities and to be consistent with our responsibilities to shareholders. We plan to continue making these investments in order to grow the business. And at the same time, we also recognize the value of returning capital to shareholders. And in that regard, our priorities are repaying TARP and in due time after that, increasing the common dividend.
I'll now take a moment to comment on TARP. Our repayment strategy has been very deliberate, and it has had the best interest of our shareholders in mind. We believe our patience has been appropriate as it has enabled us to deliver meaningful improvements in our performance, which among other things has resulted in an increased stock price. I do ultimately expect that we will have to issue some equity to exit TARP as that have been the precedent today. You may have noted that Fifth Third highlighted its pro forma Tier 1 common ratio of 9% in its announcement. Several of our other large bank peers are also currently around this level. To the extent that peer review and/or a 9% number are relevant, a more modest capital raise for SunTrust than we've seen in some precedent transactions might be required. There is now a quantitative framework through which TARP repayment is going to be evaluated, and that being the Fed's comprehensive capital plan review. We're certainly supportive over this review process, and it is expected to be completed by late March.
We expect that our 8.4% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio and our reduced risk profile will serve us well in this process. That said, this is obviously a very comprehensive review that the Fed is conducting and we don't have the results yet. Once the review process is complete, we'll be in a better position to re-evaluate our repayment options and the appropriate timing.
Looking forward, we believe SunTrust is well positioned as we enter 2011. Our efforts to drive improved operational execution and client loyalty are yielding results and will remain a priority for us. We're taking advantage of opportunities in our markets, and we'll continue to make investments and teammate engagement, client loyalty and growth in primary relationships, the three areas that we believe drive market share growth and ultimately, high levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders. 
And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Mark for more detail on financial results."
305901,117817153,93741,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2011",2011-01-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with the review of the summary income statement on Slide 7. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.23 per share. This represents a $0.06 inc",2480,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with the review of the summary income statement on Slide 7. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.23 per share. This represents a $0.06 increase from the $0.17 per share that we reported in the third quarter. Results were driven by a decline in the provision due to improved credit quality, as well as stable revenue relative to the strong results that we reported last quarter.
We'll discuss the quarter in more depth on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit a few of the highlights. Net interest income increased 2% or $28 million relative to the third quarter and grew 7% or $89 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by the continued favorable shift in the deposit mix and lower deposit pricing. We also saw a modest increase in loan balances in the quarter. The provision declined $103 million or 17% from the third quarter due to lower net charge-offs and a modest reduction in the allowance. Noninterest income declined sequentially by $5 million or about 1% as Mortgage revenue was lower on the heels of the strong refinance activities that occurred in the third quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher trading income, as well as increases in other market-sensitive revenues.
Noninterest expenses increased $49 million or 3% from the prior quarter due primarily to investments in the business, including technology, marketing and personnel, as well as higher incentive compensation in certain business lines. As we have done in the past, we adjust for several items including securities and mark-to-market gains when presenting our core revenue and expense figures. The total net adjustments this quarter contributed $88 million to pretax earnings. So even excluding these items, we delivered another profitable quarter before and after TARP dividends, consistent with our guidance in December.
For the full year 2010, we reported positive net income before preferred dividends of $189 million and a net loss to common shareholders of $87 million or $0.18 per share. As Jim mentioned, both of these results improved meaningfully compared to 2009, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2009.
Our results for the full year and for the fourth quarter are still not near the levels where we would like them to be. But we are pleased with the progress that we made over the course of 2010, and we believe that we're well positioned as we enter 2011 to realize further improvement in our financial performance. 
With that, let's shift to Slide 8 for a review of loans and deposits. Average loan balances, excluding nonaccruals, were up $1.9 billion or 2% as compared to the third quarter. Growth was driven by higher commercial and consumer loans, which more than offset our continued efforts to manage down the Construction portfolio. Growth within the commercial category was split between large corporate and smaller commercial clients. Within our Corporate and Investment Banking business unit, growth came from higher balances in our asset-backed commercial paper conduit facility, while utilization rates overall remain stable and at relatively low levels. Growth in diversified commercial banking was due to a 2 percentage point pick up in utilization rates. It is too early to declare this increase a trend as it was likely some year-end inventory building that contributed to it, but we were pleased to see higher demand in this area that we are targeting for future loan growth.
Average balance growth within the consumer direct category was largely from the consolidation of an approximate $500 million student loan securitization, which occurred at the end of the third quarter. Consumer indirect growth came primarily from auto loan purchases that occurred during both the third and fourth quarters, including an approximate $900 million portfolio acquisition that we closed in December.
We have been opportunistic with these transactions as we have found them to have attractive return and credit characteristics. Now turning to deposits. We continue to see a favorable shift in the mix towards low-cost accounts. DDA, NOW and Money Market Accounts all increased 5% sequentially. These categories grew a combined $4.3 billion over their average balance levels in the third quarter, while higher cost time deposits declined almost $2 billion. This shift helped drive further expansion on our net interest margin, which I'm going to discuss here in a minute.
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, low-cost deposits grew 10% or $8.5 billion. Concurrently, higher cost, time and wholesale deposit sources declined 25% or about the same amount, $8.4 billion. While we acknowledge that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients holding higher levels of liquidity, we also believe that the growth is the direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our client's banking experience and to drive households and market share growth.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of the securities portfolio. Our total available-for-sale portfolio stood at $26.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down $3.4 billion from the end of the third quarter. In anticipation of higher interest rates, we decreased the investment portfolio's risk profile through the sale of a longer-dated securities and recognize $64 million in securities gains in the process. The sales were primarily an agency mortgage-backed and treasury securities. And going forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk to a further steeping of the yield curve through additional repositioning. Despite the significant increase in rates during the quarter, the unrealized gain in the bond portfolio was approximately $440 million albeit down from $830 million at the end of the third quarter.
Now I'm going to move to margin on Slide 10. The net interest margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up three basis points sequentially to 3.44%. The expansion was once again driven by a lower funding costs, the direct result of our low-cost deposit growth and continued management of our rates paid by product and by market. Relative to the prior year, margin is up 17 basis points, and this improvement was primarily caused by a 38 basis point decline in rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. While earning asset yields were down about 17 basis points due to the low rate environment, our strong focus on loan pricing and our Commercial Loans swap position both help to mitigate the impact of lower rates. We expect the margin as we move into 2011 to remain relatively stable in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, and the risks and opportunities to this view are listed on the slide.
Let's transition now to provision on Slide 11. Tom Freeman will cover credit quality in detail shortly so I'll be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $512 million, down $103 million from the third quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined by $69 million or about 10% in the quarter, but the largest improvement is coming in residential Mortgage and construction. 
Additional credit metrics such as nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early stage delinquencies all declined in the quarter. As such, the allowance was reduced by $112 million, and that reduction combined with loan growth reduced the allowance to loans ratio by 11 basis points. 
Let's move now to noninterest income on Slide 12. On a reported basis, noninterest income was down 1% sequentially but up 39% from the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments can be found in the appendix. And after these adjustments, noninterest income while down 6% sequentially was up 30% from the prior year. 
Now there were three significant swings in our sequential quarter fee income, which you see listed at the bottom of the page, including declines in Mortgage production and servicing and an increase in trading. Note that these items are also reported on an adjusted basis in order to be consistent with the figures presented at the top of the page. 
Adjusted Mortgage production declined about $90 million as rising interest rates resulted in a decline in locked loan volume, as well as reduced production margins. Mortgage servicing declined $64 million as rate volatility during the quarter led to reduced hedge performance and an increase in prepayment activity. Adjusted trading income increased $76 million. Now this was primarily due to the $59 million fair value loss that we recognized in the third quarter on our indexed link CDs and as we discussed last quarter, that was an unusually high loss and it compares to a $5 million gain recognized during the fourth quarter.
Our consumer and commercial fee income categories also generally performed well. And most notably, investment banking income posted another record quarter and eclipsed the $100 million mark for the period. Syndications accounted for an atypically high proportion of the revenue this quarter, as a number of transactions were closed toward the end of the year on robust deal flow. Trust and retail investment income also increased sequentially, while deposit service charges declined due to the full quarter impact of Reg E. Overall, we were pleased that the diversity of our revenue sources enabled us to post strong year-over-year fee growth and solid sequential results amidst lower Mortgage volume and reduced deposit service charges.
Let's now turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of Mortgage repurchase trends. We've altered this slide compared to previous quarters in order to provide you some additional color on this topic. The top left portion shows that the income statement impact of Mortgage repurchases decreased to $85 million in the fourth quarter, down $10 million from the third quarter, while charge-offs increased $9 million as expected. The Mortgage repurchase reserve was reduced modestly, which is consistent with the declines experienced during the quarter, in both the pending demands and new repurchase request volume, which of the topics will shift our attention to next. As depicted in the top right, pending demands declined by $27 million or about 8% to $293 million at the end of the quarter. And I'll come back to the non-agency figures that you see in just a minute.
The bottom left chart depicts repurchase request volume by vintage. In total, repurchase volume was down $30 million in the quarter. The 2006 and 2007 vintages continue to comprise the bulk of the request, though 2007 request were down $26 million sequentially. And as we've indicated previously, new demands can be volatile and are difficult to forecast, but we do expect over time, that normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in request from the 2006 and 2007 vintages. And as that occurs, we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities as newer vintages exhibit more favorable credit characteristics. If we are correct in these assumptions, then we would expect a reduced income statement impact from Mortgage repurchases in 2011 versus what we experienced in 2010. 
Now before covering the final part of this slide, let me discuss our non-agency exposure. As we indicated last quarter, we have about $17 billion in unpaid principal balances on non-agency loans that we originated in 2005 through 2007 and subsequently sold or securitized. As you can see on the slide, we have a modest amount of pending demand on the non-agency products, and we've also been receiving a small amount of repurchase request volume of about $10 million to $15 million in recent quarters. As such, while our losses have not been immaterial, this experience has been factored into our Mortgage repurchase reserve process.
Let me finish up on this slide with a quick explanation of the bottom right box. There's been a lot of talk in the industry recently about lifetime loss estimates. The information presented here may be useful to you in deriving your own estimates for our lifetime losses, as well as our remaining exposure. You can see that we have $114 billion in remaining UPB on loans that we sold between 2005 and 2010. The $17 billion in non-agency loans is included within that figure. You also see depicted on the slide that to date, we have recognized approximately a $1 billion in losses through the income statement, which includes more than $700 million in charge-offs and the current $265 million in reserves for future losses.
With that background, let's shift gears and go to Slide 14 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense was up 3% when compared to the third quarter and 7% versus the prior year. Adjusting for losses on debt extinguishment and write-downs in our affordable housing unit, both of which we've listed in the appendix, the growth rates are 3% and 8%, respectively. The increased expenses in both periods are due to the three drivers that you see at the bottom of the page, employee compensation, outside processing and software and marketing. 
Focusing on the sequential quarter, our adjusted noninterest expense was up $46 million in total, and the increase in these three highlighted drivers was $59 million. Now broadly speaking, the increases relate to investments we've made to drive our business, but I'll provide some additional detail here. 
Employee compensation and benefits was up $29 million due to higher salaries and increased incentive compensation. Salary increases were largely the result of hiring within our technology, Mortgage and client support areas. The incentive compensation increase was driven by the strong full year performance within certain business lines. Outside processing and software increased $17 million due to client acquisition and risk management technology projects, as well as higher transaction volumes. And the marketing and customer development increase of $13 million was due to over investments to grow our business, and we have been very pleased with the results to date.
In the appendix, you will also see detail of our credit related non expenses, which also increased $9 million in the quarter, driven by $13 million in additional other real estate expenses. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we are seeking to balance investments in the business with our expense discipline. Our full year expense growth is reflective of that balance. When you exclude non-core items like the 2009 goodwill impairment, our adjusted noninterest expenses increased about 3% over 2009, whereas revenue grew approximately 5%. And looking to the first quarter of 2011, we do expect an increase in personnel expenses due to the seasonal increase in employee benefits costs. However, we expect declines in other line items to offset this impact such the total noninterest expenses will be flat to down in the quarter. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality."

I'll begin today's review of our asset quality on Slide 15. As you heard from Mark and Jim, the overall theme of our credit message this morning is that asset quality continue to improve during the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs, provisi",1904,"Thank you, Mark. I'll begin today's review of our asset quality on Slide 15. As you heard from Mark and Jim, the overall theme of our credit message this morning is that asset quality continue to improve during the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs, provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all decreased. In fact, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, every key credit quality metric on the slide improved for the second quarter in a row. Net charge-offs declined 10% from the third quarter to $621 million, and the corresponding annualized charge-off rate declined to 2.14%. Provision expense declined primarily as a result of lower charge-offs, driven by improving credit quality. As a result of current quarter asset quality trends and an outlook for continued improvement, the Allowance for Loan Losses was reduced by a $112 million. This compares to a $70 million reduction in reserves in the third quarter.
The allowance to loan ratio ended the quarter at a healthy 2.58% of loans. Loan loss reserves declined on both an absolute and a relative basis for three reasons: First, as Mark noted earlier, high-risk portfolio balances continue to decline; second, charge-offs associated with some of these higher risk portfolios such as construction absorbed some of the reserves; third, emerging risk moderated.
The loan production that replaces run off and is generating net portfolio growth is higher-quality commercial and consumer loans and federally guaranteed student Mortgage loans. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined during the quarter by $263 million and $300 million, respectively or by 6%. This is the six consecutive quarter of decline in nonperforming loans. 
Ongoing resolution of problem assets continue to drive declines in nonperforming loans. In addition, owned real estate assets are moderating as we continue to aggressively dispose of the properties once we have a clear title. As a result, on real estate plus other repossessed assets have remained consistently low as a percentage of declining NPAs. A key leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans is 30 to 89 day delinquencies. These early-stage delinquencies declined again during the quarter to 90 basis points after excluding government-guaranteed student loans and voluntary GNMA Mortgage purchases. This leading indicator of future asset quality has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2009. During this time, the economy and employment conditions have improved somewhat, but remained sluggish overall. As a result, we don't expect significant further improvement in early-stage delinquencies until economic conditions improve.
Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of asset quality by product. This slide provides net charge-offs and early-stage delinquency metrics by loan type. It illustrates at a more granular level our overall asset quality has improved and that asset quality issues remained concentrated in the Residential Real Estate and Construction portfolios. More specific takeaways from this slide are that while total portfolio balances increased over $900 million, a higher risk Residential and Construction portfolios declined by nearly $1.3 billion. 
Charge-offs remain stable in most portfolios, declined meaningfully in Mortgage and Construction and increased modestly in Commercial. Overall, early-stage delinquency was broadly stable to down among the portfolios. 
Now let's focus on the individual portfolios beginning with Commercial. This portfolio continues to perform well. Balances grew. Net charge-offs increased somewhat, and early-stage delinquencies remain very low. We do not believe that the $29 million increase in commercial charge-offs is indicative of the trend, and it was accompanied by a 20% increase in Commercial nonaccrual loans.
Charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio were stable compared to last quarter's 1% of loans on an annualized basis. Early-stage delinquency declined significantly, and then level of nonaccrual loans increased somewhat. The current Commercial Real Estate correction continues, and we expect some variability in the performances as this cycle plays out.
However, as I've said many times during these calls, we continue to believe this portfolio will perform comparatively well, given this composition. To date, our performance expectations have been met. On an absolute basis, the bulk of our charge-offs continue to come from Residential Mortgage, Home Equity and Construction portfolios. Combined these three portfolio produced slightly over 70% of our fourth quarter net losses. However, these portfolios are also driving the sequential quarterly improvement in net charge-offs. 
Net losses in these portfolios decline nearly $100 million compared to last quarter. But the majority of the improvement coming from Residential mortgages. Quarterly variability and construction losses is to be expected as we continue to work through the remaining risk in this portfolio. Charge-off trends in consumer, Mortgage and Home Equity tend to be less variable from quarter-to-quarter and on the product of declining delinquencies in stabilizing home values. 
Asset quality in the consumer portfolios was basically stable. Charge-off ratios in the direct and indirect portfolios remained roughly 60 basis points on an annualized basis and declined to less than 6% in our small credit card book. Early-stage delinquencies were flat compared to last quarter in all but the student loan portfolio. While delinquencies in the student loan portion of the direct portfolio increased to 8.3%. This portfolio consists predominantly of lower risk, government-guaranteed loans, which is evident in the charge-off ratio of less than 50 basis points.
Next I'm going to briefly talk about the higher risk Residential Mortgage, Home Equity and Construction portfolios, which are detailed on the next few slides. These portfolios have generally exhibited declining balances and stable to improving risk over the course of 2010, and their performance in the fourth quarter was no different. My comments are going to be brief because we have provided these details in each quarter throughout the cycle and are fundamentally less to say at this point. I will take the opportunity, however, to point out some key changes over time. 
Please turn to Slide 17 in our Residential Mortgage portfolio. Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio remains stable during the fourth quarter. As mentioned a moment ago, charge-offs declined meaningfully. On this slide, you can see that balances in nonperforming loans trended down within each of the Mortgage portfolios, most notably within the higher risk segments. Early-stage delinquencies increased marginally, and we believe seasonally in most Mortgage portfolio segments.
Our outlook for the Residential Mortgage portfolio remains consistent with the view we expressed last quarter. Past delinquency trends suggest reduced frequency of default over the next couple of quarters. We expect home prices to remain soft overall trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in others. We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to declining nonperforming loan and charge-off levels over the near term.
While this perspective would be on the next quarter or two, it's important to note that the material improvement in the risk profile of this portfolio over the last three years. The total portfolio has declined $1.2 billion or less than 4% over the last three years. However, the highest risk elements in the portfolio, Alt-A seconds through prime seconds on the slide have been managed down by over $5 billion or 50% since the end of 2007. Net growth in the core portfolio of $3.6 billion during this time has been in the form of mortgages guaranteed by the federal government.
At year-end 2010, $3.8 billion or nearly 15% of the core Mortgage portfolio was backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA. Including voluntary GNMA Mortgage repurchases, federally guaranteed mortgages totaled $4.5 billion. 
Moving to Slide 18 in Home Equity lines of credit. The Home Equity portfolio asset quality was basically stable, while higher risk balances continue to decline. Charge-offs increased by $4 million and the net charge-off ratio rose modestly to 3.39%. Roughly half of the increase in new ratio was driven by higher net charge-offs, while the other half was attributable to lower portfolio balances. Declines in early exchange delinquency were concentrated in the higher risk portfolios.
Balances in this portfolio have declined roughly 9% over the last two years and are flat compared to three years ago. Run-off has been concentrated in the higher risk portfolios where no new production has occurred and little or no line availability exists. 
Now if you will turn to Slide 19, I will talk about our Construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce exposure to high-risk construction, with balances dropping another 13% during the fourth quarter. Charge-offs declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. However, charge-offs were expected to remain elevated and uneven as we work through the remainder of the risk in this portfolio.
As you can see on the slide, residential regulated construction has been the most problematic, with 80% of the nonperforming loan comprised of construction deferred, residential construction and land loans. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased for the third straight quarter. While there may be some variability, we generally expect this trend of declining nonperforming loans to continue as we aggressively pursue workouts and transition foreclosed assets to other real estate owned and ultimately disposition.
The Construction portfolio also warrants a little historic perspective. Balances of $3.8 billion are down nearly $10 billion or 72% since the end of 2007. This reduction in outstanding balances was accomplished with $1.1 billion of cumulative charge-offs over the three-year period. With 29% of the remaining portfolio in nonperforming status and appropriate reserve, we believe we are well positioned to manage the remaining risk in this portfolio.
Next I'm going to review the portfolio of restructured loans on Slide 20 of today's presentation. The vast majority of SunTrust restructured loans continue to be loans that were modified to assist individual consumers experiencing financial difficulty. 97% of our accruing loan modifications benefit customers by reducing interest rates and exempting terms on mortgage and consumer loans. The payment performance of these accruing restructured loans continues to be good with 86% current on principal and interest savings.
Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up approximately $100 million from the third quarter. Growth in accruing TDRs slowed again in the current quarter as the volume of nearly delinquent loans eligible for restructure continue to decline. The balance of non-accruing TDR remain basically unchanged compared to the third quarter. 2/3 of the nonaccruing balances are restructured Mortgage and consumer loans. The majority of SunTrust modifications on loans to business entities are classified as nonaccrual. At the end of the fourth quarter, roughly 1/3 of nonaccruing TDRs were loans to business clients. Of those, $213 million were loans to the commercial real estate line of business clients. 
Before turning the call back to Chris, I'm going to provide a brief summary of today's asset quality review on Slide 21. Overall, improvement in asset quality continued in the fourth quarter. Improvements in asset quality metrics was broad-based. Provision expense charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early stage delinquencies all declined.
Individual portfolios showed generally stable to improving trends. Risk remains concentrated from the Residential Real Estate and Construction Portfolios. Balances and charge-offs in these higher risk portfolios were stable to declining during the fourth quarter. Accruing TDRs are primarily related to Mortgage and consumer loans. Solid payment performance continued and the pace of new modifications has slowed. Our asset quality outlook for the first quarter of 2011 is for a modest decline in charge-offs and nonperforming loans as compared to the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Chris."

He has accepted the position of Chief Retail Credit Officer in our Corporate Risk group. And I want to thank Steve for great work over the past few years. 
And before discussing the fourth quarter, I would like to take a moment to share a few accomplishments of SunTrust in 2010, as we finish the year on a much more positive note than it began. A few examples. We returned to profitability during the year and posted a full year profit before preferred dividends. Our low-cost deposits grew 10% over the course of the year and demonstrating our success in increasing client loyalty and growing market share. Revenue expanded and benefited from a 17 basis point expansion in the net interest margin, as well as from solid performance from several of our key businesses. Credit quality improved throughout the year with quarterly declines in net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonperforming loans. And our capital ratios remains strong and even expanded.
Returning to the fourth quarter, our earnings of $114 million or $0.23 per share improved compared to last year, as well as last quarter, mostly driven by a lower provision, with the result of improved credit quality and solid revenue. We're pleased with the diversity of our revenue sources and continued to improvement in credit quality. Net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined compared to the third quarter and are significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2009.
While our financial performance is still not to the level that we or our shareholders desire, we did make additional progress in demonstrating improved results and in executing our strategies to drive  longer-term growth. The operating environment unquestionably remains challenging, and obviously, it's been an active period from a regulatory and legislative standpoint. 
So let's turn to Slide 4. As we've said previously, financial regulation will impact our financial results going forward. Some new proposals were issued during the quarter, and the effects of certain aspects of regulatory reform are becoming clearer. This slide highlights selected items of interest, though it's not intended to be all-inclusive. Our guidance regarding deposit  service charges, Reg E issues and derivatives remains unchanged and outlined in the chart. It appears the Fed certainly followed the letter of the Dodd-Frank law, with its recent proposal on debit interchange. Like most in the industry, we are very concerned about any government efforts to impose price controls. And we additionally believe the Fed's proposal does not adequately recognize many of the costs associated with providing debit card services. We, of course, have been actively working to make our views known to the regulators as well as to Congress.
The regulation is still in the comment period, and we're hopeful that any final regulation takes into account a less narrow interpretation of costs that would include at a minimum fraud losses, fraud prevention costs and servicing costs associated with operating a debit card business. Should the proposed rules be enacted, then we obviously expect a material impact to this revenue stream beginning in the second half of 2011. I would note that the approximately 75% revenue estimate does not take into account actions that we are pursuing to help mitigate this decline.
Turning to the current deposit insurance proposal. The calculation will be based on net assets not on deposits, which will obviously raise our assessment base.  That said, the calculation will also become more complex and sensitive to a variety of trailing trends and factors, such as credit concentrations, risks and earnings. If the proposal is adopted as it is today, we expect that over time, the higher assessment base will be partially mitigated as improving operating trends are reflected in the calculation.
While all of this may lead to some volatility in our quarterly expenses, we do not expect a significant increase in our 2011 expense base. With respect to capital as we disclosed last quarter, our Tier 1 common ratio is in excess of 8%, currently above the 2019 Basel III 7% requirement. Based upon our understanding of the Basel III calculation, we expect a modest benefit to our Tier 1 common ratio, which I'll cover shortly. And lastly, we currently expect about 170 basis points impact to our Tier 1 capital ratio over a three-year period, beginning in 2013 from the Collins amendment. 
Let's take a minute and look at capital on Slide 5. Our regulatory capital ratios increased again this quarter as they have in previous quarters as highlighted on the slide. Estimated Tier 1 common increased to a healthy 8.08%. The tangible common equity ratio and book values per share declined modestly due to declines in unrealized gains from rising rates during the quarter.
But before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment to offer some context on Basel III, Slide 6. The bottom line is that our Tier 1 common ratio today already exceeds the Basel III standard that will not be effective until 2019. Our Tier 1 common ratio increases approximately 30 basis points under the Basel III calculation to 8.4% or about $1.9 billion more than the 7% standard. 
As you know, the Basel III framework is one of the lenses through which the Federal Reserve will be revaluating [ph] bank's capital plans submitted as part of the comprehensive capital plan review process. SunTrust submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early January as requested. Given that the Federal Reserve's review of that plan is still in process and that it is a confidential regulatory exam, we won't be providing any specifics contained in the plan today.
I will, however, offer a few high-level thoughts on prioritization of future capital actions. As we have said, we have been and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support the future growth opportunities and to be consistent with our responsibilities to shareholders. We plan to continue making these investments in order to grow the business. And at the same time, we also recognize the value of returning capital to shareholders. And in that regard, our priorities are repaying TARP and in due time after that, increasing the common dividend.
I'll now take a moment to comment on TARP. Our repayment strategy has been very deliberate, and it has had the best interest of our shareholders in mind. We believe our patience has been appropriate as it has enabled us to deliver meaningful improvements in our performance, which among other things has resulted in an increased stock price. I do ultimately expect that we will have to issue some equity to exit TARP as that has been the precedent today. You may have noted that Fifth Third highlighted its pro forma Tier 1 common ratio of 9% in its announcement. Several of our other large bank peers are also currently around this level. To the extent that peer review and/or a 9% number are relevant, a more modest capital raise for SunTrust than we've seen in some precedent transactions might be required. There is now a quantitative framework through which TARP repayment is going to be evaluated, and that being the Fed's comprehensive capital plan review. We're certainly supportive of this review process, and it is expected to be completed by late March.
We expect that our 8.4% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio and our reduced risk profile will serve us well in this process. That said, this is obviously a very comprehensive review that the Fed is conducting, and we don't have the results as yet. Once the review process is complete, we'll be in a better position to re-evaluate our repayment options and the appropriate timing.
Looking forward, we believe SunTrust is well positioned as we enter 2011. Our efforts to drive improved operational execution and client loyalty are yielding results and will remain a priority for us. We're taking advantage of opportunities in our markets and will continue to make investments in teammate engagement, client loyalty and growth in primary relationships, the three areas that we believe drive market share growth and ultimately, higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders. 
And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Mark for more detail on financial results."

I'll begin my comments today with a review of the summary income statement on Slide 7. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.23 per share. This represents a $0.06 incre",2475,"Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with a review of the summary income statement on Slide 7. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.23 per share. This represents a $0.06 increase from the $0.17 per share that we reported in the third quarter. Results were driven by a decline in the provision due to improved credit quality, as well as stable revenue relative to the strong results that we reported last quarter.
We'll discuss the quarter in more depth on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit a few of the highlights. Net interest income increased 2% or $28 million relative to the third quarter and grew 7% or $89 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by the continued favorable shift in the deposit mix and lower deposit pricing. We also saw a modest increase in loan balances in the quarter. The provision declined $103 million or 17% from the third quarter due to lower net charge-offs and a modest reduction in the allowance. Noninterest income declined sequentially by $5 million or about 1% as mortgage revenue was lower on the heels of the strong refinance activities that occurred in the third quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher trading income, as well as increases in other market-sensitive revenues.
Noninterest expenses increased $49 million or 3% from the prior quarter due primarily to investments in the business, including technology, marketing and personnel, as well as higher incentive compensation in certain business lines. As we have done in the past, we adjust for several items, including securities and mark-to-market gains, when presenting our core revenue and expense figures. The total net adjustments this quarter contributed $88 million to pretax earnings. So even excluding these items, we delivered another profitable quarter before and after TARP dividends, consistent with our guidance in December.
For the full year 2010, we reported positive net income before preferred dividends of $189 million and a net loss to common shareholders of $87 million or $0.18 per share. As Jim mentioned, both of these results improved meaningfully compared to 2009, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2009.
Our results for the full year and for the fourth quarter are still not near the levels where we would like them to be. But we are pleased with the progress that we made over the course of 2010, and we believe that we're well positioned as we enter 2011 to realize further improvement in our financial performance. 
With that, let's shift to Slide 8 for a review of loans and deposits. Average loan balances, excluding nonaccruals, were up $1.9 billion or 2% as compared to the third quarter. Growth was driven by higher commercial and consumer loans, which more than offset our continued efforts to manage down the Construction portfolio. Growth within the commercial category was split between large corporate and smaller commercial clients. Within our Corporate and Investment Banking business unit, growth came from higher balances in our asset-backed commercial paper conduit facility, while utilization rates overall remained stable and at relatively low levels. Growth in diversified commercial banking was due to a 2 percentage point pick-up in utilization rates. It is too early to declare this increase a trend as there was likely some year-end inventory building that contributed to it, but we were pleased to see higher demand in this area that we are targeting for future loan growth.
Average balance growth within the consumer direct category was largely from the consolidation of an approximate $500 million student loan securitization, which occurred at the end of the third quarter. Consumer indirect growth came primarily from auto loan purchases that occurred during both the third and fourth quarters, including an approximate $900 million portfolio acquisition that we closed in December.  We have been opportunistic with these transactions as we have found them to have attractive return and credit characteristics. 
Now turning to deposits. We continued to see a favorable shift in the mix towards low-cost accounts. DDA, NOW and Money Market Accounts all increased 5% sequentially. These categories grew a combined $4.3 billion over their average balance levels in the third quarter, while higher cost time deposits declined almost $2 billion. This shift helped drive further expansion on our net interest margin, which I'm going to discuss here in a minute.
Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, low-cost deposits grew 10% or $8.5 billion. Concurrently, higher cost, time and wholesale deposit sources declined 25% or about the same amount, $8.4 billion. While we acknowledge that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients holding higher levels of liquidity, we also believe that the growth is the direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our clients' banking experience and to drive households and market share growth.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of the Securities portfolio. Our total available-for-sale portfolio stood at $26.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down $3.4 billion from the end of the third quarter. In anticipation of higher interest rates, we decreased the investment portfolio's risk profile through the sale of longer-dated securities and recognized $64 million in securities gains in the process. The sales were primarily in agency mortgage-backed and treasury securities. And going forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk to a further steepening of the yield curve through additional repositioning. Despite the significant increase in rates during the quarter, the unrealized gain in the bond portfolio was approximately $440 million, albeit down from $830 million at the end of the third quarter.
Now I'm going to move to margin on Slide 10. The net interest margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up three basis points sequentially to 3.44%. The expansion was once again driven by  lower funding costs, the direct result of our low-cost deposit growth and continued management of our rates paid by product and by market. Relative to the prior year, margin is up 17 basis points, and this improvement was primarily caused by a 38 basis point decline in rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. While earning asset yields were down about 17 basis points due to the low rate environment, our strong focus on loan pricing and our commercial loans swap position both help to mitigate the impact of lower rates. We expect the margin as we move into 2011 to remain relatively stable in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, and the risks and opportunities to this view are listed on the slide.
Let's transition now to provision on Slide 11. Tom Freeman will cover credit quality in detail shortly so I'll be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $512 million, down $103 million from the third quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined by $69 million or about 10% in the quarter, with the largest improvements coming in residential mortgage and construction. 
Additional credit metrics such as nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined in the quarter. As such, the allowance was reduced by $112 million, and that reduction combined with loan growth reduced the allowance-to-loans ratio by 11 basis points. 
Let's move now to noninterest income on Slide 12. On a reported basis, noninterest income was down 1% sequentially but up 39% from the prior year. And as I mentioned earlier, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments can be found in the appendix. And after these adjustments, noninterest income, while down 6% sequentially, was up 30% from the prior year. 
Now there were three significant swings in our sequential quarter fee income, which you see listed at the bottom of the page, including declines in mortgage production and servicing and an increase in trading. Note that these items are also reported on an adjusted basis in order to be consistent with the figures presented at the top of the page. 
Adjusted mortgage production declined about $90 million as rising interest rates resulted in a decline in locked loan volume, as well as reduced production margins. Mortgage servicing declined $64 million as rate volatility during the quarter led to reduced hedge performance and an increase in prepayment activity. Adjusted trading income increased $76 million. Now this was primarily due to the $59 million fair value loss that we recognized in the third quarter on our indexed link CDs.  And as we discussed last quarter, that was an unusually high loss, and it compares to a $5 million gain recognized during the fourth quarter.
Our consumer and commercial fee income categories also generally performed well. And most notably, investment banking income posted another record quarter and eclipsed the $100 million mark for the period. Syndications accounted for an atypically high proportion of the revenue this quarter, as a number of transactions were closed toward the end of the year on robust deal flow. Trust and retail investment income also increased sequentially, while deposit service charges declined due to the full quarter impact of Reg E. Overall, we were pleased that the diversity of our revenue sources enabled us to post strong year-over-year fee growth and solid sequential results amidst lower mortgage volume and reduced deposit service charges.
Let's now turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. We have altered this slide compared to previous quarters in order to provide you some additional color on this topic. The top left portion shows that the income statement impact of mortgage repurchases decreased to $85 million in the fourth quarter, down $10 million from the third quarter, while charge-offs increased $9 million as expected. The mortgage repurchase reserve was reduced modestly, which is consistent with the declines experienced during the quarter in both the pending demands and new repurchase request volume, which are the topics we'll shift our attention to next. As depicted in the top right, pending demands declined by $27 million or about 8% to $293 million at the end of the quarter. And I'll come back to the non-agency figures that you see in just a minute.
The bottom left chart depicts repurchase request volume by vintage. In total, repurchase volume was down $30 million in the quarter. The 2006 and 2007 vintages continue to comprise the bulk of the requests, though 2007 requests were down $26 million sequentially. And as we've indicated previously, new demands can be volatile and are difficult to forecast, but we do expect over time that normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in requests from the 2006 and 2007 vintages. And as that occurs, we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities as newer vintages exhibit more favorable credit characteristics. If we are correct in these assumptions, then we would expect a reduced income statement impact from mortgage repurchases in 2011 versus what we experienced in 2010. 
Now before covering the final part of this slide, let me discuss our non-agency exposure. As we indicated last quarter, we have about $17 billion in unpaid principal balances on non-agency loans that we originated in 2005 through 2007 and subsequently sold or securitized. As you can see on the slide, we have a modest amount of pending demand on the non-agency products, and we've also been receiving a small amount of repurchase request volume of about $10 million to $15 million in recent quarters. As such, while our losses have not been material, this experience has been factored into our mortgage repurchase reserve process.
Let me finish up on this slide with a quick explanation of the bottom right box. There's been a lot of talk in the industry recently about lifetime loss estimates. The information presented here may be useful to you in deriving your own estimates for our lifetime losses, as well as our remaining exposure. You can see that we have $114 billion in remaining UPB on loans that we sold between 2005 and 2010. The $17 billion in non-agency loans is included within that figure. You also see depicted on the slide that to date, we have recognized approximately a $1 billion in losses through the income statement, which includes more than $700 million in charge-offs and the current $265 million in reserves for future losses.
With that background, let's shift gears and go to Slide 14 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense was up 3% when compared to the third quarter and 7% versus the prior year. Adjusting for losses on debt extinguishment and write-downs in our affordable housing unit, both of which we've listed in the appendix, the growth rates are 3% and 8%, respectively. The increased expenses in both periods are due to the three drivers that you see at the bottom of the page: employee compensation, outside processing and software and marketing. 
Focusing on the sequential quarter, our adjusted noninterest expense was up $46 million in total, and the increase in these three highlighted drivers was $59 million. Now broadly speaking, the increases relate to investments that we've made to drive our business, but I'll provide some additional detail here. 
Employee compensation and benefits was up $29 million due to higher salaries and increased incentive compensation. Salary increases were largely the result of hiring within our technology, mortgage and client support areas. The incentive compensation increase was driven by the strong full year performance within certain business lines. Outside processing and software increased $17 million due to client acquisition and risk management technology projects, as well as higher transaction volumes. And the marketing and customer development increase of $13 million was due to overt investments to grow our business, and we have been very pleased with the results to date.
In the appendix, you will also see detail of our credit-related noninterest expenses, which also increased $9 million in the quarter, driven by $13 million in additional other real estate expenses. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we are seeking to balance investments in the business with our expense discipline. Our full year expense growth is reflective of that balance. When you exclude non-core items like the 2009 goodwill impairment, our adjusted noninterest expenses increased about 3% over 2009, whereas revenue grew approximately 5%. And looking to the first quarter of 2011, we do expect an increase in personnel expenses due to the seasonal increase in employee benefits costs. However, we expect declines in other line items to offset this impact, such that total noninterest expenses will be flat to down in the quarter. 
And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality."

Net charge-offs, provis",1885,"Thank you, Mark. I'll begin today's review of our asset quality on Slide 15. As you heard from Mark and Jim, the overall theme of our credit message this morning is that asset quality continued to improve during the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs, provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all decreased. In fact, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, every key credit quality metric on the slide improved for the second quarter in a row. Net charge-offs declined 10% from the third quarter to $621 million, and the corresponding annualized charge-off rate declined to 2.14%. Provision expense declined primarily as a result of lower charge-offs, driven by improving credit quality. As a result of current quarter asset quality trends and an outlook for continued improvement, the allowance for loan losses was reduced by a $112 million. This compares to a $70 million reduction in reserves in the third quarter.
The allowance-to-loan ratio ended the quarter at a healthy 2.58% of loans. Loan loss reserves declined on both an absolute and a relative basis for three reasons: First, as Mark noted earlier, high-risk portfolio balances continued to decline; second, charge-offs associated with some of these higher risk portfolios, such as construction, absorbed some of the reserves; third, emerging risk moderated.
The loan production that replaced this run-off and is generating net portfolio growth is higher-quality commercial and consumer loans and federally guaranteed student mortgage loans. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined during the quarter by $263 million and $300 million, respectively or by 6%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of declining nonperforming loans. 
Ongoing resolution of problem assets continued to drive declines in nonperforming loans. In addition, owned real estate assets are moderating as we continue to aggressively dispose of properties once we have clear title. As a result, owned real estate plus other repossessed assets has remained consistently low as a percentage of declining NPAs. A key leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, is 30-to-89-day delinquencies. These early-stage delinquencies declined again during the quarter to 90 basis points after excluding government-guaranteed student loans and voluntary Ginnie Mae mortgage purchases. This leading indicator of future asset quality has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2009. During this time, the economy and employment conditions have improved somewhat, but remained sluggish overall. As a result, we don't expect significant further improvement in early-stage delinquencies until economic conditions improve.
Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of asset quality by product. This slide provides net charge-off and early-stage delinquency metrics by loan type. It illustrates at a more granular level where overall asset quality has improved and that asset quality issues remained concentrated in the Residential Real Estate and Construction portfolios. More specific takeaways from this slide are that while total portfolio balances increased over $900 million, the higher risk Residential and Construction portfolios declined by nearly $1.3 billion. 
Charge-offs remained stable in most portfolios, declined meaningfully in Mortgage and Construction and increased modestly in Commercial. Overall, early-stage delinquency was broadly stable to down among the portfolios. 
Now let's focus on the individual portfolios beginning with Commercial. This portfolio continues to perform well. Balances grew. Net charge-offs increased somewhat, and early-stage delinquencies remained very low. We do not believe that the $29 million increase in commercial charge-offs is indicative of a trend, and it was accompanied by a 20% increase in commercial nonaccrual loans.
Charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio were stable compared to last quarter's 1% of loans on an annualized basis. Early-stage delinquency declined significantly, and the level of nonaccrual loans increased somewhat. The current commercial real estate correction continues, and we expect some variability in the performance as this cycle plays out.
However, as I've said many times during these calls, we continue to believe this portfolio will perform comparatively well, given its composition. To date, our performance expectations have been met. On an absolute basis, the bulk of our charge-offs continue to come from Residential Mortgage, Home Equity and Construction portfolios. Combined, these three portfolio produced slightly over 70% of our fourth quarter net losses. However, these portfolios are also driving the sequential quarterly improvement in net charge-offs. 
Net losses in these portfolios declined nearly $100 million compared to last quarter, with the majority of the improvement coming from residential mortgages. Quarterly variability in construction losses is to be expected as we continue to work through the remaining risk in this run-off portfolio. Charge-off trends in Consumer, Mortgage and Home Equity tend to be less variable from quarter-to-quarter and are the product of declining delinquencies and stabilizing home values. 
Asset quality in the Consumer portfolios was basically stable. Charge-off ratios in the Direct and the Indirect portfolios remained roughly 60 basis points on an annualized basis and declined to less than 6% in our small credit card book. Early-stage delinquencies were flat compared to last quarter in all but the Student Loan portfolio. While delinquencies in the student loan portion of the Direct portfolio increased to 8.3%, this portfolio consists predominantly of lower-risk, government-guaranteed loans, which is evident in the charge-off ratio of less than 50 basis points.
Next, I'm going to briefly talk about the higher-risk Residential Mortgage, Home Equity and Construction portfolios, which are detailed on the next few slides. These portfolios have generally exhibited declining balances and stable-to-improving risk over the course of 2010, and their performance in the fourth quarter was no different. My comments are going to be brief because we have provided these detailed views in each quarter throughout the cycle and are fundamentally less to say at this point. I will take the opportunity, however, to point out some key changes over time. 
Please turn to Slide 17 in our Residential Mortgage portfolio. Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio remained stable during the fourth quarter. As mentioned a moment ago, charge-offs declined meaningfully. On this slide, you can see that balances in nonperforming loans trended down within each of the Mortgage portfolios, most notably within the higher-risk segments. Early-stage delinquencies increased marginally, and we believe seasonally, in most Mortgage portfolio segments.
Our outlook for the Residential Mortgage portfolio remains consistent with the view we expressed last quarter. Past delinquency trends suggest reduced frequency of default over the next couple of quarters. We expect home prices to remain soft overall, trending down in some markets and stable-to-modestly up in others. We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable-to-declining nonperforming loan and charge-off levels over the near term.
While [ph] this perspective be on the next quarter or two, it is important to note that the material improvement in the risk profile of this portfolio over the last three years. The total portfolio has declined $1.2 billion or less than 4% over the last three years. However, the highest risk elements in the portfolio, Alt-A seconds through prime seconds on the slide, have been managed down by over $5 billion or 50% since the end of 2007. Net growth in the core portfolio of $3.6 billion during this time has been in the form of mortgages guaranteed by the federal government.
At year-end 2010, $3.8 billion or nearly 15% of the core Mortgage portfolio was backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA. Including voluntary Ginnie Mae mortgage repurchases, federally guaranteed mortgages totaled $4.5 billion. 
Moving to Slide 18 in home equity lines of credit. The Home Equity portfolio asset quality was basically stable, while higher-risk balances continued to decline. Charge-offs increased by $4 million and the net charge-off ratio rose modestly to 3.39%. Roughly half of the increase in the ratio was driven by higher net charge-offs, while the other half was attributable to lower portfolio balances. Declines in early-stage delinquency were concentrated in the higher-risk portfolios.
Balances in this portfolio have declined roughly 9% over the last two years and are flat compared to three years ago. Run-off has been concentrated in the higher-risk portfolios where no new production has occurred and little or no line availability exists. 
Now if you will turn to Slide 19, I will talk about our Construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce exposure to higher-risk construction loan [ph], with balances dropping another 13% during the fourth quarter. Charge-offs declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. However, charge-offs are expected to remain elevated and uneven as we work through the remainder of the risk in this portfolio.
As you can see on the slide, residential-related construction has been the most problematic, with 80% of the nonperforming loan comprised of construction-to-perm, residential construction and land loans. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased for the third straight quarter. While there may be some variability, we generally expect this trend of declining nonperforming loans to continue as we aggressively pursue workouts and transition foreclosed assets to other real estate owned and ultimately disposition.
The Construction portfolio also warrants a little historic perspective. Balances of $3.8 billion are down nearly $10 billion or 72% since the end of 2007. This reduction in outstanding balances was accomplished with $1.1 billion of cumulative charge-offs over the three-year period. With 29% of the remaining portfolio in nonperforming status and appropriately reserved, we believe we are well positioned to manage the remaining risk in this portfolio.
Next I'm going to review the portfolio of restructured loans in Slide 20 of today's presentation. The vast majority of SunTrust restructured loans continue to be loans that were modified to assist individual consumers experiencing financial difficulty. 97% of our accruing loan modifications benefit customers by reducing interest rates and exempting terms on mortgage and consumer loans. The payment performance of these accruing restructured loans continues to be good, with 86% current on principal and interest savings.
Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up approximately $100 million from the third quarter. Growth in accruing TDRs slowed again in the current quarter as the volume of nearly delinquent loans eligible for restructure continue to decline. The balance of nonaccruing TDR remained basically unchanged compared to the third quarter. Two-thirds of the nonaccruing balances are restructured mortgage and consumer loans. The majority of SunTrust modifications on loans to business entities are classified as nonaccrual. At the end of the fourth quarter, roughly 1/3 of nonaccruing TDRs were loans to business clients. Of those, $213 million were loans to the commercial real estate line of business clients. 
Before turning the call back to Kris, I'm going to provide a brief summary of today's asset quality review on Slide 21. Overall, improvement in asset quality continued in the fourth quarter. Improvements in asset quality metrics was broad-based. Provision expense charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined.
Individual portfolios showed generally stable-to-improving trends. Risk remains concentrated in the Residential Real Estate and Construction Portfolios. Balances and charge-offs in these higher-risk portfolios were stable to declining during the fourth quarter. Accruing TDRs are primarily related to mortgage and consumer loans. Solid payment performance continued, and the pace of new modifications has slowed. Our asset quality outlook for the first quarter of 2011 is for a modest decline in charge-offs and nonperforming loans as compared to the fourth quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kris."

Now at the same time, I'm also very proud of how our company has responded to the adversity to recent past, and particularly Jim, under your leadership. Thank you for your support. Thank you for leading by example. The impact of your contributions to this company over 43 years will be felt for a very long time to come. I also appreciate the courage, patience and strength of character you've shown and a possibly no time greater than you demonstrated during, what I'll refer to as the TARP era. And leading up to our recent repurchase of the government shares. So thank you.
Now before we get into the financial results, I'd like to spend a moment on Slide 3 discussing our redemption timeshares which occurred at the end of the quarter. In mid-March upon the completion of the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan submitted in connection with the CCAR, we took actions to facilitate the redemption of TARP shares. 
First, we conducted a successful $1 billion common stock offering. It was well received by the market as evidenced by the pricing and oversubscription. Further had a follow-up premium of 4.4% which is the number that we were clearly quite pleased with. We follow that with $1 billion senior debt offering which also went very well. It priced through our rating with attractive spread of just 160 basis points over the five-year treasury yield. And on March 30, we redeemed the $4.85 billion of preferred shares that were issued to the U.S. Treasury at the time. Our common stock issuance in connection with the redemption of those shares was just 21% of the total TARP outstanding, which we believe is well below the amount it would have been had we redeemed the shares earlier. By keeping shareholders best interest in mind and demonstrating a patient, deliberate approach to TARP redemption, we successfully lessened the dilutive impact to our shareholders. And on balance, we're pleased with how this all concluded. 
Now let's take a look at Slide 4 at the impact this transaction and repayment had on our capital position.
With the issuance of the common equity and the redemption of the TARP preferred securities, our capital position was significantly enhanced this quarter. The Tier 1 Common equity ratio increased 92 basis points to an estimated 9%. And the Tier 1 Capital ratio, excluding TARP, was up 98 basis points to an estimated 11%. Our capital position is well above current regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed Basel III regulatory standards. Now the TARP shares have been redeemed, I'll reiterate our future capital plans. As we've said, we have been investing and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support future growth. At the same time, we also recognized the value of returning capital to shareholders and that regard, in due time, we plan to increase the common dividend. We expect that our board will evaluate this decision in the latter part of this year, and if our financial results and the economy continue on a positive flightpath, the board would be in a position to consider a modest increase.
Now moving on to Slide 5. I'll provide review of our financial results. As you saw, we reported $0.08 per share or $0.22 when excluding the noncash charge from our TARP redemption. Further improvement in credit quality, expansion of the net interest margin and a reduction in expenses drove earnings that were even with the prior quarter when you exclude the TARP charge. As we emphasized profitable growth and credit quality continued to improve, we delivered solid performance that was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We also made additional progress in executing our strategies to drive longer-term growth. I'll spend a moment highlighting some of the key drivers this quarter and then Mark will provide some more detail.
Client deposit growth continued this positive trajectory reaching record a high this quarter, a positive mix shift continued as well with lower cost deposit increases more than offsetting the decline in higher cost deposits. Overall, average loan balance increased only modestly. However, an important part of the story is the continued run-up at higher risk loans which were down significantly this quarter. They were offset with increases in targeted, lower risk loan categories.
We had another quarter of strong net interest margin growth. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen expansion. The income declined as anticipated to due to some seasonal aspects and lower refinanced phase mortgage originations. The Expense story is a good one compared with the prior quarter. Despite seasonally higher employee benefit expenses, we managed expenses down 5% from the prior quarter. And finally, improvements to credit quality continued as nonperforming loans and assets, early stage delinquencies, net charge-offs and the provision for loan losses all declined during the quarter.
So we continued to navigate through a challenging operating environment, we're pleased with a solid first quarter performance and recent operating trends. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'll conclude by noting that the redemption of TARP shares behind us, we are singularly focused on our client centric strategies which are aimed at taking advantage of the growth opportunities in our markets. We believe they'll be the catalyst for further improvement in profitability. We continue to invest in three main areas,. make engagement, client loyalty and growth in primary relationships. And we believe this will drive market share growth and ultimately higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders.
And mark, I'll turn the call over to you and then I'll come back and wrap up."

I'll begin my comments today with the high-level review of the income statement on Slide 6. As Bill noted, we posted net income to common shareholders of $38 million or $0.08 per share for the quarter. These results included a $74 million or approximately $0.14 per share noncash charge in conjunction with TARP redemption which relates to the write off of the amortized discount on the TARP preferred shares. Adjusted for this charge, EPS was $0.22 which was relatively stable compared to the $0.23 reported in the fourth quarter. These results were driven by a lower loan loss provision and lower noninterest expenses in the quarter, offsetting a decline in fee income. All of which are consistent with the expectations that we outlined for you last month. Results in the current quarter compared very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and higher fee income. I'll provide additional detail on our performance on subsequent slides, so let's turn to Page 7 and begin with the review of our loan balances.
Now before discussing the trends in the loan balances, I'll first oriented with our loans segments which were introduced in our 10-K in conjunction with new accounting guidance for the industry around disclosures of loan portfolios credit quality. Loans are now reported in three segments: Commercial, residential and consumer. And the bar chart on this page reflects these categorizations. You'll also find more granular detail about our subportfolios also called classes, as you review the balance sheet tables contained within our press release.
The classes in our largest segment, which is commercial, include CNI, commercial real estate and Commercial construction. I will point out that commercial real estate reflects the income producing loans, while the owner occupied loans are now included in the C&I class. The Residential segment includes mortgages, Home Equity products and residential construction. And consumer includes the balance of our portfolio, the largest categories of which are guaranteed student loans and indirect lending.
Now turning to the content on the slide. As you can see, average performing loan balances were up approximately $400 million compared to the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by growth in the Consumer segment, more than offsetting declines in commercial and residential. Consumer was up approximately $1.1 billion due to the full quarter effect of an auto loan portfolio purchased that occurred late in the fourth quarter, improvement in our own auto loan production and from higher government guaranteed student loans. The Commercial segment was down sequentially by about $350 million as we continued to manage down the commercial construction and commercial real estate classes. The decline was partially offset by an increase in C&I, included target areas for growth and asset base, middle market and SBA lending.
With respect to commercial client utilization rates, we experienced a small increase in our diversified commercial line of business and our utilization within CIBA, our Corporate and investment bank declined slightly and remained at historically low levels. Residential average balances declined during the quarter by approximately $550 million due to reductions in nonguaranteed mortgages, Home Equity and residential construction loans. Now relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up just over $2 billion or about 2%. The growth was within the Consumer segment, and again, driven by indirect auto and government guaranteed student loans. The Commercial segment declines were due to Commercial construction and commercial real estate while the residential portfolio stayed relatively flat as run-off in the high-risk segments of the portfolio was offset by an increase in government guaranteed loans.
So there are two main takeaways that I'd like you to leave with from our loan discussion. The first is that while overall loan growth has been modest due to weak demand, we have made progress in our balance sheet diversification strategy. One aspect of that strategy is to grow the Consumer segment, and we increased balances there by about $4.5 billion from the prior year. Another component of the strategy is to grow targeted portions within the Commercial segment, and we are also making progress on this front. As a couple of examples, we originated $4.4 billion in new C&I loans and commitments this quarter, which is up by $1.3 billion from the same quarter last year. We also grow our asset based lending balances by over $500 million relative to last year.
In addition to growing these targeted areas, we've also been reducing our exposure to higher risk portions of the portfolio. This change in the risk profile of the loan book is the other key take away which I'd like to discuss in greater detail on Slide 8.
Loans that we deemed to be higher risk are displayed on this page and totaled $12 billion at the end of the first quarter. That's down by over $11 billion or almost 50% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and these higher risk categories now represent only 10% of our total loan portfolio. Furthermore, government guaranteed loans are up over $6 billion during this same time frame and they now comprise $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher risk balances and the increase guaranteed loans constitutes a significant derisking of the overall portfolio. And the risk reduction continued in the first quarter of 2011 as higher risk categories declined by $1.1 billion or 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The largest dollar declines came in the Commercial construction and the Home Equity portfolios. So with that as background, let's turn to Slide 9 now for a discussion of deposits.
Average client deposits were up $1 billion from the fourth quarter and we continued to see the favorable shift in mix towards lower cost accounts. DDA, NOW, money market and savings increased by a combined $2.2 billion or 2%, while time deposits were managed down by $1.2 billion or almost 6%. Compared to the first quarter of last year, average client deposits were up about $5.6 billion or 5%. And the increase was also due to growth in the lower cost accounts, specifically DDA and money market, while higher cost time deposits declined. As we've acknowledged before, our favorable deposit trends have undoubtedly been aided by changes witnessed throughout the industry such as clients preferences for increased liquidity. But as Bill will share with you later, we are also confident that we are driving the trends via providing superior client service and through the investments that we've made. One financial metric where these efforts are evident is in our net interest margin which you can see on Slide 10.
Net interest income was down $17 million or 1% from the fourth quarter due primarily to the fact that there were two fewer days in Q1 versus Q4. However, the net interest margin was up 9 basis points to 353, marking its eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. The sequential quarter increase was driven by a combination of higher yields on earning assets, in part, from the securities portfolio repositioning that we completed during the quarter, as well as from lower rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities which was largely the result of the aforementioned deposit mixed shift.
Relative to the prior year, net interest income increased by $75 million or 6% and the margin expanded 21 basis points. This improvement was primarily the result of the previously discussed deposit trends and our effective deposit pricing. Our loan pricing improvements and our commercial loans well-positioned have also helped to mitigate the impacts of the prolonged low interest rate environment. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2011, we do expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable to its current level.
So let's switch our focus on interest income on Slide 11.
On a reported basis, net interest income was down 14% sequentially, but as in the prior quarters, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments may be found in the appendix. Net of these adjustments, noninterest income this quarter was $825 million, which was down 11% from the prior quarter. This reduction was in line with our expectations and primarily driven by lower mortgage production and Investment Banking income. Trading account profits and commissions were also one of the larger drivers of a reported basis. However, this line item was stable when factoring in the adjustment items.
Sequential quarter mortgage production decline was due to the impacts of higher mortgage interest rates during the quarter. As a result of the higher rates, we experienced a 34% reduction in closed loan volume, as well as lower production margins. Investment Banking declined from its record fourth quarter level primarily due to lower syndication revenue, as numerous clients accelerated closings of transactions into the fourth quarter of 2010. Relative to the prior year, adjusted fee income increased by $53 million or 7% despite lower deposit service charges due to Reg E. The growth came from a broad array of core consumer and commercial key categories, including trust income, retail investment services, Investment Banking and card fees, each growing by more than $10 million and by double-digit percentages.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. As you can see on the top left portion of this slide, the income statement impact from repurchase costs was $80 million during the current quarter. This was down slightly from the prior quarter as charge-offs declined $15 million to $75 million. The reserve was increased $5 million to $270 million, as we did see an uptick in repurchase demands during the latter part of the quarter. The top right portion of the slide shows that pending demands increased to $363 million and this was caused by increased repurchase requests which are depicted in the bottom left of the slide. This quarter, we had $313 million in repurchase requests which was an increase of $80 million from the fourth quarter and driven primarily by increased agency requests related to the 2007 vintage loans. As the quarterly trends depict, repurchase requests can be very lumpy from one period to another and while we continue to expect some volatility in these requests, we also continued to believe that over time, normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in volume in the higher loss 2006 to 2007 vintages.
The information that we have provided in the bottom right of this slide is consistent with what we shared last quarter and is intended to provide you useful information with respect to calculating a lifetime loss estimate, as well as some additional detail around our nonagency exposure.
Now unrelated to the repurchase reserve, but another mortgage topic that has gotten a lot of attention recently is the impact of the April 13th mortgage servicing consent order could have on the value of mortgage servicing rights. In short, our MSR value of $1.5 billion was evaluated in the context of the overall servicing market at the end of the first quarter and does not explicitly include any incremental cost that may be associated with the order. However, we did assume in our valuation methodology that the elevated level of mortgage servicing costs that we are currently experiencing remains high for the considerable period of time and to the future. We are in the process of evaluating whether there could be additional costs associated with the consent order that warrant inclusion in our valuation approach but it's too early to know what this impact might be. In the interim, as you are developing your own estimations, it is important to remember that servicing portfolios can vary significantly across servicers due to differences in product mix, delinquency status and service fee levels, all of which can create valuation differences across institutions.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a review of expenses. On a sequential quarter basis, reported noninterest expense declined $83 million or 5%, while adjusted interest expense was down $67 million or 4%. These declines came despite higher seasonal employee benefit costs experienced during the first quarter and were driven by three areas: Credit related, marketing and outside processing expenses. Credit-related costs were down $34 million due to lower other real estate expenses, as well as decreases in credit and collections expenses. Marketing and outside processing were down $18 million and $16 million, respectively, as both of these categories had specific investment related expenses that were incurred during the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2010, expenses increased by a little over $100 million. Staff expenses were the largest driver, up $62 million due to higher compensation from improved revenue generation, as well as the hiring of additional teammates primarily in mortgage origination and in client service and support roles.
Let's now switch gears and turn to Slide 14 for a review of credit quality. Asset quality metrics continued a multi-quarter trend of improvement as early-stage delinquencies, nonperforming assets and net charge-offs all declined again. As a result, we lowered the allowance by $120 million or about 4% to its current level of 2.49%. Early stage delinquencies, excluding the guaranteed portfolios, were 80 basis points this quarter, which was a 10 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and a little more than we expected. Improvement occurred in most of the portfolios and was most notable in a 27 basis point decline in the nonguaranteed residential mortgage portfolio. Among other large portfolios, commercial real estate and indirect auto both declined 10 basis points while home-equity notched up a little bit by six basis points.
We continued to expect that additional improvement in early-stage delinquencies, particularly in our residential portfolios, will be tied to the health of the general economy since commercial and consumer delinquency rates of 24 and 79 basis points, respectively, are already at relatively low levels. We'll discuss nonperforming loans and net charge-offs in greater detail on the following page, so I'll keep my comments brief for now.
Nonperforming loans were down $139 million, marking the seventh consecutive quarterly decline. Nonperforming assets declined by $190 million due to lower NPLs, as well as an approximate $50 million reduction in other assets. Net charge-offs also continued their favorable trend, down $50 million in the quarter, to an annualized 2.01% of average loans. And the decline in the allowance for loan and lease losses was consistent with the reduction in the fourth quarter, and it was also commensurate with the improved credit quality of the portfolio, including a reduction in higher risk balances as we discussed earlier, lower emerging risks in the portfolio as evidenced by the lower delinquency rates and the recognition of current quarter charge-offs.
So let's turn to Slide 15 for a review of credit trends by loan segment, and you may also find an additional detail by loan and class in the appendix. Nonperforming loans were down 3% from the prior quarter, driven by residential, and specifically, the nonguaranteed mortgage portfolio. Included in this nonperforming loan decrease was a transfer of $57 million in carrying value to loans held for sale. The value of this loans was reduced to $47 million in connection with the transfer and the $10 million differential was recognized in the current quarter as the net charge-offs.
Commercial Loans continued to perform well and held relatively stable nonperforming loans as a $118 million sequential decline in Commercial construction was partially offset by a $93 million increase in commercial real estate. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or 23%, driven by nonguaranteed mortgages, construction and C&I. Net charge-offs, which are depicted at the bottom of the page, were down 8% from the prior quarter, driven by lower losses in the Commercial segment, and specifically, within the CNI and commercial real estate portfolios. The Residential and Consumer segments were relatively stable.
Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs declined across most portfolios and were down by a total of $250 million or 30%. And the largest reduction occurred within the nonguaranteed mortgage portfolio. And as we look to the second quarter of 2011, based on the continued progress that we've made in early stage delinquencies, we currently expect nonperforming loans to decline and net charge-offs to be relatively stable to first quarter levels. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill to discuss some recent business highlights"

And before we open the call up for Q&A, I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting a selection of recent accomplishments. I want to share with you how we're aligning the company to deliver improved performance, as well as some of th",793,"Okay. Thanks, Mark. And before we open the call up for Q&A, I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting a selection of recent accomplishments. I want to share with you how we're aligning the company to deliver improved performance, as well as some of the progress that we've made today.
As you'll recall from a number of our prior presentations, our three guiding principles for operating and growing our company are centered around one team, client first and focus on profitable growth. It's a pretty simple formula, but its results are powerful when executed correctly. One team can be exemplified by engaged teammates who are more passionate about their jobs that understand the company's mission and their role in its application and they provide better service to their clients. Well served clients are more loyal, they're less likely to attrite and they offer a greater a share of their wallet, and finally, they are a great source of referrals. And when all that occurs, we make more money for our shareholders.
By focusing on these three core tenets, we're confident we can marketly move the needle on core performance. And today we've chosen to highlight a few key accomplishments in each of those areas.
First and we believe foundational to our success in the other two areas, is our ability to work as one team. And we measure this very intensely and we're realizing positive improvements in virtually every area. We're listening to our teammates and we're making the necessary changes to improve the experience of working for SunTrust. An engaged teammate, we believe, is a competitive advantage. One team also means working to ensure the entire bank delivered to our clients seamlessly. Our improved cross-selling efforts and client penetration are testaments to our progress here. One example is in our ability to cross-sell mortgages to our banking clients. Currently, one in five of our input, print homeowner households with SunTrust and we believe that's a high number. Our strategy is one that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients. That's what we mean by client first and like teammate engagement, it's something that we measure intently. In fact, we call 1,000 clients today and asked them how we're doing. And overall, they tell us, we're doing pretty well. This is also clear from the recognition we received for both consumer and commercial banking client experience. For example, we recently received 18 Greenwich excellence awards for our distinguished performance in delivering for our business clients. This is up substantially from prior years and we were one of the top award recipients nationally. We were the only bank turn 18 Greenwich awards and the JD Power customer satisfaction award in Business Banking in the same year and we recently received the number one ranking for customer experience from Forrester Research.
These awards and our own internal measures support our belief that we offer our clients a differentiated, high-quality banking relationship. I believe this supports Mark's statement that our client service is helping drive increased deposit balances.
Our client service levels are also driving client loyalty. Our client satisfaction is at the highest level it's ever been as measured by our own service excellence program. And this is evident in our numbers. As net new consumer checking accounts, we are up 30% this quarter from the same quarter last year, what's also important to note is that this increase was driven by 9% decline in closed accounts as our attrition rates continued to improve. So you've seen improved performance over the past several quarters and we believe even better days are ahead of us. A few highlights from this quarter on areas where we've succeeded include: industry leading client deposit growth, the third best net income in revenue quarter in the Corporate Investment Banking, revenue up nearly 50% over the prior year, substantial increase in Wealth and Investment Management net income up 34% from the prior year, with then 16% in net fee income; overall we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far, but there's some obviously more ground to cover.
So moving onto the final page, I'll wrap up with some formal comments for this call. Let me give a brief summary of what we shared with you today. We redeemed our TARP shares beyond patient approach and our well-positioned from the capital perspective to pursue our growth objectives. The emphasis on profitable growth that I just outlined, coupled with continued credit quality improvement, asset and liability pricing discipline, all resulted in solid performance this quarter and that's despite some cyclical and industry headwinds. And our investments are paying off with some favorable trends in our core businesses. Now with that said, Kris, I'll turn it back over to you."

And the repayment of the debt, as we talked about a few minutes ago. We have some additional liability management strategies that we can employ that will continue to support and/or augment the margin. But one of the things that we've said consistently in the past year is, as the economy improves, we are expecting commercial deposits to decline somewhat as loan growth accelerates. So far, that hasn't happened at the pace because the economic environment hasn't picked up to the level that we had all hoped. And so at this point, we are continuing to benefit significantly from the higher level of deposits. At the curve has steepened, so new CDs become a little bit more expensive and so we're going to evaluate that in the context of the continued growth strategy that we have in growing core households.

I think it's important to comment on the CEO leadership change that was announced this morning along with the earnings release. As you know, there is a tradition at SunTrust that CEOs retire by their 65th birthday and for me, that's May 2011. As you also know, SunTrust's board were on a robust succession management and development process and that process has been in place and operating for some time for this particular succession. Bill Rogers is a deeply experienced banker and leader and has created great value for SunTrust over his long career. He's been the driving force behind our play to win growth and operating strategy that has helped drive the improvement in our performance in recent quarters. He has my respect as a leader and as a person, so not only due to the calendar, but also due to the fact that the financial services industry is now in the midst of a meaningful inflection point, we believe it's the appropriate time for this change. 
This point in time is also particularly a good one for the invigorated leadership team we've assembled over the past several years to guide SunTrust through the difficult economic, regulatory and political environment. As those environments continued to through a period of radical and uncertain change, Bill and the team are well-positioned to ensure that SunTrust will compete and will win.

I'm very excited about the opportunity and what our company can do in the future. After all, we've got a great brand, the best footprint in banking, the best-in-class client service, positive momentum in key areas and teammates focused on winning. And as Jim said, our key senior leadership team has never been stronger or more focused.
Now at the same time, I'm also very proud of how our company has responded to the adversity to recent past, and particularly Jim, under your leadership. Thank you for your support. Thank you for leading by example. The impact of your contributions to this company over 43 years will be felt for a very long time to come. I also appreciate the courage, patience and strength of character you've shown and a possibly no time greater than you demonstrated during, what I'll refer to as the TARP era. And leading up to our recent repurchase of the government shares. So thank you.
Now before we get into the financial results, I'd like to spend a moment on Slide 3 discussing our redemption TARP shares which occurred at the end of the quarter. In mid-March upon the completion of the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan submitted in connection with the CCAR, we took actions to facilitate the redemption of TARP shares. 
First, we conducted a successful $1 billion common stock offering. It was well received by the market as evidenced by the pricing and oversubscription. Further had a follow to offer premium of 4.4% which is a number that we were clearly quite pleased with. We follow that with $1 billion senior debt offering which also went very well. It priced through our rating with attractive spread of just 160 basis points over the 5-year treasury yield. And on March 30, we redeemed the $4.85 billion of preferred shares that were issued to the U.S. Treasury under TARP. Our common stock issuance in connection with the redemption of those shares was just 21% of the total TARP outstanding, which we believe is well below the amount it would've been had we redeemed the shares earlier. By keeping shareholders best interest in mind and demonstrating a patient, deliberate approach to TARP redemption, we successfully lessened the dilutive impact to our shareholders. And on balance, we're pleased with how this all concluded. 
Now let's just take a look at Slide 4 at the impact this transaction repayment had on our capital position.
With the issuance of the common equity and the redemption of the TARP preferred securities, our capital position was significantly enhanced this quarter. The Tier 1 Common equity ratio increased 92 basis points to an estimated 9%. And the Tier 1 Capital ratio, excluding TARP, was up 98 basis points to an estimated 11%. Our capital position is well above current regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed Basel III regulatory standards. Now the TARP shares have been redeemed, I'll reiterate our future capital plans. As we've said, we have been investing and will continue to invest and our people and businesses to support future growth. At the same time, we also recognized the value of returning capital to shareholders and that regard, in due time, we plan to increase the common dividend. We expect that our board will evaluate this decision in the latter part of this year, and if our financial results and the economy continue on a positive flightpath, the board would be in a position to consider a modest increase.
Now moving on to Slide 5. I'll provide review of our financial results. As you saw, we reported $0.08 per share or $0.22 when excluding the noncash charge from our TARP redemption. Further improvement in credit quality, expansion of the net interest margin and a reduction in expenses drove earnings that were even with the prior quarter when you exclude the TARP charge. As we emphasized profitable growth and credit quality continued to improve, we delivered solid performance that was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We also made additional progress in executing our strategies to drive longer-term growth. I'll spend a moment highlighting some of the key drivers this quarter and then Mark will provide some more detail.
Client deposit growth continued this positive trajectory reaching a record high this quarter, a positive mix shift continued as well with lower cost deposit increases more than offsetting the decline in higher cost deposits. Overall, average loan balance increased only modestly. However, an important part of the story is the continued run-off on higher risk loans which are down significantly this quarter. They were offset with increases in targeted, lower risk loan categories.
We had another quarter of strong net interest margin growth. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen expansion. The income declined as anticipated due to some seasonal aspects and lower refinanced phase mortgage originations. The expense story is a good one compared with the prior quarter. Despite seasonally higher employee benefit expenses, we managed expenses down 5% from the prior quarter. And finally, improvements to credit quality continued as nonperforming loans and assets, early stage delinquencies, net charge-offs and the provision for loan losses all declined during the quarter.
So we continued to navigate through a challenging operating environment, we're pleased with a solid first quarter performance and recent operating trends. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'll conclude by noting that the redemption of TARP shares behind us, we are singularly focused on our client centric strategies which are aimed at taking advantage of the growth opportunities in our markets. We believe they'll be the catalyst for further improvement in profitability. We continue to invest in three main areas: teammate engagement, client loyalty and growth in primary relationships. And we believe this will drive market share growth and ultimately higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders.
And Mark, I'll turn the call over to you and then I'll come back to wrap up."
305901,129302882,116557,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with the high-level review of the income statement on Slide 6.

I'll begin my comments today with the high-level review of the income statement on Slide 6. As Bill noted, we posted net income to common shareholders of $38 million or $0.08 per share for the quarter. These results included a $74 million or approximately $0.14 per share noncash charge in conjunction with TARP redemption which relates to the write off of the unamortized discount on the TARP preferred shares. Adjusted for this charge, EPS was $0.22 which was relatively stable compared to the $0.23 reported in the fourth quarter. 
These results were driven by a lower loan loss provision and lower noninterest expenses in the quarter, offsetting a decline in fee income. All of which are consistent with the expectations that we outlined for you last month. Results in the current quarter compared very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and higher fee income. I'll provide additional detail on our performance on subsequent slides, so let's turn to Page 7 and begin with the review of our loan balances.
Now before discussing the trends in the loan balances, I'll first oriented with our loans segments which were introduced in our 10-K in conjunction with new accounting guidance for the industry around disclosures of loan portfolios credit quality. Loans are now reported in three segments: Commercial, Residential and Consumer. And the bar chart on this page reflects these categorizations. You'll also find more granular detail about our sub-portfolios also called Classes, as you review the balance sheet tables contained within our press release.
The classes in our largest segment, which is Commercial, include C&I, Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Construction. I will point out that Commercial Real Estate reflects the income producing loans, while the owner occupied loans are now included in the C&I class. The Residential segment includes mortgages, Home Equity products and residential construction. And Consumer includes the balance of our portfolio, the largest categories of which are guaranteed student loans and indirect lending.
Now turning to the content on the slide. As you can see, average performing loan balances were up approximately $400 million compared to the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by growth in the Consumer segment, more than offsetting declines in commercial and residential. Consumer was up approximately $1.1 billion due to the full quarter effect of an auto loan portfolio purchase that occurred late in the fourth quarter, improvement in our own auto loan production and from higher government guaranteed student loans. The Commercial segment was down sequentially by about $350 million as we continued to manage down the commercial construction and commercial real estate classes. The decline was partially offset by an increase in C&I, included target areas for growth and asset base, middle market and SBA lending.
With respect to commercial client utilization rates, we experienced a small increase in our diversified commercial line of business and our utilization within CIB, our corporate and Investment Bank declined slightly and remained at a historically low level. Residential average balances declined during the quarter by approximately $550 million due to reductions in nonguaranteed mortgages, Home Equity and residential construction loans. Now relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up just over $2 billion or about 2%. The growth was within the Consumer segment, and again, driven by indirect auto and government guaranteed student loans. The Commercial segment declines were due to Commercial construction and commercial real estate while the residential portfolio stayed relatively flat as run-off in the high-risk segments of the portfolio was offset by an increase in government guaranteed loans.
So there are two main takeaways that I'd like you to leave with from our loan discussion. The first is that while overall loan growth has been modest due to weak demand, we have made progress in our balance sheet diversification strategy. One aspect of that strategy is to grow the Consumer segment, and we increased balances there by about $4.5 billion from the prior year. Another component of the strategy is to grow targeted portions within the Commercial segment, and we're also making progress on this front. As a couple of examples, we originated $4.4 billion in new C&I loans and commitments this quarter, which is up by $1.3 billion from the same quarter last year. We also grow our asset-based lending balances by over $500 million relative to last year.
In addition to growing these targeted areas, we've also been reducing our exposure to higher risk portions of the portfolio. This change in the risk profile of the loan book is the other key take away which I'd like to discuss in greater detail on Slide 8.
Loans that we deemed to be higher risk are displayed on this page and totaled $12 billion at the end of the first quarter. That's down by over $11 billion or almost 50% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and these higher risk categories now represent only 10% of our total loan portfolio. Furthermore, government guaranteed loans are up over $6 billion during this same time frame and they now comprise $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher risk balances and the increase in guaranteed loans constitutes a significant derisking of the overall portfolio. And the risk reduction continued in the first quarter of 2011 as higher risk categories declined by $1.1 billion or 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The largest dollar declines came in the commercial construction and the Home Equity portfolios. So with that as background, let's turn to Slide 9 now for a discussion of deposits.
Average client deposits were up $1 billion from the fourth quarter and we continued to see the favorable shift in mix towards lower cost accounts. DDA, NOW, money market and savings increased by a combined $2.2 billion or 2%, while time deposits were managed down by $1.2 billion or almost 6%. Compared to the first quarter of last year, average client deposits were up about $5.6 billion or 5%. And the increase was also due to growth in the lower cost accounts, specifically DDA and money market, while higher cost time deposits declined. As we've acknowledged before, our favorable deposit trends have undoubtedly been aided by changes witnessed throughout the industry such as clients preferences for increased liquidity. But as Bill will share with you later, we are also confident that we are driving the trends via providing superior client service and through the investments that we've made. One financial metric where these efforts are evident is in our net interest margin which you can see on Slide 10.
Net interest income was down $17 million or 1% from the fourth quarter due primarily to the fact that there were two fewer days in Q1 versus Q4. However, the net interest margin was up 9 basis points to 353, marking its eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. The sequential quarter increase was driven by a combination of higher yields on earning assets, in part, from the securities portfolio repositioning that we completed during the quarter, as well as from lower rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities which was largely the result of the aforementioned deposit mixed shift.
Relative to the prior year, net interest income increased by $75 million or 6% and the margin expanded 21 basis points. This improvement was primarily the result of the previously discussed deposit trends and our effective deposit pricing. Our loan pricing improvements and our commercial loans swap position have also helped mitigate the impacts of the prolonged low interest rate environment. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2011, we do expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable to its current level.
So let's switch our focus to noninterest income on Slide 11.
On a reported basis, noninterest income was down 14% sequentially, but as in prior quarters, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments may be found in the appendix. Net of these adjustments, noninterest income this quarter was $825 million, which was down 11% from the prior quarter. This reduction was in line with our expectations and primarily driven by lower mortgage production and Investment Banking income. Trading account profits and commissions were also one of the larger drivers on a reported basis. However, this line item was stable when factoring in the adjustment items.
Sequential quarter mortgage production decline was due to the impacts of higher mortgage interest rates during the quarter. As a result of the higher rates, we experienced a 34% reduction in closed loan volume, as well as lower production margins. Investment Banking declined from its record fourth quarter level primarily due to lower syndication revenue, as numerous clients accelerated closings of transactions into the fourth quarter of 2010. Relative to the prior year, adjusted fee income increased by $53 million or 7% despite lower deposit service charges due to Reg E. The growth came from a broad array of core consumer and commercial key categories, including trust income, retail investment services, Investment Banking and card fees, each growing by more than $10 million and by double-digit percentages.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. As you can see on the top left portion of this slide, the income statement impact from repurchase costs was $80 million during the current quarter. This was down slightly from the prior quarter as charge-offs declined $15 million to $75 million. The reserve was increased $5 million to $270 million, as we did see an uptick in repurchase demands during the latter part of the quarter. The top right portion of the slide shows that pending demands increased to $363 million and this was caused by increased repurchase requests which are depicted in the bottom left of the slide. 
This quarter, we had $313 million in repurchase requests which was an increase of $80 million from the fourth quarter and driven primarily by increased agency requests related to the 2007 vintage loans. As the quarterly trends depict, repurchase requests can be very lumpy from one period to another and while we continue to expect some volatility in these requests, we also continued to believe that over time, normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in volume in the higher loss 2006 to 2007 vintages.
The information that we have provided in the bottom right of this slide is consistent with what we shared last quarter and is intended to provide you useful information with respect to calculating a lifetime loss estimate, as well as some additional detail around our non-agency exposure.
Now unrelated to the repurchase reserve, but another mortgage topic that has gotten a lot of attention recently is the impact of the April 13th mortgage servicing consent order could have on the value of mortgage servicing rights. In short, our MSR value of $1.5 billion was evaluated in the context of the overall servicing market at the end of the first quarter and does not explicitly include any incremental cost that may be associated with the order. However, we did assume in our valuation methodology that the elevated level of mortgage servicing costs that we are currently experiencing remains high for the considerable period of time and to the future. We are in the process of evaluating whether there could be additional costs associated with the consent order that warrant inclusion in our valuation approach but it's too early to know what this impact might be. In the interim, as you are developing your own estimations, it is important to remember that servicing portfolios can vary significantly across servicers due to differences in product mix, delinquency status and service fee levels, all of which can create valuation differences across institutions.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a review of expenses. On a sequential quarter basis, reported noninterest expense declined $83 million or 5%, while adjusted noninterest expense was down $67 million or 4%. These declines came despite higher seasonal employee benefits costs experienced during the first quarter and were driven by three areas: Credit related, marketing and outside processing expenses. Credit-related costs were down $34 million due to lower other real estate expenses, as well as decreases in credit and collections expenses. Marketing and outside processing were down $18 million and $16 million, respectively, as both of these categories had specific investment related expenses that were incurred during the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2010, expenses increased by a little over $100 million. Staff expenses were the largest driver, up $62 million due to higher compensation from improved revenue generation, as well as the hiring of additional teammates primarily in mortgage origination and in client service and support roles.
Let's now switch gears and turn to Slide 14 for a review of credit quality. Asset quality metrics continued a multi-quarter trend of improvement as early-stage delinquencies, nonperforming assets and net charge-offs all declined again. As a result, we lowered the allowance by $120 million or about 4% to its current level of 2.49%. Early stage delinquencies, excluding the guaranteed portfolios, were 80 basis points this quarter, which was a 10 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and a little more than we expected. Improvement occurred in most of the portfolios and was most notable in a 27 basis point decline in the nonguaranteed residential mortgage portfolio. Among other large portfolios, commercial real estate and indirect auto both declined 10 basis points while Home Equity notched up a little bit by 6 basis points.
We continue to expect that additional improvement in early-stage delinquencies, particularly in our residential portfolios, will be tied to the health of the general economy since commercial and consumer delinquency rates of 24 and 79 basis points, respectively, are already at relatively low levels. We'll discuss nonperforming loans and net charge-offs in greater detail on the following page, so I'll keep my comments brief for now.
Nonperforming loans were down $139 million, marking the 7th consecutive quarterly decline. Nonperforming assets declined by $190 million due to lower NPLs, as well as an approximate $50 million reduction in other assets. Net charge-offs also continued their favorable trend, down $50 million in the quarter, to an annualized 2.01% of average loans. Of the decline in the allowance for loan and lease losses was consistent with the reduction in the fourth quarter, and it was also commensurate with the improved credit quality of the portfolio, including a reduction in higher risk balances as we discussed earlier, lower emerging risks in the portfolio as evidenced by the lower delinquency rate and the recognition of current quarter charge-offs.
So let's turn to Slide 15 for a review of credit trends by loan segment, and you may also find an additional detail by loan and class in the appendix. Nonperforming loans were down 3% from the prior quarter, driven by residential, and specifically, the nonguaranteed mortgage portfolio. Included in this nonperforming loan decrease was a transfer of $57 million in carrying value to loans held for sale. The value of this loans was reduced to $47 million in connection with the transfer and a $10 million differential was recognized in the current quarter as a net charge-off.
Commercial Loans continued to perform well and had relatively stable nonperforming loans as a $118 million sequential decline in Commercial construction was partially offset by a $93 million increase in commercial real estate. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or 23%, driven by nonguaranteed mortgages, construction and C&I. Net charge-offs, which are depicted at the bottom of the page, were down 8% from the prior quarter, driven by lower losses in the Commercial segment, and specifically, within the CNI and commercial real estate portfolios. The Residential and Consumer segments were relatively stable.
Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs declined across most portfolios and were down by a total of $250 million or 30%. And the largest reduction occurred within the nonguaranteed mortgage portfolio. And as we look to the second quarter of 2011, based on the continued progress that we've made in early stage delinquencies, we currently expect nonperforming loans to decline and net charge-offs to be relatively stable to first quarter levels. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill to discuss some recent business highlights"

And before we open the call up for Q&A, I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting a selection of recent accomplishments. I want to share with you how we're aligning the company to deliver improved performance, as well as some of the progress that we've made today.
As you'll recall from a number of our prior presentations, our three guiding principles for operating and growing our company are centered around one team, client first and focus on profitable growth. It's a pretty simple formula, but its results are powerful when executed correctly. One team can be exemplified by engaged teammates who are more passionate about their jobs that understand the company's mission and their role in its application and they provide better service to their clients. Well served clients are more loyal, they're less likely to attrite and they offer a greater a share of their wallet, and finally, they are a great source of referrals. And when all that occurs, we make more money for our shareholders.
By focusing on these three core tenets, we're confident we can markedly move the needle on core performance. And today we've chosen to highlight a few key accomplishments in each of those areas.
First and we believe foundational to our success in the other two areas, is our ability to work as one team. And we measure this very intently and we're realizing positive improvements in virtually every area. We're listening to our teammates and we're making the necessary changes to improve the experience of working for SunTrust. An engaged teammate, we believe, is a competitive advantage. One team also means working to ensure the entire bank has delivered to our clients seamlessly. Our improved cross-selling efforts and client penetration are testaments to our progress here. 
One example is in our ability to cross-sell mortgages to our banking clients. Currently, 1 in 5 of our input, print homeowner households have a mortgage with SunTrust, and we believe that's a high number. Our strategy is one that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients. That's what we mean by client first and like teammate engagement, it's something that we measure intently. In fact, we call 1,000 clients today and ask them how we're doing. And overall, they tell us, we're doing pretty well. This is also clear from the recognition we received for both consumer and commercial banking client experience. For example, we recently received 18 Greenwich excellence awards for our distinguished performance in delivering for our business clients. This is up substantially from prior years and we were one of the top award recipients nationally. We were the only bank to earn 18 Greenwich awards and the JD Power Customer Satisfaction Award in Business Banking in the same year and we recently received the #1 ranking for customer experience from Forrester Research.
These awards and our own internal measures support our belief that we offer our clients a differentiated, high-quality banking relationship. I believe this supports Mark's statement that our client service is helping drive increased deposit balances.
Our client service levels are also driving client loyalty. Our client satisfaction is at the highest level it's ever been as measured by our own service excellence program. And this is evident in our numbers. As net new consumer checking accounts, were up 30% this quarter from the same quarter last year, what's also important to note that this increase was driven by a 9% decline in closed accounts as our attrition rates continued to improve. 
So you've seen improved performance over the past several quarters and we believe even better days are ahead of us. A few highlights from this quarter on areas where we've succeeded include: industry-leading client deposit growth, the third best net income in revenue quarter in the Corporate Investment Banking, revenue up nearly 50% over the prior year, substantial increase in Wealth and Investment Management net income up 34% from the prior year, with a 16% in net fee income; overall we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far, but there's some obviously more ground to cover.
So moving onto the final page, I'll wrap up with some formal comments for this call. Let me give a brief summary of what we shared with you today. We redeemed our TARP shares via a patient approach and are well-positioned from a capital perspective to pursue our growth objectives. The emphasis on profitable growth that I just outlined, coupled with continued credit quality improvement, asset and liability pricing discipline, all resulted in solid performance this quarter and that's despite some cyclical and industry headwinds.

He's been the driving force behind our play to win growth and operating strategy that has helped drive the improvement in our performance in recent quarters. He has my respect as a leader and as a person, so not only due to the calendar, but also due to the fact that the financial services industry is now in the midst of a meaningful inflection point, we believe it's the appropriate time for this change.

I also appreciate the courage, patience and strength of character you've shown and at possibly no time greater than you demonstrated during what I'll refer to as the TARP era, and leading up to our recent repurchase of government shares. So thank you.
Now before we get into the financial results, I'd like to spend a moment on Slide 3 discussing our redemption TARP shares, which occurred at the end of the quarter. In mid-March, upon the completion of the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan, submitted in connection with the CCAR, we took actions to facilitate the redemption of TARP shares. 
First, we conducted a successful $1 billion common stock offering. It was well received by the market, as evidenced by the pricing and oversubscription. Further, it had a follow to offer premium of 4.4%, which is a number that we were clearly quite pleased with. We followed that with $1 billion senior debt offering, which also went very well. It priced through our rating with attractive spread of just 160 basis points over the 5-year treasury yield. And on March 30, we redeemed the $4.85 billion of preferred shares that were issued to the U.S. Treasury under TARP. Our common stock issuance in connection with the redemption of those shares was just 21% of the total TARP outstanding, which we believe is well below the amount it would've been had we redeemed the shares earlier. By keeping shareholders' best interest in mind and demonstrating a patient, deliberate approach to TARP redemption, we successfully lessened the dilutive impact to our shareholders. And on balance, we're pleased with how this all concluded. 
Now let's just take a look at Slide 4 at the impact this transaction and repayment had on our capital position.
With the issuance of the common equity and the redemption of the TARP preferred securities, our capital position was significantly enhanced this quarter. The Tier 1 Common equity ratio increased 92 basis points to an estimated 9%. And the Tier 1 Capital ratio, excluding TARP, was up 98 basis points to an estimated 11%. Our capital position is well above current regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed Basel III regulatory standards. Now that TARP shares have been redeemed, I'll reiterate our future capital plans. As we've said, we have been investing and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support future growth. At the same time, we also recognized the value of returning capital to shareholders, and that regard, in due time, we plan to increase the common dividend. We expect that our board will evaluate this decision in the latter part of this year, and if our financial results and the economy continue on a positive flight path, the board would be in a position to consider a modest increase.
Now moving on to Slide 5. I'll provide review of our financial results. As you saw, we reported $0.08 per share or $0.22 when excluding the noncash charge from our TARP redemption. Further improvement in credit quality, expansion of the net interest margin and a reduction in expenses drove earnings that were even with the prior quarter when you exclude the TARP charge. As we emphasized profitable growth and credit quality continued to improve, we delivered solid performance that was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We also made additional progress in executing our strategies to drive longer-term growth. I'll spend a moment highlighting some of the key drivers this quarter, and then Mark will provide some more detail.
Client deposit growth continued its positive trajectory, reaching a record high this quarter. A positive mix shift continued as well with lower cost deposit increases more than offsetting the decline in higher cost deposits. Overall, average loan balance increased only modestly. However, an important part of the story is the continued run-off on higher risk loans, which are down significantly this quarter. They were offset with increases in targeted, lower risk loan categories.
We had another quarter of strong net interest margin growth. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen expansion. The income declined as anticipated due to some seasonal aspects and lower refinance phase mortgage originations. The expense story is a good one compared with the prior quarter. Despite seasonally higher employee benefit expenses, we managed expenses down 5% from the prior quarter. And finally, improvements to credit quality continued as nonperforming loans and assets, early stage delinquencies, net charge-offs and the provision for loan losses all declined during the quarter.
So we continue to navigate through a challenging operating environment. We're pleased with a solid first quarter performance and recent operating trends. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'll conclude by noting that with the redemption of TARP shares behind us, we are singularly focused on our client centric strategies which are aimed at taking advantage of the growth opportunities in our market. We believe they'll be the catalyst for further improvement in profitability. We're continuing to invest in three main areas: teammate engagement, client loyalty and growth in primary relationships. And we believe this will drive market share growth and ultimately higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders.
And Mark, I'll turn the call over to you and then I'll come back to wrap up."

I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 6. As Bill noted, we posted net income to common shareholders of $38 million or $0.08 per share for the quarter. These result",2732,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 6. As Bill noted, we posted net income to common shareholders of $38 million or $0.08 per share for the quarter. These results included a $74 million or approximately $0.14 per share noncash charge in conjunction with TARP redemption, which relates to the write-off of the unamortized discount on the TARP preferred shares. Adjusted for this charge, EPS was $0.22, which was relatively stable compared to the $0.23 reported in the fourth quarter. 
These results were driven by a lower loan loss provision and lower noninterest expenses in the quarter, offsetting a decline in fee income. All of which are consistent with the expectations that we outlined for you last month. Results in the current quarter compare very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and higher fee income. I'll provide additional detail on our performance on subsequent slides, so let's turn to Page 7 and begin with the review of our loan balances.
Now before discussing the trends in the loan balances, I'll first orient you with our loan segments, which were introduced in our 10-K in conjunction with new accounting guidance for the industry around disclosures of loan portfolios credit quality. Loans are now reported in three segments: Commercial, Residential and Consumer, and the bar chart on this page reflects these categorizations. You'll also find more granular detail about our sub-portfolios, also called Classes, as you review the balance sheet tables contained within our press release.
The classes in our largest segment, which is Commercial, include CNI, Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Construction. I will point out that Commercial Real Estate reflects the income producing loans, while the owner occupied loans are now included in the C&I class. The Residential segment includes mortgages, Home Equity products and residential construction. And Consumer includes the balance of our portfolio, the largest categories of which are guaranteed student loans and indirect lending.
Now turning to the content on the slide. As you can see, average performing loan balances were up approximately $400 million compared to the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by growth in the Consumer segment, more than offsetting declines in commercial and residential. Consumer was up approximately $1.1 billion due to the full quarter effect of an auto loan portfolio purchase that occurred late in the fourth quarter, improvement in our own auto loan production and from higher government guaranteed student loans. The Commercial segment was down sequentially by about $350 million as we continued to manage down the commercial construction and commercial real estate classes. The decline was partially offset by an increase in C&I, included target areas for growth and asset based, middle market and SBA lending.
With respect to commercial client utilization rates, we experienced a small increase in our diversified commercial line of business and our utilization within CIB, our corporate and Investment Bank, declined slightly and remained at a historically low level. Residential average balances declined during the quarter by approximately $550 million due to reductions in nonguaranteed mortgages, Home Equity and residential construction loans. Now relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up just over $2 billion or about 2%. The growth was within the Consumer segment, and, again, driven by indirect auto and government guaranteed student loans. The Commercial segment declines were due to Commercial construction and commercial real estate, while the residential portfolio stayed relatively flat as run-off in the high-risk segments of the portfolio was offset by an increase in government guaranteed loans.
So there are two main takeaways that I'd like you to leave with from our loan discussion. The first is that while overall loan growth had been modest due to weak demand, we have made progress in our balance sheet diversification strategy. One aspect of that strategy is to grow the Consumer segment, and we increased balances there by about $4.5 billion from the prior year. Another component of the strategy is to grow targeted portions within the Commercial segment, and we're also making progress on this front. As a couple of examples, we originated $4.4 billion in new C&I loans and commitments this quarter, which is up by $1.3 billion from the same quarter last year. We also grew our asset-based lending balances by over $500 million relative to last year.
In addition to growing these targeted areas, we've also been reducing our exposure to higher risk portions of the portfolio. This change in the risk profile of the loan book is the other key takeaway, which I'd like to discuss in greater detail on Slide 8.
Loans that we deemed to be higher risk are displayed on this page and totaled $12 billion at the end of the first quarter. That's down by over $11 billion, or almost 50%, from the fourth quarter of 2008 and these higher risk categories now represent only 10% of our total loan portfolio. Furthermore, government guaranteed loans are up over $6 billion during this same time frame, and they now comprise $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher risk balances and the increase in guaranteed loans constitutes a significant derisking of the overall portfolio. And the risk reduction continued in the first quarter of 2011, as higher risk categories declined by $1.1 billion or 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The largest dollar declines came in the commercial construction and the Home Equity portfolios. So with that as background, let's turn to Slide 9 now for a discussion of deposits.
Average client deposits were up $1 billion from the fourth quarter, and we continue to see the favorable shift in mix towards lower cost accounts. DDA, NOW, money market and savings increased by a combined $2.2 billion or 2%, while time deposits were managed down by $1.2 billion or almost 6%. Compared to the first quarter of last year, average client deposits were up about $5.6 billion or 5%. And the increase was also due to growth in the lower cost accounts, specifically DDA and money market, while higher cost time deposits declined. As we've acknowledged before, our favorable deposit trends have undoubtedly been aided by changes witnessed throughout the industry, such as clients' preferences for increased liquidity. But as Bill will share with you later, we are also confident that we are driving the trends via providing superior client service and through the investments that we've made. One financial metric where these efforts are evident is in our net interest margin, which you can see on Slide 10.
Net interest income was down $17 million or 1% from the fourth quarter due primarily to the fact that there were two fewer days in Q1 versus Q4. However, the net interest margin was up 9 basis points to 353, marking its eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. The sequential quarter increase was driven by a combination of higher yields on earning assets, in part from the securities portfolio repositioning that we completed during the quarter, as well as from lower rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which was largely the result of the aforementioned deposit mixed shift.
Relative to the prior year, net interest income increased by $75 million or 6% and the margin expanded 21 basis points. This improvement was primarily the result of the previously discussed deposit trends and our effective deposit pricing. Our loan pricing improvements and our commercial loans swap position have also helped mitigate the impacts of the prolonged low interest rate environment. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2011, we do expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable to its current level.
So let's switch our focus to noninterest income on Slide 11.
On a reported basis, noninterest income was down 14% sequentially, but, as in prior quarters, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments may be found in the appendix. Net of these adjustments, noninterest income this quarter was $825 million, which was down 11% from the prior quarter. This reduction was in line with our expectations and primarily driven by lower mortgage production and Investment Banking income. Trading account profits and commissions were also one of the larger drivers on a reported basis. However, this line item was stable when factoring in the adjustment items.
Sequential quarter mortgage production decline was due to the impacts of higher mortgage interest rates during the quarter. As a result of the higher rates, we experienced a 34% reduction in closed loan volume, as well as lower production margins. Investment Banking declined from its record fourth quarter level, primarily due to lower syndication revenue as numerous clients accelerated closings of transactions into the fourth quarter of 2010. Relative to the prior year, adjusted fee income increased by $53 million or 7% despite lower deposit service charges due to Reg E. The growth came from a broad array of core consumer and commercial key categories, including trust income, retail investment services, Investment Banking and card fees, each growing by more than $10 million and by double-digit percentages.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. As you can see in the top left portion of this slide, the income statement impact from repurchase costs was $80 million during the current quarter. This was down slightly from the prior quarter as charge-offs declined $15 million to $75 million. The reserve was increased $5 million to $270 million, as we did see an uptick in repurchase demands during the latter part of the quarter. The top right portion of the slide shows that pending demands increased to $363 million, and this was caused by increased repurchase requests, which are depicted in the bottom left of the slide. 
This quarter, we had $313 million in repurchase requests, which was an increase of $80 million from the fourth quarter and driven primarily by increased agency requests related to the 2007 vintage loans. As the quarterly trends depict, repurchase requests can be very lumpy from one period to another, and while we continue to expect some volatility in these requests, we also continue to believe that over time, normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in volume in the higher loss 2006 to 2007 vintages.
The information that we have provided in the bottom right of this slide is consistent with what we shared last quarter and is intended to provide you useful information with respect to calculating a lifetime loss estimate, as well as some additional detail around our non-agency exposure.
Now unrelated to the repurchase reserve, but another mortgage topic that has gotten a lot of attention recently, is the impact that the April 13th mortgage servicing consent order could have on the value of mortgage servicing rights. In short, our MSR value of $1.5 billion was evaluated in the context of the overall servicing market at the end of the first quarter and does not explicitly include any incremental cost that may be associated with the order. However, we did assume in our valuation methodology that the elevated level of mortgage servicing costs that we are currently experiencing remains high for a considerable period of time into the future. We are in the process of evaluating whether there could be additional costs associated with the consent order that warrant inclusion in our valuation approach but it's too early to know what this impact might be. In the interim, as you are developing your own estimations, it is important to remember that servicing portfolios can vary significantly across servicers due to differences in product mix, delinquency status and service fee levels, all of which can create valuation differences across institutions.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a review of expenses. On a sequential quarter basis, reported noninterest expense declined $83 million or 5%, while adjusted noninterest expense was down $67 million or 4%. These declines came despite higher seasonal employee benefits costs experienced during the first quarter and were driven by three areas: credit related, marketing and outside processing expenses. Credit-related costs were down $34 million due to lower other real estate expenses, as well as decreases in credit and collections expenses. Marketing and outside processing were down $18 million and $16 million, respectively, as both of these categories had specific investment related expenses that were incurred during the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2010, expenses increased by a little over $100 million. Staff expenses were the largest driver, up $62 million due to higher compensation from improved revenue generation, as well as the hiring of additional teammates, primarily in mortgage origination and in client service and support roles.
Let's now switch gears and turn to Slide 14 for a review of credit quality. Asset quality metrics continued a multi-quarter trend of improvement as early-stage delinquencies, nonperforming assets and net charge-offs all declined again. As a result, we lowered the allowance by $120 million or about 4% to its current level of 2.49%. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding the guaranteed portfolios, were 80 basis points this quarter, which was a 10 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and a little more than we expected. Improvement occurred in most of the portfolios and was most notable in a 27 basis point decline in the nonguaranteed residential mortgage portfolio. Among other large portfolios, commercial real estate and indirect auto both declined 10 basis points, while Home Equity notched up a little bit by 6 basis points.
We continue to expect that additional improvement in early-stage delinquencies, particularly in our residential portfolios, will be tied to the health of the general economy since commercial and consumer delinquency rates of 24 and 79 basis points, respectively, are already at relatively low levels. We'll discuss nonperforming loans and net charge-offs in greater detail on the following page, so I'll keep my comments brief for now.
Nonperforming loans were down $139 million, marking the 7th consecutive quarterly decline. Nonperforming assets declined by $190 million due to lower NPLs, as well as an approximate $50 million reduction in other assets. Net charge-offs also continued their favorable trend, down $50 million in the quarter to an annualized 2.01% of average loans. Now the decline in the allowance for loan and lease losses was consistent with the reduction in the fourth quarter, and it was also commensurate with the improved credit quality of the portfolio, including a reduction in higher risk balances, as we discussed earlier, lower emerging risks in the portfolio as evidenced by the lower delinquency rate and the recognition of current-quarter charge-offs.
So let's turn to Slide 15 for a review of credit trends by loan segment, and you may also find  additional detail by loan and class in the appendix. Nonperforming loans were down 3% from the prior quarter, driven by residential, and, specifically, the nonguaranteed mortgage portfolio. Included in this nonperforming loan decrease was a transfer of $57 million in carrying value to loans held for sale. The value of these loans was reduced to $47 million in connection with the transfer, and a $10 million differential was recognized in the current quarter as a net charge-off.
Commercial Loans continued to perform well and had relatively stable nonperforming loans, as a $118 million sequential decline in commercial construction was partially offset by a $93 million increase in commercial real estate. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or 23%, driven by nonguaranteed mortgages, construction and C&I. Net charge-offs, which are depicted at the bottom of the page, were down 8% from the prior quarter, driven by lower losses in the Commercial segment, and, specifically, within the C&I and commercial real estate portfolios. The Residential and Consumer segments were relatively stable.
Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs declined across most portfolios and were down by a total of $250 million or 30%. And the largest reduction occurred within the nonguaranteed mortgage portfolio. And as we look to the second quarter of 2011, based on the continued progress that we've made in early stage delinquencies, we currently expect nonperforming loans to decline and net charge-offs to be relatively stable to first quarter levels. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill to discuss some recent business highlights."

And before we open the call up for Q&A, I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting a selection of recent accomplishments. I want to share with you how we're aligning the company to deliver improved performance, as well as some of th",795,"Okay. Thanks, Mark. And before we open the call up for Q&A, I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting a selection of recent accomplishments. I want to share with you how we're aligning the company to deliver improved performance, as well as some of the progress that we've made today.
Now as you'll recall from a number of our prior presentations, our three guiding principles for operating and growing our company are centered around one team, client first and focus on profitable growth. It's a pretty simple formula, but its results are powerful when executed correctly. One team can be exemplified by engaged teammates who are more passionate about their jobs. They understand the company's mission and their role in its application, and they provide better service to their clients. Well-served clients are more loyal, they're less likely to attrite and they offer a greater a share of their wallet, and, finally, they are a great source of referrals. And when all that occurs, we make more money for our shareholders.
By focusing on these three core tenets, we're confident we can markedly move the needle on core performance. And today we've chosen to highlight a few key accomplishments in each of those areas.
First and, we believe, foundational to our success in the other two areas, is our ability to work as one team. And we measure this very intently, and we're realizing positive improvements in virtually every area. We're listening to our teammates, and we're making the necessary changes to improve the experience of working for SunTrust. An engaged teammate, we believe, is a competitive advantage. One team also means working to ensure the entire bank has delivered to our clients seamlessly. Our improved cross-selling efforts and client penetration are testaments to our progress here. 
One example is in our ability to cross-sell mortgages to our banking clients. Currently, 1 in 5 of our input, print homeowner households have a mortgage with SunTrust, and we believe that's a high number. Our strategy is one that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients. That's what we mean by client first, and, like teammate engagement, it's something that we measure intently. In fact, we call 1,000 clients a day and ask them how we're doing. And overall, they tell us we're doing pretty well. This is also clear from the recognition we've received for both consumer and commercial banking client experience. For example, we recently received 18 Greenwich Excellence Awards for our distinguished performance in delivering for our business clients. This is up substantially from prior years, and we were one of the top award recipients nationally. We were the only bank to earn 18 Greenwich Awards and the JD Power Customer Satisfaction Award in Business Banking in the same year, and we recently received the #1 ranking for customer experience from Forrester Research.
These awards and our own internal measures support our belief that we offer our clients a differentiated, high-quality banking relationship. I believe this supports Mark's statement that our client service is helping drive increased deposit balances.
Our client service levels are also driving client loyalty. Our client satisfaction is at the highest level it's ever been as measured by our own service excellence program. And this is evident in our numbers, as net new consumer checking accounts were up 30% this quarter from the same quarter last year. What's also important to note that this increase was driven by a 9% decline in closed accounts as our attrition rates continue to improve. 
So you've seen improved performance over the past several quarters, and we believe even better days are ahead of us. A few highlights from this quarter on areas where we've succeeded include: industry-leading client deposit growth, the third-best net income and revenue quarter in  Corporate Investment Banking, revenue up nearly 50% over the prior year, substantial increase in Wealth and Investment Management net income up 34% from the prior year, with a 16% in net fee income; overall we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far, but there's some obviously more ground to cover.
So moving onto the final page, I'll wrap up with some formal comments for this call. Let me give a brief summary of what we shared with you today. We redeemed our TARP shares via a patient approach and are well-positioned from a capital perspective to pursue our growth objectives. The emphasis on profitable growth that I just outlined, coupled with continued credit quality improvement, asset and liability pricing discipline all resulted in solid performance this quarter, and that's despite some cyclical and industry headwinds. And our investments are paying off with some favorable trends in our core businesses. Now with that said, Kris, I'll turn it back over to you."

And the repayment of the debt, as we talked about a few minutes ago. We have some additional liability management strategies that we can employ that will continue to support and/or augment the margin. But one of the things that we've said consistently in the past year is, as the economy improves, we are expecting commercial deposits to decline somewhat as loan growth accelerates. So far, that hasn't happened at the pace because the economic environment hasn't picked up to the level that we had all hoped. And so at this point, we're continuing to benefit significantly from the higher level of deposits. As the curve has steepened, so new CDs become a little bit more expensive and so we're going to evaluate that in the context of the continued growth strategy that we have in growing core households.

I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the firs",2059,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.
Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the first quarter reported EPS of $0.08 or $0.22 when adjusted for the noncash charge associated with TARP production. The primary drivers of the sequential EPS growth were a lower provision due to continued improvements in credit quality, higher fee income across multiple categories and lower preferred dividends due to TARP redemption, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. These results also compare very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and lower preferred dividends. I'll share additional color on our performance in a moment, so let's turn to Page 5 for a review of the loan portfolio.
Average performing loans were flat compared to first quarter levels of $111 billion. However, we continued to make progress in diversifying the loan portfolio as we drove growth in targeted commercial and consumer areas while further reducing our residential real estate portfolio. We also continued to de-risk the portfolio and I'll share more detail with you about that later. Growth this quarter within the Commercial segment was driven by C&I loans which increased by $1 billion or more than 2%. This growth came generally from larger Corporate borrowers and was most pronounced within the areas that we've been targeting for growth, such as asset-based lending, middle market and certain industry verticals within our Corporate and Investment Banking business.
The Consumer segment expanded modestly, driven by guaranteed student loans. Conversely, residential loans declined by about $650 million, a similar amount to last quarter, mostly due to lower nonguaranteed mortgage and Home Equity balances.
Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by about $3 billion or almost 3%. This growth was driven by consumer loans which were up about $4 billion, specifically in student loans and in direct. Residential balances were down marginally as nonguaranteed mortgages and home equity balances both declined by about $1 billion, which more than offset the growth in the guaranteed mortgage portfolio. The Commercial segment also declined primarily due to intentional reductions in Commercial Construction, as well as lower commercial real estate balances, which more than offset the C&I growth that we've experienced for the last several quarters.
Overall, loan growth and loan demand remained weaker than we would like, but we are pleased with our progress in growing selected areas of the portfolio, while concurrently reducing risk. Further detail on this risk reduction is on Slide 6.
This page provides a visual of the trends in loans that for this purpose, we can address as higher risk. These portfolios now total $11.4 billion and have been declining consistently and meaningfully, down over 50% since the end of 2008. Concurrent with these declining higher risk balances, we've also grown our government-guaranteed loan portfolio which now totals over $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher risk balances, combined with growth in government-guaranteed loans, constitute a substantial improvement in our risk profile.
During the second quarter, high-risk balances declined by about $700 million or 6%, with roughly half of that coming from Commercial Construction. Relative to the prior year, balances are down about $3.8 billion or 25%, with significant declines in each of the categories you see on this slide. We expect declines in the high-risk portfolios to continue in the future, although given their smaller aggregate balance, the absolute dollar decline could moderate somewhat. As such, the runoff in these portfolios could be less of a headwind for total loan growth than it has been in prior periods.
Turning to Slide 7 for a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up $1.2 billion from the first quarter, reaching a record level of $121.9 billion. The favorable shift in the deposit mix towards lower cost accounts continued, most notably by a DDA growth of $1.6 billion 5.5%. Higher cost time deposits declined $300 million. And now accounts also decreased in part due to public fund migrations into DDA. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, average deposits were up $5.4 billion or 4.7%. This growth was entirely from lower cost accounts, primarily DDA and money market, which increased by a combined $9.5 billion. This growth and lower cost accounts has enabled us to manage down our higher cost deposits, which decreased by $4.3 billion or 18% from the prior year.
Slide 8 covers net interest income, which declined modestly from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due -- which had increased modestly, I'm sorry, from the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to the account. The net interest margin, after expanding for 8 consecutive quarters, stabilized at 3.35%. Interest earning asset yields declined 5 basis points due to lower loan deals. This was offset by a 7 basis point contraction in interest-bearing liability costs due to the favorable deposit mix shift, lower rates paid and a reduction in our long-term debt costs.
Relative to last year, net interest income increased by $78 million or 6%. The net interest margin expanded by 20 basis points. Favorable deposit trends were the primary drivers of rates paid decline and lower cost deposit accounts increased. The enhanced liquidity position also enabled an almost $3 billion or 17% reduction in our average long-term debt balances. As we look to the third quarter, while we see both headwinds and tailwinds to the margin, our current expectation is for a modest decline due primarily to further decreases in interest earning asset yields resulting from the lower rate environment.
Let's turn to noninterest income. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our non-interest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market accounts. And we've included these details in the appendix. After adjustments, noninterest income increased $37 million or 5% sequentially. Most prominent was the $28 million increase in Investment Banking due to strong syndicated financial revenue and another really good quarter for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, our Investment Banking business. While the Investment Banking line item has and continued to experience volatility due to market factors, it's clear that the investments we've been making in our Corporate and Investment Banking business are paying off.
Other notable sequential quarter increases in fee income include a deposit service charges and card fees. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income was up $53 million or 7% despite the $38 million decline in deposits service charges due primarily to Reg E.
We saw increases across a broad range of consumer and commercial categories, including growth of $11 million or 12% from higher debit interchange, revenue and retail investment services growth of $11 million or 23%.
Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. This is the same information that we've shown you for the last few quarters, reordered just a little bit. The top left shows new repurchase demands which were $348 million in the second quarter. That's up by $35 million from the prior quarter, $26 million of which was from the 2007 vintage. As you see at the bottom of that table, a very limited amount of the demands, only 5% this quarter are nonagency related. As a result of the new demands, the pending population, which is shown at the top right part of the page, grew to $472 million. In light of this larger pending population, we've increased the mortgage repurchase reserves to $299 million, which is shown on the bottom left portion of the slide. You'll also see that the income statement impact this quarter grew to $90 million despite the actual charge-offs declining to $61 million. While demands will likely continue to be volatile on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we continued to believe that demands from the higher loss 2006 to 2007 vintages will decline as normal seasoning patterns occur.
Let's now turn to Slide 11 for a review of expenses. Expenses were up $77 million on a sequential quarter basis. Credit-related expenses accounted for $37 million or about half of this increase due to legal and compliance-related accruals. We also saw a $10 million increase in the FDIC premium due to the new asset-based assessment methodology. So overall, I'd characterize the growth in expenses as primarily due to the credit and regulatory environment, but I'd also say that at roughly $1.5 billion a quarter which is where we've been plus or minus, our expense base is too high for this environment. Bill will speak momentarily to our efficiency improvement focus.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense was up by about $100 million and you see the factors listed on this slide. Compensation was the highest driver due to improved revenue in certain businesses, as well as for additional team mates that we've hired primarily in client facing and loss mitigation positions. Let's switch to Slide 12 for a review of credit quality.
Our asset quality story is a good one again this quarter. We continued and in some cases, accelerated the multi-quarter trend of improvement that we've seen in all of our primary metrics. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 73 basis points, down 7 basis points from the prior quarter. Delinquency declines were evident across most loan categories, notably an 18 basis point improvement in nonguaranteed mortgages, following the 27 basis point improvement last quarter. Commercial and consumer loan delinquency rates of 22 and 66 basis points, respectively, are at relatively low levels. As such, we believe that any future improvements in delinquencies will be driven by the residential segment and be influenced by the overall health of the economy.
Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were down 9% and 10%, respectively, and we also saw a reduction in NPL inflows. Net charge-offs also showed notable improvements, declining from the first quarter by 12%, while the net charge-off ratio fell 25 basis points.
In light of the improvement in credit quality and the continued reduction in our risk profile, the allowance for loan losses declined by 4% in the first quarter to $2.7 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 13 for some additional detail on nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by loan segments. Like last quarter, we've also provided some supplemental information by loan class in the appendix. The $361 million sequential decline in nonperforming loans marked the eighth consecutive quarterly decline, and was primarily due to our commercial segment, including a 25% reduction in Commercial Construction. Reductions in almost all other loan classes occurred as well. The $1.1 billion or 23% decline in nonperforming loans from 2010 was largely driven by Commercial Construction, nonguaranteed mortgages and C&I.
Net charge-offs are shown at the bottom of the page and the $66 million sequential decline was driven by our residential segment, specifically by the nonguaranteed mortgage and Home Equity portfolios. The $217 million or 30% improvement in charge-offs from the prior year was widespread across loan categories, with the largest dollar declines coming from nonguaranteed mortgages, commercial construction and residential construction.
Overall, we are pleased with the direction in which all of our credit metrics are moving. The early-stage delinquency data indicate we may expect these trends to continue. Therefore, as we look to the rest of this year, we expect NPLs to continue to decline. We also expect net charge-offs to continue to trend favorably overtime, although given the significant second quarter decline, third quarter net charge-offs are likely to approximate those of the second quarter, plus or minus.
I'll continue my comments by focusing on capital. Capital ratios continued their expansion this quarter and remained well above regulatory minimums and the proposed Basel III ratios. Tier 1 Common grew by an estimated 15 basis points to 9.2%, while Tier 1 was up by an estimated 10 basis points to 11.1%. Tangible common equity ratio expanded to 7.96% and tangible book value per share increased to $24.57.
I'll conclude by noting that in light of the improved earnings per share we have generated this year, as well as the momentum that we're demonstrating in several of our businesses, we intend to request a modest dividend increase from our Board of Directors during the second half of this year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Now I'll turn you to Slide 15 and as you'll remember, we are organized around a consumer and wholesale businesses and this outlined several accomplishments in both. I'm not going to detail all of them this morning but I'll point to the fact we that continue to make progress as we pursue a strategy that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients, thereby, fostering loyalty which helps us in attracting, retaining and expanding relationships. A few highlights from the quarter on these areas where we succeeded include retail client loyalty which continues to improve and it's exceeding our internal benchmarks; the loan production in the consumer business while still low, is up 14% over the same quarter in 2010; Corporate and Investment Banking experienced its second-highest quarter of revenue generation and its third highest quarter of net income. Diversified Commercial Banking net income is up over 40% year-to-date, with favorable trends in both client acquisition and attrition as compared to last year. So overall, we continued to be pleased with the progress we've made, adding more importantly, with the momentum we've established. Now as you're all aware and in light of regulatory changes, banks are evaluating how to charge for their services. We have invested significantly in the science of understanding consumers behaviors and needs and clearly, that has shown us that attitudes about money and banking are evolving. So in response, we have reviewed our consumer product offerings to ensure they remain relevant, competitive and profitable.
This quarter we announced some key changes to our checking account portfolio. And as part of these changes, we've simplified our products suite. We discontinued free checking and introduced products that respond to how clients use their bank, including our new core product, everyday checking. This is one of the means by which we're both responding to clients needs and mitigating the impact from regulation that are impacting our revenue stream. I'll outline a few more monetarily. But now that we've had clarity on the Durbin amendment, let me first provide some transparency around our estimates of the run rate impact of that particular piece of legislation and its impact on fee income.
Now based on our business mix, we estimate the Durbin will have a 50% annualized impact before any mitigating actions. So to give you some additional context, our year-to-date annual debit interchange revenue is approximately $370 million. As you're aware of the final rules will not be implemented until the beginning of the fourth quarter, so we'll only a experience a small percentage of this in calendar 2011.
And we've been evaluating the variety of methods to mitigate both the impacts of Durbin and Reg E. And you will recall that we made no immediate changes to our products or fees in response to Reg E, as we wanted to monitor both the competitive and regulatory dynamics. Now with some additional clarity on both fronts and with a lot of client insights, we've moved in to implementation mode on certain mitigation efforts.
Now, for example, we recently eliminated our debit rewards program and I told you about the current rollout of our new checking product set. We also have other value-added checking features that we plan to introduce later, which we believe will be beneficial to our clients, as well as enhance our deposit fee income. So collectively and over time, we currently estimate that the benefits from all of these changes will enable us to recapture around 50% of the revenue lost from both Durbin and Reg E.
Now I want to emphasize that we've been very deliberate in this process and we spent a lot of time garnering feedback from our clients. During the implementation of Reg E, we received accolades from our clients and within industry in terms of client satisfaction and with our communication efforts. We needed to understand the final impacts of both Reg E and Durbin before we rolled out our new product set. In the last few months, I've been in virtually all 4 corners of our retail franchise and I'm really pleased with our teammates responsiveness. The early results are exceeding our expectations and producing more primary accounts and accounts from higher balances.
Now let me turn to the last slide for our closing remarks. Now overall, we had some encouraging signs during the quarter, growth in targeted loan categories, a continued favorable shift in the deposit mix, good growth in certain fee areas and continued encouraging asset quality trends. Now while our results aren't yet where we'd like them to be, progress is being made, momentum is building, and we have specific initiatives aimed at accelerating our performance in the future. Somebody's efforts are designed to further improve our revenue generation and we feel good about our prospects, particularly as the economy improves and provides a little bi of tailwind.
Now we also recognized that the expenses or the run rate is just simply too high for this new environment. As a result, we also have initiatives underway to lower our expense base with a targeted run rate reduction of $300 million by the end of 2013. Now similar to our successful E square expense reduction initiatives a few years ago, there are multiple tactics involve that are structural and will accrue benefits over a period of time. And I'll just take a moment or 2 to give you a flavor of how we plan to do this.
First, a key focus will be on implementing an aggressive approach to what's commonly referred to as shared services, wherein we will centralize and eliminate redundancy of similar functions currently housed in multiple parts of the organization. This will allow us to more effectively balance costs, quality and service so we can more efficiently meet the needs of our lines of business, geographies and support projects. We've identified enterprisewide solutions, and such disciplines as technology and operations, finance, procurement, marketing and human resources to maximize their impact and improve their efficiency. Further, our supplier management efforts will be intensified to yield greater cost savings, and plans to reduce paper usage both within the organization and our interaction with clients will be accelerated.
While we're not approaching this as a headcount reduction exercise per se, we'll be providing these service with fewer people in the future. Our clients continued to demonstrate an increasing preference for more technology driven self-service channels such as a more robust ATM network and enhanced mobile banking platforms. This increase and convenience for clients also results in lower delivery costs and improved efficiency in the branch network. As all these reductions are intended to produce permanent alterations to our expense space versus the quick fix, only a small portion will be realized in 2011, while we expect that it will have approximately 80% of the expense savings in our run rate by the end of 2012 with the remainder occurring in 2013. So to be clear, these expense reductions are above and beyond those that we expect to normalize as the environment improves. Credit related noninterest expenses, for example, have been running about $700 million in annual or roughly 12% of our expense base. That's several multiples above where they were pre-cycle and a big drag on our efficiency ratio. Even if these expenses normalized to a level somewhat higher than they were pre-cycle, there are still several hundred million dollars in credit-related expenses that over time, we expect to come out of our expense run rate as the environment improves.
Our individual efforts and an improving economy are ingredients to our overall effort to permanently reduce our normalized efficiency ratio to under 60%, getting to that level will take some time and the realization is in part dependent upon an improving economy, but at outlined elements if we can impact regardless. And I can assure you we will receive the intensity. It's important to note our efforts will be focused on driving expense savings, without compromising the high service levels that our clients have come to expect we believe strategically differentiate us from our competitors.
So put another way, we are approaching this as we approach all aspects of our business. With a focus on the guiding principles of our operating philosophy, putting the client first by viewing the relationship to the eyes of those who choose our services, building a team and focusing on profitable growth by operating efficiently and investing prudently. This planned development has been a team effort and I have great confidence and a strong belief in our franchise potential and ability to deliver. So Kris, let me turn it over to you and we can start the Q&A."

I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the firs",2042,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.
Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the first quarter reported EPS of $0.08 or $0.22 when adjusted for the noncash charge associated with TARP redemption. The primary drivers of the sequential EPS growth were a lower provision due to continued improvements in credit quality, higher fee income across multiple categories and lower preferred dividends due to TARP redemption, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. 
These results also compare very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and lower preferred dividends. I'll share additional color on our performance in a moment, so let's turn to Page 5 for a review of the loan portfolio.
Average performing loans were flat compared to first quarter levels of $111 billion. However, we continued to make progress in diversifying the loan portfolio as we drove growth in targeted commercial and consumer areas while further reducing our residential real estate portfolio. We also continued to de-risk the portfolio, and I'll share more detail with you about that later. Growth this quarter within the commercial segment was driven by C&I loans, which increased by $1 billion or more than 2%. This growth came generally from larger corporate borrowers and was most pronounced within the areas that we've been targeting for growth, such as asset-based lending, middle market and certain industry verticals within our Corporate and Investment Banking business.
The consumer segment expanded modestly, driven by guaranteed student loans. Conversely, residential loans declined by about $650 million, a similar amount to last quarter, mostly due to lower non-guaranteed mortgage and home equity balances.
Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by about $3 billion or almost 3%. This growth was driven by consumer loans, which were up about $4 billion, specifically in student loans and indirect. Residential balances were down marginally as non-guaranteed mortgages and home equity balances both declined by about $1 billion, which more than offset the growth in the guaranteed mortgage portfolio. The commercial segment also declined, primarily due to intentional reductions in commercial construction, as well as lower commercial real estate balances, which more than offset the C&I growth that we've experienced for the last several quarters.
Overall, loan growth and loan demand remained weaker than we would like, but we are pleased with our progress in growing selected areas of the portfolio, while concurrently reducing risk. Further detail on this risk reduction is on Slide 6.
This page provides a visual of the trends in loans that, for this purpose, we categorize as higher risk. These portfolios now total $11.4 billion and have been declining consistently and meaningfully, down over 50% since the end of 2008. Concurrent with these declining higher risk balances, we've also grown our government-guaranteed loan portfolio, which now totals over $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher-risk balances, combined with growth in government-guaranteed loans, constitute a substantial improvement in our risk profile.
During the second quarter, high-risk balances declined by about $700 million or 6%, with roughly half of that coming from commercial construction. Relative to the prior year, balances are down about $3.8 billion or 25%, with significant declines in each of the categories you see on this slide. We expect declines in the higher-risk portfolios to continue in the future, although, given their smaller aggregate balance, the absolute dollar decline could moderate somewhat. As such, the runoff in these portfolios could be less of a headwind for total loan growth than it has been in prior periods.
Turning to Slide 7 for a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up $1.2 billion from the first quarter, reaching a record level of $121.9 billion. The favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower-cost accounts continued, most notably by a DDA growth of $1.6 billion or 5.5%. Higher-cost time deposits declined $300 million. And NOW accounts also decreased in part due to public fund migrations into DDA. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, average deposits were up $5.4 billion or 4.7%. This growth was entirely from lower-cost accounts, primarily DDA and Money Market, which increased by a combined $9.5 billion. This growth and lower cost accounts has enabled us to manage down our higher-cost time deposits, which decreased by $4.3 billion or 18% from the prior year.
Slide 8 covers net interest income, which declined modestly from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due -- which had increased modestly, I'm sorry, from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due day count. The net interest margin, after expanding for 8 consecutive quarters, stabilized at 3.53%. Interest-earning asset yields declined 5 basis points due to lower loan yields. This was offset by a 7-basis-point contraction in interest-bearing liability costs due to the favorable deposit mix shift, lower rates paid and a reduction in our long-term debt costs.
Relative to last year, net interest income increased by $78 million or 6%. The net interest margin expanded by 20 basis points. Favorable deposit trends were the primary drivers as rates paid declined and lower-cost deposit accounts increased. The enhanced liquidity position also enabled an almost $3 billion or 17% reduction in our average long-term debt balances. As we look to the third quarter, while we see both headwinds and tailwinds to the margin, our current expectation is for a modest decline, due primarily to further decreases in interest-earning asset yields resulting from the low rate environment.
Let's turn to noninterest income. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our noninterest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market accounts. And we've included these details in the appendix. After adjustments, noninterest income increased $37 million or 5% sequentially. Most prominent was the $28 million increase in investment banking due to strong syndicated financial revenue and another really good quarter for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, our investment banking business. While the investment banking line item has and continued to experience volatility due to market factors, it's clear that the investments we've been making in our Corporate and Investment Banking business are paying off.
Other notable sequential quarter increases in fee income included deposit service charges and card fees. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income was up $53 million or 7% despite the $38 million decline in deposit service charges due primarily to Reg E.
We saw increases across a broad range of consumer and commercial categories, including growth of $11 million or 12% from higher debit interchange revenue and retail investment services growth of $11 million or 23%.
Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. This is the same information that we've shown you for the last few quarters, reordered just a little bit. The top left shows new repurchase demands, which were $348 million in the second quarter. That's up by $35 million from the prior quarter, $26 million of which was from the 2007 vintage. As you see at the bottom of that table, a very limited amount of the demands, only 5% this quarter, are non-agency related. As a result of the new demands, the pending population, which is shown at the top right part of the page, grew to $472 million. In light of this larger pending population, we've increased the mortgage repurchase reserves to $299 million, which is shown on the bottom left portion of the slide. You'll also see that the income statement impact this quarter grew to $90 million despite actual charge-offs declining to $61 million. While demands will likely continue to be volatile on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we continue to believe that demands from the higher-loss 2006 to 2007 vintages will decline as normal seasoning patterns occur.
Let's now turn to Slide 11 for a review of expenses. Expenses were up $77 million on a sequential quarter basis. Credit-related expenses accounted for $37 million or about half of this increase due to legal and compliance-related accruals. We also saw a $10 million increase in the FDIC premium due to the new asset-based assessment methodology. So overall, I'd characterize the growth in expenses as primarily due to the credit and regulatory environment, but I'd also say that at roughly $1.5 billion a quarter, which is where we've been plus or minus, our expense base is too high for this environment. Bill will speak momentarily to our efficiency improvement focus.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense was up by about $100 million and you see the factors listed on this slide. Compensation was the highest driver due to improved revenue in certain businesses, as well as for additional teammates that we've hired, primarily in client-facing and loss-mitigation positions. Let's switch to Slide 12 for a review of credit quality.
Our asset quality story is a good one again this quarter. We continued and, in some cases, accelerated the multi-quarter trend of improvement that we've seen in all of our primary metrics. Early stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 73 basis points, down 7 basis points from the prior quarter. Delinquency declines were evident across most loan categories, notably an 18 basis point improvement in non-guaranteed mortgages following the 27 basis point improvement last quarter. Commercial and consumer loan delinquency rates of 22 and 66 basis points, respectively, are at relatively low levels. As such, we believe that any future improvements in delinquencies will be driven by the residential segment and be influenced by the overall health of the economy.
Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were down 9% and 10%, respectively, and we also saw a reduction in NPL inflows. Net charge-offs also showed notable improvements, declining from the first quarter by 12%, while the net charge-off ratio fell 25 basis points.
In light of the improvement in credit quality and the continued reduction in our risk profile, the allowance for loan losses declined by 4% in the first quarter to $2.7 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 13 for some additional detail on nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by loan segment. Like last quarter, we've also provided some supplemental information by loan class in the appendix. The $361 million sequential decline in nonperforming loans marked the eighth consecutive quarterly decline and was primarily due to our commercial segment, including a 25% reduction in commercial construction. Reductions in almost all other loan classes occurred as well. The $1.1 billion or 23% decline in nonperforming loans from 2010 was largely driven by commercial construction, non-guaranteed mortgages and C&I.
Net charge-offs are shown at the bottom of the page, and the $66 million sequential decline was driven by our residential segment, specifically by the non-guaranteed mortgage and home equity portfolios. The $217 million or 30% improvement in charge-offs from the prior year was widespread across loan categories, with the largest dollar declines coming from non-guaranteed mortgages, commercial construction and residential construction.
Overall, we're pleased with the direction in which all of our credit metrics are moving. The early-stage delinquency data indicate we may expect these trends to continue. Therefore, as we look to the rest of this year, we expect NPLs to continue to decline. We also expect net charge-offs to continue to trend favorably over time, although given the significant second quarter decline, third quarter net charge-offs are likely to approximate those of the second quarter, plus or minus.
I'll continue my comments by focusing on capital. Capital ratios continued their expansion this quarter and remained well above regulatory minimums and the proposed Basel III ratios. Tier 1 common grew by an estimated 15 basis points to 9.2%, while Tier 1 was up by an estimated 10 basis points to 11.1%. Tangible common equity ratio expanded to 7.96% and tangible book value per share increased to $24.57.
I'll conclude by noting that in light of the improved earnings per share we have generated this year, as well as the momentum that we're demonstrating in several of our businesses, we intend to request a modest dividend increase from our Board of Directors during the second half of this year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Now I'll turn you to Slide 15, and as you'll remember, we're organized around a consumer and wholesale businesses and this outlined several accomplishments in both. I'm not going to detail all of them this morning, but I'll point to the fact that we continue to make progress as we pursue a strategy that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients, thereby fostering loyalty, which helps us in attracting, retaining and expanding relationships. 
A few highlights from the quarter on these areas where we succeeded include: Retail client loyalty, which continues to improve and is exceeding our internal benchmarks. The loan production in the consumer business, while still low, is up 14% over the same quarter in 2010. Corporate and Investment Banking experienced its second-highest quarter of revenue generation and its third highest quarter of net income. Diversified Commercial Banking net income is up over 40% year-to-date, with favorable trends in both client acquisition and attrition as compared to last year. So overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we've made, I think more importantly, with the momentum we've established. Now as you're all aware, and in light of regulatory changes, banks are evaluating how to charge for their services. We have invested significantly in the science of understanding consumers' behaviors and needs and clearly, that has shown us that attitudes about money and banking are evolving. So in response, we have reviewed our consumer product offerings to ensure they remain relevant, competitive and profitable.
This quarter we announced some key changes to our checking account portfolio. And as part of these changes, we've simplified our products suite. We've discontinued free checking and introduced products that respond to how clients use their bank, including our new core product, Everyday Checking. This is one of the means by which we're both responding to clients' needs and mitigating the impact from regulation that are impacting our revenue stream. I'll outline a few more monetarily. But now that we've had clarity on the Durbin amendment, let me first provide some transparency around our estimates to the run rate impact of that particular piece of legislation and its impact on fee income.
Now based on our business mix, we estimate that Durbin will have a 50% annualized impact before any mitigating actions. So to give you some additional context, our year-to-date annual debit interchange revenue is approximately $370 million. And as you're aware, the final rules will not be implemented until the beginning of the fourth quarter, so we'll only experience a small percentage of this in calendar 2011.
And we've been evaluating a variety of methods to mitigate both the impacts of Durbin and Reg E. And you will recall that we made no immediate changes to our products or fees in response to Reg E as we wanted to monitor both the competitive and regulatory dynamics. Now with some additional clarity on both fronts and with a lot of client insights, we've moved into implementation mode on certain mitigation efforts.
Now for example, we recently eliminated our debit rewards program, and I told you about the current rollout of our new checking product set. We also have other value-added checking features that we plan to introduce later, which we believe will be beneficial to our clients, as well as enhance our deposit fee income. So collectively and over time, we currently estimate that the benefits from all these changes will enable us to recapture around 50% of the revenue lost from both Durbin and Reg E.
Now I want to emphasize that we've been very deliberate in this process, and we spent a lot of time garnering feedback from our clients. During the implementation of Reg E, we received accolades from our clients and within the industry in terms of client satisfaction and with our communication efforts. We needed to understand the final impacts of both Reg E and Durbin before we rolled out our new product set. In the last few months, I've been in virtually all 4 corners of our retail franchise, and I'm really pleased with our teammates' responsiveness. The early results are exceeding our expectations and producing more primary accounts and accounts with higher balances.
Now let me turn to the last slide for our closing remarks. Now overall, we had some encouraging signs during the quarter, growth in targeted loan categories, a continued favorable shift in the deposit mix, good growth in certain fee areas and continued encouraging asset quality trends. Now while our results aren't yet where we'd like them to be, progress is being made, momentum is building, and we have specific initiatives aimed at accelerating our performance in the future. Some of these efforts are designed to further improve our revenue generation, and we feel good about our prospects, particularly as the economy improves and provides a little bit of tailwind.
Now we also recognize that expenses or the run rate is just simply too high for this new environment. As a result, we also have initiatives underway to lower our expense base with a targeted run rate reduction of $300 million by the end of 2013. Now similar to our successful E squared expense reduction initiatives a few years ago, there are multiple tactics involved that are structural and will accrue benefits over a period of time. And I'll just take a moment or 2 to give you a flavor of how we plan to do this.
First, a key focus will be on implementing an aggressive approach to what's commonly referred to as shared services wherein we will centralize and eliminate redundancy of similar functions currently housed in multiple parts of the organization. This will allow us to more effectively balance costs, quality and service, so we can more efficiently meet the needs of our lines of business, geographies and support projects. We've identified enterprise-wide solutions and such disciplines as technology and operations, finance, procurement, marketing and human resources to maximize their impact and improve their efficiency. Further, our supplier management efforts will be intensified to yield greater cost savings, and plans to reduce paper usage both within the organization and our interaction with clients will be accelerated.
And while we're not approaching this as a headcount reduction exercise per se, we will be providing new services with fewer people in the future. Our clients continued to demonstrate an increasing preference for more technology-driven, self-service channels such as a more robust ATM network and enhanced mobile banking platforms. This increase and convenience for clients also results in lower delivery costs and improved efficiency in the branch network. As all of these reductions are intended to produce permanent alterations to our expense base versus a quick fix, only a small portion will be realized in 2011, while we expect that we'll have approximately 80% of the expense savings in our run rate by the end of 2012, with the remainder occurring in 2013. 
So to be clear, these expense reductions are above and beyond those that we expect to normalize as the environment improves. Credit-related noninterest expenses, for example, have been running about $700 million in annual clip or roughly 12% of our expense base. That's several multiples above where they were pre-cycle and a big drag on our efficiency ratio. Even if these expenses normalized to a level somewhat higher than they were pre-cycle, there are still several hundred million dollars in credit-related expenses that, over time, we expect to come out of our current expense run rate as the environment improves.
Our individual efforts and an improving economy are ingredients to our overall effort to permanently reduce our normalized efficiency ratio to under 60%. Getting to that level will take some time, and the realization of it is in part dependent upon an improving economy, but I've outlined elements that we can impact regardless. And I can assure you they we will receive the requisite intensity. It's important to note our efforts will be focused on driving expense savings without compromising the high service levels that our clients have come to expect and we believe strategically differentiate us from our competitors.
So put another way, we are approaching this as we approach all aspects of our business: with a focus on the guiding principles of our operating philosophy, putting the client first by viewing the relationship through the eyes of those who choose our services, building a [indiscernible] team and focusing on profitable growth by operating efficiently and investing prudently. This planned development has been a team effort, and I have great confidence and a strong belief in our franchise potential and ability to deliver. So Kris, let me turn it over to you, and we can start the Q&A."

I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the firs",2040,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.
Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the first quarter reported EPS of $0.08 or $0.22 when adjusted for the noncash charge associated with TARP redemption. The primary drivers of the sequential EPS growth were a lower provision due to continued improvements in credit quality, higher fee income across multiple categories and lower preferred dividends due to TARP redemption, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. 
These results also compare very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and lower preferred dividends. I'll share additional color on our performance in a moment, so let's turn to Page 5 for a review of the loan portfolio.
Average performing loans were flat compared to first quarter levels of $111 billion. However, we continued to make progress in diversifying the loan portfolio as we drove growth in targeted commercial and consumer areas while further reducing our residential real estate exposure. We also continued to de-risk the portfolio, and I'll share more detail with you about that later. Growth this quarter within the commercial segment was driven by C&I loans, which increased by $1 billion or more than 2%. This growth came generally from larger corporate borrowers and was most pronounced within areas that we've been targeting for growth, such as asset-based lending, middle market and certain industry verticals within our Corporate and Investment Banking business.
The consumer segment expanded modestly, driven by guaranteed student loans. Conversely, residential loans declined by about $650 million, a similar amount to last quarter, mostly due to lower non-guaranteed mortgage and home equity balances.
Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by about $3 billion or almost 3%. This growth was driven by consumer loans, which were up about $4 billion, specifically in student loans and indirect. Residential balances were down marginally as non-guaranteed mortgages and home equity balances both declined by about $1 billion, which more than offset the growth in the guaranteed mortgage portfolio. The commercial segment also declined, primarily due to intentional reductions in commercial construction, as well as lower commercial real estate balances, which more than offset the C&I growth that we've experienced for the last several quarters.
Overall, loan growth and loan demand remained weaker than we would like, but we are pleased with our progress in growing selected areas of the portfolio, while concurrently reducing risk. Further detail on this risk reduction is on Slide 6.
This page provides a visual of the trends in loans that, for this purpose, we categorize as higher risk. These portfolios now total $11.4 billion and have been declining consistently and meaningfully, down over 50% since the end of 2008. Concurrent with these declining higher risk balances, we've also grown our government-guaranteed loan portfolio, which now totals over $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher-risk balances, combined with growth in government-guaranteed loans, constitute a substantial improvement in our risk profile.
During the second quarter, higher-risk balances declined by about $700 million or 6%, with roughly half of that coming from commercial construction. Relative to the prior year, balances are down about $3.8 billion or 25%, with significant declines in each of the categories you see on this slide. We expect declines in the higher-risk portfolios to continue in the future, although, given their smaller aggregate balance, the absolute dollar decline could moderate somewhat. As such, the runoff in these portfolios could be less of a headwind for total loan growth than it has been in prior periods.
Turning to Slide 7 for a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up $1.2 billion from the first quarter, reaching a record level of $121.9 billion. The favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower-cost accounts continued, most notably by a DDA growth of $1.6 billion or 5.5%. Higher-cost time deposits declined $300 million. And NOW accounts also decreased in part due to public fund migrations into DDA. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, average deposits were up $5.4 billion or 4.7%. This growth was entirely from lower-cost accounts, primarily DDA and Money Market, which increased by a combined $9.5 billion. This growth in lower cost accounts has enabled us to manage down our higher-cost time deposits, which decreased by $4.3 billion or 18% from the prior year.
Slide 8 covers net interest income, which declined modestly from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due -- which has increased modestly, I'm sorry, from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to day count. The net interest margin, after expanding for 8 consecutive quarters, stabilized at 3.53%. Interest-earning asset yields declined 5 basis points due to lower loan yields. This was offset by a 7-basis-point contraction in interest-bearing liability costs due to the favorable deposit mix shift, lower rates paid and a reduction in our long-term debt costs.
Relative to last year, net interest income increased by $78 million or 6%. The net interest margin expanded by 20 basis points. Favorable deposit trends were the primary drivers as rates paid declined and lower-cost deposit accounts increased. The enhanced liquidity position also enabled an almost $3 billion or 17% reduction in our average long-term debt balances. As we look to the third quarter, while we see both headwinds and tailwinds to the margin, our current expectation is for a modest decline, due primarily to further decreases in interest-earning asset yields resulting from the low-rate environment.
Let's turn to noninterest income. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our noninterest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market accounts. And we've included these details in the appendix. After adjustments, noninterest income increased $37 million or 5% sequentially. Most prominent was the $28 million increase in investment banking due to strong syndicated financial revenue and another really good quarter for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, our investment banking business. While the investment banking line item has and continued to experience volatility due to market factors, it's clear that the investments we've been making in our Corporate and Investment Banking businesses are paying off.
Other notable sequential quarter increases in fee income included deposit service charges and card fees. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income was up $53 million or 7% despite the $38 million decline in deposit service charges due primarily to Reg E.
We saw increases across a broad range of consumer and commercial categories, including growth of $11 million or 12% from higher debit interchange revenue and retail investment services growth of $11 million or 23%.
Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. This is the same information that we've shown you for the last few quarters, reordered just a little bit. The top left shows new repurchase demands, which were $348 million in the second quarter. That's up by $35 million from the prior quarter, $26 million of which was from the 2007 vintage. As you see at the bottom of that table, a very limited amount of the demands, only 5% this quarter, are non-agency related. As a result of the new demands, the pending population, which is shown at the top right part of the page, grew to $472 million. In light of this larger pending population, we've increased the mortgage repurchase reserves to $299 million, which is shown on the bottom left portion of the slide. You'll also see that the income statement impact this quarter grew to $90 million despite actual charge-offs declining to $61 million. While demands will likely continue to be volatile on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we continue to believe that demands from the higher-loss 2006 and 2007 vintages will decline as normal seasoning patterns occur.
Let's now turn to Slide 11 for a review of expenses. Expenses were up $77 million on a sequential quarter basis. Credit-related expenses accounted for $37 million or about half of this increase due to legal and compliance-related accruals. We also saw a $10 million increase in the FDIC premium due to the new asset-based assessment methodology. So overall, I'd characterize the growth in expenses as primarily due to the credit and regulatory environment, but I'd also say that at roughly $1.5 billion a quarter, which is where we've been plus or minus, our expense base is too high for this environment. Bill will speak momentarily to our efficiency improvement focus.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense was up by about $100 million and you see the factors listed on this slide. Compensation was the highest driver due to improved revenue in certain businesses, as well as for additional teammates that we've hired, primarily in client-facing and loss-mitigation positions. Let's switch to Slide 12 for a review of credit quality.
Our asset quality story is a good one again this quarter. We continued and, in some cases, accelerated the multi-quarter trend of improvement that we've seen in all of our primary metrics. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 73 basis points, down 7 basis points from the prior quarter. Delinquency declines were evident across most loan categories, notably an 18 basis point improvement in non-guaranteed mortgages following the 27 basis point improvement last quarter. Commercial and consumer loan delinquency rates of 22 and 66 basis points, respectively, are at relatively low levels. As such, we believe that any future improvements in delinquencies will be driven by the residential segment and be influenced by the overall health of the economy.
Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were down 9% and 10%, respectively, and we also saw a reduction in NPL inflows. Net charge-offs also showed notable improvements, declining from the first quarter by 12%, while the net charge-off ratio fell 25 basis points.
In light of the improvement in credit quality and the continued reduction in our risk profile, the allowance for loan losses declined by 4% for the first quarter to $2.7 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 13 for some additional detail on nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by loan segment. Like last quarter, we've also provided some supplemental information by loan class in the appendix. The $361 million sequential decline in nonperforming loans marked the eighth consecutive quarterly decline and was primarily due to our commercial segment, including a 25% reduction in commercial construction. Reductions in almost all other loan classes occurred as well. The $1.1 billion or 23% decline in nonperforming loans from 2010 was largely driven by commercial construction, non-guaranteed mortgages and C&I.
Net charge-offs are shown at the bottom of the page, and the $66 million sequential decline was driven by our residential segment, specifically by the non-guaranteed mortgage and home equity portfolios. The $217 million or 30% improvement in charge-offs from the prior year was widespread across loan categories, with the largest dollar declines coming from non-guaranteed mortgages, commercial construction and residential construction.
Overall, we're pleased with the direction in which all of our credit metrics are moving. The early-stage delinquency data indicate we may expect these trends to continue. Therefore, as we look to the rest of this year, we expect NPLs to continue to decline. We also expect net charge-offs to continue to trend favorably over time, although given the significant second quarter decline, third quarter net charge-offs are likely to approximate those of the second quarter, plus or minus.
I'll continue my comments by focusing on capital. Capital ratios continued their expansion this quarter and remained well above regulatory minimums and the proposed Basel III ratios. Tier 1 common grew by an estimated 15 basis points to 9.2%, while Tier 1 was up by an estimated 10 basis points to 11.1%. Tangible common equity ratio expanded to 7.96% and tangible book value per share increased to $24.57.
I'll conclude by noting that in light of the improved earnings per share we have generated this year, as well as the momentum that we're demonstrating in several of our businesses, we intend to request a modest dividend increase from our Board of Directors during the second half of this year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Now I'll turn you to Slide 15, and as you'll remember, we're organized around a consumer and wholesale businesses and this outlines several of the accomplishments in both. I'm not going to detail all of them this morning, but I'll point to the fact that we continue to make progress as we pursue a strategy that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients, thereby fostering loyalty, which helps us in attracting, retaining and expanding relationships. 
A few highlights from the quarter on these areas where we've succeeded include: Retail client loyalty, which continues to improve and is exceeding our internal benchmarks. The loan production in the consumer businesses, while still low, is up 14% over the same quarter in 2010. Corporate and Investment Banking experienced its second-highest quarter of revenue generation and its third highest quarter of net income. Diversified Commercial Banking net income is up over 40% year-to-date, with favorable trends in both client acquisition and attrition as compared to last year. So overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we've made, and I think more importantly, with the momentum we've established. Now as you're all aware, and in light of regulatory changes, banks are evaluating how they charge for their services. We have invested significantly in the science of understanding consumers' behaviors and needs and clearly, that has shown us that attitudes about money and banking are evolving. So in response, we have reviewed our consumer product offerings to ensure they remain relevant, competitive and profitable.
This quarter we announced some key changes to our checking account portfolio. And as part of these changes, we've simplified our products suite. We've discontinued free checking and introduced products that respond to how clients use their bank, including our new core product, Everyday Checking. This is one of the means by which we're both responding to clients' needs and mitigating the impact from regulations that are impacting our revenue stream. I'll outline a few more monetarily. But now that we've had clarity on the Durbin amendment, let me first provide some transparency around our estimates to the run rate impact of that particular piece of legislation and its impact on fee income.
Now based on our business mix, we estimate that Durbin will have a 50% annualized impact before any mitigating actions. So to give you some additional context, our year-to-date annual debit interchange revenue is approximately $370 million. And as you're aware, the final rules will not be implemented until the beginning of the fourth quarter, so we'll only experience a small percentage of this in calendar 2011.
And we've been evaluating a variety of methods to mitigate both the impacts of Durbin and Reg E. And you will recall that we made no immediate changes to our products or fees in response to Reg E as we wanted to monitor both the competitive and regulatory dynamics. Now with some additional clarity on both fronts and with a lot of client insights, we've moved into implementation mode on certain mitigation efforts.
Now for example, we recently eliminated our debit rewards program, and I told you about the current rollout of our new checking product set. We also have other value-added checking features that we plan to introduce later, which we believe will be beneficial to our clients, as well as enhance our deposit fee income. So collectively and over time, we currently estimate that the benefits from all these changes will enable us to recapture around 50% of the revenue lost from both Durbin and Reg E.
Now I want to emphasize that we've been very deliberate in this process, and we've spent a lot of time garnering feedback from our clients. During the implementation of Reg E, we received accolades from our clients and within the industry in terms of client satisfaction and with our communication efforts. We needed to understand the final impacts of both Reg E and Durbin before we rolled out our new product set. In the last few months, I've been in virtually all 4 corners of our retail franchise, and I'm really pleased with our teammates' responsiveness. The early results are exceeding our expectations and producing more primary accounts and accounts with higher balances.
Now let me turn to the last slide for closing remarks. Now overall, we had some encouraging signs during the quarter, growth in targeted loan categories, a continued favorable shift in the deposit mix, good growth in certain fee areas and continued encouraging asset quality trends. Now while our results aren't yet where we'd like them to be, progress is being made, momentum is building, and we have specific initiatives aimed at accelerating our performance in the future. Some of these efforts are designed to further improve our revenue generation, and we feel good about our prospects, particularly as the economy improves and provides a little bit of tailwind.
Now we also recognize that expenses or the run rate is just simply too high for this new environment. As a result, we also have initiatives underway to lower our expense base with a targeted run rate reduction of $300 million by the end of 2013. Now similar to our successful E squared expense reduction initiatives a few years ago, there are multiple tactics involved that are structural and will accrue benefits over a period of time. And I'll just take a moment or 2 to give you a flavor of how we plan to do this.
First, a key focus will be on implementing an aggressive approach to what's commonly referred to as shared services wherein we will centralize and eliminate redundancy of similar functions currently housed in multiple parts of the organization. This will allow us to more effectively balance costs, quality and service, so we can more efficiently meet the needs of our lines of business, geographies and support projects. We've identified enterprise-wide solutions in such disciplines as technology and operations, finance, procurement, marketing and human resources to maximize their impact and improve their efficiency. Further, our supplier management efforts will be intensified to yield greater cost savings, and plans to reduce paper usage both within the organization and our interaction with clients will be accelerated.
And while we're not approaching this as a headcount reduction exercise per se, we will be providing these services with fewer people in the future. Our clients continue to demonstrate an increasing preference for more technology-driven, self-service channels such as a more robust ATM network and enhanced mobile banking platforms. This increase in convenience for clients also results in lower delivery costs and improved efficiency in the branch network. As all of these reductions are intended to produce permanent alterations to our expense base versus a quick fix, only a small portion will be realized in 2011, while we expect that we'll have approximately 80% of the expense savings in our run rate by the end of 2012, with the remainder occurring in 2013. 
So to be clear, these expense reductions are above and beyond those that we expect to normalize as the environment improves. Credit-related noninterest expenses, for example, have been running about $700 million in annual clip or roughly 12% of our expense base. That's several multiples above where they were pre-cycle and a big drag on our efficiency ratio. Even if these expenses normalized to a level somewhat higher than they were pre-cycle, there are still several hundred million dollars in credit-related expenses that, over time, we expect to come out of our current expense run rate as the environment improves.
Our individual efforts and an improving economy are ingredients to our overall effort to permanently reduce our normalized efficiency ratio to under 60%. Getting to that level will take some time, and the realization of it is in part dependent upon an improving economy, but I've outlined elements that we can impact regardless. And I can assure you they we will receive the requisite intensity. It's important to note our efforts will be focused on driving expense savings without compromising the high service levels that our clients have come to expect and we believe strategically differentiate us from our competitors.
So put another way, we are approaching this as we approach all aspects of our business: with a focus on the guiding principles of our operating philosophy, putting the client first by viewing the relationship through the eyes of those who choose our services, building a [indiscernible] team and focusing on profitable growth by operating efficiently and investing prudently. This planned development has been a team effort, and I have great confidence and a strong belief in our franchise potential and ability to deliver. So Kris, let me turn it over to you, and we can start the Q&A."

This quarter, we had several which ended up actually just being net unfavorable, and that raised our effective tax rate. But if you think about what our normalized tax rate is and how that looks over time, as a general rule, think about us as having sort of $100 million to $120 million of tax-free income. So if you take a look at our overall income, subtract $100 million to $120 million per quarter of tax-free income and then apply our marginal rate to the remainder, you sort of get a generally effective tax rate number.

I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the firs",2040,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.
Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the first quarter reported EPS of $0.08 or $0.22 when adjusted for the noncash charge associated with TARP redemption. The primary drivers of the sequential EPS growth were a lower provision due to continued improvements in credit quality, higher fee income across multiple categories and lower preferred dividends due to TARP redemption, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. 
These results also compare very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and lower preferred dividends. I'll share additional color on our performance in a moment, so let's turn to Page 5 for a review of the loan portfolio.
Average performing loans were flat compared to first quarter levels of $111 billion. However, we continued to make progress in diversifying the loan portfolio as we drove growth in targeted commercial and consumer areas while further reducing our residential real estate exposure. We also continued to de-risk the portfolio, and I'll share more detail with you about that later. Growth this quarter within the commercial segment was driven by C&I loans, which increased by $1 billion or more than 2%. This growth came generally from larger corporate borrowers and was most pronounced within areas that we've been targeting for growth, such as asset-based lending, middle market and certain industry verticals within our Corporate and Investment Banking business.
The consumer segment expanded modestly, driven by guaranteed student loans. Conversely, residential loans declined by about $650 million, a similar amount to last quarter, mostly due to lower non-guaranteed mortgage and home equity balances.
Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by about $3 billion or almost 3%. This growth was driven by consumer loans, which were up about $4 billion, specifically in student loans and indirect. Residential balances were down marginally as non-guaranteed mortgages and home equity balances both declined by about $1 billion, which more than offset the growth in the guaranteed mortgage portfolio. The commercial segment also declined, primarily due to intentional reductions in commercial construction, as well as lower commercial real estate balances, which more than offset the C&I growth that we've experienced for the last several quarters.
Overall, loan growth and loan demand remained weaker than we would like, but we are pleased with our progress in growing selected areas of the portfolio, while concurrently reducing risk. Further detail on this risk reduction is on Slide 6.
This page provides a visual of the trends in loans that, for this purpose, we categorize as higher risk. These portfolios now total $11.4 billion and have been declining consistently and meaningfully, down over 50% since the end of 2008. Concurrent with these declining higher risk balances, we've also grown our government-guaranteed loan portfolio, which now totals over $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher-risk balances, combined with growth in government-guaranteed loans, constitute a substantial improvement in our risk profile.
During the second quarter, higher-risk balances declined by about $700 million or 6%, with roughly half of that coming from commercial construction. Relative to the prior year, balances are down about $3.8 billion or 25%, with significant declines in each of the categories you see on this slide. We expect declines in the higher-risk portfolios to continue in the future, although, given their smaller aggregate balance, the absolute dollar decline could moderate somewhat. As such, the runoff in these portfolios could be less of a headwind for total loan growth than it has been in prior periods.
Turning to Slide 7 for a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up $1.2 billion from the first quarter, reaching a record level of $121.9 billion. The favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower-cost accounts continued, most notably by a DDA growth of $1.6 billion or 5.5%. Higher-cost time deposits declined $300 million. And NOW accounts also decreased in part due to public fund migrations into DDA. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, average deposits were up $5.4 billion or 4.7%. This growth was entirely from lower-cost accounts, primarily DDA and Money Market, which increased by a combined $9.5 billion. This growth in lower cost accounts has enabled us to manage down our higher-cost time deposits, which decreased by $4.3 billion or 18% from the prior year.
Slide 8 covers net interest income, which declined modestly from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due -- which has increased modestly, I'm sorry, from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to day count. The net interest margin, after expanding for 8 consecutive quarters, stabilized at 3.53%. Interest-earning asset yields declined 5 basis points due to lower loan yields. This was offset by a 7-basis-point contraction in interest-bearing liability costs due to the favorable deposit mix shift, lower rates paid and a reduction in our long-term debt costs.
Relative to last year, net interest income increased by $78 million or 6%. The net interest margin expanded by 20 basis points. Favorable deposit trends were the primary drivers as rates paid declined and lower-cost deposit accounts increased. The enhanced liquidity position also enabled an almost $3 billion or 17% reduction in our average long-term debt balances. As we look to the third quarter, while we see both headwinds and tailwinds to the margin, our current expectation is for a modest decline, due primarily to further decreases in interest-earning asset yields resulting from the low-rate environment.
Let's turn to noninterest income. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our noninterest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market accounts. And we've included these details in the appendix. After adjustments, noninterest income increased $37 million or 5% sequentially. Most prominent was the $28 million increase in investment banking due to strong syndicated financial revenue and another really good quarter for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, our investment banking business. While the investment banking line item has and continued to experience volatility due to market factors, it's clear that the investments we've been making in our Corporate and Investment Banking businesses are paying off.
Other notable sequential quarter increases in fee income included deposit service charges and card fees. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income was up $53 million or 7% despite the $38 million decline in deposit service charges due primarily to Reg E.
We saw increases across a broad range of consumer and commercial categories, including growth of $11 million or 12% from higher debit interchange revenue and retail investment services growth of $11 million or 23%.
Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. This is the same information that we've shown you for the last few quarters, reordered just a little bit. The top left shows new repurchase demands, which were $348 million in the second quarter. That's up by $35 million from the prior quarter, $26 million of which was from the 2007 vintage. As you see at the bottom of that table, a very limited amount of the demands, only 5% this quarter, are non-agency related. As a result of the new demands, the pending population, which is shown at the top right part of the page, grew to $472 million. In light of this larger pending population, we've increased the mortgage repurchase reserves to $299 million, which is shown on the bottom left portion of the slide. You'll also see that the income statement impact this quarter grew to $90 million despite actual charge-offs declining to $61 million. While demands will likely continue to be volatile on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we continue to believe that demands from the higher-loss 2006 and 2007 vintages will decline as normal seasoning patterns occur.
Let's now turn to Slide 11 for a review of expenses. Expenses were up $77 million on a sequential quarter basis. Credit-related expenses accounted for $37 million or about half of this increase due to legal and compliance-related accruals. We also saw a $10 million increase in the FDIC premium due to the new asset-based assessment methodology. So overall, I'd characterize the growth in expenses as primarily due to the credit and regulatory environment, but I'd also say that at roughly $1.5 billion a quarter, which is where we've been plus or minus, our expense base is too high for this environment. Bill will speak momentarily to our efficiency improvement focus.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense was up by about $100 million and you see the factors listed on this slide. Compensation was the highest driver due to improved revenue in certain businesses, as well as for additional teammates that we've hired, primarily in client-facing and loss-mitigation positions. Let's switch to Slide 12 for a review of credit quality.
Our asset quality story is a good one again this quarter. We continued and, in some cases, accelerated the multi-quarter trend of improvement that we've seen in all of our primary metrics. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 73 basis points, down 7 basis points from the prior quarter. Delinquency declines were evident across most loan categories, notably an 18 basis point improvement in non-guaranteed mortgages following the 27 basis point improvement last quarter. Commercial and consumer loan delinquency rates of 22 and 66 basis points, respectively, are at relatively low levels. As such, we believe that any future improvements in delinquencies will be driven by the residential segment and be influenced by the overall health of the economy.
Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were down 9% and 10%, respectively, and we also saw a reduction in NPL inflows. Net charge-offs also showed notable improvements, declining from the first quarter by 12%, while the net charge-off ratio fell 25 basis points.
In light of the improvement in credit quality and the continued reduction in our risk profile, the allowance for loan losses declined by 4% for the first quarter to $2.7 billion.
Let's turn to Slide 13 for some additional detail on nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by loan segment. Like last quarter, we've also provided some supplemental information by loan class in the appendix. The $361 million sequential decline in nonperforming loans marked the eighth consecutive quarterly decline and was primarily due to our commercial segment, including a 25% reduction in commercial construction. Reductions in almost all other loan classes occurred as well. The $1.1 billion or 23% decline in nonperforming loans from 2010 was largely driven by commercial construction, non-guaranteed mortgages and C&I.
Net charge-offs are shown at the bottom of the page, and the $66 million sequential decline was driven by our residential segment, specifically by the non-guaranteed mortgage and home equity portfolios. The $217 million or 30% improvement in charge-offs from the prior year was widespread across loan categories, with the largest dollar declines coming from non-guaranteed mortgages, commercial construction and residential construction.
Overall, we're pleased with the direction in which all of our credit metrics are moving. The early-stage delinquency data indicate we may expect these trends to continue. Therefore, as we look to the rest of this year, we expect NPLs to continue to decline. We also expect net charge-offs to continue to trend favorably over time, although given the significant second quarter decline, third quarter net charge-offs are likely to approximate those of the second quarter, plus or minus.
I'll continue my comments by focusing on capital. Capital ratios continued their expansion this quarter and remained well above regulatory minimums and the proposed Basel III ratios. Tier 1 common grew by an estimated 15 basis points to 9.2%, while Tier 1 was up by an estimated 10 basis points to 11.1%. Tangible common equity ratio expanded to 7.96% and tangible book value per share increased to $24.57.
I'll conclude by noting that in light of the improved earnings per share we have generated this year, as well as the momentum that we're demonstrating in several of our businesses, we intend to request a modest dividend increase from our Board of Directors during the second half of this year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

Now I'll turn you to Slide 15, and as you'll remember, we're organized around a consumer and wholesale businesses and this outlines several of the accomplishments in both. I'm not going to detail all of them this morning, but I'll point to the fact that we continue to make progress as we pursue a strategy that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients, thereby fostering loyalty, which helps us in attracting, retaining and expanding relationships. 
A few highlights from the quarter on these areas where we've succeeded include: Retail client loyalty, which continues to improve and is exceeding our internal benchmarks. The loan production in the consumer businesses, while still low, is up 14% over the same quarter in 2010. Corporate and Investment Banking experienced its second-highest quarter of revenue generation and its third highest quarter of net income. Diversified Commercial Banking net income is up over 40% year-to-date, with favorable trends in both client acquisition and attrition as compared to last year. So overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we've made, and I think more importantly, with the momentum we've established. Now as you're all aware, and in light of regulatory changes, banks are evaluating how they charge for their services. We have invested significantly in the science of understanding consumers' behaviors and needs and clearly, that has shown us that attitudes about money and banking are evolving. So in response, we have reviewed our consumer product offerings to ensure they remain relevant, competitive and profitable.
This quarter we announced some key changes to our checking account portfolio. And as part of these changes, we've simplified our products suite. We've discontinued free checking and introduced products that respond to how clients use their bank, including our new core product, Everyday Checking. This is one of the means by which we're both responding to clients' needs and mitigating the impact from regulations that are impacting our revenue stream. I'll outline a few more monetarily. But now that we've had clarity on the Durbin amendment, let me first provide some transparency around our estimates to the run rate impact of that particular piece of legislation and its impact on fee income.
Now based on our business mix, we estimate that Durbin will have a 50% annualized impact before any mitigating actions. So to give you some additional context, our year-to-date annual debit interchange revenue is approximately $370 million. And as you're aware, the final rules will not be implemented until the beginning of the fourth quarter, so we'll only experience a small percentage of this in calendar 2011.
And we've been evaluating a variety of methods to mitigate both the impacts of Durbin and Reg E. And you will recall that we made no immediate changes to our products or fees in response to Reg E as we wanted to monitor both the competitive and regulatory dynamics. Now with some additional clarity on both fronts and with a lot of client insights, we've moved into implementation mode on certain mitigation efforts.
Now for example, we recently eliminated our debit rewards program, and I told you about the current rollout of our new checking product set. We also have other value-added checking features that we plan to introduce later, which we believe will be beneficial to our clients, as well as enhance our deposit fee income. So collectively and over time, we currently estimate that the benefits from all these changes will enable us to recapture around 50% of the revenue lost from both Durbin and Reg E.
Now I want to emphasize that we've been very deliberate in this process, and we've spent a lot of time garnering feedback from our clients. During the implementation of Reg E, we received accolades from our clients and within the industry in terms of client satisfaction and with our communication efforts. We needed to understand the final impacts of both Reg E and Durbin before we rolled out our new product set. In the last few months, I've been in virtually all 4 corners of our retail franchise, and I'm really pleased with our teammates' responsiveness. The early results are exceeding our expectations and producing more primary accounts and accounts with higher balances.
Now let me turn to the last slide for closing remarks. Now overall, we had some encouraging signs during the quarter, growth in targeted loan categories, a continued favorable shift in the deposit mix, good growth in certain fee areas and continued encouraging asset quality trends. Now while our results aren't yet where we'd like them to be, progress is being made, momentum is building, and we have specific initiatives aimed at accelerating our performance in the future. Some of these efforts are designed to further improve our revenue generation, and we feel good about our prospects, particularly as the economy improves and provides a little bit of tailwind.
Now we also recognize that expenses or the run rate is just simply too high for this new environment. As a result, we also have initiatives underway to lower our expense base with a targeted run rate reduction of $300 million by the end of 2013. Now similar to our successful E squared expense reduction initiatives a few years ago, there are multiple tactics involved that are structural and will accrue benefits over a period of time. And I'll just take a moment or 2 to give you a flavor of how we plan to do this.
First, a key focus will be on implementing an aggressive approach to what's commonly referred to as shared services wherein we will centralize and eliminate redundancy of similar functions currently housed in multiple parts of the organization. This will allow us to more effectively balance costs, quality and service, so we can more efficiently meet the needs of our lines of business, geographies and support projects. We've identified enterprise-wide solutions in such disciplines as technology and operations, finance, procurement, marketing and human resources to maximize their impact and improve their efficiency. Further, our supplier management efforts will be intensified to yield greater cost savings, and plans to reduce paper usage both within the organization and our interaction with clients will be accelerated.
And while we're not approaching this as a headcount reduction exercise per se, we will be providing these services with fewer people in the future. Our clients continue to demonstrate an increasing preference for more technology-driven, self-service channels such as a more robust ATM network and enhanced mobile banking platforms. This increase in convenience for clients also results in lower delivery costs and improved efficiency in the branch network. As all of these reductions are intended to produce permanent alterations to our expense base versus a quick fix, only a small portion will be realized in 2011, while we expect that we'll have approximately 80% of the expense savings in our run rate by the end of 2012, with the remainder occurring in 2013. 
So to be clear, these expense reductions are above and beyond those that we expect to normalize as the environment improves. Credit-related noninterest expenses, for example, have been running about $700 million in annual clip or roughly 12% of our expense base. That's several multiples above where they were pre-cycle and a big drag on our efficiency ratio. Even if these expenses normalized to a level somewhat higher than they were pre-cycle, there are still several hundred million dollars in credit-related expenses that, over time, we expect to come out of our current expense run rate as the environment improves.
Our individual efforts and an improving economy are ingredients to our overall effort to permanently reduce our normalized efficiency ratio to under 60%. Getting to that level will take some time, and the realization of it is in part dependent upon an improving economy, but I've outlined elements that we can impact regardless. And I can assure you they we will receive the requisite intensity. It's important to note our efforts will be focused on driving expense savings without compromising the high service levels that our clients have come to expect and we believe strategically differentiate us from our competitors.
So put another way, we are approaching this as we approach all aspects of our business: with a focus on the guiding principles of our operating philosophy, putting the client first by viewing the relationship through the eyes of those who choose our services, building a [indiscernible] team and focusing on profitable growth by operating efficiently and investing prudently. This planned development has been a team effort, and I have great confidence and a strong belief in our franchise potential and ability to deliver. So Kris, let me turn it over to you, and we can start the Q&A."

But if you think about what our normalized tax rate is and how that looks over time, as a general rule, think about us as having sort of $100 million to $120 million of tax-free income. So if you take a look at our overall income, subtract $100 million to $120 million per quarter of tax-free income and then apply our marginal rate to the remainder, you sort of get a generally effective tax rate number. What that tells you is that over time, as our income rises, our effective tax rate should be rising also as our marginal rate then gets applied to a higher proportion of our total income."

I'll provide you greater detail into the primary performance drivers on subsequent, so for, I'll just hit the highlights. 
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.39. That's a $0.06 per share increase from the second quarter, primarily due to a lower provision resulting from improved credit trends. Compared to the third quarter of last year, earnings per share increased $0.22. The largest drivers were higher net interest income, a lower provision and the elimination of the TARP drag. The improving profitability trends that we have reported over the past couple of years are evident in the year-to-date figures. Earnings per share were $0.81, which obviously compares favorably to the net loss that we reported during the first 9 months of last year. 
If you'll turn to Slide 5, we'll drill down further and our performance beginning with net interest income and net interest margin rates. Third quarter net interest income increased sequentially by $7 million or 1%. This was due to an additional day during the third quarter and the decline in interest expense, which is primarily attributable to lower deposit rates and the continuation of the favorable deposit mix shift. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points was consistent with our guidance and primarily driven by lower earning asset yields. Relative to the third quarter of last year, net interest income increased $27 million or 2%, and the margin increased 8 basis points. This was the result of a 29 basis point decline in interest-bearing liability costs due to favorable deposit trends and the reduction in longer-term debt. This benefit more than offset the 17 basis point decline in interest earning asset yields due to lower rates. 
On a year-to-date basis, net interest income increased 5%, again, due primarily to lower liability costs. As we look to the fourth quarter, particularly in light of the low rate environment, we expect a similar decline in the net interest margin to that experienced in the third quarter. 
Let's turn to noninterest income on Slide 6. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our noninterest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts. And the details of these adjustments are included within the appendix. The major components of this quarter's $63 million adjustment included $78 million and valuation gains that were recognized on the company's fair valued debt and index linked CDs, partially offset by $21 million in valuation losses on previously secured securitized loans and illiquid securities. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income declined by $21 million this quarter. Investment Banking revenue was down $27 million, coming off a high second quarter as transaction volume decreased in light of the market volatility. That's same market volatility in August also resulted in somewhat lower core trading revenue. Mortgage production income was up by $37 million this quarter on an adjusted basis. Core production income rose by about $65 million as a result of increased origination, volume, as well as wider margins. Partially offsetting this was $27 million of higher mortgage repurchase costs, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. Notwithstanding the stronger sequential quarter mortgage performance, mortgage-related revenue was lower than the third quarter last year when we saw extremely high levels of refinanced volume, as well as very strong MSR hedge performance. These were the primary drivers of the approximate $200 million decline in adjusted noninterest income from a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis, noninterest income was stable with 2010 levels. Double-digit growth in core consumer and commercial fee categories like Investment Banking, card fees and retail investment services was offset by a lower mortgage revenue, as well as lower deposit service charges due to Reg E. 
As you are aware, our debit interchange revenue will decline beginning in the fourth quarter. As mentioned last quarter, we expect about a 50% reduction, which equates to approximately $45 million to $50 million per quarter. We continued to expect to mitigate about 50% of the approximate $300 million combined annual revenue reductions from Reg E and dividend interchange. Most of that mitigation should be in a run rate by early 2012, with the balance late in 2012 and in 2013. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion on mortgage repurchase trends. As shown on the top left portion of the slide, new repurchased demands increased to $440 million during the quarter, with the 2007 vintage continuing to be the largest component. Demands remained difficult to predict and they were elevated this quarter, which is the trend that may continue in the fourth quarter. As you can see in the bottom row of the table, almost all of the demand this quarter were agency related. The top right part of the page show the pending demands ended the quarter at $490 million. That's up only modestly from the prior quarter despite the increase in new demands as we work hard to actively resolve. You can see evidence of this in the bottom left portion of the page as charge-offs increased from second quarter levels. This was largely expected as a significant portion of last quarter's new demands came late in the month of June, thus driving up the second quarter pending population. As such and despite the fact that charge-offs declined that quarter, we had built the second quarter reserve in anticipation of this quarter's increase in resolutions. As the losses were recognized, we were able to utilize a portion of that reserve increase. The mortgage repurchase provision during the third quarter was $117 million and the ending reserve level was $282 million. 
Let's take a look at expenses now. Expenses increased by $18 million or 1% on a sequential-quarter basis due to mortgage-related costs. Specifically, operating losses and credit and collections expense were up a combined $19 million. Other expense line items were essentially stable. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense increased by $74 million. Operating losses increased by $45 million, largely attributable to mortgage servicing. Employee compensation was the other major driver, up $41 million due to staff additions in client interfacing and mortgage loss mitigation and servicing roles. Higher incentive compensation due to improved revenue in certain businesses also contributed to this increase. Partially offsetting this was a $15 million decline in other real estate expense. And as Bill mentioned, he will provide an update to our expense program later in the call. 
Let's move on to the balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. Average performing loans increased by over $1 billion or about 1% from the prior quarter. Growth was driven by targeted loan categories, including C&I and consumer loans, while higher risk elements of the portfolio continued to be managed down. Commercial loan growth came from the C&I category which increased by $1.1 billion or almost 2.5%, primarily driven by our large book of borrowers. The growth was across multiple industries, mostly in the form of increased term funding. We saw a modest increase in large corporate utilization rates and a similar increase in commitment levels for our smaller commercial clients. Growth within consumer was across all loan categories, with the largest dollar increases in guaranteed student loans and indirect autos. Period end loans were up over $2.5 billion or more than 2% from the prior quarter. Notable items include an increased production volume, higher loan balances during every month of the quarter and the $500 million student loan portfolio acquisition at close the quarter-end. Relative to the prior year, average loans grew almost $3.5 billion or about 3%. This growth also came from the targeted C&I and consumer portfolio. Commercial category loans increased by about $0.5 billion, as strong C&I growth more than offset declines in CRE and commercial Construction. The Consumer portfolio was up by approximately $3.5 billion with student and indirect auto again driving the growth. Conversely, residential loans declined due to about a $2 billion combined reduction in non-guaranteed mortgages, Home Equity and residential Construction, partially offset by growth in guaranteed mortgage. 
Overall, we are pleased with our traction in growing selected areas of the portfolio this quarter. And currently, we were also able to continue to reduce risks, and further information of this is shown on Slide 10. 
The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk have accounted for about 50% of our net charge-offs over the past couple of years. As maybe seen on this slide, these balances are down by almost $13 billion or about 55% since the fourth quarter of 2008. This portfolio is held by another $700 million this quarter, with declines across all the categories, especially the commercial construction and higher risk Home Equity portfolios. Overall, these higher risk portfolios now constitute only 9% of our total loans, less than $1 billion of this is nonperforming, and has been written down or reserve for. While the remainder of the book is exhibiting more favorable characteristics. For example, the performing higher risk Home Equity portfolio has the refreshed averages FICO score in excess of 700. 
At the same time that we've been managing these higher risk balances down, we've also been reducing our risk further by increasing our government-guaranteed loans. Government-guaranteed loans increased this quarter by about $650 million. And they now total $9.8 billion or 8% of our loan portfolio. 
Let's move on now to a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up again, increasing by over $1 billion or about 1% from the second quarter. Favorable mix shift continued as growth was again concentrated in lower cost categories, most notably via the $2.1 billion or 7% single quarter increase in DDA balances. Time deposits were down and we also say decline in mail balances, many of which migrated into DDA. Relative to the prior year, average deposits were up $5.7 billion or about 5%. Lower-cost deposit accounts increased by about $10 billion, which primarily came from 20% growth in DDA and 8% growth in money market. And currently, higher cost time deposits declined by about $4 billion or 17%. 
Moving on to credit quality. All of our primary asset quality metrics improved this quarter, largely due to favorable trends in the commercial portfolio. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, declined 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Commercial loan delinquencies were down 7 basis points, while residential loans improved by a modest 2 basis points. You can see this detail in the appendix where we provided you the usual supplementary slides. Commercial and consumer early-stage delinquency rates are 15 and 67 basis points, respectively, are at the relatively low levels. So we expect any further improvements in overall delinquencies to be driven by residential loans and to be influenced by the overall economy, particularly by changes in unemployment, and to a lesser extent, home value. We saw another quarter of meaningful improvement in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, which were down 10% and 8%, respectively. I'll share with you the drivers of this momentarily. 
Net charge-offs were $492 million. This was a 3% improvement from the prior quarter and consistent with our prior guidance. In light of the overall continued credit quality improvement and risk reduction in the portfolio, we decreased the allowance for loan and lease losses by $144 million this quarter. The allowance ended the quarter at 2.22% of loans. Of note, if you exclude government-guaranteed loans from the denominator, this ratio is about 20 basis points higher. 
Slide 13 provides some additional detail on nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans marked their ninth consecutive quarterly decrease and was driven by commercial loans. Commercial Construction NPLs fell $242 million or almost 40% as the result of continuing risk mitigation activities. C&I and CRE NPLs declined by almost $60 million each or over 10%. Nonperforming residential loans were essentially unchanged. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans declined by $1.1 billion or 26%. Every loan category was down, with the largest dollar declines coming from Commercial Construction, non-guaranteed mortgages and C&I. Net charge-offs declined by $13 million from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans as Home Equity and residential construction fell by a combined $17 million. The Commercial charge-offs were relatively stable as an approximate $40 million sequential quarter increase in commercial construction was largely offset by about a $35 million combined decrease in C&I and CRE. Compared to last year, net charge-offs were down by about $200 million or about 30% which was striven primarily by lower residential losses, most notably in the non-guaranteed mortgage loan category. 
Overall, NPL declines in recent quarters have been driven by commercial category loans and the higher risk commercial Construction portfolio has been reduced although C&I book is generally perform well overall. Residential loans have been the largest driver of our lower net charge-offs. This portfolio has seen notable improvements over the past year although that's stabilized somewhat this quarter. Taking this together, we expect the third quarter trends to be similar in the fourth quarter, specifically additional declines in non-performing loans with generally stable net charge-offs. 
I'll concludes our comments today on Slide 14 with the discussion of capital. The Tier 1 common ratio expanded to an estimated 9.25% while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 11.05%. The latter was down marginally due to a modest reduction in our outstanding Trust Preferred Securities, as well as the impact to loan growth on risk-weighted assets. Both of these ratios continued to be well above the current and proposed regulatory requirement. The tangible common equity ratio expanded by over 30 basis points due to higher retained earnings, as well as an increase in accumulated other conference of income with higher unrealized gains in our securities portfolio. Those same factors drove a 4% increase in tangible book value per share which ended the quarter at $25.60. We told you on the last call that we intended to approach our board requesting a modest common dividend increase. We did so and received their approval. And we announced during the third quarter a $0.04 per share increase in the fourth quarter of dividend. Separately, we also repurchased and retired about 4 million SunTrust warrants during the public auction conducted by the U.S. Treasury. While both of these actions were relatively small, they are consistent with our desire to increase the return of capital to our shareholders. With that, and to lead us through a discussion of our strategic growth initiatives, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."
305901,140603304,175230,"SunTrust Banks, Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2011",2011-10-21,"Earnings Calls","SunTrust Banks, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Aleem.

I think the slide shows 3 of the 4 main categories, and provi",1698,"Great. Thanks, Aleem. I'm going to take us to Slide 15. And as we discussed before, we're pursuing specific strategies to drive higher profitability and growth from a more diversified platform. I think the slide shows 3 of the 4 main categories, and provide some examples of the success we've already garnered. The fourth category, improved expense efficiency will be covered on the subsequent slide. But there are certainly more to come on each of these fronts. So I wanted to provide some data points to demonstrate the momentum we're generating. There are several interrelated component strategy for growing consumer market and wallet share. Most importantly, the initiatives are grounded in our ability to win by providing the best service to drive improved client loyalty and better relationship penetration. We believe this is a critical means of differentiating ourselves in the market place and is resonating well with our clients on a very broad basis. As you heard earlier, evidence of this is showing up at absolute deposit growth as BEA balances are up 7% over the prior quarter. Lower cost deposit increases more than offset the decline in higher cost deposits maintaining our favorable mix shift. A relative growth, however, was evidence in the recent FDIC deposit share data as we increased share in 8 of our top MSAs.
Last quarter, I indicated that we were beginning the planning for our new checking product suite. This was the result of extensive client research and is now in full implementation mode. We discontinued free checking and introduced our new everyday checking product. Everyday checking carries a monthly maintenance fee which can be waived by holding a $500 daily balance or by simply having a direct deposit into the account. Everyday checking also has a monthly check card fee, unlimited check card usage, which is assessed only when the card is used on a monthly cycle at the point of sale. Now as was expected, we are opening fewer accounts. However, the average balance of the new accounts are twice as high as those opened under free checking. We are also seeing triple digit growth in the sale of our higher tier accounts which require higher balances and a greater breadth the relationship with SunTrust. So on various fronts, this conversion is meeting or exceeding our expectations. 
Another strategic priority is better diversification of our loan portfolio. Our C&I consumer books grew by combined $7 billion over the last year. More importantly, production in C&I and consumer were particularly strong this quarter where we saw some improvement in utilization in large Corporate, an increase in total commitments in core commercial. Our guaranteed portfolios both residential and student have also been growing and contributing to both our diversification and risk improvement. All this growth more than offset the targeted reductions in our non-guaranteed residential loans which are down $2 billion since the third quarter of last year, including a $1 billion decline in Home Equity. So overall good progress toward this objective as well. A better diversification also applies our business mix and fee income, expanding the wholesale business is a key strategic element in this priority and we generated significant momentum on this front. While the third quarter was impacted by an industrywide decline in capital markets revenue, Investment Banking year-to-date revenue was up 16% and net income was up 23%. Diversified Commercial Banking revenue is up 9%, net income is up 34%. On our private Wealth business is also a priority and you see we've had some success here, as well as retail service income is up almost 20%. 
Now moving onto our expense initiatives in Slide 16. So anticipating a tougher economic environment earlier this year, we embarked upon the development of a program to uncover additional ways to make significant and permanent expense reduction throughout the organization. As a result of those efforts, we announced to you last quarter our plans to eliminate $300 million in run rate expenses at the end of 2013. Today, I'd like to provides some more specificity around what we're doing to accomplish that goal. First, you'll notice that this program now has a name which is the PPG Expense Initiative. PBG is an acronym for Playbook for Profitable Growth. It's what we call the collection initiatives across the organization that we believe, over time, will be a key component in our plan to reduce our efficiency ratio to under 60%. As you can imagine, there are numerous initiatives in place under this program, but for purposes of communicating our progress, we've categorized them for a few core markets which you can see depicted on this slide. As we move through the process, we'll be updating you on the status of these with increasing accuracy and transparency. The bar across the top of the page will be filled in over time with real dollar progress towards our program goal. As we previously stated, only a small portion of the savings will actually be realized in 2011, and as such, the dollar impact of our efforts thus far has not been meaningful. We have, however, made significant progress on our overall plan and are in full implementation mode on several large and dozens of smaller initiatives. To remind you that the $300 million in expense reductions are above and beyond the expected credit-related expense and mortgage repurchase reserves, normalization that undoubtedly will occur as the economic environment improves. Sub 60 efficiency ratio goal is the culmination of both the program and these expected normalizations. 
Let me move to some of the specific initiatives. The first starting with the strategic supply management effort, let's focus on not only securing even more competitive pricing from our supply base, but also proactively further managing down our on demand and assessing value received for costs incurred. Nearly all outside spend areas are in scope and the entire enterprise is in the game. The broad categories for which we are providing status updates are discretionary spending, demand management and outsourcing. The immediate actions have been taken to further reduce expense and obvious discretionary areas. More importantly, we are enhancing our engagement model focused on sustaining these new lower levels of spending. 
Next key component of the program is the consumer bank efficiency initiatives, which includes channel optimization, alternative channel management, and sales and service productivity. As we've articulated previously, we've made numerous investments in client facing technology, which is mobile and ATM enhancements, which have supported and enabled a meaningful shift in client's willingness to use self-service channels. As clients utilize these channels, it allows us to evaluate other aspects of our consumer delivery model such as our branch network. This is not a widespread branch reduction exercise, though it will include some branch rationalization, the core changes to our branch staffing model. There are going to be increases in key opportunity Ranches but overall, net reductions to reflect reduced transaction volume. The changes are underway and we'll begin to see the results early next year. The objective is to accomplish this while maintaining the key momentum we've established in our industry-leading loyalty. Operations, staff and supporters, the final of the 3 main categories of savings and includes our shared service initiatives along with digital technology and lean process design and management. 
Within our Corporate operations, there will be strategic consolidation of certain areas where redundancies have been identified. There are some aspects of our corporate functions have performed in multiple parts of our organization, Corporate staff within the lines of business and core within the geographic units. Future model, we use a more centralized approach to support functions with more centers of excellence while preserving our key local sales and service delivery model. We expect that this will enable us to perform functions like marketing, procurement, technology and human resources, more efficiently and more effectively. 
We are also pursuing other opportunities such a standard reporting through all elements of the organization. Digital technology in this case refers to a set of initiatives designed to significantly increase both our internal and our clients' use of digital solutions. When means of reducing the month of print material in our interactions with clients in the day-to-day operations of our branches and across the bank. It also includes efforts to improve adoption rates of our more robust digital solutions by our clients. For many of the issues are very specific like consolidations, redundancy eliminations and expensive layers analysis, we're also incorporating lean tools and policies in to virtually the whole bank to this productivity. We've had much success in using lean process principles in our technology and operations area to help drive large scale transformational improvements. We plan to adopt these on a more widespread basis across more disciplines. As the PPG expense program progresses, we'll provide status updates on each of the major initiatives outlined on the slides, along with a real dollars in the coming out of our expense base as they are realized. Let me share you this program has my full attention and I am confident that we've built the resources that have the intensity to Compass our objective. 
In conclusion and before we open up the call for Q&A, I'll note that while our bottom line performance is not yet where we'd like it to be, progress is being made. Momentum is building around the initiatives we have in place to grow targets businesses, better diversify the loan portfolio and reduce expenses. While the future may be a little less certain, virtually all of our asset quality metrics improved this quarter. Our client first mandate, the focus on having a talented highly engaged workforce is being recognized and rewarded by our clients. And all that's being done with an eye towards driving better return for our shareholders. I've great confidence we've got the right curtsies in place. We have a great team leading our company. Their focus team working towards a common objective. Now before turn it over to  Q&A, I'd like to take a little liberty to thank the teammates were on this call as they are what define SunTrust.

So that's been a pleasant surprise and we are now looking to see how we can continue to do more of that going forward. Other levers that we've got at our disposal are going to be things like further TruPS redemptions, further payoffs of our longer mortgage debt.

If you think back a little bit, you know that the trends and the demands actually declined pretty substantially, and more than we expected late last year. And then in the last couple of quarters, they've come back up again. So it is hard to speculate what the future activity is going to be. Assuming that demand stalemated again in Q4, sort of seems reasonable. But it's tough to give you a good read on subsequent quarters past that. And it does it stand to reason that the further we get away from 2006 and the 2007 vintage, that mortgage repurchases will have less of an impact because the later vintages have tighter underwriting criteria, and came in after the bulk of the housing price declines. And the improvement in our delinquency ratios overall, you suggest that lower demands will eventually follow. But to be fair, we haven't seen that we expected so far."

If you turn to Slide 3, I think that's a good summary of the quarter, and I'm pleased to report we have momentum in several key areas, fueled in part by our intent client-centric focus. Loans were up again this quarter with targeted portfolio growth exceeding planned declines in higher-risk categories. We continued to grow deposits with a favorable mix shift, and key credit quality metrics improved across-the-board. We are pursuing initiatives to help drive better performance over time, including, but not limited to, our expense reduction program. I'll revisit that topic later in the call.

I'll begin my comments today with the summary income statement on Slide 4. I'll provide you greater detail into the primary performance drivers on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit the highlights. Ea",2425,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with the summary income statement on Slide 4. I'll provide you greater detail into the primary performance drivers on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit the highlights. 
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.39. That's a $0.06 per share increase from the second quarter, primarily due to a lower provision resulting from improved credit trends. Compared to the third quarter of last year, earnings per share increased $0.22. The largest drivers were higher net interest income, a lower provision and the elimination of the TARP drag. The improving profitability trends that we've reported over the past couple of years are evident in the year-to-date figures. 2011 earnings per share were $0.81, which obviously compares favorably to the net loss that we reported during the first 9 months of last year. 
If you'll turn to Slide 5, we'll drill down further into our performance beginning with net interest income and net interest margin trends. Third quarter net interest income increased sequentially by $7 million or 1%. This was due to an additional day during the third quarter and a decline in interest expense, which was primarily attributable to lower deposit rates and the continuation of the favorable deposit mix shift. The net interest margin decline of 4 basis points was consistent with our guidance and primarily driven by lower earning asset yields. Relative to the third quarter of last year, net interest income increased $27 million or 2%, and the margin increased 8 basis points. This was the result of a 29 basis point decline in interest-bearing liability costs due to favorable deposit trends and a reduction in longer-term debt. This benefit more than offset the 17 basis point decline in earning asset -- in interest-earning asset yields due to lower rates. 
On a year-to-date basis, net interest income increased 5%, again due primarily to lower liability costs. As we look to the fourth quarter, particularly in light of the low rate environment, we expect a similar decline in the net interest margin to that experienced in the third quarter. 
Let's turn to noninterest income on Slide 6. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our noninterest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the details of these adjustments are included within the appendix. The major components of this quarter's $63 million adjustment included $78 million in valuation gains that were recognized on the company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs, partially offset by $21 million in valuation losses on previously secured securitized loans and illiquid securities. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income declined by $21 million this quarter. Investment Banking revenue was down $27 million, coming off a high second quarter as transaction volume decreased in light of the market volatility. That same market volatility in August also resulted in somewhat lower core trading revenue. Mortgage production income was up by $37 million this quarter on an adjusted basis. Core production income rose by about $65 million as a result of increased origination volume as well as wider margins. Partially offsetting this was $27 million of higher mortgage repurchase costs, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. 
Notwithstanding the stronger sequential quarter mortgage performance, mortgage-related revenue was lower than the third quarter last year when we saw extremely high levels of refinance volume, as well as very strong MSR hedge performance. These were the primary drivers of the approximate $200 million decline in adjusted noninterest income from a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis, noninterest income was stable with 2010 levels. Double-digit growth in core consumer and commercial fee categories like Investment Banking, card fees and retail investment services was offset by lower mortgage revenue, as well as lower deposit service charges due to Reg E. 
As you are aware, our debit interchange revenue will decline beginning in the fourth quarter. As mentioned last quarter, we expect about a 50% reduction, which equates to approximately $45 million to $50 million per quarter. We continue to expect to mitigate about 50% of the approximate $300 million combined annual revenue reductions from Reg E and debit interchange. Most of that mitigation should be in the run rate by early 2012, with the balance late in 2012 and in 2013. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion on mortgage repurchase trends. As shown on the top left portion of the slide, new repurchase demands increased to $440 million during the quarter with the 2007 vintage continuing to be the largest component. Demands remained difficult to predict and they were elevated this quarter, which is a trend that may continue in the fourth quarter. As you can see in the bottom row of the table, almost all of the demand this quarter were agency related. 
The top right part of the page shows the pending demands ended the quarter at $490 million. That's up only modestly from the prior quarter despite the increase in new demands as we work hard to actively resolving this. You can see evidence of this in the bottom left portion of the page as charge-offs increased from second quarter levels. This was largely expected as a significant portion of last quarter's new demands came late in the month of June, thus driving up the second quarter pending population. As such and despite the fact that charge-offs declined that quarter, we had built the second quarter reserve in anticipation of this quarter's increase in resolutions. As the losses were recognized, we were able to utilize a portion of that reserve increase. The mortgage repurchase provision during the third quarter was $117 million, and the ending reserve level was $282 million. 
Let's take a look at expenses now. Expenses increased by $18 million or 1% on a sequential-quarter basis due to mortgage-related costs. Specifically, operating losses and credit and collections expense were up a combined $19 million. Other expense line items were essentially stable. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense increased by $74 million. Operating losses increased by $45 million, largely attributable to mortgage servicing. Employee compensation was the other major driver, up $41 million, due to staff additions in client interfacing and mortgage loss mitigation and servicing roles. Higher incentive compensation due to improved revenue in certain businesses also contributed to this increase. Partially offsetting this was a $15 million decline in other real estate expense. And as Bill mentioned, he will provide you an update to our expense program later in the call. 
Let's move on to the balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. Average performing loans increased by over $1 billion or about 1% from the prior quarter. Growth was driven by targeted loan categories, including C&I and consumer loans, while higher risk elements of the portfolio continued to be managed down. Commercial loan growth came from the C&I category, which increased by $1.1 billion or almost 2.5%, primarily driven by our large book of borrowers. The growth was across multiple industries, mostly in the form of increased term funding. We saw a modest increase in large corporate utilization rates and a similar increase in commitment levels for our smaller commercial clients. Growth within consumer was across all loan categories with the largest dollar increases in guaranteed student loans and indirect auto. 
Period-end loans were up over $2.5 billion or more than 2% from the prior quarter. Notable items included increased production volume, higher loan balances during every month of the quarter and the $500 million student loan portfolio acquisition at close to quarter end. Relative to the prior year, average loans grew almost $3.5 billion or about 3%. This growth also came from the targeted C&I and consumer portfolios. Commercial category loans increased by about $0.5 billion as strong C&I growth more than offset declines in CRE and commercial construction. The consumer portfolio was up by approximately $3.5 billion with student and indirect auto again driving the growth. Conversely, residential loans declined due to about a $2 billion combined reduction in non-guaranteed mortgages, home equity and residential construction, partially offset by growth in guaranteed mortgage. 
Overall, we are pleased with our traction in growing selected areas of the portfolio this quarter. And currently, we were also able to continue to reduce risks, and further information of this is shown on Slide 10. 
The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk have accounted for about 50% of our net charge-offs over the past couple of years. As may be seen on this slide, these balances are down by almost $13 billion or about 55% since the fourth quarter of 2008. These portfolios fell by another $700 million this quarter with declines across all the categories, especially the commercial construction and higher-risk home equity portfolios. Overall, these higher-risk portfolios now constitute only 9% of our total loans. Less than $1 billion of this is nonperforming and has been written down or reserved for while the remainder of the book is exhibiting more favorable characteristics. For example, the performing higher-risk home equity portfolio has a refreshed averages FICO score in excess of 700. 
At the same time that we've been managing these high-risk balances down, we've also been reducing our risk further by increasing our government-guaranteed loans. Government-guaranteed loans increased this quarter by about $650 million. And they now total $9.8 billion or 8% of our loan portfolio. 
Let's move on now to a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up again, increasing by over $1 billion or about 1% from the second quarter. Favorable mix shift continued as growth was again concentrated in lower-cost categories, most notably via the $2.1 billion or 7% single quarter increase in DDA balances. Time deposits were down, and we also saw a decline in NOW balances, many of which migrated into DDA. Relative to the prior year, average deposits were up $5.7 billion or about 5%. Lower-cost deposit accounts increased by about $10 billion, which primarily came from 20% growth in DDA and 8% growth in money market. And currently, higher-cost time deposits declined by about $4 billion or 17%. 
Moving on to credit quality. All of our primary asset quality metrics improved this quarter, largely due to favorable trends in the commercial portfolio. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, declined 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Commercial loan delinquencies were down 7 basis points while residential loans improved by a modest 2 basis points. You can see this detail in the Appendix where we've provided you the usual supplementary slides. Commercial and consumer early-stage delinquency rates of 15 and 67 basis points, respectively, are at relatively low levels. So we expect any further improvements in overall delinquencies to be driven by residential loans and to be influenced by the overall economy, particularly by changes in unemployment, and to a lesser extent, home value. We saw another quarter of meaningful improvement in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, which were down 10% and 8%, respectively. I'll share with you the drivers of this momentarily. 
Net charge-offs were $492 million. This was a 3% improvement from the prior quarter and consistent with our prior guidance. In light of the overall continued credit quality improvement and risk reduction in the portfolio, we decreased the allowance for loan and lease losses by $144 million this quarter. The allowance ended the quarter at 2.22% of loans. Of note, if you exclude government-guaranteed loans from the denominator, this ratio is about 20 basis points higher. 
Slide 13 provides some additional detail on nonperforming loan and net charge-offs. Sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans marked their ninth consecutive quarterly decrease and was driven by commercial loans. Commercial construction NPLs fell $242 million or almost 40% as the result of continuing risk-mitigation activities. C&I and CRE NPLs declined by almost $60 million each or over 10%. Nonperforming residential loans were essentially unchanged. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans declined by $1.1 billion or 26%. Every loan category was down with the largest dollar declines coming from commercial construction, non-guaranteed mortgages and C&I. Net charge-offs declined by $13 million from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans as home equity and residential construction fell by a combined $17 million. Commercial charge-offs were relatively stable as an approximate $40 million sequential quarter increase in commercial construction was largely offset by about a $35 million combined decrease in C&I and CRE. Compared to last year, net charge-offs were down by about $200 million or about 30%, which was striven primarily by lower residential losses, most notably in the non-guaranteed mortgage loan category. 
Overall, NPL declines in recent quarters have been driven by commercial category loans as the higher-risk commercial construction portfolio has been reduced while the C&I book has generally performed well overall. Residential loans have been the largest driver of our lower net charge-offs. This portfolio has seen notable improvements over the past year, although that stabilized somewhat this quarter. Taking this together, we expect the third quarter trends to be similar in the fourth quarter, specifically additional declines in nonperforming loans with generally stable net charge-offs. 
I'll conclude my comments today on Slide 14 with the discussion of capital. The Tier 1 common ratio expanded to an estimated 9.25% while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 11.05%. The latter was down marginally due to a modest reduction in our outstanding trust preferred securities, as well as the impact of loan growth on risk-weighted assets. Both of these ratios continue to be well above the current and proposed regulatory requirement. The tangible common equity ratio expanded by over 30 basis points due to higher retained earnings, as well as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to higher unrealized gains in our securities portfolio. Those same factors drove a 4% increase in tangible book value per share, which ended the quarter at $25.60. 
We told you on the last call that we intended to approach our board requesting a modest dividend -- a common dividend increase. We did so and received their approval. And we announced during the third quarter a 4% share -- a $0.04 per share increase in the quarterly dividend. Separately, we also repurchased and retired about 4 million SunTrust warrants during a public auction conducted by the U.S. Treasury. While both of these actions were relatively small, they are consistent with our desire to increase the return of capital to our shareholders. 
With that, and to lead us through a discussion of our strategic growth initiatives, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

And as we discussed before, we're pursuing specific strategies to drive higher profitability and growth from a more diversified platform. I think the slide shows 3 of the 4 main categories and provides some examples of the success we've already garnered. The fourth category, improved expense efficiency, will be covered on the subsequent slide. 
While there are certainly more to come on each of these fronts, I wanted to provide some data points to demonstrate the momentum we're generating. There are several interrelated component strategy for growing consumer market and wallet share. Most importantly, the initiatives are grounded in our ability to win by providing the best service to drive improved client loyalty and better relationship penetration. We believe this is a critical means of differentiating ourselves in the market place and is resonating well with our clients on a very broad basis. 
As you heard earlier, evidence of this is showing up in absolute deposit growth as DDA balances are up 7% over the prior quarter. Lower-cost deposit increases more than offset the decline in higher-cost deposits, maintaining our favorable mix shift. A relative growth, however, was evidenced in the recent FDIC deposit share data as we increased share in 8 of our top MSAs.
Last quarter, I indicated that we were beginning the planning for our new checking product suite. This was the result of extensive client research and is now in full implementation mode. We discontinued free checking and introduced our new everyday checking product. Everyday checking carries a monthly maintenance fee, which can be waived by holding a $500 daily balance or by simply having a direct deposit into the account. Everyday checking also has a monthly check card fee for unlimited check card usage, which is assessed only when the card is used on a monthly cycle at the point of sale. Now as was expected, we're opening fewer accounts. However, the average balance of the new accounts are twice as high as those opened under free checking. We're also seeing triple digit growth in the sale of our higher tier accounts, which require higher balances and a greater breadth of relationship with SunTrust. So on various fronts, this conversion is meeting or exceeding our expectations. 
Another strategic priority is better diversification of our loan portfolio. Our C&I consumer books grew by combined $7 billion over the last year. More importantly, production in C&I and consumer were particularly strong this quarter, and we saw some improvement in utilization in large corporate and an increase in total commitments in core commercial. Our guaranteed portfolios, both residential and student, have also been growing and contributing to both our diversification and risk improvement. All this growth more than offset the targeted reductions in our non-guaranteed residential loans, which are down $2 billion since the third quarter of last year, including a $1 billion decline in home equity. So overall good progress toward this objective as well. 
A better diversification also applies to our business mix and fee income. Expanding a wholesale business is a key strategic element in this priority, and we generated significant momentum on this front. While the third quarter was impacted by an industry-wide decline in capital markets revenue, Corporate and Investment Banking year-to-date revenue was up 16% and net income was up 23%. Diversified Commercial Banking revenue was up 9% and net income was up 34%. Growing our private wealth business is also a priority and you see we've had some success here as well as retail service income was up almost 20%. 
Now moving onto our expense initiatives in Slide 16. So anticipating a tougher operating environment earlier this year, we embarked upon the development of a program to uncover additional ways to make significant and permanent expense reduction throughout the organization. As a result of those efforts, we announced to you last quarter our plans to eliminate $300 million in run rate expenses at the end of 2013. Today, I'd like to provides some more specificity around what we're doing to accomplish that goal. 
First, you'll notice that this program now has a name, which is the PPG Expense Initiative. PPG is an acronym for playbook for profitable growth. It's what we call the collection of initiatives across the organization that we believe, over time, will be a key component in our plan to reduce our efficiency ratio to under 60%. As you can imagine, there are numerous initiatives in place under this program, but for purposes of communicating our progress, we've categorized them into a few core buckets, which you can see depicted on the slide. As we move through the process, we'll be updating you on the status of these with increasing accuracy and transparency. The bar across the top of the page will be filled in over time with real dollar progress towards our program goal. As we've previously stated, only a small portion of the savings will actually be realized in 2011 and as such the dollar impact of our efforts, thus far, has not been meaningful. We have, however, made significant progress on our overall plan and are in full implementation mode on several large and dozens of smaller initiatives. I'll remind you that the $300 million in expense reductions are above and beyond the expected credit-related expense and mortgage repurchase reserve normalization that undoubtedly will occur -- undoubtedly occur as the economic environment improves. The sub-60 efficiency ratio goal is the culmination of both the program and these expected normalizations. 
So let me move to some of the specific initiatives. The first, starting with the strategic supply management effort. That's focused on not only securing even more competitive pricing from our supply base, but also proactively further managing down our own demand and assessing value received for costs incurred. Nearly all outside spend areas are in scope and the entire enterprise is in the game. The broad categories for which we are providing status updates are: discretionary spending, demand management and outsourcing. Immediate actions have been taken to further reduce expense in obvious discretionary areas. But more importantly, we're enhancing our engagement model focused on sustaining these new lower levels of spending. 
The next key component of the program is the consumer bank efficiencies initiatives, which includes channel optimization, alternative channel management and sales and service productivity. As we've articulated previously, we've made numerous investments in client-facing technology such as mobile and ATM enhancements, which have supported and enabled a meaningful shift in clients' willingness to use self-service channels. As clients utilize these channels, it allows us to evaluate other aspects of our consumer delivery model such as our branch network. This is not a widespread branch-reduction exercise, though it will include some branch rationalization and core changes to our branch staffing model. There are going to be increases in key opportunity branches, but overall, net reductions to reflect reduced transaction volume. The changes are underway, and we'll begin to see the results early next year. The objective is to accomplish this while maintaining the key momentum we've established in our industry-leading loyalty. 
Operations staff and support is the final of the 3 main categories of savings and includes our shared service initiatives along with digital technology and lean process design and management. 
Within our corporate operations, there will be strategic consolidation of certain areas where redundancies have been identified. Today, some aspects of our corporate functions have performed in multiple parts of our organization like corporate staff within the lines of business and/or within the geographic units. Our future model will use a more centralized approach for support functions with more centers of excellence while preserving our key local sales and service delivery model. We expect that this will enable us to perform functions like marketing, procurement, technology and human resources more efficiently and more effectively. 
We're also pursuing other opportunities such as standard reporting through all elements of the organization. 
Digital technology, in this case, refers to a set of initiatives designed to significantly increase both our internal and our clients' use of digital solutions. We're uncovering means of reducing the amount of printed material in our interactions with clients in the day-to-day operations of our branches and across the bank. It also includes efforts to improve adoption rates of our more robust digital solutions by our clients. 
While many of the initiatives are very specific like consolidations, redundancy eliminations and spans and layers analysis, we're also incorporating lean tools and technologies in to virtually the whole bank to this productivity. We've had much success in using lean process principles in our technology and operations area to help drive large-scale transformational improvements. We plan to adopt these on a more widespread basis across more disciplines. 
As the PPG expense program progresses, we'll provide status updates on each of the major initiatives outlined on this slide along with the real dollars that are coming out of our expense base as they are realized. I want to assure you this program has my full attention, and I'm confident that we've built the resources and have the intensity to accomplish our objective. 
So in conclusion and before we open up the call for Q&A, I'll note that while our bottom line performance is not yet where we'd like it to be, progress is being made. Momentum is building around the initiatives we have in place to grow targeted businesses, better diversify the loan portfolio and reduce expenses. While the future may be a little less certain, virtually all of our asset quality metrics improved this quarter. Our client first mandate and focus on having a talented, highly engaged workforce is being recognized and rewarded by our clients. And all that's being done with an eye towards driving better return for our shareholders. I've great confidence we've got the right priorities in place. We have a great team leading our company. We have focused teammates working towards a common objective. 
Now before we turn it over to  Q&A, I'd like to take a little liberty to thank the teammates who are on this call as they are what define SunTrust. 
So with that said, Kris, let me hand it back over to you, and we'll start the Q&A"

So that's been a pleasant surprise, and we're now looking to see how we can continue to do more of that going forward.

Assuming that demand stay elevated again in Q4 so it seems reasonable, but it's tough to give you a good read on subsequent quarters past that. It does stand to reason that the further we get away from 2006 and the 2007 vintage, that mortgage repurchases will have less of an impact because the later vintages have tighter underwriting criteria and came in after the bulk of the housing price declines. And the improvement in our delinquency ratios, overall, do suggest that lower demands will eventually follow. But to be fair, we haven't seen what we expected so far."

If you turn to Slide 3, I think that's a good summary of the quarter, and I'm pleased to report we have momentum in several key areas, fueled in part by our intense client-centric focus. Loans were up again this quarter with targeted portfolio growth exceeding planned declines in higher-risk categories. We continued to grow deposits with a favorable mix shift, and key credit quality metrics improved across-the-board. We are pursuing initiatives to help drive better performance over time, including, but not limited to, our expense reduction program. I'll revisit that topic later in the call.

I'll begin my comments today with the summary income statement on Slide 4. I'll provide you greater detail into the primary performance drivers on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit the highlights. Ea",2427,"Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with the summary income statement on Slide 4. I'll provide you greater detail into the primary performance drivers on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit the highlights. 
Earnings per share this quarter were $0.39. That's a $0.06 per share increase from the second quarter, primarily due to a lower provision resulting from improved credit trends. Compared to the third quarter of last year, earnings per share increased $0.22. The largest drivers were higher net interest income, a lower provision and the elimination of the TARP drag. The improving profitability trends that we've reported over the past couple of years are evident in the year-to-date figures. 2011 earnings per share were $0.81, which obviously compares favorably to the net loss that we reported during the first 9 months of last year. 
If you'll turn to Slide 5, we'll drill down further into our performance beginning with net interest income and net interest margin trends. Third quarter net interest income increased sequentially by $7 million or 1%. This was due to an additional day during the third quarter and a decline in interest expense, which was primarily attributable to lower deposit rates and the continuation of the favorable deposit mix shift. The net interest margin decline of 4 basis points was consistent with our guidance and primarily driven by lower earning asset yields. Relative to the third quarter of last year, net interest income increased $27 million or 2%, and the margin increased 8 basis points. This was the result of a 29 basis point decline in interest-bearing liability costs due to favorable deposit trends and a reduction in longer-term debt. This benefit more than offset the 17 basis point decline in earning asset -- in interest-earning asset yields due to lower rates. 
On a year-to-date basis, net interest income increased 5%, again due primarily to lower liability costs. As we look to the fourth quarter, particularly in light of the low rate environment, we expect a similar decline in the net interest margin to that experienced in the third quarter. 
Let's turn to noninterest income on Slide 6. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our noninterest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the details of these adjustments are included within the appendix. The major components of this quarter's $63 million adjustment included $78 million in valuation gains that were recognized on the company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs, partially offset by $21 million in valuation losses on previously secured securitized loans and illiquid securities. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income declined by $21 million this quarter. Investment Banking revenue was down $27 million, coming off a high second quarter as transaction volume decreased in light of the market volatility. That same market volatility in August also resulted in somewhat lower core trading revenue. Mortgage production income was up by $37 million this quarter on an adjusted basis. Core production income rose by about $65 million as a result of increased origination volume as well as wider margins. Partially offsetting this was $27 million of higher mortgage repurchase costs, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. 
Notwithstanding the stronger sequential quarter mortgage performance, mortgage-related revenue was lower than the third quarter last year when we saw extremely high levels of refinance volume, as well as very strong MSR hedge performance. These were the primary drivers of the approximate $200 million decline in adjusted noninterest income from a year ago. 
On a year-to-date basis, noninterest income was stable with 2010 levels. Double-digit growth in core consumer and commercial fee categories like Investment Banking, card fees and retail investment services was offset by lower mortgage revenue, as well as lower deposit service charges due to Reg E. 
As you are aware, our debit interchange revenue will decline beginning in the fourth quarter. As mentioned last quarter, we expect about a 50% reduction, which equates to approximately $45 million to $50 million per quarter. We continue to expect to mitigate about 50% of the approximate $300 million combined annual revenue reductions from Reg E and debit interchange. Most of that mitigation should be in the run rate by early 2012, with the balance late in 2012 and in 2013. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion on mortgage repurchase trends. As shown in the top left portion of the slide, new repurchase demands increased to $440 million during the quarter with the 2007 vintage continuing to be the largest component. Demands remained difficult to predict and they were elevated this quarter, which is a trend that may continue in the fourth quarter. As you can see in the bottom row of the table, almost all of the demand this quarter were agency related. 
The top right part of the page shows that pending demands ended the quarter at $490 million. That's up only modestly from the prior quarter despite the increase in new demands as we worked hard to actively resolving these issues. You can see evidence of this in the bottom left portion of the page as charge-offs increased from second quarter levels. This was largely expected as a significant portion of last quarter's new demands came late in the month of June, thus driving up the second quarter pending population. As such and despite the fact that charge-offs declined that quarter, we had built the second quarter reserve in anticipation of this quarter's increase in resolutions. As the losses were recognized, we were able to utilize a portion of that reserve increase. The mortgage repurchase provision during the third quarter was $117 million, and the ending reserve level was $282 million. 
Let's take a look at expenses now. Expenses increased by $18 million or 1% on a sequential-quarter basis due to mortgage-related costs. Specifically, operating losses and credit and collections expense were up a combined $19 million. Other expense line items were essentially stable. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense increased by $74 million. Operating losses increased by $45 million, largely attributable to mortgage servicing. Employee compensation was the other major driver, up $41 million, due to staff additions in client interfacing and mortgage loss mitigation and servicing roles. Higher incentive compensation due to improved revenue in certain businesses also contributed to this increase. Partially offsetting this was a $15 million decline in other real estate expense. And as Bill mentioned, he will provide you an update to our expense program later in the call. 
Let's move on to the balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. Average performing loans increased by over $1 billion or about 1% from the prior quarter. Growth was driven by targeted loan categories, including C&I and consumer loans, while higher risk elements of the portfolio continued to be managed down. Commercial loan growth came from the C&I category, which increased by $1.1 billion or almost 2.5%, primarily driven by our large book of borrowers. The growth was across multiple industries, mostly in the form of increased term funding. We saw a modest increase in large corporate utilization rates and a similar increase in commitment levels for our smaller commercial clients. Growth within consumer was across all loan categories with the largest dollar increases in guaranteed student loans and indirect auto. 
Period-end loans were up over $2.5 billion or more than 2% from the prior quarter. Notable items included increased production volume, higher loan balances during every month of the quarter and the $500 million student loan portfolio acquisition that closed at quarter end. Relative to the prior year, average loans grew almost $3.5 billion or about 3%. This growth also came from the targeted C&I and consumer portfolios. Commercial category loans increased by about $0.5 billion as strong C&I growth more than offset declines in CRE and commercial construction. The consumer portfolio was up by approximately $3.5 billion with student and indirect auto again driving the growth. Conversely, residential loans declined due to about a $2 billion combined reduction in non-guaranteed mortgages, home equity and residential construction, partially offset by growth in guaranteed mortgage. 
Overall, we are pleased with our traction in growing selected areas of the portfolio this quarter. And currently, we were also able to continue to reduce risks, and further information of this is shown on Slide 10. 
The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk have accounted for about 50% of our net charge-offs over the past couple of years. As may be seen on this slide, these balances are down by almost $13 billion or about 55% since the fourth quarter of 2008. These portfolios fell by another $700 million this quarter with declines across all the categories, especially the commercial construction and higher-risk home equity portfolios. Overall, these higher-risk portfolios now constitute only 9% of our total loans. Less than $1 billion of this is nonperforming and has been written down or reserved for while the remainder of the book is exhibiting more favorable characteristics. For example, the performing higher-risk home equity portfolio has a refreshed averages FICO score in excess of 700. 
At the same time that we've been managing these high-risk balances down, we've also been reducing our risk further by increasing our government-guaranteed loans. Government-guaranteed loans increased this quarter by about $650 million. And they now total $9.8 billion or 8% of our loan portfolio. 
Let's move on now to a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up again, increasing by over $1 billion or about 1% from the second quarter. Favorable mix shift continued as growth was again concentrated in lower-cost categories, most notably via the $2.1 billion or 7% single quarter increase in DDA balances. Time deposits were down, and we also saw a decline in NOW balances, many of which migrated into DDA. Relative to the prior year, average deposits were up $5.7 billion or about 5%. Lower-cost deposit accounts increased by about $10 billion, which primarily came from 20% growth in DDA and 8% growth in money market. And currently, higher-cost time deposits declined by about $4 billion or 17%. 
Moving on to credit quality. All of our primary asset quality metrics improved this quarter, largely due to favorable trends in the commercial portfolio. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, declined 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Commercial loan delinquencies were down 7 basis points while residential loans improved by a modest 2 basis points. You can see this detail in the Appendix where we've provided you the usual supplementary slides. Commercial and consumer early-stage delinquency rates of 15 and 67 basis points, respectively, are at relatively low levels. So we expect any further improvements in overall delinquencies to be driven by residential loans and to be influenced by the overall economy, particularly by changes in unemployment, and to a lesser extent, home value. We saw another quarter of meaningful improvement in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, which were down 10% and 8%, respectively. I'll share with you the drivers of this momentarily. 
Net charge-offs were $492 million. This was a 3% improvement from the prior quarter and consistent with our prior guidance. In light of the overall continued credit quality improvement and risk reduction in the portfolio, we decreased the allowance for loan and lease losses by $144 million this quarter. The allowance ended the quarter at 2.22% of loans. Of note, if you exclude government-guaranteed loans from the denominator, this ratio is about 20 basis points higher. 
Slide 13 provides some additional detail on nonperforming loan and net charge-offs [ph]. 
Sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans marked their ninth consecutive quarterly decrease and was driven by commercial loans. Commercial construction NPLs fell $242 million or almost 40% as the result of continuing risk-mitigation activities. C&I and CRE NPLs declined by almost $60 million each or over 10%. Nonperforming residential loans were essentially unchanged. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans declined by $1.1 billion or 26%. Every loan category was down with the largest dollar declines coming from commercial construction, non-guaranteed mortgages and C&I. Net charge-offs declined by $13 million from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans as home equity and residential construction fell by a combined $17 million. Commercial charge-offs were relatively stable as an approximate $40 million sequential quarter increase in commercial construction was largely offset by about a $35 million combined decrease in C&I and CRE. Compared to last year, net charge-offs were down by about $200 million or about 30%, which was driven primarily by lower residential losses, most notably in the non-guaranteed mortgage loan category. 
Overall, NPL declines in recent quarters have been driven by commercial category loans as the higher-risk commercial construction portfolio has been reduced while the C&I book has generally performed well overall. Residential loans have been the largest driver of our lower net charge-offs. This portfolio has seen notable improvements over the past year, although that stabilized somewhat this quarter. Taking this together, we expect the third quarter trends to be similar in the fourth quarter, specifically additional declines in nonperforming loans with generally stable net charge-offs. 
I'll conclude my comments today on Slide 14 with the discussion of capital. The Tier 1 common ratio expanded to an estimated 9.25% while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 11.05%. The latter was down marginally due to a modest reduction in our outstanding trust preferred securities, as well as the impact of loan growth on risk-weighted assets. Both of these ratios continue to be well above the current and proposed regulatory requirement. The tangible common equity ratio expanded by over 30 basis points due to higher retained earnings, as well as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to higher unrealized gains in our securities portfolio. Those same factors drove a 4% increase in tangible book value per share, which ended the quarter at $25.60. 
We told you on the last call that we intended to approach our Board requesting a modest dividend -- a common dividend increase. We did so and received their approval. And we announced during the third quarter a 4% share -- a $0.04 per share increase in the quarterly dividend. Separately, we also repurchased and retired about 4 million SunTrust warrants during a public auction conducted by the U.S. Treasury. While both of these actions were relatively small, they are consistent with our desire to increase the return of capital to our shareholders. 
With that, and to lead us through a discussion of our strategic growth initiatives, I'll turn the call back over to Bill."

And as we discussed before, we're pursuing specific strategies to drive higher profitability and growth from a more diversified platform. I think this slide shows 3 of the 4 main categories and provides some examples of the success we've already garnered. The fourth category, improved expense efficiency, will be covered on the subsequent slide. 
While there are certainly more to come on each of these fronts, I wanted to provide some data points to demonstrate the momentum we're generating. There are several interrelated components to our strategy for growing consumer market and wallet share. Most importantly, the initiatives are grounded in our ability to win by providing the best service to drive improved client loyalty and better relationship penetration. We believe this is a critical means of differentiating ourselves in the market place and is resonating well with our clients on a very broad basis. 
As you heard earlier, evidence of this is showing up in absolute deposit growth as DDA balances are up 7% over the prior quarter. Lower-cost deposit increases more than offset the decline in higher-cost deposits, maintaining our favorable mix shift. A relative growth, however, was evidenced in the recent FDIC deposit share data as we increased share in 8 of our top MSAs.
Last quarter, I indicated that we were beginning the planning for our new checking product suite. This was the result of extensive client research and is now in full implementation mode. We discontinued free checking and introduced our new Everyday Checking product. Everyday Checking carries a monthly maintenance fee, which can be waived by holding a $500 daily balance or by simply having a direct deposit into the account. Everyday Checking also has a monthly check card fee for unlimited check card usage, which is assessed only when the card is used on a monthly cycle at the point of sale. Now as was expected, we're opening fewer accounts. However, the average balance of the new accounts are twice as high as those opened under free checking. We're also seeing triple digit growth in the sale of our higher tier accounts, which require higher balances and a greater breadth of relationship with SunTrust. So on various fronts, this conversion is meeting or exceeding our expectations. 
Another strategic priority is better diversification of our loan portfolio. Our C&I and consumer books grew by combined $7 billion over the last year. More importantly, production in C&I and consumer were particularly strong this quarter, and we saw some improvement in utilization in large corporate and an increase in total commitments in core commercial. Our guaranteed portfolios, both residential and student, have also been growing and contributing to both our diversification and risk improvement. All this growth more than offset the targeted reductions in our non-guaranteed residential loans, which are down $2 billion since the third quarter of last year, including a $1 billion decline in home equity. So overall good progress toward this objective as well. 
A better diversification also applies to our business mix and fee income. Expanding wholesale business is a key strategic element in this priority, and we generated significant momentum on this front. While the third quarter was impacted by an industry-wide decline in capital markets revenue, Corporate and Investment Banking year-to-date revenue was up 16% and net income was up 23%. Diversified Commercial Banking revenue is up 9% and net income is up 34%. Growing our private wealth business is also a priority and you see we've had some success here as well as retail service income was up almost 20%. 
Now moving onto our expense initiatives in Slide 16. So anticipating a tougher operating environment earlier this year, we embarked upon the development of a program to uncover additional ways to make significant and permanent expense reduction throughout the organization. As a result of those efforts, we announced to you last quarter our plans to eliminate $300 million in run rate expenses by the end of 2013. Today, I'd like to provide some more specificity around what we're doing to accomplish that goal. 
First, you'll notice that this program now has a name, which is the PPG Expense Initiative. PPG is an acronym for playbook for profitable growth. It's what we call the collection of initiatives across the organization that we believe, over time, will be a key component in our plan to reduce our efficiency ratio to under 60%. As you can imagine, there are numerous initiatives in place under this program, but for purposes of communicating our progress, we've categorized them into a few core buckets, which you can see depicted on the slide. As we move through the process, we'll be updating you on the status of these with increasing accuracy and transparency. 
The bar across the top of the page will be filled in overtime with real dollar progress towards our program goal. As we've previously stated, only a small portion of the savings will actually be realized in 2011 and as such the dollar impact of our efforts, thus far, has not been meaningful. We have, however, made significant progress on our overall plan and are in full implementation mode on several large and dozens of smaller initiatives. I'll remind you that the $300 million in expense reductions are above and beyond the expected credit-related expense and mortgage repurchase reserve normalization that undoubtedly will occur -- undoubtedly occur as the economic environment improves. The sub-60 efficiency ratio goal is the culmination of both the program and these expected normalizations. 
So let me move to some of the specific initiatives. So first, starting with the strategic supply management effort. That's focused on not only securing even more competitive pricing from our supply base, but also proactively further managing down our own demand and assessing value received for costs incurred. Nearly all outside spend areas are in scope and the entire enterprise is in the game. The broad categories for which we are providing status updates are: Discretionary spending, demand management and outsourcing. Immediate actions have been taken to further reduce expense in obvious discretionary areas. But more importantly, we're enhancing our engagement model focused on sustaining these new lower levels of spending. 
The next key component of the program is the consumer bank efficiencies initiatives, which includes channel optimization, alternative channel management and sales and service productivity. As we've articulated previously, we've made numerous investments in client-facing technology such as mobile and ATM enhancements, which have supported and enabled a meaningful shift in clients' willingness to use self-service channels. As clients utilize these channels, it allows us to evaluate other aspects of our consumer delivery model such as our branch network. This is not a widespread branch-reduction exercise, though it will include some branch rationalization and core changes to our branch staffing model. There are going to be increases in key opportunity branches, but overall, net reductions to reflect reduced transaction volume. The changes are underway, and we'll begin to see the results early next year. The objective is to accomplish this while maintaining the key momentum we've established in our industry-leading loyalty. 
Operations staff and support is the final of the 3 main categories of savings and includes our shared service initiatives along with digital technology and lean process design and management. 
Within our corporate operations, there will be strategic consolidation of certain areas where redundancies have been identified. Today, some aspects of our corporate functions are performed in multiple parts of our organization like corporate staff within the lines of business and/or within the geographic units. Our future model will use a more centralized approach for support functions with more centers of excellence while preserving our key local sales and service delivery model. We expect that this will enable us to perform functions like marketing, procurement, technology and human resources more efficiently and more effectively. 
We're also pursuing other opportunities such as standard reporting through all elements of the organization. 
Digital technology, in this case, refers to a set of initiatives designed to significantly increase both our internal and our clients' use of digital solutions. We're uncovering means of reducing the amount of printed material in our interactions with clients in the day-to-day operations of our branches and across the bank. It also includes efforts to improve adoption rates of our more robust digital solutions by our clients. 
While many of the initiatives are very specific like consolidations, redundancy eliminations and spans and layers analysis, we're also incorporating lean tools and technologies in to virtually the whole bank to boost productivity. We've had much success in using lean process principles in our technology and operations area to help drive large-scale transformational improvements. We plan to adopt these on a more widespread basis across more disciplines. 
As the PPG expense program progresses, we'll provide status updates on each of the major initiatives outlined on this slide along with the real dollars that are coming out of our expense base as they are realized. I want to assure you this program has my full attention, and I'm confident that we've built the resources and have the intensity to accomplish our objective. 
So in conclusion and before we open up the call for Q&A, I'll note that while our bottom line performance is not yet where we'd like it to be, progress is being made. Momentum is building around the initiatives we have in place to grow targeted businesses, better diversify the loan portfolio and reduce expenses. While the future may be a little less certain, virtually all of our asset quality metrics improved this quarter. Our client first mandate and focus on having a talented, highly engaged workforce is being recognized and rewarded by our clients. And all that's being done with an eye towards driving better return for our shareholders. I have great confidence we've got the right priorities in place. We have a great team leading our company. We have focused teammates working towards a common objective. 
Now before we turn it over to Q&A, I'd like to take a little liberty to thank the teammates who are on this call as they are what define SunTrust. 
So with that said, Kris, let me hand it back over to you, and we'll start the Q&A"

Going forward, we've given you a little bit of guidance for Q4. We do expect to see a modest margin decline in Q4 also. And then, as we look out into 2012, we're thinking about the kinds of levers that we've got to be able to protect the margin. Those kinds of levers include things like further drops in deposit rates. Overall, ability that we've had to drop deposit rates has actually extended out farther than I had initially thought it would. So that's been a pleasant surprise, and we're now looking to see how we can continue to do more of that going forward. Other levers that we've got at our disposal are going to be things like further TruPS redemptions, further payoffs of our longer-term, more expensive debt. So we've got some levers that we're going to be continuing to pull on to try and manage the margin overall.

It does stand to reason that the further we get away from 2006 and the 2007 vintage, that mortgage repurchases will have less of an impact because the later vintages have tighter underwriting criteria and came in after the bulk of the housing price declines. And the improvement in our delinquency ratios, overall, do suggest that lower demands will eventually follow. But to be fair, we haven't seen what we expected so far."

But after excluding out the adjustment items, core trading was down about $15 million to $20 million quarter-over-quarter. The majority of that really happened in August as a result of all of the market volatility and all the issues that happened in Europe. We're not a huge trader. Most of our trading positions are really kept to service our client business. But we were impacted a little bit by that risk-off trade that happened in August and concurrent with the downgrade of the U.S. debt by S&P. In the fourth quarter, I think typically, what you see happen across the industry is trading revenue generally goes down as we get into the holiday season. It's a little hard to say now what the whole quarter is going to look like."

We're under no illusion that the operating environment is going to be easy, but we're focused on and making meaningful progress in the areas that we can control. So just to summarize, if I could, this quarter, we saw loan growth in our targeted commercial and consumer categories. Deposits hit a record new high. Credit trends continued to improve. We grew tangible book value. And our capital ratios were well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements, including Basel III. Our strategic priorities are set. Our teammates are focused. Our results are showing signs of progress. So with that as a conclusion, thank you for joining us today."
