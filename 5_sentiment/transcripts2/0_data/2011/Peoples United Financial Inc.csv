Before we go through the slides, let me provide I'd like to remind you that our objectives have been, and continue to be straightforward and twofold: To optimize existing busine",558,"Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we go through the slides, let me provide I'd like to remind you that our objectives have been, and continue to be straightforward and twofold: To optimize existing business and to efficiently deploy the excess capital. 
I'm glad to be able to provide a number of details today regarding our progress against those two objectives. Regarding our agenda today. First, we'll discuss our fourth quarter 2010 results, and the primary revenue initiatives we have underway. Second, we'll have an update on the integration of our four acquisitions closed in 2010, and our de novo branches in downtown Boston. Finally, I look forward to speaking with you on about our Danvers Bancorp acquisition, and we'll take questions.
Regarding growth, we're well positioned versus the industry, and that we have a number of products and services that we can deliver to new markets to represent real organic growth opportunities for us. Now we have to continue just to execute on that plan. 
In addition to those growth opportunities, we also remain significantly over capitalized, and intend to continue to look for well-priced acquisitions to better leverage our brand. Finally, we constantly evaluate the returns available to us via share repurchases.
On Slide 3, we've provided an overview of our fourth quarter results. Operating income for the quarter was $36.7 million, or $0.10 per share, excluding $4.7 million, or $0.01 per share of one-time cost, primarily related to mergers. 
Our net interest margin expanded by 12 basis points in the fourth quarter to 3.85% from 3.73% in the third quarter. Importantly, asset quality improved with net charge-offs declining 228 basis points from 57 basis points in the prior quarter. Our NPAs decreased in the fourth quarter to 2.07% from 2.18% in the third quarter. Our net loans grew by $221 million compared to the previous quarter.
On Slide 4, we reviewed key recent initiatives. Our acquisitions of the Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank, both closed November 30, and we are off to a great start. As expected, we opened both our Boston branches at the Prudential Center and at Milk Street by the middle of last month, and each branches are doing very, very well. 
As of January one, Jeff Tangle who have joined us in the first quarter of last year, took over as Head of Commercial Banking business area as planned, following Brian Dreyer's retirement. Jeff has over 25 years of commercial banking experience. Most recently he was at PNC, following PNC's acquisition of National City. In National City, Jeff was Executive Vice President of Corporate Banking and was a member of the executive management team.
As you get to know Jeff, you're going to learn that he's an excellent relationship-based commercial banker with a strong understanding of all of our business lines.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $114 million of our common stock equal to 8.7 million shares through open market purchases at an average price of $13.08. Because these repurchases leave us with only 2.9 million shares remaining under the initial share repurchase authorization, our board has also authorized an additional repurchase program for another 5% of our outstanding shares.
With that, I will turn it back to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter beginning on Page 5. Paul?"

As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin expanded to 3.85%, up 12 basis points from the third quarter. The primary drivers were both an increase in asset deals, as well as a decrease in interest expense. We are pleased to have our deposit cost drop by another six basis points in the quarter to 64 basis points. I would expect the net interest margin to remain at the 3.85% level in 2011.
Moving on to Slide 6, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans decreased in the fourth quarter to 28 basis points from 57 basis points in the third quarter. For the full year, charge-offs were 39 basis points compared to the 29 basis points in 2009. So for the fourth quarter, we are back to the lower 2009 levels.
On Slide 7, we're encouraged to have nonperformers falling. You can see there are NPAs decreasing by 11 basis points to 2.07% of originated loans and our REO.
Slide 8 shows an inflection point with respect to organic loan growth overall. Commercial loans grew $174 million from September  to December, and residential mortgages grew $99 million. 
Our core C&I and commercial real estate loans grew steadily throughout the year, but you'll recall we've been challenged by the continued residential mortgage runoff which we began reversing in the second quarter of 2010. Our portfolio overall, grew $221 million, and remains well diversified. We continue to see strong portfolio growth within existing loan products, as well as opportunities to introduce new products. 
Now I'll hand it back to Jack to provide you with an update on acquisition integration activities, as well as details about our Danvers Bancorp acquisition announced yesterday."
295774,118042367,93762,"People's United Financial Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2011",2011-01-21,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul.

We're pleased with  our integration efforts are going, and I just want to give you some color. On Slide 10, outlines are focused on driving revenue growth through the introduction of best practices throughout the franchise. We're rolling out the new customer experience On-Boarding and Retention Focus programs that have served us well in building our industry-leading loyalty among retail customers in our Connecticut and Westchester County, New York markets.
We're also investing a Retail Banking business with securities and life insurance licensing, as well as products and sales training, and the people securities and brokerage model. Our near-term objective is to increase cross-sell levels by approximately 30% in the northern markets to match current levels in the southern markets. 
Likewise, in Connecticut and New York, we are building our business banking and small business lending and deposit products and services, increasing our marketing of business services such as payroll processing, merchant services, and putting a strong emphasis on the wealth management business, especially in terms of Private Banking.
Slide 11 focuses on our integration of Financial Federal which we've renamed People's United Equipment Finance. We call this transaction close last February. Our portfolio loan balances are down, this business is not losing market share, rather, the market they sell into are depressed. These markets are primarily construction and to the lesser extent, transportation. 
Recall that most of their business is repeat business. They're cautiously optimistic that there will be an update during the second half of the year, as construction projects are this spring and activity picks up.
You'll recall that at the time of the announcement, we had expected no cost savings. In fact, we've been able to reduce operating expenses by 13%.
In Slide 12, provides an update on the integration of Butler Bank and RiverBank acquisitions in Massachusetts, as well as the progress at our the de novo downtown Boston branches. We're pleased to seem and 93% deposit retention rate since April 2010, closing of the Butler Bank transaction. 
Conversion is scheduled for the first week in February, concurrently with the conversion of the RiverBank. Recall that these two franchises are adjacent to one another in the Merrimack Valley.  Additionally, at RiverBank, we had announced the targeted cost savings of 30%, which we're on track to achieve. A meaningful portion of those cost savings will begin post conversion in February.
We're also very pleased that our deposit gathering and lending referral activities at the Boston branches. These offices have been opened approximately one month, and deposits totaled $14 million, more than double our early expectations. The people that we've put in place in the Boston offices and our focus on service, as well as our local New England-based leadership positons, have led us off to a great start in those two offices.
Slide 13 illustrates our progress in the integration of the Bank of Smithtown. Our brand of banking focused on the customer experience is well received in the Long Island for both the customer and the employee perspective. 
We are building on de novo C&I business on Long Island, as senior C&I lender with over 20 years of experience at People's United has relocated to the market. We've also hired a seasoned banker from Long Island market. 
With respect to the CRE business, our primary focus is on managing the existing portfolio. Our Long Island CRE team is led by another senior People's United Bank, who'll already lived in Long Island. We've also hired or bankers from within the market to actively manage and grow that portfolio.
Finally, we've hired the head of workout for the Long Island, and are supplementing the in-market employees with experienced People's United workout professionals from the Bridgeport area. We're also reducing problem assets through loan sales where appropriate, very encouraged about the prospect of good pace of reduction on the problem loan side. 
Our Long Island systems conversion is scheduled for June. By the way, we will finish our re-branding in Long Island in the months of February and March.
Slide 14, we'd like to walk you through the details of the Danvers transaction. Slide 15 outlines that strategic rationale of this transaction. Danvers provide People's United, New England's largest independent bank, with a significant presence in Boston, the region's economic hub. As you know, this has been a key strategic priority for us. People's United is pro forma of this transaction, the seventh largest bank in both Massachusetts in the Boston MSA. The 28-branched Danvers brand footprint, and complements our contiguous footprint, from Worchester and Central Massachusetts in through Boston and north to New Hampshire.
The acquisition provides an excellent platform for commercial growth, as Danvers is a commercially-focused franchise, with 49% of its loan portfolio in C&I loans. More over, Danvers has an excellent reputation in these markets, which is why we're excited to have Kevin Bottomley, the Chairman and CEO of Danvers Bank, joined the People's United Financial Board of Directors. Kevin will provide strategic leadership for our Boston growth efforts.
The transaction exceeds our stated financial hurdles with an IRR rate greater than 15%, significant earnings accretion, and a tangible book value dilution earn back period of approximately 57 years.
Slide 16 illustrates our expanded and strengthened the print in Eastern Massachusetts as a result of the acquisition and highlights the areas strong demographic profile. As you can see, the median household income in the Danvers bank footprint is very similar to the median household income within the legacy People's United footprint. 
As you can see on Slide 17, the transaction significantly enhances our market share position in Ethics County, the Boston MSA and the state of Massachusetts. 
Danvers bank is at Slide 18 illustrates, a strong and healthy bank. Over 150 years old, it has more than 2.6 billion in assets, net loans of $1.7 billion, and deposits of over $2 billion. It also has a healthy net interest margin at 3.49% and very strong asset quality. The last 12 months charge-offs to average loans of just 16 basis points.
Slide 19 details the diversified loan portfolio funded by core deposits.
Slide 20 highlights the strong asset quality I mentioned earlier. As you can see, net charge-offs and NPAs for both Danvers and People's United are significantly lower than those of the top 50 banks.
Turning to Slide 21, you can see we are paying $23 per share in consideration of 55% stock and 45% cash. The consideration mix is a result of the deal negotiations. 
Danvers as you expect, wanted to take a significant portion of bill consideration stock given a bit given their belief in the upside in the combined company. Like Danvers, we see upside in our stock too, and do not wish to issue a lot of stock at these levels. So this mix represents a compromise.
Targeted cost saves are 38%, if we exclude the 8% related to ESOP, turf and restricted stock, which were higher than normal, due to the fact that Danvers is a recently converted mutual holding company, the targeted cost saves becomes 30%, which is in line with the targeted cost saves at RiverBank. As I stated earlier, we're on track to achieve those cost saves.
Our 1.5% loan mark is a testimony to the high quality of the loan portfolio. Well remember never that willing to want our jobs are just 16 basis points. Danvers bank shareholder approval and regulatory approval is needed. I would note that People's United Financial shareholder approval is not needed in this transaction. We expect the transaction to close in this year's second quarter.
On Slide 22, you can see the pro forma impact of the transaction. Transaction increases our assets by $2.6 billion and deposits by $2 billion, and adds 28 branches to our network. We also expect earnings accretion of approximately $0.08 per share, and I stated earlier, we expect to earn the tangible book value dilution back in seven years. We anticipate return on invested capital will be greater than 10%.
In summary, on Slide 23, we're excited about the growth and confident in our position. We operate from a position of competitive strength based on our premium brand, our strong credit culture and strong pool of talent in our employee base. We also benefit from the opportunities to deliver new products and services into new markets.
We have demonstrated our ability to efficiently deploy capital through acquisitions, and maintain a strong dividend policy and the willingness, ability to execute in the share repurchase programs.
Further, given the impact on competitors, the extended low interest rate environment, the multiyear deleveraging process and increased regulatory pressures, we believe that other financial institutions will have interest in increasing pace in partnership discussions with us. We're very encouraged about the environment.
This concludes our presentation, and now we will be happy to answer any questions that you have."

Thank you for joining us today. Before we go through the slides that we provided, I'd like to remind you that our objectives have been, and continue to be straightforward and twofold: To optimize existing business and to efficiently deploy the excess capital. I'm glad to be able to provide a number of details today regarding our progress against those two objectives. 
Regarding our agenda today. First, we'll discuss our fourth quarter 2010 results and the primary revenue initiatives we have underway. Second, we'll have an update on the integration of our four acquisitions closed in 2010 and our de novo branches in downtown Boston. Finally, I look forward to speaking with you on about our Danvers Bancorp acquisition, and then we'll take questions.
Regarding growth, we're well-positioned versus the industry, and that we have a number of products and services that we can deliver to new markets to represent real organic growth opportunities for us. Now, we have to continue just to execute on that plan. In addition to those growth opportunities, we also remain significantly over capitalized, and intend to continue to look for well-priced acquisitions to better leverage our brand. Finally, we constantly evaluate the returns available to us via share repurchases.
On Slide 3, we've provided an overview of our fourth quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $36.7 million, or $0.10 per share, excluding $4.7 million, or $0.01 per share for one-time cost, primarily related to mergers. 
Our net interest margin expanded by 12 basis points in the fourth quarter to 3.85% from 3.73% in the third quarter. Importantly, asset quality improved with net charge-offs declining 228 basis points from 57 basis points in the prior quarter. Our NPAs decreased in the fourth quarter to 2.07% from 2.18% in the third quarter. Our net loans grew by $221 million compared to the previous quarter.
On Slide 4, we reviewed key recent initiatives. Our acquisitions of the Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank, both closed November 30, and we are off to a great start. As expected, we opened both our Boston branches at the Prudential Center and at Milk Street by the middle of last month, and these branches are doing very, very well. 
As of January 1, Jeff Tengel, who had joined us in the first quarter of last year, took over as Head of Commercial Banking business area as planned, following Brian Dreyer's retirement. Jeff has over 25 years of commercial banking experience. Most recently, he was at PNC, following PNC's acquisition of National City. At National City, Jeff was Executive Vice President of Corporate Banking and was a member of the executive management team. As you get to know Jeff, you're going to learn that he's an excellent relationship-based commercial banker with a strong understanding of all of our business lines.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $114 million of our common stock equal to 8.7 million shares through open market purchases at an average price of $13.08. Because these repurchases leave us with only 2.9 million shares remaining under the initial share repurchase authorization, our Board has also authorized an additional repurchase program for another 5% of our outstanding shares.
With that, I'll turn it back to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter beginning on Page 5. Paul?"

As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin expanded to 3.85%, up 12 basis points from the third quarter. The primary drivers were both an increase in asset yields, as well as a decrease in interest expense. We are pleased to have our deposit cost drop by another six basis points in the quarter to 64 basis points. I would expect the net interest margin to remain at the 3.85% level in 2011.
Moving on to Slide 6, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans decreased in the fourth quarter to 28 basis points from 57 basis points in the third quarter. For the full year, charge-offs were 39 basis points compared to the 29 basis points in 2009. So for the fourth quarter, we are back to the lower 2009 levels.
On Slide 7, we're encouraged to have non-performers falling. You can see there are NPAs decreased by 11 basis points to 2.07% of originated loans and our REO.
Slide 8 shows an inflection point with respect to organic loan growth overall. Commercial loans grew $174 million from September  to December, and residential mortgages grew $99 million. 
Our core C&I and commercial real estate loans grew steadily throughout the year, but you'll recall we've been challenged by the continued residential mortgage runoff, which we began reversing in the second quarter of 2010. Our portfolio, overall, grew $221 million, and remains well-diversified. We continue to see strong portfolio growth within existing loan products, as well as opportunities to introduce new products. 
Now, I'll hand it back to Jack to provide you with an update on acquisition integration activities, as well as details about our Danvers Bancorp acquisition announced yesterday."

We're pleased with how our integration efforts are going, and I just want to give you some color. 
On Slide 10, outlines are focused on driving revenue growth through the introduction of best practices throughout the franchise. We're rolling out the New Customer Experience on-boarding and retention-focused programs that have served us so well in building our industry-leading loyalty among retail customers in our Connecticut and Westchester County, New York markets.
We are also investing in our Retail Banking business with securities and life insurance licensing, as well as products and sales training, and the People's Securities brokerage model. Our near-term objective is to increase cross-sell levels by approximately 30% in the northern markets to match current levels in the southern markets. 
Likewise, in Connecticut and New York, we are building our business banking and small business lending and deposit products and services, increasing our marketing of business services such as payroll processing, merchant services, and putting a strong emphasis on the Wealth Management business, especially in terms of Private Banking.
Slide 11 focuses on our integration of Financial Federal, which we've renamed People's United Equipment Finance, we call this transaction close last February. While portfolio loan balances are down, this business is not losing market share, rather, the market they sell into are depressed. These markets are primarily construction and to the lesser extent, transportation. 
Recall that most of their business is repeat business. They're cautiously optimistic that we'll be an uptick during the second half of the year, as construction projects are let to spring and activity picks up. You'll recall that at the time of the announcement, we had expected no cost savings. In fact, we've been able to reduce operating expenses by 13%.
In Slide 12, provides an update on the integration of Butler Bank and RiverBank acquisitions in Massachusetts, as well as the progress at our the de novo downtown Boston branches. We're pleased to see a 93% deposit retention rate since April 2010, closing of the Butler Bank transaction. 
Conversion is scheduled for the first week in February, concurrent with the conversion of the RiverBank. Recall that these two franchises are adjacent to one another in the Merrimack Valley.  Additionally, at RiverBank, we had announced the targeted cost savings of 30%, which we are on track to achieve. A meaningful portion of those cost savings will begin post-conversion in February.
We're also very pleased at our deposit gathering and lending referral activities at the Boston branches. These offices have been opened approximately one month, and deposits totaled $14 million, more than double our early expectations. The people that we've put in place in the Boston offices and our focus on service, as well as our local New England-based leadership positons, have led us off to a great start in those two offices.
Slide 13 illustrates our progress in the integration of the Bank of Smithtown. Our brand of banking focused on the customer experience is well-received in the Long Island for both the customer and the employee perspective. 
We are building a de novo C&I business on Long Island, as senior C&I lender, with over 20 years of experience at People's United, has relocated to the market. We've also hired a seasoned banker from Long Island market. 
With respect to the CREF business, our primary focus is on managing the existing portfolio. Our Long Island CREF team is led by another senior People's United banker , who already lived in Long Island. We've also hired four bankers from within the market to actively manage and grow that portfolio.
Finally, we've hired the head of workout for the Long Island, and are supplementing the in-market employees with experienced People's United workout professionals from the Bridgeport area. We're also reducing problem assets through loan sales where appropriate, very encouraged about the prospect of good pace of reaction on the problem loan side. Our Long Island systems conversion is scheduled for June. By the way, we'll finish our re-branding in Long Island in the months of February and March.
On Slide 14, we'd like to walk you through the details of the Danvers transaction. 
Slide 15 outlines that strategic rationale of the transaction. Danvers provides People's United, New England's largest independent bank, with a significant presence in Boston, the region's economic hub. As you know, this has been a key strategic priority for us. People's United is pro forma of this transaction, the seventh largest bank in both Massachusetts and the Boston MSA. The 28-branched Danversbank footprint complements our contiguous footprint, from Worchester and Central Massachusetts, in through Boston and North to New Hampshire. The acquisition provides an excellent platform for commercial growth, as Danvers is a commercially-focused franchise, with 49% of its loan portfolio in C&I loans. 
More over, Danvers has an excellent reputation in these markets, which is why we're excited to have Kevin Bottomley, the Chairman and CEO of Danversbank, join the People's United Financial Board of Directors. Kevin will provide strategic leadership for our Boston growth efforts.
The transaction exceeds our stated financial hurdles with an IRR rate greater than 15%, significant earnings accretion, and a tangible book value dilution earn back period of approximately 57 years.
Slide 16 illustrates our expanded and strengthened footprint in Eastern Massachusetts as a result of the acquisition, and highlights the area's strong demographic profile. As you can see, the median household income in the Danversbank footprint is very similar to the median household income within the legacy of People's United footprint. 
As you can see on Slide 17, the transaction significantly enhances our market share position in Essex County, the Boston MSA and the state of Massachusetts. 
Danvers Bancorp is, at Slide 18, illustrates, a strong and healthy bank. Over 150 years old, it has more than $2.6 billion in assets, net loans of $1.7 billion, and deposits of over $2 billion. It also has a healthy net interest margin at 3.49% and very strong asset quality in the last 12 months charge-offs to average loans of just 16 basis points.
Slide 19 details the diversified loan portfolio funded by core deposits.
Slide 20 highlights the strong asset quality I mentioned earlier. As you can see, net charge-offs and NPAs for both Danvers and People's United are significantly lower than those of the top 50 banks.
Turning to Slide 21, you can see we are paying $23 per share in consideration of 55% stock and 45% cash. The consideration mix is a result of the deal negotiations. Danvers as you'd expect, wanted to take a significant portion of deal consideration and stock, given their belief in the upside in the combined company. Like Danvers, we see upside in our stock too, and do not wish to issue a lot of stock at these levels. So this mix represents a compromise.
Targeted cost saves are 38%. If we exclude the 8% related to ESOP, SERP and restricted stock, which were higher than normal due to the fact that Danvers is a recently converted mutual holding company, the targeted cost saves becomes 30%, which is in line with the targeted cost saves at RiverBank. As I stated earlier, we are on track to achieve those cost saves.
Our 1.5% loan mark is a testimony to the high quality of the loan portfolio. Remember that trailing 12-month charge-offs are just 16 basis points. Danvers Bancorp shareholder approval and regulatory approval is needed. I would note that People's United Financial shareholder approval is not needed in this transaction. We expect the transaction to close in this year's second quarter.
On Slide 22, you can see the pro forma impact of the transaction. Transaction increases our assets by $2.6 billion and deposits by $2 billion, and adds 28 branches to our network. We also expect earnings accretion of approximately $0.08 per share, and as stated earlier, we expect to earn the tangible book value dilution back in seven years. We anticipate return on invested capital will be greater than 10%.
In summary, on Slide 23, we're excited about the growth and confident in our position. We operate from a position of competitive strength based on our premium brand, our strong credit culture and strong pool of talent in our employee base. We also benefit from the opportunities to deliver new products and services into new markets.
We have demonstrated our ability to efficiently deploy capital through acquisitions, and maintain a strong dividend policy and then the willingness, ability to execute on the share repurchase programs.
Further, given the impact on competitors, the extended low interest rate environment, the multi-year deleveraging process and the increased regulatory pressures, we believe that other financial institutions will have interest in increasing pace in partnership discussions with us. We're very encouraged about the environment.
This concludes our presentation, and now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you have."

We've done a sale of one large problem loan that went very favorably for us and we have four or five that are actively in discussions.

Thank you for joining us today. Before we go through the slides that we provided, I'd like to remind you that our objectives have been, and continue to be straightforward and twofold: To optimize existing business and to efficiently deploy the excess capital. I'm glad to be able to provide a number of details today regarding our progress against those two objectives. 
Regarding our agenda today. First, we'll discuss our fourth quarter 2010 results and the primary revenue initiatives we have underway. Second, we'll have an update on the integration of our four acquisitions closed in 2010 and our de novo branches in downtown Boston. Finally, I look forward to speaking with you on about our Danvers Bancorp acquisition, and then we'll take questions.
Regarding growth, we're well-positioned versus the industry, in that we have a number of products and services that we can deliver to new markets to represent real organic growth opportunities for us. Now, we have to continue just to execute on that plan. In addition to those growth opportunities, we also remain significantly over capitalized, and intend to continue to look for well-priced acquisitions to better leverage our brand. Finally, we constantly evaluate the returns available to us via share repurchases.
On Slide 3, we've provided an overview of our fourth quarter results. Operating net income for the quarter was $36.7 million, or $0.10 per share, excluding $4.7 million, or $0.01 per share for one-time cost, primarily related to mergers. 
Our net interest margin expanded by 12 basis points in the fourth quarter to 3.85% from 3.73% in the third quarter. Importantly, asset quality improved with net charge-offs declining 228 basis points from 57 basis points in the prior quarter. Our NPAs decreased in the fourth quarter to 2.07% from 2.18% in the third quarter. Our net loans grew by $221 million compared to the previous quarter.
On Slide 4, we reviewed key recent initiatives. Our acquisitions of the Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank, both closed November 30, and we are off to a great start. As expected, we opened both our Boston branches at the Prudential Center and at Milk Street by the middle of last month, and these branches are doing very, very well. 
As of January 1, Jeff Tengel, who had joined us in the first quarter of last year, took over as Head of Commercial Banking business area as planned, following Brian Dreyer's retirement. Jeff has over 25 years of commercial banking experience. Most recently, he was at PNC, following PNC's acquisition of National City. At National City, Jeff was Executive Vice President of Corporate Banking and was a member of the executive management team. As you get to know Jeff, you're going to learn that he's an excellent relationship-based commercial banker with a strong understanding of all of our business lines.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $114 million of our common stock equal to 8.7 million shares through open market purchases at an average price of $13.08. Because these repurchases leave us with only 2.9 million shares remaining under the initial share repurchase authorization, our Board has also authorized an additional repurchase program for another 5% of our outstanding shares.
With that, I'll turn it back to Paul to provide you with details on the quarter beginning on Page 5. Paul?"

As Jack mentioned, our overall net interest margin expanded to 3.85%, up 12 basis points from the third quarter. The primary drivers were both an increase in asset yields, as well as a decrease in interest expense. We are pleased to have our deposit costs drop by another six basis points in the quarter to 64 basis points. I would expect the net interest margin to remain at the 3.85% level in 2011.
Moving on to Slide 6, the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans decreased in the fourth quarter to 28 basis points from 57 basis points in the third quarter. For the full year, charge-offs were 39 basis points compared to the 29 basis points in 2009. So for the fourth quarter, we are back to the lower 2009 levels.
On Slide 7, we're encouraged to have non-performers falling. You can see there are NPAs decreased by 11 basis points to 2.07% of originated loans and our REO.
Slide 8 shows an inflection point with respect to organic loan growth overall. Commercial loans grew $174 million from September  to December, and residential mortgages grew $99 million. 
Our core C&I and commercial real estate loans grew steadily throughout the year, but you'll recall we've been challenged by the continued residential mortgage runoff, which we began reversing in the second quarter of 2010. Our portfolio, overall, grew $221 million, and remains well-diversified. We continue to see strong portfolio growth within existing loan products, as well as opportunities to introduce new products. 
Now, I'll hand it back to Jack to provide you with an update on acquisition integration activities, as well as details about our Danvers Bancorp acquisition announced yesterday."
295774,118042367,94107,"People's United Financial Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2011",2011-01-21,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul.

We're pleased with how our integration efforts are going, and I just want to give you some color. 
On Slide 10, outlines are focused on driving revenue growth through the introduction of best practices throughout the franchise. We're rolling out the New Customer Experience on-boarding and retention-focused programs that have served us so well in building our industry-leading loyalty among retail customers in our Connecticut and Westchester County, New York markets.
We are also investing in our Retail Banking business with securities and life insurance licensing, as well as products and sales training, and the People's Securities brokerage model. Our near-term objective is to increase cross-sell levels by approximately 30% in the northern markets to match current levels in the southern markets. 
Likewise, in Connecticut and New York, we are building our business banking and small business lending and deposit products and services, increasing our marketing of business services such as payroll processing, merchant services, and putting a strong emphasis on the Wealth Management business, especially in terms of Private Banking.
Slide 11 focuses on our integration of Financial Federal, which we've renamed People's United Equipment Finance, we call this transaction close last February. While portfolio loan balances are down, this business is not losing market share, rather, the market they sell into are depressed. These markets are primarily construction and to the lesser extent, transportation. 
Recall that most of their business is repeat business. They're cautiously optimistic that we'll see an uptick during the second half of the year, as construction projects are let to spring and activity picks up. You'll recall that at the time of the announcement, we had expected no cost savings. In fact, we've been able to reduce operating expenses by 13%.
In Slide 12, provides an update on the integration of Butler Bank and RiverBank acquisitions in Massachusetts, as well as the progress at our de novo downtown Boston branches. We're pleased to see a 93% deposit retention rate since April 2010, closing of the Butler Bank transaction. 
Conversion is scheduled for the first week in February, concurrent with the conversion of the RiverBank. Recall that these two franchises are adjacent to one another in the Merrimack Valley.  Additionally, at RiverBank, we had announced the targeted cost savings of 30%, which we are on track to achieve. A meaningful portion of those cost savings will begin post-conversion in February.
We're also very pleased at our deposit gathering and lending referral activities at the Boston branches. These offices have been opened approximately one month, and deposits totaled $14 million, more than double our early expectations. The people that we've put in place in the Boston offices and our focus on service, as well as our local New England-based leadership positons, have led us off to a great start in those two offices.
Slide 13 illustrates our progress in the integration of the Bank of Smithtown. Our brand of banking focused on the customer experience is well-received in the Long Island for both the customer and the employee perspective. 
We are building a de novo C&I business on Long Island, as senior C&I lender, with over 20 years of experience at People's United, has relocated to the market. We've also hired a seasoned banker from Long Island market. 
With respect to the CREF business, our primary focus is on managing the existing portfolio. Our Long Island CREF team is led by another senior People's United banker , who already lived in Long Island. We've also hired four bankers from within the market to actively manage and grow that portfolio.
Finally, we've hired the head of workout for the Long Island, and are supplementing the in-market employees with experienced People's United workout professionals from the Bridgeport area. We're also reducing problem assets through loan sales where appropriate, very encouraged about the prospect of good pace of reaction on the problem loan side. Our Long Island systems conversion is scheduled for June. By the way, we'll finish our re-branding in Long Island in the months of February and March.
On Slide 14, we'd like to walk you through the details of the Danvers transaction. 
Slide 15 outlines the strategic rationale of the transaction. Danvers provides People's United, New England's largest independent bank, with a significant presence in Boston, the region's economic hub. As you know, this has been a key strategic priority for us. People's United is pro forma of this transaction, the seventh largest bank in both Massachusetts and the Boston MSA. The 28-branched Danversbank footprint complements our contiguous footprint, from Worchester and Central Massachusetts, in through Boston and North to New Hampshire. The acquisition provides an excellent platform for commercial growth, as Danvers is a commercially-focused franchise, with 49% of its loan portfolio in C&I loans. 
More over, Danvers has an excellent reputation in these markets, which is why we're excited to have Kevin Bottomley, the Chairman and CEO of Danversbank, join the People's United Financial Board of Directors. Kevin will provide strategic leadership for our Boston growth efforts.
The transaction exceeds our stated financial hurdles with an IRR greater than 15%, significant earnings accretion, and a tangible book value dilution earn back period of approximately 57 years.
Slide 16 illustrates our expanded and strengthened footprint in Eastern Massachusetts as a result of the acquisition, and highlights the area's strong demographic profile. As you can see, the median household income in the Danversbank footprint is very similar to the median household income within the legacy of People's United footprint. 
As you can see on Slide 17, the transaction significantly enhances our market share position in Essex County, the Boston MSA and the state of Massachusetts. 
Danvers Bancorp is, as Slide 18, illustrates a strong and healthy bank. Over 150 years old, it has more than $2.6 billion in assets, net loans of $1.7 billion, and deposits of over $2 billion. It also has a healthy net interest margin at 3.49% and very strong asset quality in the last 12 months charge-offs to average loans of just 16 basis points.
Slide 19 details the diversified loan portfolio funded by core deposits.
Slide 20 highlights the strong asset quality I mentioned earlier. As you can see, net charge-offs and NPAs for both Danvers and People's United are significantly lower than those of the top 50 banks.
Turning to Slide 21, you can see we are paying $23 per share in consideration of 55% stock and 45% cash. The consideration mix is a result of the deal negotiations. Danvers, as you'd expect, wanted to take a significant portion of deal consideration and stock, given their belief in the upside in the combined company. Like Danvers, we see upside in our stock too, and do not wish to issue a lot of stock at these levels. So this mix represents a compromise.
Targeted cost saves are 38%. If we exclude the 8% related to ESOP, SERP and restricted stock, which were higher than normal due to the fact that Danvers is a recently converted mutual holding company, the targeted cost saves becomes 30%, which is in line with the targeted cost saves at RiverBank. As I stated earlier, we are on track to achieve those cost saves.
Our 1.5% loan mark is a testimony to the high quality of the loan portfolio. Remember that trailing 12-month charge-offs are just 16 basis points. Danvers Bancorp shareholder approval and regulatory approval is needed. I would note that People's United Financial shareholder approval is not needed in this transaction. We expect the transaction to close in this year's second quarter.
On Slide 22, you can see the pro forma impact of the transaction. Transaction increases our assets by $2.6 billion and deposits by $2 billion, and adds 28 branches to our network. We also expect earnings accretion of approximately $0.08 per share, and as stated earlier, we expect to earn the tangible book value dilution back in seven years. We anticipate return on invested capital will be greater than 10%.
In summary, on Slide 23, we're excited about the growth and confident in our position. We operate from a position of competitive strength based on our premium brand, our strong credit culture and strong pool of talent in our employee base. We also benefit from the opportunities to deliver new products and services into new markets.
We have demonstrated our ability to efficiently deploy capital through acquisitions, and maintain a strong dividend policy and the willingness, ability to execute on the share repurchase programs.
Further, given the impact on competitors, the extended low interest rate environment, the multi-year deleveraging process and the increased regulatory pressures, we believe that other financial institutions will have interest in increasing pace in partnership discussions with us. We're very encouraged about the environment.
This concludes our presentation, and now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you have."

And we had been working on hoping to realize on acquisitions and the Butler, the River and now Danvers acquisitions have brought us a long way to achieving our goals there, and we hope for more. And we obviously, decided to do the two de novo branches in Boston to begin to establish the downtown Boston and a presence in the Boston MSA pending realizing any -- an acquisition opportunity. So in the process of doing that, we did announce this sort of what kind of pace we could realize in revenue and in earnings improvement from taking both the tasks. And clearly, the acquisition route is much more favorable to us. And I'm sure anyone, given the length of time it takes to establish scale in de novo branches."

And good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to be able to share solid progress toward improved operating performance in the quarter which comes from everybody's hard work on executing to our plan. 
Before we go through the slides, I'd like to remind you that our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold, one to optimize the existing business and two, efficiently deploy excess capital. I'm very happy to be able to provide the number of details regarding our continued progress against those objectives.
Here on Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. Net income for the quarter was $51.7 million or $0.15 per share with operating net income of $53.8 million, which when rounded is still $0.15 per share. Net interest margin expanded by 29 basis points in the first quarter to 4.16% from 3.87% in the fourth quarter. Total loan growth was $195 million or 4.5% linked quarter annualized. Deposits grew at a 3.9% annualized rate. Notably, this growth occurred while deposit rate fell from 64 basis points to 59 basis points in the quarter.
Our non-interest income increased by $6.5 million, supported by a $5.5 million gain on nonperforming loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio and a full quarter of contributions from Smithtown and RiverBank. With expenses flat, and revenue up, our efficiency ratio declined to 66.2%. This represents initial steps toward our ultimate goal. We would expect that as we deploy capital and rightsize our expense basis, our efficiency ratio will move in line with peer averages.
Asset quality improved with our nonperforming asset decreasing in the first quarter to 1.96% from 2.09% in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs also declined to 22 basis points from 28 basis points in the prior quarter. Our Danvers transaction is on track with their shareholder vote set for May 13. On Slide 3, we review recent initiatives. As you know, we named Kirk Walters as CFO, and he is now a member of the board of both the bank and the holding company. Kirk brings extraordinary competency and experience, built over more than 30 years, 22 of those years in the Northeast markets. In particular, his experiences at Chittenden and Santander give him an outstanding perspective on the competitive landscape in which we operate.
Now turning to our operating initiatives, we've been expanding our asset base lending business with a nice pickup in originations this quarter. As we mentioned at the time of the Danvers transaction announcement, we look forward to combining our asset base lending business with theirs to deliver an excellent solution throughout our foot print. 
Additionally, this quarter, we've expanded the multifamily lending activity through the acquisition of Bank of Smithtown on Long Island and increased penetration into New York Metro area by our Connecticut-based commercial real estate lenders. At the end of the quarter, the deposits at the Prudential Center in Milk Street branches in Boston totaled $37 million, with growth of $29 million during the quarter. Approximately 70% of those deposit in the branches are non timed. The C&I lending effort in Boston has developed traction already with seasoned in market lenders winning business.
On Long Island, we've seen 7% core deposit growth since the transaction closed on November 30. We attribute that growth to local market's excellent job, excuse me, local management's excellent job at regaining customer loyalty and relationships. Our Long Island performance has been a pleasant surprise with solid home equity and mortgage origination in the first quarter. I'm pleased with our work to understand the acquired Smithtown portfolio and build our C&I lending capabilities on Long Island.
Since the quarter closed, we booked our first C&I loans of $23 million to a local college. We've also, we're also pleased to announce earlier today another increase in our dividend, our 19th consecutive annual increase, which will result in a dividend yield of approximately 4.9%. During the first quarter, we repurchased $60.7 million of our common stock equal to 4.6 million shares through open market purchases at an average price of $13.09. We are currently prohibited from buying back stock as a result of our equity issuance and the pending Danvers Bancorp transaction, which, as I mentioned earlier expect to close later this quarter.
With that, I'm pleased to hand it over to Kirk."

In this challenging economic en",1496,"Thank you, Jack. Before I start, as this is my first quarter here at People's United, I thought I would take a moment to share my perspective with you and explain why I have such high confidence in our ability to succeed. 
In this challenging economic environment, People's United has immense opportunities to drive growth through new markets, new product and increased cross-selling. We benefit from exceptional relationships built over 169 years and a balance sheet, which is 93% funded by low-cost deposit and common equity.
It's worth pointing out here that the current banking environment is very similar in terms of regulatory response that of late 1980s and early 1990s when -- were passed following the savings loan prices. These acts had the equivalent impact on the industry as Dodd-Frank has today. As banks began to feel the impact of these regulatory requirements in the mid-1990s, we saw a number of weaker operators begin to face a fatigue factor, encouraging consolidation in the industry. Our management team is experienced and has a record of strong operators who have survived and thrived in the banking crisis of the 1980s, 1990s, as well as through the most recent one.
Furthermore, People's United conducts business in the nation's best commercial banking market, characterized by high density markets with well-educated customers and multigenerational businesses that provide additional credit support to the region. 
Importantly, a wave of consolidations over the past 20 years has created a void in relationship-based and customer service focused banking, which we are uniquely positioned to fill. Now I will return to the presentation.
On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to the increase in our margin, which rose to 4.16%. An accretive yield adjustment for our People's United Equipment Finance business, formerly Financial Federal, added 16 basis points to the margin. This adjustment, which happens to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Financial Federal transaction has brought about by better than expected credit experience and slower than anticipated repayment activity, both of which have the effect of increasing the portfolios accretively yield over the remaining life of the underlying loans. In the case of Financial Federal, the portfolio duration is shorter than that of a traditional bank portfolio, which has the effect of amplifying the extent of such accretable yield adjustment.
That said, generally speaking, the credit experience within acquired loan portfolios continue to be better than originally expected. We will likely benefit from additional interest accretion as those portfolios run down. In the first quarter, investment mix and yields contributed an additional 12 basis points to the margin. During the fourth quarter, average balances for short-term investment and securities totaled $3.7 billion, yielded 1.6% and had a period and duration of 2.4 years. This compares to the average balances for short-term investments and securities for the first quarter of 2011, which totaled $3.8 billion, yielded 2.26% and had a duration of 2.7 years.
The full quarter impact the bak of Smithtown and RiverBank also added 15 basis points. As we've discussed, we did have 4.5% linked quarter annualized loan growth, primarily funded by deposit growth, which one would expect to have also positively contributed to our margin. And while it did, the impact was small because March was an extremely strong month accounting for more than half of the average loan balance growth. Accordingly, we will see an increased margin contribution from this loan growth in the second quarter.
On Slide 5, you can see that our net interest margin has been growing steadily, beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we have experienced healthy and sustained margin expansion. As of the first quarter of 2010, we held virtually all of our excess capital in cash to fed earning 25 basis points. In the second quarter 2010, we began to invest more of our excess capital and agency mortgage-backed securities. As a result of these investment decisions, since period end of the first quarter 2010, our net interest margin has positively been impacted by approximately 25 basis points. Whereas last quarter, we expected net interest margin to remain at the 3.85% level or above for the rest of 2011. Today, we would expect net interest margin to remain at 4% or above for the rest of the year.
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. We look at our portfolio as 2 distinct pieces: originated and acquired. Our originated portfolio grew at a linked quarter annualized rate of 11.4% compared to 7.4% last quarter. 11.4% growth represents a weighted average of 11% in commercial banking and 12.3% in retail and business banking. 
Within commercial banking, the commercial real estate category grew by approximately $200 million during the quarter. This increase was largely attributable to in footprint multifamily loan growth.
C&I loans grew modestly. Within Retail and Business Banking, the increase in residential mortgages was a result of a large refinance pipeline that carried over from 2010. Our acquired portfolio shrank during the quarter by 30% on an annualized basis. This change is amplified by nonperforming loans sales from the acquired Smithtown portfolio. Taken together, the originated and acquired portfolio has produced total loan growth of 4.5% quarter-over-quarter annualized. Since we're talking about loans, as footnoted on the earnings release, on the heels of a core system conversion in multiple acquisitions completed in 2010, we reclassified approximately $875 million of owner occupied CRE loans to C&I. This reclassification was a result of a portfolio review undertaken to ensure that our commercial loans were classified in a consistent manner and serves to align policy across our expanded franchise and better conform to industry practice for such loans.
You can see on Slide 7 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. In the DeNovo category, Boston branch has experienced $30 million of growth as we mentioned earlier with a similar growth on a higher base in Westchester. Again, our Long Island customers responded well to our local management efforts. We also were pleased to open our sixth Westchester branch in Bronxeville  [ph] in the first week of the current quarter.
Slide 8 provides a breakout of non-interest income. Highlights include $5.5 million of gains on nonperforming loan sales from the acquired Smithtown portfolio, full quarter impact to Smithtown and RiverBank and strength across the board in wealth management.
Regarding the nonperforming loans sales of the acquired Smithtown portfolio, we're pleased with this outcome as these loans represented some of the more troubled credits in the portfolio. We continued to evaluate loan sales from within the acquired banks portfolios. We have a very good idea of where fair value is for these loans and we continue to see a good strategic and investor interest in these loans.
On Slide 9, we're pleased to report that absolute expenses remained relatively flat following the first quarter of Bank of Smithtown and Riverbank expenses. The RiverBank conversion occurred in late February and reported significant cost savings. The Smithtown system conversion is scheduled for June 17 and we expect similar levels of efficiencies.
On Slide 10, the efficiency ratio improved to 66% due to increased revenues and a lower cost of funds. I know that many of you have been focused on this ratio for this institution. As you know, this ratio is affected by both revenue and expenses and we'll be actively working on both sides of the ratio to move it to peer averages in the future.
Slide 11 and 12 are quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers in the industry. We are encouraged by continued drop in nonperformers. You can see that NPAs decreased by another 13 basis points to 1.96% of originated loan in REO. Early returns for the second quarter are looking good as well.
Looking at Slide 12, as we said before and will continue to say, we see the net charge-offs numbers slightly volatile. We're pleased with where it is, but it can be a bit lumpy.
On Slide 13, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. As we described, we feel confident in the direction of our credit trends. We did increase the loan-loss provision this quarter beyond the level of charge-offs to keep pace with originated loan growth. Slide 14 illustrates one the best measures of our progress, our operating return on average assets for the first quarter was 87 basis points, up 23 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010. We're pleased to be moving in the right direction. We clearly have more work to do as we are targeting a return on average assets in excess of 1.25%. We expect additional loan and deposit growth through system conversion at Smithtown and the integration of Danvers Bancorp to further support our return on average assets in the quarters ahead.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 15, regarding capital deployment, you can see that our primary focus is deploying capital via organic loan growth in the new markets and by delivering new loan products and services throughout our franchise. We spoke earlier about the dividend and share repurchase. 
On acquisitions, our primary focus is in New England and New York City metro areas and secondarily in the mid-Atlantic region. I continue to build relationships with potential partners in these markets.
On Slide 16, in summary, we offer a compelling investment opportunity based on our sustainable competitive advantage and improving returns as we leverage our excess capital. We have strong fundamentals that include a premium 169-year-old branch led by a renewed and strengthened leadership team. We have a high-quality branch footprint characterized by wealth, density and commercial activity. Our brand of banking allows for a low cost of deposits and an above average net interest margin. Finally, we consistently deliver industry-leading asset quality levels.
We are working to optimize our business, relationship-based thinking while efficiently going loans and deposit per share, which includes growth into of the country's largest markets, the New York and Boston MSAs. We are significantly more asset sensitive than our peers so when rates finally do rise, we will experience a strong positive impact on our net interest income. 
Finally, our pro forma tangible common equity ratio is approximately 12%, leaving us plenty of opportunity for continued growth. This concludes our presentation. Before we take your questions, Peter has a few remarks about the Q&A session. Peter?"

But we have been keeping the duration relatively short on the investment side and certainly from a funding standpoint, which is the other side of the equation. If you look at the loan growth this quarter, it was funded by our own deposits, in our own branches, et cetera, at a lower cost. So really, we're able to fund the loan growth with our deposits that which of course is powerful and preserving the rate sensitivity that we have there.

And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to be able to share solid progress toward improved operating performance in the quarter which comes from everybody's hard work on executing to our plan. 
Before we go through the slides, I'd like to remind you that our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: One to optimize the existing business; and two, efficiently deploy excess capital. I'm very happy to be able to provide the number of details regarding our continued progress against those objectives.
Here on Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. Net income for the quarter was $51.7 million or $0.15 per share with operating net income of $53.8 million, which when rounded is still $0.15 per share. Net interest margin expanded by 29 basis points in the first quarter to 4.16% from 3.87% in the fourth quarter. Total loan growth was $195 million or 4.5% linked quarter annualized. Deposits grew at a 3.9% annualized rate. Notably, this growth occurred while deposit rates fell from 64 basis points to 59 basis points in the quarter.
Our non-interest income increased by $6.5 million, supported by a $5.5 million gain on nonperforming loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio and a full quarter of contributions from Smithtown and RiverBank. With expenses flat and revenue up, our efficiency ratio declined to 66.2%. This represents initial steps toward our ultimate goal. We would expect that as we deploy capital and rightsize our expense basis, our efficiency ratio will move in line with peer averages.
Asset quality improved with our nonperforming assets decreasing in the first quarter to 1.96% from 2.09% in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs also declined to 22 basis points from 28 basis points in the prior quarter. Our Danvers transaction is on track with their shareholder vote set for May 13. 
On Slide 3, we review recent initiatives. As you know, we named Kirk Walters as CFO, and he is now a member of the board of both the bank and the holding company. Kirk brings extraordinary competency and experience built over more than 30 years, 22 of those years in the Northeast markets. In particular, his experiences at Chittenden and Santander give him an outstanding perspective on the competitive landscape in which we operate.
Now turning to our operating initiatives, we've been expanding our Asset Base Lending business with a nice pick up in originations this quarter. As we mentioned at the time of the Danvers transaction announcement, we look forward to combining our Asset Base Lending business with theirs to deliver an excellent solution throughout our footprint.  Additionally, this quarter, we've expanded our multifamily lending activities through the acquisition of Bank of Smithtown on Long Island and increased penetration into New York Metro area by our Connecticut-based commercial real estate lenders. At the end of the quarter, the deposits at the Prudential Center in Milk Street branches in Boston totaled $37 million, with growth of $29 million during the quarter. Approximately 70% of those deposits in the branches are non-time. The C&I lending effort in Boston has developed traction already with seasoned end market lenders winning business.
On Long Island, we've seen 7% core deposit growth since the transaction closed on November 30. We attribute that growth to local markets' excellent job, excuse me, local management's excellent job at regaining customer loyalty and relationships. Our Long Island performance has been a pleasant surprise with solid home equity and mortgage origination in the first quarter. I'm pleased with our work to understand the acquired Smithtown portfolio and build our C&I lending capabilities on Long Island.
Since the quarter closed, we've booked our first C&I loan of $23 million to a local college. We've also -- we're also pleased to announce earlier today another increase in our dividend, our 19th consecutive annual increase, which will result in a dividend yield of approximately 4.9%. During the first quarter, we repurchased $60.7 million of our common stock equal to 4.6 million shares through open market purchases at an average price of $13.09. We are currently prohibited from buying back stock as a result of our equity issuance in the pending Danvers Bancorp transaction, which as I mentioned earlier, I expect to close later this quarter.
With that, I'm pleased to hand it over to Kirk."

In this challenging economic en",1501,"Thank you, Jack. Before I start, as this is my first quarter here at People's United, I thought I would take a moment to share my perspective with you and explain why I have such high confidence in our ability to succeed. 
In this challenging economic environment, People's United has immense opportunities to drive growth through new markets, new product and increased cross-selling. We benefit from exceptional relationships built over 169 years and a balance sheet which is 93% funded by low-cost deposit and common equity.
It's worth pointing out here that the current banking environment is very similar in terms of regulatory response that of the late 1980s and early 1990s when FIRREA and FDICIA were passed following the savings and loan crisis. These acts had the equivalent impact on the industry as Dodd-Frank has today. As banks began to feel the impact of these regulatory requirements in the mid 1990s, we saw a number of weaker operators begin to face a fatigue factor, encouraging consolidation in the industry. Our management team is experienced and has a record of strong operators who have survived and thrived in the banking crisis of the 1980s, 1990s, as well as through the most recent one.  
Furthermore, People's United conducts business in the nation's best commercial banking market, characterized by high density markets with well-educated customers and multigenerational businesses that provide additional credit support to the region.  Importantly, a wave of consolidations over the past 20 years has created a void in relationship-based and customer service focused banking, which we are uniquely positioned to fill. 
Now I will return to the presentation.  On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to the increase in our margin, which rose to 4.16%. An accretable yield adjustment for our People's United Equipment Finance business, formerly Financial Federal, added 16 basis points to the margin. This adjustment, which happens to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Financial Federal transaction is brought about by better than expected credit experience and slower than anticipated prepayment activity, both of which have the effect of increasing the portfolio's accretable yield over the remaining life of the underlying loans. In the case of Financial Federal, the portfolio duration is shorter than that of a traditional bank portfolio, which has the effect of amplifying the extent of such accretable yield adjustments.
That said, generally speaking, the credit experience within acquired loan portfolios continue to be better than originally expected. We will likely benefit from additional interest accretion as those portfolios run down. In the first quarter, investment mix and yields contributed an additional 12 basis points to the margin. During the fourth quarter, average balances for short-term investment and securities totaled $3.7 billion, yielded 1.6% and had a period end duration of 2.4 years. This compares to the average balances for short-term investments and securities for the first quarter of 2011, which totaled $3.8 billion, yielded 2.26% and had a duration of 2.7 years.  The full quarter impact of Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank also added 15 basis points. 
As we've discussed, we did have 4.5% linked quarter annualized loan growth, primarily funded by deposit growth, which one would expect to have also positively contributed to our margin. And while it did, the impact was small because March was an extremely strong month accounting for more than half of the average loan balance growth. Accordingly, we will see an increased margin contribution from this loan growth in the second quarter.
On Slide 5, you can see that our net interest margin has been growing steadily. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we have experienced healthy and sustained margin expansion. As of the first quarter of 2010, we held virtually all of our excess capital in cash to the Fed earning 25 basis points. In the second quarter 2010, we began to invest more of our excess capital and agency mortgage-backed securities. As a result of these investment decisions, since period end of the first quarter 2010, our net interest margin has positively been impacted by approximately 25 basis points. Whereas last quarter, we expected net interest margin to remain at the 3.85% level or above for the rest of 2011. Today, we would expect net interest margin to remain at 4% or above for the rest of the year.
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. We look at our portfolio as 2 distinct pieces: originated and acquired. Our originated portfolio grew at a linked quarter annualized rate of 11.4% compared to 7.4% last quarter. 11.4% growth represents a weighted average of 11% in Commercial Banking and 12.3% in Retail and Business banking.  Within Commercial Banking, the commercial real estate category grew by approximately $200 million during the quarter. This increase was largely attributable to in-footprint multifamily loan growth.
C&I loans grew modestly. Within Retail and Business Banking, the increase in residential mortgages was a result of a large refinance pipeline that carried over from 2010. Our acquired portfolio shrank during the quarter by 30% on an annualized basis. This change is amplified by nonperforming loan sales from the acquired Smithtown portfolio. Taken together, the originated and acquired portfolio has produced total loan growth of 4.5% quarter-over-quarter annualized. Since we're talking about loans as footnoted on the earnings release, on the heels of a core system conversion in multiple acquisitions completed in 2010, we reclassified approximately $875 million of owner occupied CRE loans to C&I. This reclassification was a result of a portfolio review undertaken to ensure that all commercial loans were classified in a consistent manner and serves to align policy across our expanded franchise and better conform to industry practice for such loans.
You can see on Slide 7 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. In the De Novo category, Boston branch has experienced $30 million of growth, as we mentioned earlier, with a similar growth on a higher base in Westchester. Again, our Long Island customers responded well to our local management's efforts. We also were pleased to open our sixth Westchester branch in Bronxville  in the first week of the current quarter.
Slide 8 provides a breakout of non-interest income. Highlights include $5.5 million of gains on nonperforming loan sales from the acquired Smithtown portfolio, full quarter impact to Smithtown and RiverBank and strength across the board in Wealth Management.
Regarding the nonperforming loan sales of the acquired Smithtown portfolio, we're pleased with this outcome as these loans represented some of the more troubled credits in the portfolio. We continued to evaluate loan sales from within the acquired banks' portfolios. We have a very good idea of where fair value is for these loans and continue to see a good, strategic and investor interest in these loans.
On Slide 9, we're pleased to report that absolute expenses remained relatively flat following the first quarter of Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank expenses. The RiverBank conversion occurred in late February and afforded significant cost savings. The Smithtown system conversion is scheduled for June 17, and we expect similar levels of efficiencies.
On Slide 10, the efficiency ratio improved to 66% due to increased revenues and a lower cost of funds. I know that many of you have been focused on this ratio for this institution. As you know, this ratio is affected by both revenue and expenses, and we'll be actively working on both sides of the ratio to move it to peer averages in the future.
Slide 11 and 12 are a quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers' in the industry. We are encouraged by continued drop in nonperformers. You can see that NPAs decreased by another 13 basis points to 1.96% of originated loans in REO. Early returns for the second quarter are looking good as well.
Looking at Slide 12, as we said before and will continue to say, we see the net charge-offs number's slightly volatile. We're pleased with where it is, but it can be a bit lumpy.
On Slide 13, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. As we described, we feel confident in the direction of our credit trends. We did increase the loan-loss provision this quarter beyond the level of charge-offs to keep pace with originated loan growth. 
Slide 14 illustrates one the best measures of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the first quarter was 87 basis points, up 23 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010. We're pleased to be moving in the right direction. We clearly have more work to do as we are targeting a return on average assets in excess of 1.25%. We expect additional loan and deposit growth through system conversion at Smithtown and the integration of Danvers Bancorp will further support our return on average assets in the quarters ahead.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 15, regarding capital deployment, you can see that our primary focus is deploying capital via organic loan growth in the new markets and by delivering new loan products and services throughout our franchise. We spoke earlier about the dividend and share repurchase. 
On acquisitions, our primary focus is in New England and New York City metro areas and secondarily in the mid-Atlantic region. I continue to build relationships with potential partners in these markets.
On Slide 16, in summary, we offer a compelling investment opportunity based on our sustainable competitive advantage and improving returns as we leverage our excess capital. We have strong fundamentals that include a premium 169-year-old brand led by a renewed and strengthened leadership team. We have a high quality branch footprint characterized by wealth, density and commercial activity. Our brand of banking allows for a low cost of deposits and an above average net interest margin. Finally, we consistently deliver industry-leading asset quality levels.
We are working to optimize our business, relationship-based thinking while efficiently going loans and deposits per share, which includes growth in two of the country's largest markets, the New York and Boston MSAs. We are significantly more asset sensitive than our peers so when rates finally do rise, we will experience a strong positive impact on our net interest income. 
Finally, our pro forma tangible common equity ratio is approximately 12%, leaving us plenty of opportunity for continued growth. This concludes our presentation. Before we take your questions, Peter has a few remarks about the Q&A session. Peter?"

And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to be able to share solid progress toward improved operating performance in the quarter which comes from everybody's hard work on executing to our plan.",719,"Thank you, Peter. And good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to be able to share solid progress toward improved operating performance in the quarter which comes from everybody's hard work on executing to our plan. 
Before we go through the slides, I'd like to remind you that our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: One, to optimize the existing business; and two, efficiently deploy excess capital. I'm very happy to be able to provide the number of details regarding our continued progress against those objectives.
Here on Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. Net income for the quarter was $51.7 million or $0.15 per share with operating net income of $53.8 million, which when rounded is still $0.15 per share. Net interest margin expanded by 29 basis points in the first quarter to 4.16% from 3.87% in the fourth quarter. Total loan growth was $195 million or 4.5% linked quarter annualized. Deposits grew at a 3.9% annualized rate. Notably, this growth occurred while deposit rates fell from 64 basis points to 59 basis points in the quarter.
Our non-interest income increased by $6.5 million, supported by a $5.5 million gain on nonperforming loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio and a full quarter of contributions from Smithtown and RiverBank. With expenses flat and revenue up, our efficiency ratio declined to 66.2%. This represents initial steps toward our ultimate goal. We would expect that as we deploy capital and rightsize our expense basis, our efficiency ratio will move in line with peer averages.
Asset quality improved with our nonperforming assets decreasing in the first quarter to 1.96% from 2.09% in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs also declined to 22 basis points from 28 basis points in the prior quarter. Our Danvers transaction is on track with their shareholder vote set for May 13. 
On Slide 3, we review recent initiatives. As you know, we named Kirk Walters as CFO, and he is now a member of the board of both the bank and the holding company. Kirk brings extraordinary competency and experience built over more than 30 years, 22 of those years in the Northeast markets. In particular, his experiences at Chittenden and Santander give him an outstanding perspective on the competitive landscape in which we operate.
Now turning to our operating initiatives, we've been expanding our Asset Base Lending business with a nice pick up in originations this quarter. As we mentioned at the time of the Danvers transaction announcement, we look forward to combining our Asset Base Lending business with theirs to deliver an excellent solution throughout our footprint.  Additionally, this quarter, we've expanded our multifamily lending activities through the acquisition of Bank of Smithtown on Long Island and increased penetration into New York Metro area by our Connecticut-based commercial real estate lenders. At the end of the quarter, the deposits at the Prudential Center in Milk Street branches in Boston totaled $37 million, with growth of $29 million during the quarter. Approximately 70% of those deposits in the branches are non-time. The C&I lending effort in Boston has developed traction already with seasoned end-market lenders winning business.
On Long Island, we've seen 7% core deposit growth since the transaction closed on November 30. We attribute that growth to local management's excellent job at regaining customer loyalty and relationships. Our Long Island performance has been a pleasant surprise with solid home equity and mortgage origination in the first quarter. I'm pleased with our work to understand the acquired Smithtown portfolio and build our C&I lending capabilities on Long Island.
Since the quarter closed, we've booked our first C&I loan of $23 million to a local college. We're also pleased to announce earlier today another increase in our dividend, our 19th consecutive annual increase, which will result in a dividend yield of approximately 4.9%. During the first quarter, we repurchased $60.7 million of our common stock equal to 4.6 million shares through open market purchases at an average price of $13.09. We are currently prohibited from buying back stock as a result of our equity issuance in the pending Danvers Bancorp transaction, which as I mentioned earlier, I expect to close later this quarter.
With that, I'm pleased to hand it over to Kirk."

In this challenging economic en",1500,"Thank you, Jack. Before I start, as this is my first quarter here at People's United, I thought I would take a moment to share my perspective with you and explain why I have such high confidence in our ability to succeed. 
In this challenging economic environment, People's United has immense opportunities to drive growth through new markets, new products and increased cross-selling. We benefit from exceptional relationships built over 169 years and a balance sheet which is 93% funded by low-cost deposits and common equity.
It's worth pointing out here that the current banking environment is very similar in terms of regulatory response that of the late 1980s and early 1990s when FIRREA and FDICIA were passed following the savings and loan crisis. These acts had the equivalent impact on the industry as Dodd-Frank has today. As banks began to feel the impact of these regulatory requirements in the mid 1990s, we saw a number of weaker operators begin to face a fatigue factor, encouraging consolidation in the industry. Our management team is experienced and has a record of strong operators who have survived and thrived in the banking crisis of the 1980s, 1990s, as well as through the most recent one.  
Furthermore, People's United conducts business in the nation's best commercial banking market, characterized by high density markets with well-educated customers and multigenerational businesses that provide additional credit support to the region.  Importantly, a wave of consolidations over the past 20 years has created a void in relationship-based and customer service focused banking, which we are uniquely positioned to fill. 
Now I will return to the presentation.  On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to the increase in our margin, which rose to 4.16%. An accretable yield adjustment for our People's United Equipment Finance business, formerly Financial Federal, added 16 basis points to the margin. This adjustment, which happens to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Financial Federal transaction is brought about by better than expected credit experience and slower than anticipated prepayment activity, both of which have the effect of increasing the portfolio's accretable yield over the remaining life of the underlying loans. In the case of Financial Federal, the portfolio duration is shorter than that of a traditional bank portfolio, which has the effect of amplifying the extent of such accretable yield adjustments.
That said, generally speaking, the credit experience within acquired loan portfolios continue to be better than originally expected. We will likely benefit from additional interest accretion as those portfolios run down. In the first quarter, investment mix and yields contributed an additional 12 basis points to the margin. During the fourth quarter, average balances for short-term investment and securities totaled $3.7 billion, yielded 1.6% and had a period end duration of 2.4 years. This compares to the average balances for short-term investments and securities for the first quarter of 2011, which totaled $3.8 billion, yielded 2.26% and had a duration of 2.7 years.  The full quarter impact of Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank also added 15 basis points. 
As we've discussed, we did have 4.5% linked quarter annualized loan growth, primarily funded by deposit growth, which one would expect to have also positively contributed to our margin. And while it did, the impact was small because March was an extremely strong month accounting for more than half of the average loan balance growth. Accordingly, we will see an increased margin contribution from this loan growth in the second quarter.
On Slide 5, you can see that our net interest margin has been growing steadily. Beginning in the first quarter of 2010, we have experienced healthy and sustained margin expansion. As of the first quarter of 2010, we held virtually all of our excess capital in cash to the Fed earning 25 basis points. In the second quarter 2010, we began to invest more of our excess capital and agency mortgage-backed securities. As a result of these investment decisions, since period end of the first quarter 2010, our net interest margin has positively been impacted by approximately 25 basis points. Whereas last quarter, we expected net interest margin to remain at the 3.85% level or above for the rest of 2011. Today, we would expect net interest margin to remain at 4% or above for the rest of the year.
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. We look at our portfolio as 2 distinct pieces: originated and acquired. Our originated portfolio grew at a linked quarter annualized rate of 11.4% compared to 7.4% last quarter. 11.4% growth represents a weighted average of 11% in Commercial banking and 12.3% in Retail and Business banking.  Within Commercial banking, the commercial real estate category grew by approximately $200 million during the quarter. This increase was largely attributable to in-footprint multifamily loan growth.
C&I loans grew modestly. Within Retail and Business banking, the increase in residential mortgages was a result of a large refinance pipeline that carried over from 2010. Our acquired portfolio shrank during the quarter by 30% on an annualized basis. This change is amplified by nonperforming loan sales from the acquired Smithtown portfolio. Taken together, the originated and acquired portfolio has produced total loan growth of 4.5% quarter-over-quarter annualized. Since we're talking about loans as footnoted on the earnings release, on the heels of a core system conversion in multiple acquisitions completed in 2010, we reclassified approximately $875 million of owner occupied CRE loans to C&I. This reclassification was a result of a portfolio review undertaken to ensure that all commercial loans were classified in a consistent manner and serves to align policy across our expanded franchise and better conform to industry practice for such loans.
You can see on Slide 7 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. In the De Novo category, Boston branch has experienced $30 million of growth, as we mentioned earlier, with a similar growth on a higher base in Westchester. Again, our Long Island customers responded well to our local management's efforts. We also were pleased to open our sixth Westchester branch in Bronxville in the first week of the current quarter.
Slide 8 provides a breakout of non-interest income. Highlights include $5.5 million of gains on nonperforming loan sales from the acquired Smithtown portfolio, full quarter impact to Smithtown and RiverBank and strength across the board in Wealth Management.
Regarding the nonperforming loan sales of the acquired Smithtown portfolio, we're pleased with this outcome as these loans represented some of the more troubled credits in the portfolio. We continued to evaluate loan sales from within the acquired banks' portfolios. We have a very good idea of where fair value is for these loans and continue to see good, strategic and investor interest in these loans.
On Slide 9, we're pleased to report that absolute expenses remained relatively flat following the first quarter of Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank expenses. The RiverBank conversion occurred in late February and afforded significant cost savings. The Smithtown system conversion is scheduled for June 17, and we expect similar levels of efficiencies.
On Slide 10, the efficiency ratio improved to 66% due to increased revenues and a lower cost of funds. I know that many of you have been focused on this ratio for this institution. As you know, this ratio is affected by both revenue and expenses, and we'll be actively working on both sides of the ratio to move it to peer averages in the future.
Slide 11 and 12 are a quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers' in the industry. We are encouraged by continued drop in nonperformers. You can see that NPAs decreased by another 13 basis points to 1.96% of originated loans in REO. Early returns for the second quarter are looking good as well.
Looking at Slide 12, as we've said before and will continue to say, we see the net charge-offs number's slightly volatile. We're pleased with where it is, but it can be a bit lumpy.
On Slide 13, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. As we described, we feel confident in the direction of our credit trends. We did increase the loan-loss provision this quarter beyond the level of charge-offs to keep pace with originated loan growth. 
Slide 14 illustrates one the best measures of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the first quarter was 87 basis points, up 23 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010. We're pleased to be moving in the right direction. We clearly have more work to do as we are targeting a return on average assets in excess of 1.25%. We expect additional loan and deposit growth through system conversion at Smithtown and the integration of Danvers Bancorp will further support our return on average assets in the quarters ahead.
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

On Slide 15, regarding capital deployment, you can see that our primary focus is deploying capital via organic loan growth in the new markets and by delivering new loan products and services throughout our franchise. We spoke earlier about the dividend and share repurchase. 
On acquisitions, our primary focus is in New England and New York City metro areas and secondarily in the mid-Atlantic region. I continue to build relationships with potential partners in these markets.
On Slide 16, in summary, we offer a compelling investment opportunity based on our sustainable competitive advantage and improving returns as we leverage our excess capital. We have strong fundamentals that include a premium 169-year-old brand led by a renewed and strengthened leadership team. We have a high quality branch footprint characterized by wealth, density and commercial activity. Our brand of banking allows for a low cost of deposits and an above average net interest margin. Finally, we consistently deliver industry-leading asset quality levels.
We are working to optimize our business, relationship-based thinking while efficiently going loans and deposits per share, which includes growth in two of the country's largest markets, the New York and Boston MSAs. We are significantly more asset sensitive than our peers so when rates finally do rise, we will experience a strong positive impact on our net interest income. 
Finally, our pro forma tangible common equity ratio is approximately 12%, leaving us plenty of opportunity for continued growth. This concludes our presentation. Before we take your questions, Peter has a few remarks about the Q&A session. Peter?"

As I begin my comments, please keep in mind that our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and two-fold. One, optimizing the existing businesses and two, efficiently deploying excess capital. The second quarter much like the first, represents progress against those goals. 
On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. Net income for the quarter was $51.2 million, or $0.15 per share with operating net income of $57.3 million, or $0.17 per share. Net interest margin for the second quarter was 4.13%, compared to 4.16% in the first quarter and 3.87% in the fourth quarter. We call that last quarter, we expected our margin to remain above 4%, excluding accretable yield reassessment, our core net interest margin came in at 4.09%. We continue to see solid loan growth of $164 million or 3.7% linked quarter annualized. Deposits also grew at a 3.7% annualized rate. This growth occurred while deposit costs declined from 59 basis points to 58 basis points in the quarter. Our non-interest income increased by $2 million quarter-over-quarter, which include a $7.2 million gain on acquired loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio. We continue to make progress on our efficiency ratio, which declined to 65.7% in the quarter from 66.2% in the first quarter. As many of you have heard us say during the quarter, we are committed to reducing our efficiency ratio to 55% within the next two years. As you'll hear in a minute, we've made additional progress beyond what's represented in the second quarter's results. Finally, while our nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets increased in the second quarter to 2.05% of loans and REO, compared to 1.96% in the first quarter, this increase was entirely due to the effect of a single credit. Of course we'll be providing additional colors today on our asset quality, which remains a source of pride for the company. 
On Slide 3, we review recent initiatives. Our Danversbank transaction closed on June 30 effective July 1st of the financial reporting purposes, which is why their numbers are not included in our second quarter results. We're please to welcome, Kevin Bottomley to our Board of Directors, he'll provide strategic leadership for our Boston growth efforts. In addition, he brings 35 years of banking experience to our Board. We expect to convert Danvers to our operating system and rebrand their branches early in the fourth quarter. We successfully completed the system conversion of Bank of Smithtown during the weekend of June 17, which will result in annual savings of $3 million. In total, we've exceeded our target costs savings at the time of acquisition announcement. We'll see the full quarter benefit of the conversion related savings in the third quarter. As we announced in our earnings release, we have also undertaken a number of franchise wide initiatives that will result in approximately $20 million in annual cost savings. These include changes to our retirement programs and other benefits and headcount reductions primarily in corporate positions. We'll see the full benefit of these changes in 2012. We continue to seek new opportunities for business growth and announced early this month our hire of Michael Mariano who'll head our asset-based lending group and report directly to Jeff Tengel, Head of Commercial Lending. Michael's possibilities will also include oversight of our new mortgage house business as we view this as an asset-based lending product. Michael joined us from Sovereign Bank, where he spent the past nine years. While at Sovereign, he was Executive Vice President and Divisions President of Sovereign business capital, a $2 billion business and EVP Debt Management and Recoveries. Prior to that, Michael was Division President of Fleet Capital, now Bank of America Business Capital, responsible for the business finance division. We have high expectations for growth in this segment. Finally, we recently announced three new branches in Massachusetts. Two in downtown Boston and one in Lexington, Massachusetts. With these new branches, and the completion of the Danvers transaction, we now have 59 branches in Boston MSA with six branches in downtown Boston. From a deposit share perspective, we also are now the seventh largest bank in both Massachusetts and the Boston MSA. We're excited about the momentum we have in Massachusetts and the Boston MSA in particular. With that I'm pleased to hand it over to Kirk."
295774,134124501,144276,"People's United Financial Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. As I listened to Jack's comments on the quarter and the recent initiatives, I'd like to reflect on what I think is happening here for a big picture of prospective. Recall much of the management team has changed over the past two years and",2132,"Good afternoon. As I listened to Jack's comments on the quarter and the recent initiatives, I'd like to reflect on what I think is happening here for a big picture of prospective. Recall much of the management team has changed over the past two years and Jack took over as CEO in April of last year. Jack took over this institution is refocused on optimizing the existing business which has reenergized key units of the business. In addition, important progress has been made on capital deployment, which has afforded us large new markets in Boston and Long Island such that we no longer need M&A to improve our profitability. It takes a little while for customers to reengage in businesses such as residential mortgage and home equity when you are effectively not a participant for three to four years. For my perspective, while we clearly have more work ahead of us, this franchise does have momentum as a result of a number of strategic decisions taken over the last year. 
Now let me take you through some of the details. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.13% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, core first quarter net interest margin was 4% excluding the 16 basis point benefit from People's United Equipment Finance equitable yield reassessments. This quarter, we had a 4 basis point benefit from accretable yields reassessments. The effects of changing loan mix and yield both in the acquired and originated portfolio was a 3 basis point improvement. Underlying this number is repricing pressure on our originated loans, which has more than offset by accretion on our acquired loan portfolio. In addition, we experienced 4 basis points of benefit from changing investment mix and yield as we invested more of our cash into securities and substituted some callable agencies for MBS. Finally, we picked-up 2 basis points due to lower deposits and borrowing rates. 
On Slide 5, you can see that our net interest margin has been growing steadily. Despite a prolonged period of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market, we continue to expect the net interest margin to remain above 4% for the rest of the year. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost, stable funding, good loan mix in strong capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch on credit. 
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. As we discussed last quarter, we look at our portfolio as two distinct pieces, originated and acquired. Our originated portfolio grew at a link quarter annualized rate of 12.2%, compared to 11.4% last quarter. The 12.2% growth represents a weighted average of 18.7% in retail and business banking. And 9.3% in commercial banking. I'm pleased to report that we have experienced loan growth across the board and all of our originated loans portfolios. Even home equity saw growth for the first time in several quarters. Loan growth was led by retail specifically residential mortgage with $187 million of quarterly growth or 30% linked quarter annualized. Our residential mortgage pipeline stands as high as its level in a few years at 47% from last quarter. Second quarter growth and pipeline growth are attributable to a few changes. One, we have a jumbo mortgage product. We didn't have one a year ago because we weren't portfolio and mortgages. 70% in the pipeline is jumbo product. Two, acquired in Long Island branches, acquired in Massachusetts and Long Island branches have undergone mortgage certification training and are now more comfortable with the product. Three, we've added seven mortgage account officers. Four, variable compensations have been adjusted to further encourage mortgage originations and five, lastly, we have regained traction with third-party mortgage originators. This product is fully underwritten by us just comes through a different channel, and is only done in our footprint. I'd highlight that we only book in hybrid ARMs to our portfolio and that we operate in excellent markets for high quality residual mortgages. 
Finally, some statistics about our recent originations. The average loan size of the second quarter originations was $553,000, average by the score for the second quarter was 759 with an average LTV of 65%. Also within the regional category, Home Equity outstanding actually grew in the face of low interest rates, which often lead customers to refinance the primary mortgage and consolidate home equity balances. In fact, second quarter was an outstanding period for this business. The new Home Equity commitment closings totaling $161 million, which represents a 65% increase versus the prior quarter and the pipeline increased 84% versus the prior quarter. Branch incentives, sales contests and home equity promotion including newspaper, advertising, direct mail and radio contributed to this growth. Again, some statistics about our recent originations, the average loan and line size. The second quarter was $126,000, average FICO score was 745 and the average combined loan to value was 54%.  On a percent of home equity loans our retail originated in all of our footprint. The new approach is towards both our residential mortgage and home equity businesses are excellent examples of the strategic changes made by the new management team. Within the commercial portfolio, our growth was led by CRE with a $102 million increase followed by C&I with $63 million of growth. C&I originations are new geographies, Boston and Long Island, accounted for 25% of our total originated commercial loan growth in the second quarter. The commercial pipeline is up approximately 10%, compared to the prior quarter as a result of good growth in our core Connecticut markets coupled with growth in Boston, Long Island in Southern Maine and new initiatives such as the mortgage warehouse lending in particular. Our acquired portfolio decreased during the quarter by 43% linked quarter annualized. This change was once again amplified by acquired loan sales resolutions and charge-offs from the acquired Smithtown portfolio. Later in the presentation, we'll detail more of our progress to date on our Smithtown nonperforming portfolio. Taken together, the originated and acquired portfolios produced total loan growth of 3.7%, quarter-over-quarter, annualized. 
You can see on Slide 7 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We continue to see healthy growth rates within our de novo branches. In April, we opened two new Stop and Shop branches in New Haven, Connecticut and West Hartford, Connecticut as well as the previously announced Bronx, New York branch. The acquired portfolio did shrink modestly but deposit rates for those branches of novo mix improved. The run-off at these branches went entirely high rate single transactions CDs and municipal deposits, which in the great state of New York as a thrift charter bank we are not allowed to hold. In Cedars, we have no reason to hold given their high-cost and our strong funding base. Recall when we announce these transactions our intention was and remains to move the deposit rates of required institutions in line with our legacy branches. As of the end of the second quarter, the weighted average core deposit retention rate of the acquired banks since the acquisition closed is 109%. So we've actually seen nice core deposit growth in the acquired branch networks. During 2011, the average weighted cost of deposits of the acquired banks has dropped 20 basis points to 1.2%. Though we definitely have more work to do but we're making good progress and in the coming quarters deposit rates will continue to move towards the franchise wide deposit rate, which is 58 basis points for the second quarter. 
Slide 8 provides a breakout of non-interest income. Bank service charges benefited from a full quarter of fee increases which we reinstituted in February as well as seasonally stronger interchange fees. The increase in gain on sale of acquired loans and the former bank's Smithtown portfolio of $1.7 million was more than offset by the $2 million decrease in net gain on sale of residential loans. As we will discuss in a moment, we've made significant progress with respect to the acquired Smithtown portfolio and as a result, it's not likely that we'll see the same magnitude of gains on acquired loans in the quarters ahead. We also saw seasonal and continued cyclical pressure on insurance revenue. 
On Slide 9, we were pleased to report another quarter of solid cost control. On an operating basis, our run rate has been consistently under $200 million over the past two quarters in spite the carrying the full cost load of River and Bank of Smithtown. As the Danvers transaction closed in June 30, which is effective July 1, we will have a full quarter of Danvers expenses in our third quarter numbers. 
On Slide 10, the efficiency ratio decreased slightly to 65.7% in the second quarter, compared to 66.2% in the first quarter. As you saw in our press release and heard in Jack's comments earlier, we've taken some important steps to reduce our cost base by $23 million on an annual basis in 2012. These initiatives and the scheduled Danvers conversion are a part of a two-year process, which we expect to produce and efficiency ratio of 55% or better. 
Slides 11 and 12 are a quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers in the industry. As mentioned in the press release, and earlier in this presentation, we did have one CRE loan to an in-market borrower with an out-of-market property that moved to nonperforming. A portion of which was charged of. The borrower is cooperating and current on payments. This single credit accounts for the entire increase in nonperforming loans and charge-offs. If we exclude this credit, the nonperforming loans are actually down $5 million continuing the improving trend within the originated portfolio. Despite the slight uptick in nonperformers, which was entirely related to the aforementioned single credit, nonperforming assets of 2.05% of originated loans and REO remain well below the peer group in Top 50 banks. I continue to be encouraged by the overall positive credit performance of our loan portfolio, which is attributable to a heritage of strong underwriting. 
Looking at Slide 12, as we said last quarter, we see the net charge-offs number as slightly up. While we remain pleased with our net charge-off levels, we do experience some lumpiness. If we exclude the single credit already discussed, net charge-offs average loans were 22 basis points in line with last quarter's results. 
On Slide 13, we detailed our progress in working up nonperforming loans within the acquired Smithtown portfolio. At the time of closing, nonperforming loans totaled $268.7 million. Since closing we've experienced additional $130.4 million of NPA in-flows. Simultaneously $125.3 million of loans in the portfolio have been sold, settled and paid off, while we've charged off $74.9 million. In addition, we experienced $24.4 million of loans returning to accrual and $9.4 million of paydowns. This high level of activity leaves us nonperformers totaling $169.1 million, which compares favorably to our remaining non-accretable difference of credit market of $296.6 million. As many of you know, we have included the slight highlighting the non-accretable difference for each of the acquired portfolios in our investor presentation. We've updated that Slide  for the second quarter of 2011 and have included it as an appendix in this presentation. This Slide now also includes the remaining equitable yield by portfolio. 
On Slide 14, you can see the details for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. As we just described, we feel confident in the direction of our credit trends. We had a specific reserve against the single credit so provisioning increase reflects originated growth. 
Slide 15 illustrates one of the best managers of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 92 basis points, continuing to move towards our return on average assets call of 1.25%. We expect future return on average assets improvements to come from additional loan and deposit growth and enhance the income cross-selling initiatives, core quarter impact as Smithtown system conversion and the integration of Danvers Bancorp, as well as the overhead cost reduction initiatives discussed earlier in additional cost reduction efforts. 
Slide 16 is an important lens for us  as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share and take care of business on the cost side, as we discussed earlier, we will produce greater earnings per share. With two consecutive quarters of excellent fundamentals I feel even more optimistic about the opportunities for this franchise and I did when I started in March. Now I'll passed it back to Jack."

As I begin my comments, please keep in mind that our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: One, optimizing the existing businesses; and two, efficiently deploying excess capital. The second quarter, much like the first, represents progress against those goals. 
On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. Net income for the quarter was $51.2 million or $0.15 per share with operating net income of $57.3 million or $0.17 per share. Net interest margin for the second quarter was 4.13% compared to 4.16% in the first quarter and 3.87% in the fourth quarter. Recall that last quarter we expected our margin to remain above 4%. Excluding accretable yield reassessment, our core net interest margin came in at 4.09%. We continue to see solid loan growth of $164 million or 3.7% linked-quarter annualized. Deposits also grew at a 3.7% annualized rate. This growth occurred while deposit costs declined from 59 basis points to 58 basis points in the quarter. Our noninterest income increased by $2 million quarter-over-quarter, which include a $7.2 million gain on acquired loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio. We continue to make progress on our efficiency ratio, which declined to 65.7% in the quarter from 66.2% in the first quarter. As many of you have heard us say during the quarter, we are committed to reducing our efficiency ratio to 55% within the next 2 years. As you'll hear in a minute, we've made additional progress beyond what's represented in the second quarter's results. Finally, while our nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets increased in the second quarter to 2.05% of loans and REO compared to 1.96% in the first quarter. This increase was entirely due to the effect of a single credit. Of course, we'll be providing additional color today on our asset quality, which remains a source of pride for the company. 
On Slide 3, we review recent initiatives. Our Danversbank transaction closed on June 30, effective July 1 for the financial reporting purposes, which is why their numbers are not included in our second quarter results. 
We're pleased to welcome Kevin Bottomley to our Board of Directors. He will provide strategic leadership for our Boston growth efforts. In addition, he brings 35 years of banking experience to our board. We expect to convert Danvers to our operating system and rebrand their branches early in the fourth quarter. We successfully completed the system conversion of Bank of Smithtown during the weekend of June 17, which will result in annual savings of $3 million. In total, we've exceeded our target cost savings at the time of the acquisition; announcement. We'll see the full quarter benefit of the conversion-related savings in the third quarter. 
As we announced in our earnings release, we have also undertaken a number of franchise-wide initiatives that will result in approximately $20 million in annual cost savings. These include changes to our retirement program and other benefits and headcount reduction, primarily in corporate positions. We'll see the full benefit of these changes in 2012. We continue to seek new opportunities for business growth and announced early this month our hire of Michael Maiorino who will head our asset-based lending group and report directly to Jeff Tengel, Head of Commercial Lending. Michael's responsibilities will also include oversight of our new mortgage warehouse business as we view this as an asset-based lending product. Michael joined us from Sovereign Bank, where he spent the past 9 years. While at Sovereign, he was Executive Vice President and Divisions President of Sovereign business capital, a $2 billion business and EVP, Debt Management and Recoveries. Prior to that, Michael was Division President at Fleet Capital, now Bank of America Business Capital, responsible for the Business Finance Division. We have high expectations for growth in this segment. 
Finally, we recently announced 3 new branches in Massachusetts, 2 in downtown Boston and one in Lexington, MA. With these new branches and the completion of the Danvers transaction, we now have 59 branches in Boston MSA with 6 branches in downtown Boston. From a deposit share perspective, we're also now the seventh largest bank in both Massachusetts and the Boston MSA. We're excited about the momentum we have in Massachusetts and the Boston MSA in particular. With that, I'm pleased to hand it over to Kirk."
295774,134124501,144440,"People's United Financial Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. As I listen to Jack's comments on the quarter and the recent initiatives, I'd like to reflect on what I think is happening here from a big picture perspective. Recall much of the management team has changed over the past 2 years and Jack t",2137,"Good afternoon. As I listen to Jack's comments on the quarter and the recent initiatives, I'd like to reflect on what I think is happening here from a big picture perspective. Recall much of the management team has changed over the past 2 years and Jack took over as CEO in April of last year. [indiscernible] since Jack took over, this institution is refocused on optimizing the existing business which has reenergized key units of the business. In addition, important progress has been made on capital deployment, which has afforded us large new markets in Boston and Long Island such that we no longer need M&A to improve our profitability. It takes a little while for customers to reengage in businesses such as residential mortgage and Home Equity when you are effectively not a participant for 3 to 4 years. From my perspective, while we clearly have more work ahead of us, this franchise does have momentum as a result of a number of strategic decisions taken over the last year. 
Now let me take you through some of the details. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.13% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, core first quarter net interest margin is 4% excluding the 16 basis point benefit from People's United Equipment Finance equitable yield reassessments. This quarter, we had a 4 basis point benefit from accretable yield reassessments. The effects of changing loan mix and yield in both the acquired and originated portfolio was a 3 basis point improvement. Underlying this number is repricing pressure on our originated loans, which is more than offset by accretion on our acquired loan portfolio. In addition, we experienced 4 basis points of benefit from changing investment mix and yield as we invested more of our cash into securities and substituted some callable agencies for MBS. Finally, we picked up 2 basis points due to lower deposit and borrowing rates. 
On Slide 5, you can see that our net interest margin has been growing steadily. Despite a prolonged period of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market, we continue to expect our net interest margin to remain above 4% for the rest of the year. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost, stable funding, good loan mix and strong capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch on credit. 
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. As we discussed last quarter, we look at our portfolio as 2 distinct pieces, originated and acquired. Our originated portfolio grew at a linked-quarter annualized rate of 12.2% compared to 11.4% last quarter. The 12.2% growth represents a weighted average of 18.7% in retail and business banking and 9.3% in commercial banking. I'm pleased to report that we experienced loan growth across the board in all of our originated loan portfolios. Even Home Equity saw growth for the first time in several quarters. Loan growth was led by retail, specifically residential mortgage, with $187 million of quarterly growth or 30% linked-quarter annualized. Our residential mortgage pipeline stands at its highest level in a few years at 47% from last quarter. Second quarter growth and pipeline growth are attributable to a few changes: One, we have the Jumbo Mortgage Product. We didn't have one a year ago because we weren't portfolio and mortgages. 70% in the pipeline is Jumbo Product; two, acquired in Long Island branches -- acquired in Massachusetts and Long Island branches have undergone mortgage certification training and are now more comfortable with the product; three, we've added 7 mortgage account officers; four, variable compensation has been adjusted to further encourage mortgage originations; and five, lastly, we have regained traction with third-party mortgage originators. This product is fully underwritten by us, just comes through a different channel and is only done in our footprint. I'd highlight that we are only booked in hybrid ARMs to our portfolio and that we operate in excellent markets for high quality residential mortgages. 
Finally, some statistics about our recent originations. The average loan size of the second quarter originations was $553,000, average FICO score score for the second quarter was 759 with an average LTV of 65%. Also within the retail category, Home Equity outstanding actually grew in the face of low interest rates, which often lead customers to refinance their primary mortgage and consolidate Home Equity balances. In fact, second quarter was an outstanding period for this business. The new Home Equity commitment closings totaling $161 million, which represents a 65% increase versus the prior quarter and the pipeline increased 84% versus the prior quarter. Branch incentives, sales contests and Home Equity promotion including newspaper, advertising, direct mail and radio contributed to this growth. Again, some statistics about our recent originations, the average loan and line size. The second quarter was $126,000, average FICO score was 745 and the average combined loan to value was 54%.  
100% of Home Equity loans are retail originated in all our footprint. The new approaches towards both our residential mortgage and Home Equity businesses are excellent examples of the strategic changes made by the new management team. Within the commercial portfolio, our growth was led by CRE with a $102 million increase followed by C&I with $63 million of growth. C&I originations on our new geographies, Boston and Long Island, accounted for 25% of our total originated commercial loan growth in the second quarter. The commercial pipeline is up approximately 10% compared to the prior quarter as a result of good growth in our core Connecticut market coupled with growth in Boston, Long Island and Southern Maine and new initiatives such as the mortgage warehouse lending in particular. 
Our acquired portfolio decreased during the quarter by 43% linked-quarter annualized. This change was once again amplified by acquired loan sales resolutions and charge-offs from the acquired Smithtown portfolio. Later in the presentation, we'll detail more of our progress to date on the Smithtown nonperforming portfolio. Taken together, the originated and acquired portfolios produced total loan growth of 3.7%, quarter-over-quarter, annualized. 
You can see on Slide 7 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We continue to see healthy growth rates within our de novo branches. In April, we opened 2 new Stop & Shop branches in New Haven, Connecticut and West Hartford, Connecticut as well as the previously announced Bronxville, New York branch. The acquired portfolio did shrink modestly, but deposit rates of those branches and overall mix improved. The run-off at these branches was entirely high rate single transaction CDs and municipal deposits, which in the great State of New York as a thrift chartered bank we are not allowed to hold. In Cedars [ph], which we have no reason to hold given their high cost and our strong funding base. Recall when we announced these transactions, our intention was and remains to move the deposit rates of the required institutions in line with our legacy branches. As of the end of the second quarter, the weighted average core deposit retention rate of the acquired banks since the acquisition closed is 109%. So we've actually seen nice core deposit growth in the acquired branch networks. During 2011, the average weighted cost of deposits of the acquired banks has dropped 20 basis points to 1.2%, but we definitely have more work to do but we're making good progress. And in the coming quarters, deposit rates will continue to move towards the franchise-wide deposit rate, which is 58 basis points in the second quarter. 
Slide 8 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Bank service charges benefited from a full quarter of fee increases which were instituted in February, as well as seasonally stronger interchange fees. The increase in gain on sale of acquired loans and the former Bank of Smithtown portfolio of $1.7 million was more than offset by the $2 million decrease in net gain on sale of residential loans. As we will discuss in a moment, we've made significant progress with respect to the acquired Smithtown portfolio. And as a result, it's not likely that we will see the same magnitude of gains on acquired loans in the quarters ahead. We also saw seasonal and continued cyclical pressure on insurance revenue. 
On Slide 9, we were pleased to report another quarter of solid cost control. On an operating basis, our run rate has been consistently under $200 million over the past 2 quarters in spite of carrying the full cost load of River and Bank of Smithtown. As the Danvers transaction closed in June 30, which is effective July 1, we will have a full quarter of Danvers expenses in our third quarter numbers. 
On Slide 10, the efficiency ratio decreased slightly to 65.7% for the second quarter compared to 66.2% in the first quarter. As you saw in our press release and heard in Jack's comments earlier, we've taken some important steps to reduce our cost base by $23 million on an annual basis in 2012. These initiatives and the scheduled Danvers conversion are a part of a 2-year process, which we expect to produce an efficiency ratio of 55% or better. 
Slides 11 and 12 are a quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers in the industry. As mentioned in the press release and earlier in this presentation, we did have one CRE loan to an in-market borrower with an out-of-market property that moved to nonperforming. A portion of which was charged off. The borrower is cooperating and current on payments. This single credit accounts for the entire increase in nonperforming loans and charge-offs. If we exclude this credit, the nonperforming loans are actually down $5 million, continuing the improving trend within the originated portfolio. Despite the slight uptick in nonperformers, which was entirely related to the aforementioned single credit, nonperforming assets at 2.05% of originated loans and REO remain well below the peer group in Top 50 banks. I continue to be encouraged by the overall positive credit performance of our loan portfolio, which is attributable to a heritage of strong underwriting. 
Looking at Slide 12, as we said last quarter, we see the net charge-offs number as slightly volatile. While we remain pleased with the net charge-off levels, we do experience some lumpiness. If we exclude the single credit already discussed, net charge-offs average loans were 22 basis points, in line with last quarter's results. 
On Slide 13, we've detailed our progress in working out the nonperforming loans within the acquired Smithtown portfolio. At the time of closing, nonperforming loans totaled $268.7 million. Since closing, we've experienced an additional $130.4 million of NPA inflows. Simultaneously, $125.3 million of loans in the portfolio have been sold, settled or paid off, while we've charged off $74.9 million. In addition, we've experienced $20.4 million of loans returning to accrual and $9.4 million of paydowns. This high level of activity leaves us with nonperformers totaling $169.1 million, which compares favorably to our remaining non-accretable difference or credit mark of $296.6 million. As many of you know, we have included a slide highlighting the non-accretable difference for each of the acquired portfolios in our Investor Presentation. We've updated that slide  for the second quarter of 2011 and have included it as an appendix in this presentation. This slide now also includes the remaining accretable yield by portfolio. 
On Slide 14, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. As we just described, we feel confident in the direction of our credit trends. We had a specific reserve against the single credit so the provision increase reflects originated growth. 
Slide 15 illustrates one of the best majors of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 92 basis points, continuing to move towards a return on average assets call of 1.25%. We expect future return on average asset improvements to come from additional loan and deposit growth, enhanced fee income cross-selling initiatives, full quarter impact with the Smithtown system conversion and the integration of Danvers Bancorp, as well as the overhead cost reduction initiatives discussed earlier and additional cost reduction efforts. 
Slide 16 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share and take care of business on the cost side, as we have discussed earlier, we will produce greater earnings per share. With 2 consecutive quarters of excellent fundamentals, I feel even more optimistic about the opportunities for this franchise, and I did when I started March. Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

First, within our markets, certainly the hybrid ARMS which is what we're putting in our portfolio, our popular product, they have been for quite a while on the markets were you're doing the larger loans, and have been popular in the history of this company has been that we have had excellent cross-sell to those customers of our other retail products. So it's a way of continuing to build our overall loan footing, but more importantly to really build our relationship base not only in our traditional markets, but in the Long Island, Boston markets, and I'd reemphasize what we're putting on the books I don't think I'd call a real interest rate debt. These are hybrid ARMs and so aren't long in duration. Anything that is a longer fixed rate is still sold and it's also of servicing released.

Our franchise has always been very strong in the residential origination area. And we had gotten out of it in Connecticut for a few years, but really had great strength in the retail relationships and interest in the product and we had the capability. And so we pursued, starting to eliminate the run-off of the portfolio and start to build it and that's what you're seeing. And to Kirk's point, whenever we study cross-sell, the residential mortgage is high on that list. So that's very much central to our strategy of deepening relationships and improving cross-sell across the franchise. So that's the essence of it. Again, kind of similar to the answer of the first question, at this point, we're not feeling any pressure given the structure and the rates that we're getting to slow down. But we've only been kind of back into the business of portfolio-ing for probably 12 months and it's taken us a good 6 of those months to just stop the amortization."

First, the [indiscernible] it is across our franchise. In our core business and our lenders across the footprint are doing a very good job of working relationships and starting to see some of the fruits of all the calling on new customers, that's always ongoing. We're getting our share of the business there. And also we're really pleased with the growth in Boston and the Boston MSA. That team, coupled with the early efforts to get the entire Boston area lenders, making progress in the market. It's really paying off. We're ahead of plan and doing very well there. And obviously, those growth rates are factors since we're restarting at a low spot. Long Island is also kicking in nicely, and we're very encouraged about the efforts.

As I begin my comments, please keep in mind that our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: One, optimizing the existing businesses; and two, efficiently deploying excess capita",733,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. As I begin my comments, please keep in mind that our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: One, optimizing the existing businesses; and two, efficiently deploying excess capital. The second quarter, much like the first, represents progress against those goals. 
On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. Net income for the quarter was $51.2 million or $0.15 per share with operating net income of $57.3 million or $0.17 per share. Net interest margin for the second quarter was 4.13% compared to 4.16% in the first quarter and 3.87% in the fourth quarter. Recall that last quarter we expected our margin to remain above 4%. Excluding accretable yield reassessment, our core net interest margin came in at 4.09%. We continue to see solid loan growth of $164 million or 3.7% linked-quarter annualized. Deposits also grew at a 3.7% annualized rate. This growth occurred while deposit costs declined from 59 basis points to 58 basis points in the quarter. Our noninterest income increased by $2 million quarter-over-quarter, which includes a $7.2 million gain on acquired loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio. We continue to make progress on our efficiency ratio, which declined to 65.7% in the quarter from 66.2% in the first quarter. As many of you have heard us say during the quarter, we are committed to reducing our efficiency ratio to 55% within the next 2 years. As you'll hear in a minute, we've made additional progress beyond what's represented in the second quarter's results. Finally, while our nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets increased in the second quarter to 2.05% of loans and REO compared to 1.96% in the first quarter. This increase was entirely due to the effect of a single credit. Of course, we'll be providing additional color today on our asset quality, which remains a source of pride for the company. 
On Slide 3, we review recent initiatives. Our Danversbank transaction closed on June 30, effective July 1 for the financial reporting purposes, which is why their numbers are not included in our second quarter results. 
We're pleased to welcome Kevin Bottomley to our Board of Directors. He will provide strategic leadership for our Boston growth efforts. In addition, he brings 35 years of banking experience to our board. We expect to convert Danvers to our operating system and rebrand their branches early in the fourth quarter. We successfully completed the system conversion of Bank of Smithtown during the weekend of June 17, which will result in annual savings of $3 million. In total, we've exceeded our target cost savings at the time of acquisition announcement. We'll see the full quarter benefit of the conversion-related savings in the third quarter. 
As we announced in our earnings release, we have also undertaken a number of franchise-wide initiatives that will result in approximately $20 million in annual cost savings. These include changes to our retirement programs and other benefits and headcount reduction, primarily in corporate positions. We'll see the full benefit of these changes in 2012. We continue to seek new opportunities for business growth and announced early this month our hire of Michael Maiorino who will head our asset-based lending group and report directly to Jeff Tengel, Head of Commercial Lending. Michael's responsibilities will also include oversight of our new mortgage warehouse business as we view this as an asset-based lending product. Michael joined us from Sovereign Bank, where he spent the past 9 years. While at Sovereign, he was Executive Vice President and Divisions President of Sovereign business capital, a $2 billion business and EVP, Debt Management and Recoveries. Prior to that, Michael was Division President at Fleet Capital, now Bank of America Business Capital, responsible for the Business Finance Division. We have high expectations for growth in this segment. 
Finally, we recently announced 3 new branches in Massachusetts, 2 in downtown Boston and one in Lexington, MA. With these new branches and the completion of the Danvers transaction, we now have 59 branches in Boston MSA with 6 branches in downtown Boston. From a deposit share perspective, we're also now the seventh largest bank in both Massachusetts and the Boston MSA. We're excited about the momentum we have in Massachusetts and the Boston MSA in particular. With that, I'm pleased to hand it over to Kirk."
295774,134124501,144477,"People's United Financial Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. As I listen to Jack's comments on the quarter and the recent initiatives, I'd like to reflect on what I think is happening here from a big picture perspective. Recall much of the management team has changed over the past 2 years and Jack t",2136,"Good afternoon. As I listen to Jack's comments on the quarter and the recent initiatives, I'd like to reflect on what I think is happening here from a big picture perspective. Recall much of the management team has changed over the past 2 years and Jack took over as CEO in April of last year. Particularly since Jack took over, this institution is refocused on optimizing the existing business which has reenergized key units of the business. In addition, important progress has been made on capital deployment, which has afforded us large new markets in Boston and Long Island such that we no longer need M&A to improve our profitability. It takes a little while for customers to reengage in businesses such as residential mortgage and Home Equity when you are effectively not a participant for 3 to 4 years. From my perspective, while we clearly have more work ahead of us, this franchise does have momentum as a result of a number of strategic decisions taken over the last year. 
Now let me take you through some of the details. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.13% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, core first quarter net interest margin is 4% excluding the 16 basis point benefit from People's United Equipment Finance accretable yield reassessments. This quarter, we had a 4 basis point benefit from accretable yield reassessments. The effects of changing loan mix and yield in both the acquired and originated portfolio was a 3 basis point improvement. Underlying this number is repricing pressure on our originated loans, which is more than offset by accretion on our acquired loan portfolio. In addition, we experienced 4 basis points of benefit from changing investment mix and yield as we invested more of our cash into securities and substituted some callable agencies for MBS. Finally, we picked up 2 basis points due to lower deposit and borrowing rates. 
On Slide 5, you can see that our net interest margin has been growing steadily. Despite a prolonged period of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market, we continue to expect our net interest margin to remain above 4% for the rest of the year. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost, stable funding, good loan mix and strong capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch on credit. 
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. As we discussed last quarter, we look at our portfolio as 2 distinct pieces, originated and acquired. Our originated portfolio grew at a linked-quarter annualized rate of 12.2% compared to 11.4% last quarter. The 12.2% growth represents a weighted average of 18.7% in retail and business banking and 9.3% in commercial banking. I'm pleased to report that we experienced loan growth across the board in all of our originated loan portfolios. Even Home Equity saw growth for the first time in several quarters. Loan growth was led by retail, specifically residential mortgage, with $187 million of quarterly growth or 30% linked-quarter annualized. Our residential mortgage pipeline stands at its highest level in a few years, up 47% from last quarter. Second quarter growth and pipeline growth are attributable to a few changes: One, we have a Jumbo Mortgage Product. We didn't have one a year ago because we weren't portfolio and mortgages. 70% of the pipeline is Jumbo Product; two, acquired and Long Island branches -- acquired Massachusetts and Long Island branches have undergone mortgage certification training and are now more comfortable with the product; three, we've added 7 mortgage account officers; four, variable compensation has been adjusted to further encourage mortgage originations; and five, lastly, we have regained traction with third-party mortgage originators. This product is fully underwritten by us, just comes through a different channel and is only done in our footprint. I'd highlight that we are only booking hybrid ARMs to our portfolio and that we operate in excellent markets for high quality residential mortgages. 
Finally, some statistics about our recent originations. The average loan size of the second quarter originations was $553,000, average FICO score for the second quarter was 759 with an average LTV of 65%. Also within the retail category, Home Equity outstanding actually grew in the face of low interest rates, which often lead customers to refinance their primary mortgage and consolidate Home Equity balances. In fact, second quarter was an outstanding period for this business. The new Home Equity commitment closings totaling $161 million, which represents a 65% increase versus the prior quarter and the pipeline increased 84% versus the prior quarter. Branch incentives, sales contests and Home Equity promotion including newspaper, advertising, direct mail and radio contributed to this growth. Again, some statistics about our recent originations, the average loan and line size. The second quarter was $126,000, average FICO score was 745 and the average combined loan to value was 54%.  
100% of Home Equity loans are retail originated and all are in our footprint. The new approaches towards both our residential mortgage and Home Equity businesses are excellent examples of the strategic changes made by the new management team. Within the commercial portfolio, our growth was led by CRE with a $102 million increase followed by C&I with $63 million of growth. C&I originations on our new geographies, Boston and Long Island, accounted for 25% of our total originated commercial loan growth in the second quarter. The commercial pipeline is up approximately 10% compared to the prior quarter as a result of good growth in our core Connecticut markets coupled with growth in Boston, Long Island and Southern Maine and new initiatives such as the mortgage warehouse lending in particular. 
Our acquired portfolio decreased during the quarter by 43% linked-quarter annualized. This change was once again amplified by acquired loan sales resolutions and charge-offs from the acquired Smithtown portfolio. Later in the presentation, we'll detail more of our progress to date on the Smithtown nonperforming portfolio. Taken together, the originated and acquired portfolios produced total loan growth of 3.7%, quarter-over-quarter, annualized. 
You can see on Slide 7 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We continue to see healthy growth rates within our de novo branches. In April, we opened 2 new Stop & Shop branches in New Haven, Connecticut and West Hartford, Connecticut as well as the previously announced Bronxville, New York branch. The acquired portfolio did shrink modestly, but deposit rates of those branches and overall mix improved. The run-off at these branches was entirely high rate single transaction CDs and municipal deposits, which in the great State of New York as a thrift chartered bank we are not allowed to hold. In Cedars [ph], which we have no reason to hold given their high cost and our strong funding base. Recall when we announced these transactions, our intention was and remains to move the deposit rates of the acquired institutions in line with our legacy branches. As of the end of the second quarter, the weighted average core deposit retention rate of the acquired banks since the acquisition closed is 109%. So we've actually seen nice core deposit growth in the acquired branch networks. During 2011, the average weighted cost of deposits of the acquired banks has dropped 20 basis points to 1.2%, so we definitely have more work to do but we're making good progress. And in the coming quarters, deposit rates will continue to move towards the franchise-wide deposit rate, which is 58 basis points in the second quarter. 
Slide 8 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Bank service charges benefited from a full quarter of fee increases which were instituted in February, as well as seasonally stronger interchange fees. The increase in gain on sale of acquired loans in the former Bank of Smithtown portfolio of $1.7 million was more than offset by the $2 million decrease in net gain on sale of residential loans. As we will discuss in a moment, we've made significant progress with respect to the acquired Smithtown portfolio. And as a result, it's not likely that we will see the same magnitude of gains on acquired loans in the quarters ahead. We also saw seasonal and continued cyclical pressure on insurance revenue. 
On Slide 9, we were pleased to report another quarter of solid cost control. On an operating basis, our run rate has been consistently under $200 million over the past 2 quarters in spite of carrying the full cost load of River and Bank of Smithtown. As the Danvers transaction closed in June 30, which is effective July 1, we will have a full quarter of Danvers expenses in our third quarter numbers. 
On Slide 10, the efficiency ratio decreased slightly to 65.7% for the second quarter compared to 66.2% in the first quarter. As you saw in our press release and heard in Jack's comments earlier, we've taken some important steps to reduce our cost base by $23 million on an annual basis in 2012. These initiatives and the scheduled Danvers conversion are a part of a 2-year process, which we expect to produce an efficiency ratio of 55% or better. 
Slides 11 and 12 are a quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers in the industry. As mentioned in the press release and earlier in this presentation, we did have one CRE loan to an in-market borrower with an out-of-market property that moved to nonperforming. A portion of which was charged off. The borrower is cooperating and current on payments. This single credit accounts for the entire increase in nonperforming loans and charge-offs. If we exclude this credit, the nonperforming loans are actually down $5 million, continuing the improving trend within the originated portfolio. Despite the slight uptick in nonperformers, which was entirely related to the aforementioned single credit, nonperforming assets at 2.05% of originated loans and REO remain well below the peer group in Top 50 banks. I continue to be encouraged by the overall positive credit performance of our loan portfolio, which is attributable to a heritage of strong underwriting. 
Looking at Slide 12, as we said last quarter, we see the net charge-offs number as slightly volatile. While we remain pleased with the net charge-off levels, we do experience some lumpiness. If we exclude the single credit already discussed, net charge-offs average loans were 22 basis points, in line with last quarter's results. 
On Slide 13, we've detailed our progress in working out the nonperforming loans within the acquired Smithtown portfolio. At the time of closing, nonperforming loans totaled $268.7 million. Since closing, we've experienced an additional $130.4 million of NPA inflows. Simultaneously, $125.3 million of loans in the portfolio have been sold, settled or paid off, while we've charged off $74.9 million. In addition, we've experienced $20.4 million of loans returning to accrual and $9.4 million of paydowns. This high level of activity leaves us with nonperformers totaling $169.1 million, which compares favorably to our remaining non-accretable difference or credit mark of $296.6 million. As many of you know, we have included a slide highlighting the non-accretable difference for each of the acquired portfolios in our Investor Presentation. We've updated that slide  for the second quarter of 2011 and have included it as an appendix in this presentation. This slide now also includes the remaining accretable yield by portfolio. 
On Slide 14, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. As we just described, we feel confident in the direction of our credit trends. We had a specific reserve against the single credit so the provision increase reflects originated growth. 
Slide 15 illustrates one of the best measures of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 92 basis points, continuing to move towards a return on average assets goal of 1.25%. We expect future return on average asset improvements to come from additional loan and deposit growth, enhanced fee income, cross-selling initiatives, full quarter impact with the Smithtown system conversion and the integration of Danvers Bancorp, as well as the overhead cost reduction initiatives discussed earlier and additional cost reduction efforts. 
Slide 16 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share and take care of business on the cost side, as we have discussed earlier, we will produce greater earnings per share. With 2 consecutive quarters of excellent fundamentals, I feel even more optimistic about the opportunities for this franchise then I did when I started March. Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

First, within our markets, certainly the hybrid ARMS which is what we're putting in our portfolio, are a popular product, they have been for quite a while in the markets were you're doing the larger loans, and have been popular. And the history of this company has been that we have had excellent cross-sell to those customers of our other retail products. So it's a way of continuing to build our overall loan footing, but more importantly to really build our relationship base not only in our traditional markets, but in the Long Island, Boston markets, and I'd reemphasize what we're putting on the books I don't think I'd call a real interest rate debt. These are hybrid ARMs and so aren't long in duration. Anything that is a longer fixed rate is still sold and it's all sold servicing released. I don't know, Jack if you want to add, any additional color to that."

Our franchise has always been very strong in the residential origination area. And we had gotten out of it in Connecticut for a few years, but really had great strength in the retail relationships and interest in the product and we had the capability. And so we pursued, starting to eliminate the run-off of the portfolio and start to build it and that's what you're seeing. And to Kirk's point, whenever we study cross-sell, the residential mortgage is high on that list. So that's very much central to our strategy of deepening relationships and improving cross-sell across the franchise. So that's the essence of it. Again, kind of similar to the answer of the first question, at this point, we're not feeling any pressure given the structure and the rates that we're getting to slow down. But we've only been kind of back into the business of portfolio-ing for probably 12 months and it's taken us a good 6 of those months to just stop the amortization."

As I begin my comments, please keep in mind that our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: One, optimizing the existing businesses; and two, efficiently deploying excess capital. The second quarter, much like the first, represents progress against those goals. 
On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. Net income for the quarter was $51.2 million or $0.15 per share with operating net income of $57.3 million or $0.17 per share. Net interest margin for the second quarter was 4.13% compared to 4.16% in the first quarter and 3.87% in the fourth quarter. Recall that last quarter we expected our margin to remain above 4%. Excluding accretable yield reassessment, our core net interest margin came in at 4.09%. We continue to see solid loan growth of $164 million or 3.7% linked-quarter annualized. Deposits also grew at a 3.7% annualized rate. This growth occurred while deposit costs declined from 59 basis points to 58 basis points in the quarter. Our noninterest income increased by $2 million quarter-over-quarter, which includes a $7.2 million gain on acquired loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio. We continue to make progress on our efficiency ratio, which declined to 65.7% in the quarter from 66.2% in the first quarter. As many of you have heard us say during the quarter, we are committed to reducing our efficiency ratio to 55% within the next 2 years. As you'll hear in a minute, we've made additional progress beyond what's represented in the second quarter's results. Finally, while our nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets increased in the second quarter to 2.05% of loans and REO compared to 1.96% in the first quarter. This increase was entirely due to the effect of a single credit. Of course, we'll be providing additional color today on our asset quality, which remains a source of pride for the company. 
On Slide 3, we review recent initiatives. Our Danversbank transaction closed on June 30, effective July 1 for the financial reporting purposes, which is why their numbers are not included in our second quarter results. 
We're pleased to welcome Kevin Bottomley to our Board of Directors. He will provide strategic leadership for our Boston growth efforts. In addition, he brings 35 years of banking experience to our board. We expect to convert Danvers to our operating system and rebrand their branches early in the fourth quarter. We successfully completed the system conversion of Bank of Smithtown during the weekend of June 17, which will result in annual savings of $3 million. In total, we've exceeded our target cost savings at the time of acquisition announcement. We'll see the full quarter benefit of the conversion-related savings in the third quarter. 
As we announced in our earnings release, we have also undertaken a number of franchise-wide initiatives that will result in approximately $20 million in annual cost savings. These include changes to our retirement programs and other benefits and headcount reduction, primarily in corporate positions. We'll see the full benefit of these changes in 2012. We continue to seek new opportunities for business growth and announced early this month our hire of Michael Maiorino who will head our asset-based lending group and report directly to Jeff Tengel, Head of Commercial Lending. Michael's responsibilities will also include oversight of our new mortgage warehouse business as we view this as an asset-based lending product. Michael joined us from Sovereign Bank, where he spent the past 9 years. While at Sovereign, he was Executive Vice President and Divisions President of Sovereign business capital, a $2 billion business and EVP, Debt Management and Recoveries. Prior to that, Michael was Division President at Fleet Capital, now Bank of America Business Capital, responsible for the Business Finance Division. We have high expectations for growth in this segment. 
Finally, we recently announced 3 new branches in Massachusetts, 2 in downtown Boston and one in Lexington, MA. With these new branches and the completion of the Danvers transaction, we now have 59 branches in Boston MSA with 6 branches in downtown Boston. From a deposit share perspective, we're also now the seventh largest bank in both Massachusetts and the Boston MSA. We're excited about the momentum we have in Massachusetts and the Boston MSA in particular. With that, I'm pleased to hand it over to Kirk."
295774,134124501,144646,"People's United Financial Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","People's United Financial, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon. As I listen to Jack's comments on the quarter and the recent initiatives, I'd like to reflect on what I think is happening here from a big picture perspective.

As I listen to Jack's comments on the quarter and the recent initiatives, I'd like to reflect on what I think is happening here from a big picture perspective. Recall much of the management team has changed over the past 2 years and Jack took over as CEO in April of last year. Particularly since Jack took over, this institution is refocused on optimizing the existing business which has reenergized key units of the business. In addition, important progress has been made on capital deployment, which has afforded us large new markets in Boston and Long Island such that we no longer need M&A to improve our profitability. It takes a little while for customers to reengage in businesses such as residential mortgage and Home Equity when you are effectively not a participant for 3 to 4 years. From my perspective, while we clearly have more work ahead of us, this franchise does have momentum as a result of a number of strategic decisions taken over the last year. 
Now let me take you through some of the details. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.13% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, core first quarter net interest margin is 4% excluding the 16 basis point benefit from People's United Equipment Finance accretable yield reassessments. This quarter, we had a 4 basis point benefit from accretable yield reassessments. The effects of changing loan mix and yield in both the acquired and originated portfolio was a 3 basis point improvement. Underlying this number is repricing pressure on our originated loans, which is more than offset by accretion on our acquired loan portfolio. In addition, we experienced 4 basis points of benefit from changing investment mix and yield as we invested more of our cash into securities and substituted some callable agencies for MBS. Finally, we picked up 2 basis points due to lower deposit and borrowing rates. 
On Slide 5, you can see that our net interest margin has been growing steadily. Despite a prolonged period of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market, we continue to expect our net interest margin to remain above 4% for the rest of the year. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost, stable funding, good loan mix and strong capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch on credit. 
Slide 6 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. As we discussed last quarter, we look at our portfolio as 2 distinct pieces, originated and acquired. Our originated portfolio grew at a linked-quarter annualized rate of 12.2% compared to 11.4% last quarter. The 12.2% growth represents a weighted average of 18.7% in retail and business banking and 9.3% in commercial banking. I'm pleased to report that we experienced loan growth across the board in all of our originated loan portfolios. Even Home Equity saw growth for the first time in several quarters. Loan growth was led by retail, specifically residential mortgage, with $187 million of quarterly growth or 30% linked-quarter annualized. Our residential mortgage pipeline stands at its highest level in a few years, up 47% from last quarter. Second quarter growth and pipeline growth are attributable to a few changes: One, we have a Jumbo Mortgage Product. We didn't have one a year ago because we weren't portfolio and mortgages. 70% of the pipeline is Jumbo Product; two, acquired and Long Island branches -- acquired Massachusetts and Long Island branches have undergone mortgage certification training and are now more comfortable with the product; three, we've added 7 mortgage account officers; four, variable compensation has been adjusted to further encourage mortgage originations; and five, lastly, we have regained traction with third-party mortgage originators. This product is fully underwritten by us, just comes through a different channel and is only done in our footprint. I'd highlight that we are only booking hybrid ARMs to our portfolio and that we operate in excellent markets for high quality residential mortgages. 
Finally, some statistics about our recent originations. The average loan size of the second quarter originations was $553,000, average FICO score for the second quarter was 759 with an average LTV of 65%. Also within the retail category, Home Equity outstanding actually grew in the face of low interest rates, which often lead customers to refinance their primary mortgage and consolidate Home Equity balances. In fact, second quarter was an outstanding period for this business. The new Home Equity commitment closings totaling $161 million, which represents a 65% increase versus the prior quarter and the pipeline increased 84% versus the prior quarter. Branch incentives, sales contests and Home Equity promotion including newspaper, advertising, direct mail and radio contributed to this growth. Again, some statistics about our recent originations, the average loan and line size. The second quarter was $126,000, average FICO score was 745 and the average combined loan to value was 54%.  
100% of Home Equity loans are retail originated and all are in our footprint. The new approaches towards both our residential mortgage and Home Equity businesses are excellent examples of the strategic changes made by the new management team. Within the commercial portfolio, our growth was led by CRE with a $102 million increase followed by C&I with $63 million of growth. C&I originations on our new geographies, Boston and Long Island, accounted for 25% of our total originated commercial loan growth in the second quarter. The commercial pipeline is up approximately 10% compared to the prior quarter as a result of good growth in our core Connecticut markets coupled with growth in Boston, Long Island and Southern Maine and new initiatives such as the mortgage warehouse lending in particular. 
Our acquired portfolio decreased during the quarter by 43% linked-quarter annualized. This change was once again amplified by acquired loan sales resolutions and charge-offs from the acquired Smithtown portfolio. Later in the presentation, we'll detail more of our progress to date on the Smithtown nonperforming portfolio. Taken together, the originated and acquired portfolios produced total loan growth of 3.7%, quarter-over-quarter, annualized. 
You can see on Slide 7 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We continue to see healthy growth rates within our de novo branches. In April, we opened 2 new Stop & Shop branches in New Haven, Connecticut and West Hartford, Connecticut as well as the previously announced Bronxville, New York branch. The acquired portfolio did shrink modestly, but deposit rates of those branches and overall mix improved. The run-off at these branches was entirely high rate single transaction CDs and municipal deposits, which in the great State of New York as a thrift chartered bank we are not allowed to hold. In Cedars [ph], which we have no reason to hold given their high cost and our strong funding base. Recall when we announced these transactions, our intention was and remains to move the deposit rates of the acquired institutions in line with our legacy branches. As of the end of the second quarter, the weighted average core deposit retention rate of the acquired banks since the acquisition closed is 109%. So we've actually seen nice core deposit growth in the acquired branch networks. During 2011, the average weighted cost of deposits of the acquired banks has dropped 20 basis points to 1.2%, so we definitely have more work to do but we're making good progress. And in the coming quarters, deposit rates will continue to move towards the franchise-wide deposit rate, which is 58 basis points in the second quarter. 
Slide 8 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Bank service charges benefited from a full quarter of fee increases which were instituted in February, as well as seasonally stronger interchange fees. The increase in gain on sale of acquired loans in the former Bank of Smithtown portfolio of $1.7 million was more than offset by the $2 million decrease in net gain on sale of residential loans. As we will discuss in a moment, we've made significant progress with respect to the acquired Smithtown portfolio. And as a result, it's not likely that we will see the same magnitude of gains on acquired loans in the quarters ahead. We also saw seasonal and continued cyclical pressure on insurance revenue. 
On Slide 9, we were pleased to report another quarter of solid cost control. On an operating basis, our run rate has been consistently under $200 million over the past 2 quarters in spite of carrying the full cost load of River and Bank of Smithtown. As the Danvers transaction closed in June 30, which is effective July 1, we will have a full quarter of Danvers expenses in our third quarter numbers. 
On Slide 10, the efficiency ratio decreased slightly to 65.7% for the second quarter compared to 66.2% in the first quarter. As you saw in our press release and heard in Jack's comments earlier, we've taken some important steps to reduce our cost base by $23 million on an annual basis in 2012. These initiatives and the scheduled Danvers conversion are a part of a 2-year process, which we expect to produce an efficiency ratio of 55% or better. 
Slides 11 and 12 are a quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers in the industry. As mentioned in the press release and earlier in this presentation, we did have one CRE loan to an in-market borrower with an out-of-market property that moved to nonperforming. A portion of which was charged off. The borrower is cooperating and current on payments. This single credit accounts for the entire increase in nonperforming loans and charge-offs. If we exclude this credit, the nonperforming loans are actually down $5 million, continuing the improving trend within the originated portfolio. Despite the slight uptick in nonperformers, which was entirely related to the aforementioned single credit, nonperforming assets at 2.05% of originated loans and REO remain well below the peer group in Top 50 banks. I continue to be encouraged by the overall positive credit performance of our loan portfolio, which is attributable to a heritage of strong underwriting. 
Looking at Slide 12, as we said last quarter, we see the net charge-offs number as slightly volatile. While we remain pleased with the net charge-off levels, we do experience some lumpiness. If we exclude the single credit already discussed, net charge-offs average loans were 22 basis points, in line with last quarter's results. 
On Slide 13, we've detailed our progress in working out the nonperforming loans within the acquired Smithtown portfolio. At the time of closing, nonperforming loans totaled $268.7 million. Since closing, we've experienced an additional $130.4 million of NPA inflows. Simultaneously, $125.3 million of loans in the portfolio have been sold, settled or paid off, while we've charged off $74.9 million. In addition, we've experienced $20.4 million of loans returning to accrual and $9.4 million of paydowns. This high level of activity leaves us with nonperformers totaling $169.1 million, which compares favorably to our remaining non-accretable difference or credit mark of $296.6 million. As many of you know, we have included a slide highlighting the non-accretable difference for each of the acquired portfolios in our Investor Presentation. We've updated that slide  for the second quarter of 2011 and have included it as an appendix in this presentation. This slide now also includes the remaining accretable yield by portfolio. 
On Slide 14, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. As we just described, we feel confident in the direction of our credit trends. We had a specific reserve against the single credit so the provision increase reflects originated growth. 
Slide 15 illustrates one of the best measures of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 92 basis points, continuing to move towards a return on average assets goal of 1.25%. We expect future return on average asset improvements to come from additional loan and deposit growth, enhanced fee income, cross-selling initiatives, full quarter impact with the Smithtown system conversion and the integration of Danvers Bancorp, as well as the overhead cost reduction initiatives discussed earlier and additional cost reduction efforts. 
Slide 16 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share and take care of business on the cost side, as we have discussed earlier, we will produce greater earnings per share. With 2 consecutive quarters of excellent fundamentals, I feel even more optimistic about the opportunities for this franchise then I did when I started March. Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

First, within our markets, certainly the hybrid ARMS which is what we're putting in our portfolio, are a popular product, they have been for quite a while in the markets were you're doing the larger loans, and have been popular. And the history of this company has been that we have had excellent cross-sell to those customers of our other retail products. So it's a way of continuing to build our overall loan footing, but more importantly to really build our relationship base not only in our traditional markets, but in the Long Island, Boston markets, and I'd reemphasize what we're putting on the books I don't think I'd call a real interest rate debt. These are hybrid ARMs and so aren't long in duration. Anything that is a longer fixed rate is still sold and it's all sold servicing released. I don't know, Jack if you want to add, any additional color to that."

Our franchise has always been very strong in the residential origination area. And we had gotten out of it in Connecticut for a few years, but really had great strength in the retail relationships and interest in the product and we had the capability. And so we pursued, starting to eliminate the run-off of the portfolio and start to build it and that's what you're seeing. And to Kirk's point, whenever we study cross-sell, the residential mortgage is high on that list. So that's very much central to our strategy of deepening relationships and improving cross-sell across the franchise. So that's the essence of it. Again, kind of similar to the answer of the first question, at this point, we're not feeling any pressure given the structure and the rates that we're getting to slow down. But we've only been kind of back into the business of portfolio-ing for probably 12 months and it's taken us a good 6 of those months to just stop the amortization."

Good afternoon, everyone. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results.

On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.3 million or $0.19 per share, with net income of $52.9 million or $0.15 per share. Once again, our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: one, to optimize existing businesses; and two, efficiently deploy capital. The third quarter represents significant progress against these goals.
To the first objective, we have a simple strategy which is to focus on organic loan and deposit growth while expanding our key businesses and reducing noninterest expense. This quarter loans grew at a 15% linked quarter annualized rate and deposits grew at a 6% annualized rate in a seasonally lowest period. While deposit rates declined by 2 basis points to 56 basis points in the quarter, our efficiency ratio improved to 63.1% in the quarter. Another way we are optimizing the businesses is defined -- by fine tuning our balance sheet. During the quarter, we sold $507 million of mortgage-backed securities. This was done to reduce book value at risk resulting from higher prepayment speeds. Separately, we repaid FHLB advances acquired through the acquisitions of RiverBank and Danversbank totaling $284 million in order to reduce our wholesale borrowings, which now only represent 1.7% of our total funding.
In environments like this, we know that asset quality is a critically important differentiator for us. Our asset quality has remained at industry-leading levels throughout this crisis. This quarter, our nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets decreased to 1.88% of loans and REO compared to 2.05% in the second quarter of 2011.
Now onto the second objective, capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased $15.8 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $11.81. While we were disappointed to see our stock trade at the levels it did in the third quarter, it presented us an opportunity to repurchase shares. It's worth noting we should 18.5 million shares as part of the Danvers transaction at a price of $13.44, and since the Danvers transaction was announced in January, we repurchased 20.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.10 which offset the dilution from issuing stock in the transaction and effectively converted it to a cash transaction. 
Additionally, we are pleased to announce that our board authorized an additional $18 million share repurchase program. This amounts to 5% of our current shares outstanding. This program does not have an expiration date.
The progress on both of these objectives resulted in a stronger earnings stream which produced an operating dividend payout ratio of 85%, down from 95% past quarter and 200.4% the prior-year period.
On Slide 3, we review recent important initiatives. This past weekend, we successfully completed the Danvers Core System conversion. This is our fourth successful Core System conversion this year and our sixth over the past 2 years. The entire franchise now operates under a single core operating system and brand. The result of this experience is true competency for this organization. We now have a strong track record of conversion execution, capturing targeted cost savings and now beginning to realize revenue synergies as well. We have submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to convert People's United Bank to a and national bank charter from its current federal savings bank charter. The conversion to national bank charter will enhance our ability to achieve our financial goals as our commercial growth will no longer be limited by the thrift lending test. Further, we will benefit from the OCC's deep understanding of and experience in supervising large commercially-oriented financial institutions. With the Fed's announcement in August and expectations that interest rates will be held at very low levels through mid-2013, we are taking a more active approach towards deposit rate reductions. We expect another 2 basis points of improvement in our total cost of deposits in the fourth quarter as a result of these actions.
We are excited to report that in September, we signed a lease for our first de novo branch in Manhattan at 250 Park Avenue on the corner of 47th Street, currently the Auto Dealership. Park Avenue and 47th Street is a high-traffic location, a couple of blocks from Grand Central terminal, perfectly situated to expand the People's United Bank brand's presence visibility in the nation's largest market, the New York Metro area. We currently serve our Fairfield and Westchester County along -- excuse me, as well as the Long Island customers in over 100 conveniently located branches. This site will provide those who commute to and regularly visit the city with even more flexibility in banking with us. While New York City is clearly a different market, we've seen strong growth in the 1 Manhattan branch we acquired through the Smithtown transaction. Our confidence as we expand into this market is also based on our successful de novo branch activity in Westchester, where we have grown 6 branches to nearly $500 million in deposits in less than 4 years, and on our Boston-area branch growth of $100 million across 5 branches in less than a year.
Related to the charter conversion, we've also undertaken to change our peer group listed in our appendix to include only commercially oriented banks and then exclude the traditional thrift business models, a few of which had been included in our prior peer group. It really pleases me to see our company gained so much momentum over the past year. Everyone here is focused on continued progress as we move forward. With that, I'll hand it over to Kirk."

As you recall, core second quarter net interest margin was 4.09% excluding the 4-basis point benefit from accretive low yield re",1736,"Thank you, Jack. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.11% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, core second quarter net interest margin was 4.09% excluding the 4-basis point benefit from accretive low yield reassessments. The effects of the change in our asset mix and yield on both the acquired originator portfolio was a 4-basis point drop. We experienced 3 basis points of benefit from lower deposit rates excluding the impact of the Danvers acquisition. Finally, we picked up 3 basis points from Danvers by investing some of our excess cash and loans which offer a higher yield than securities. 
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin, excluding the impact of accretable yield reassessments grew modestly in the quarter despite a continued environment of low interest rates, pricing pressure in the market. Operating margin is equal to reported margin as there is no impact from accretable yield reassessments in the quarter. As we said in the past, we expect our net interest margin to remain above 4% for the rest of the year. Our strong margin as a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and strong capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.46 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 18 months.
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide. Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. This slide provides you with the remaining accretable yield by acquisition as well as relevant credit information by acquisition. During the third quarter, we booked accretion of $72 million. It's also worth noting that the additional non-accretable difference of $374 million compares favorably to $242 million of acquired nonperforming loans. So if credit were to remain on its current trajectory, there may be additional yield enhancement as a result of future reclasses from the non-accretable difference or credit mark to accretable yield or interest income.
Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. The loan portfolios produced total loan growth of 14.8% quarter-over-quarter annualized or 23% quarter-over-quarter annualized of originated loan growth. This marks the third consecutive quarter of originated loan growth greater than 10%, which reflects the strong momentum within the franchise. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining the outstanding customer service standards of a small bank. Importantly, our customers and others within the market recognize that we did not pull back in the last economic crisis and supported them over the last few years. So much of the growth is word-of-mouth referrals from our long-term customers.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $878 million. 36% or $315 million came from the C&I category. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 areas. People's United equipment finance formally known as Fin Fed asset based lending both experienced solid quarter-over-quarter growth. People's United equipment finance grew $65 million in the quarter and within asset-based lending, our mortgage warehouse business contributed $127 million.
26% or $230 million came from the commercial real estate category. As we've grown, we see more opportunities to act lead in larger deals. The portfolio remains very broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million with commercial line utilization relatively flat over the past couple of years, we believe our loan growth does largely reflect market share gains. We believe customers are making a trade toward customer service, as a result much of our growth is coming from larger banks that are not offering the same customer experience. 36% or $320 million came from residential mortgages. Of the residential mortgage originations, 85% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages.
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. The legacy branch network contributed $221 million of the $269 million total growth excluding the impact to Danvers. As you'd expect, we're working to maintain stability among core deposit relationships at Danvers while eliminating higher rate product that doesn't make sense to our franchise. Our de novo branches, those in our emerging markets, the Westchester County and the Boston MSA, continue to deliver strong growth, adding $72 million in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to be pleased with the reception to our branded banking in the Boston MSA. The acquired portfolio did shrink modestly but deposit rates at those branches and overall mix improved. The runoff at those branches was predominantly high rate CDs and municipal deposits. Recall when we announced these transactions, our intention was, and remains to move the deposit rates to the acquired institutions in line with our legacy branches.
As of the end of third quarter of '11, the weighted average core deposit retention rate at the acquired banks since acquisitions -- since acquisition closed is 101%, which we are very pleased with. The weighted average cost of deposits of the acquired banks has dropped to 110 basis points, so we have more work to do, but we're making good progress, and in the coming quarters, deposit rates will continue to move toward the franchise-wide deposit rate which was 56 basis points in the third quarter.
Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 very challenging years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown a compound annual rates of 16% and 14% respectively.
Slide 10 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Our noninterest income increased by $8.4 million quarter-over-quarter excluding the acquired loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio that occurred about the second quarter and the third quarter, as well as the effect of mortgage bank securities gain and the impact of the Danvers acquisition. Noninterest income was further supported by $4.7 million of prepayment fees, bolstered by expectations for long-term, low-rate environment. The good news is that in most cases, we have been able to retain the customers.
We experienced a $2.4 million increase from additional insurance revenues, which largely reflects seasonal strength. As we have discussed for some time now, that Durbin Amendment went into effect October 1 and we have and will continue to be working to offset impact.
On Slide 11, you can see a full quarter of Danvers expenses and our noninterest expense numbers. Operating expenses including the impact of the Danvers acquisition were essentially flat. We did incur $9.3 million in FHLB prepayment penalties, which relates to the strategic decision to reduce wholesale borrowings. These borrowings were high-cost funding especially relative to our strong funding base. Perhaps more importantly, they were callable which means that when rates did rise, the FHLB will call them and force us to fund alternative funding but likely higher rates.
On Slide 12, the efficiency ratio decreased to 63.1% for the third quarter compared to 65.7% in the second quarter. This reflects the Smithtown conversion and the partial benefited Danvers cost savings.
Slides 13 and 14 are quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which is remained far stronger than peers in energy. As mentioned earlier, we have recently modified our peer group to include more commercially-oriented institutions. These charts reflect performance of our new peers. Nonperforming assets at 1.88% of originated loans and REO are approximately 40% below the peer group and top 50 banks. I continue to be encouraged by the overall positive credit performance of our loan portfolio, which is attributable to a heritage of strong underwriting. 
Looking at Slide 14. Net charge-offs declined to 27 basis points, approximately 25% of our peers. As we said in the past, we see the charge-offs numbers as slightly volatile. If you exclude the single credit discussed last quarter, charge-offs to average loans are 22 basis points in the second quarter and this quarter is effectively in line with that low level.
On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is approximately 1.5%, a healthy measure. The allowance for loan losses on retail loans increased slightly this quarter in conjunction with the higher levels of originated retail loan growth. As you all know, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology which has not changed. Mixed shift explained the modest decline in overall coverage ratios of the prior quarter.
Slide 16 illustrates one of the best measures of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 98 basis points, continuing to move toward our return on average asset goal of 1.25%. We expect future return on average asset improvements to come from additional loan and deposit growth, enhanced fee income, cross-selling initiatives, both quarter impact of the Danvers system conversion which took place last weekend as well as the continued benefit of the overhead cost-reduction initiatives we disclosed last quarter and additional cost-reduction efforts.
Slide 17 illustrates our improved return on average assets as well as our continued capital deployment progress. We don't believe in holding a war chest of capital so we expect to see a continued increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and possibly deploy capital.
On Slide 18, the 5 transactions we've completed since 2010 have served to rebuild profitability and have significantly reduced the operating dividend payout ratio. We expect continued progress on this metric in the quarters ahead.
On Slide 19, we've updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with tangible common equity at 12.5% compared to industry levels of 7.5%. Until we're uncommon at 15%, well above the 9% recently advertised for the large European banks and well above normalized levels of 8.5% for institution of our size and also world. Now I'll pass it back to Jeff."

Once again, ou",951,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.3 million or $0.19 per share, with net income of $52.9 million or $0.15 per share. Once again, our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: one, to optimize existing businesses; and two, efficiently deploy capital. The third quarter represents significant progress against these goals.
To the first objective, we have a simple strategy, which is to focus on organic loan and deposit growth while expanding our fee businesses and reducing noninterest expense. This quarter, loans grew at a 15% linked-quarter annualized rate. And deposits grew at a 6% annualized rate in a seasonally lowest period. While deposit rates declined by 2 basis points to 56 basis points in the quarter, our efficiency ratio improved to 63.1% in the quarter. 
Another way we are optimizing the businesses is to fine -- by fine-tuning our balance sheet. During the quarter, we sold $507 million of mortgage-backed securities. This was done to reduce book value at risk resulting from higher prepayment speeds. Separately, we repaid FHLB advances acquired through the acquisitions of RiverBank and Danversbank, totaling $284 million in order to reduce our wholesale borrowings, which now only represent 1.7% of our total funding.
In environments like this, we know that asset quality is a critically important differentiator for us. Our asset quality has remained at industry-leading levels throughout this crisis. This quarter, our nonperforming assets, as a percentage of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets decreased to 1.88% of loans and REO compared to 2.05% in the second quarter of 2011.
Now onto the second objective, capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased $15.8 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $11.81. While we were disappointed to see our stock trade at the levels it did in the third quarter, it presented us a significant opportunity to repurchase shares. It's worth noting we issued 18.5 million shares as part of the Danvers transaction at a price of $13.44. And since the Danvers transaction was announced in January, we repurchased 20.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.10, which offset the dilution from issuing stock in the transaction and effectively converted it to a cash transaction. 
Additionally, we're pleased to announce that our board authorized an additional $18 million share repurchase program. This amounts to 5% of our current shares outstanding. This program does not have an expiration date. The progress on both of these objectives resulted in a stronger earnings stream, which produced an operating dividend payout ratio of 85%, down from 95% past quarter and 200.4% the prior year period.
On Slide 3, we review recent important initiatives. This past weekend, we successfully completed the Danvers core system conversion. This is our fourth successful core system conversion this year and our sixth over the past 2 years. The entire franchise now operates under a single core operating system and brand. The result of this experience is a true competency for this organization. We now have a strong track record of conversion execution, capturing targeted cost savings and now beginning to realize revenue synergies as well. 
We have submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to convert People's United Bank to a national bank charter from its current federal savings bank charter. The conversion to a national bank charter will enhance our ability to achieve our financial goals as our commercial growth will no longer be limited by the thrift lending test. Further, we will benefit from the OCC's deep understanding of and experience in supervising large commercially oriented financial institutions. 
With the Fed's announcement in August and expectations that interest rates will be held at very low levels through mid-2013, we are taking a more active approach toward deposit rate reductions. We expect another 2 basis points of improvement in our total cost of deposits in the fourth quarter as a result of these actions.
We are excited to report that in September, we signed a lease for our first de novo branch in Manhattan at 250 Park Avenue on the corner of 47th Street, currently the Audi dealership. Park Avenue and 47th Street is a high-traffic location, a couple of blocks from Grand Central Terminal, perfectly situated to expand the People's United Bank brand presence and visibility in the nation's largest market, the New York Metro area. 
We currently serve our Fairfield and Westchester County along -- excuse me, as well as the Long Island customers in over 100 conveniently located branches. This site will provide those who commute to and regularly visit the city with even more flexibility in banking with us. While New York City is clearly a different market, we've seen strong growth in the one Manhattan branch we acquired through the Smithtown transaction. Our confidence as we expand in this market is also based on our successful de novo branch activity in Westchester, where we have grown 6 branches to nearly $500 million in deposits in less than 4 years and on your Boston area branch growth of $100 million across 5 branches in less than a year.
Related to the charter conversion, we've also undertaken to change our peer group, listed in our appendix, to include only commercially oriented banks and then exclude the traditional thrift business models, a few of which had been included in our prior peer group. It really pleases me to see our company gain so much momentum over the past year. Everyone here is focused on continued progress as we move forward. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Kirk."

On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.11% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, core second quarter net interest margin was 4.09%, excluding the 4 basis point benefit from accretable yield reassessments. The effects of the change in our -- in assets mix and yield on both the acquired and originated portfolio was a 4 basis point drop. We experienced 3 basis points of benefit from lower deposit rates, excluding the impact of the Danvers acquisition. Finally, we picked up 3 basis points from Danvers by investing some of our excess cash and loans, which offer a higher yield than securities.  
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin, excluding the impact of accretable yield reassessments, grew modestly in the quarter despite a continued environment of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market. Operating margin is equal to reported margin as there is no impact from accretable yield reassessments in the quarter. As we've said in the past, we expect our net interest margin to remain above 4% for the rest of the year. Our strong margin as a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and strong capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.46 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 18 months.
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide. Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. This slide provides you with the remaining accretable yield by acquisition, as well as relevant credit information by acquisition. During the third quarter, we booked accretion of $72 million. It's also worth noting that the additional non-accretable difference of $374 million compares favorably to $242 million of acquired nonperforming loans. So if credit were to remain on its current trajectory, there may be additional yield enhancement as a result of future re-classes from the non-accretable difference or credit mark to accretable yield or interest income.
Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. The loan portfolios produced total loan growth of 14.8% quarter-over-quarter annualized or 23% quarter-over-quarter annualized of originated loan growth. This marks the third consecutive quarter of originated loan growth greater than 10%, which reflects the strong momentum within the franchise. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining the outstanding customer service standards of a small bank.  Importantly, our customers and others within the market recognize that we did not pull back in the last economic crisis and supported them over the last few years. So much of the growth is word-of-mouth referrals from our long-term customers.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $878 million. 36% or $315 million came from the C&I category. Within C&I, we saw a strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 areas. People's United Equipment Finance, formally known as Fin Fed, and asset-based lending both experienced solid quarter-over-quarter growth. People's United Equipment Finance grew $65 million in the quarter. And within asset-based lending, our mortgage warehouse business contributed $127 million. 26% or $230 million came from the commercial real estate category. As we've grown, we've seen more opportunities to act as a lead in larger deals. The portfolio remains very broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. 
With commercial line utilization relatively flat over the past couple of years, we believe our loan growth does largely reflect market share gains. We believe customers are making a trade toward customer service. As a result, much of our growth is coming from larger banks that are not offering the same customer experience. 36% or $320 million came from residential mortgages. Of the residential mortgage originations, 85% were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages.
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. The legacy branch network contributed $221 million of the $269 million total growth, excluding the impact to Danvers. As you'd expect, we are working to maintain stability among core deposit relationships at Danvers while eliminating higher rate product that doesn't make sense for our franchise. Our de novo branches, those in our emerging markets or Westchester County and the Boston MSA, continued to deliver strong growth, adding $72 million in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to be pleased with the reception to our brand of banking in the Boston MSA. 
The acquired portfolio did shrink modestly, but deposit rates at those branches and overall mix improved. The runoff at those branches was predominantly high-rate CDs and municipal deposits. Recall when we announced these transactions, our intention was and remains to move the deposit rates of the acquired institutions in line with our legacy branches.
As of the end of third quarter of '11, the weighted average core deposit retention rate of the acquired banks since acquisitions -- since acquisition closed is 101%, which we are very pleased with. The weighted average cost of deposits of the acquired banks has dropped to 110 basis points, so we have more work to do, but we're making good progress. And in the coming quarters, deposit rates will continue to move toward the franchise-wide deposit rate, which was 56 basis points in the third quarter.
Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We know that if we grow our loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 very challenging years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown a compound annual rates of 16% and 14% respectively.
Slide 10 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Our noninterest income increased by $8.4 million quarter-over-quarter, excluding the acquired loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio that occurred about the second quarter and the third quarter, as well as the effect of mortgage-backed securities gain and the impact of the Danvers acquisition. Noninterest income was further supported by $4.7 million of prepayment fees, bolstered by expectations for long-term, low-rate environment. The good news is that in most cases, we have been able to retain the customers.
We experienced a $2.4 million increase from additional insurance revenues, which largely reflects seasonal strength. As we have discussed for some time now, the Durbin Amendment went into effect October 1, and we have and will continue to be working to offset its impact.
On Slide 11, you can see a full quarter of Danvers expenses and our noninterest expense numbers. Operating expenses, including the impact of the Danvers acquisition, were essentially flat. We did incur $9.3 million in FHLB prepayment penalties, which relates to the strategic decision to reduce wholesale borrowings. These borrowings were high-cost funding, especially relative to our strong funding base. Perhaps more importantly, they were callable, which means that when rates did rise, the FHLB would call them and force us to find alternative funding at likely higher rates.
On Slide 12, the efficiency ratio decreased to 63.1% for the third quarter compared to 65.7% in the second quarter. This reflects the Smithtown conversion and the partial benefit of Danvers cost savings.
Slides 13 and 14 are quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers in the industry. As mentioned earlier, we have recently modified our peer group to include more commercially oriented institutions. These charts reflect the performance of our new peers. Nonperforming assets at 1.88% of originated loans and REO are approximately 40% below the peer group and top 50 banks. I continue to be encouraged by the overall positive credit performance of our loan portfolio, which is attributable to a heritage of strong underwriting. 
Looking at Slide 14. Net charge-offs declined to 27 basis points, approximately 25% of our peers. As we've said in the past, we see the charge-offs numbers as slightly volatile. If we exclude the single credit discussed last quarter, charge-offs to every loan -- average loans are 22 basis points in the second quarter, and this quarter is effectively in line with that low level.
On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is approximately 1.5%, a healthy measure. The allowance for loan losses on retail loans increased slightly this quarter in conjunction with the higher levels of originated retail loan growth. As you all know, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology which has not changed. Mixed shift explains the modest decline in the overall coverage ratio from the prior quarter.
Slide 16 illustrates one of the best measures of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 98 basis points, continuing to move toward our return on average asset goal of 1.25%. We expect future return on average asset improvements to come from additional loan and deposit growth, enhanced fee income, cross-sell initiatives, both quarter impact of the Danvers system conversion, which took place last weekend, as well as a continued benefit of the overhead cost-reduction initiatives we disclosed last quarter and additional cost-reduction efforts.
Slide 17 illustrates our improved return on average assets, as well as our continued capital deployment progress. We don't believe in holding a war chest of capital, so we expect to see a continued increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and possibly deploy capital.
On Slide 18, the 5 transactions we have completed since 2010 have served to rebuild profitability and have significantly reduced the operating dividend payout ratio. We expect continued progress on this metric in the quarters ahead.
On Slide 19, we've updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with tangible common equity at 12.5% compared to industry levels of 7.5% and Tier 1 common at 15%, well above the 9% recently advertised for the large European banks and well above normalized levels of 8%, 8.5% for an institution of our size in the Basel III world. 
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

Once again, ou",951,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.3 million or $0.19 per share, with net income of $52.9 million or $0.15 per share. Once again, our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: one, to optimize existing businesses; and two, efficiently deploy capital. The third quarter represents significant progress against these goals.
To the first objective, we have a simple strategy, which is to focus on organic loan and deposit growth while expanding our fee businesses and reducing non-interest expense. This quarter, loans grew at a 15% linked-quarter annualized rate. And deposits grew at a 6% annualized rate in a seasonally lowest period. While deposit rates declined by 2 basis points to 56 basis points in the quarter, our efficiency ratio improved to 63.1% in the quarter. 
Another way we are optimizing the businesses is to fine -- by fine-tuning our balance sheet. During the quarter, we sold $507 million of mortgage-backed securities. This was done to reduce book value at risk resulting from higher prepayment speeds. Separately, we repaid FHLB advances acquired through the acquisitions of RiverBank and Danversbank, totaling $284 million in order to reduce our wholesale borrowings, which now only represent 1.7% of our total funding.
In environments like this, we know that asset quality is a critically important differentiator for us. Our asset quality has remained at industry-leading levels throughout this crisis. This quarter, our non-performing assets, as a percentage of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets decreased to 1.88% of loans and REO compared to 2.05% in the second quarter of 2011.
Now on to the second objective, capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased $15.8 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $11.81. While we were disappointed to see our stock trade at the levels it did in the third quarter, it presented us a significant opportunity to repurchase shares. It's worth noting we issued 18.5 million shares as part of the Danvers transaction at a price of $13.44. And since the Danvers transaction was announced in January, we've repurchased 20.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.10, which offset the dilution from issuing stock in the transaction and effectively converted it to a cash transaction. 
Additionally, we're pleased to announce that our board authorized an additional $18 million share repurchase program. This amounts to 5% of our current shares outstanding. This program does not have an expiration date. The progress on both of these objectives resulted in a stronger earnings stream, which produced an operating dividend payout ratio of 85%, down from 95% past quarter and 200.4% the prior year period.
On Slide 3, we review recent important initiatives. This past weekend, we successfully completed the Danvers core system conversion. This is our fourth successful core system conversion this year and our sixth over the past 2 years. The entire franchise now operates under a single core operating system and brand. The result of this experience is a true competency for this organization. We now have a strong track record of conversion execution, capturing targeted cost savings and now beginning to realize revenue synergies as well. 
We have submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to convert People's United Bank to a national bank charter from its current federal savings bank charter. The conversion to a national bank charter will enhance our ability to achieve our financial goals as our commercial growth will no longer be limited by the thrift lending test. Further, we will benefit from the OCC's deep understanding of and experience in supervising large commercially oriented financial institutions. 
With the Fed's announcement in August and expectations that interest rates will be held at very low levels through mid-2013, we are taking a more active approach toward deposit rate reductions. We expect another 2 basis points of improvement in our total cost of deposits in the fourth quarter as a result of these actions.
We are excited to report that in September, we signed a lease for our first de novo branch in Manhattan at 250 Park Avenue on the corner of 47th Street, currently the Audi dealership. Park Avenue and 47th Street is a high-traffic location, a couple of blocks from Grand Central Terminal, perfectly situated to expand the People's United Bank brand presence and visibility in the nation's largest market, the New York Metro area. 
We currently serve our Fairfield and Westchester County along -- excuse me, as well as the Long Island customers in over 100 conveniently located branches. This site will provide those who commute to and regularly visit the city with even more flexibility in banking with us. While New York City is clearly a different market, we've seen strong growth in the one Manhattan branch we acquired through the Smithtown transaction. Our confidence as we expand in this market is also based on our successful de novo branch activity in Westchester, where we have grown 6 branches to nearly $500 million in deposits in less than 4 years and on your Boston area branch growth of $100 million across 5 branches in less than a year.
Related to the charter conversion, we've also undertaken to change our peer group, listed in our appendix, to include only commercially oriented banks and exclude the traditional thrift business models, a few of which had been included in our prior peer group. It really pleases me to see our company gain so much momentum over the past year. Everyone here is focused on continued progress as we move forward. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Kirk."

On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.11% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, core second quarter net interest margin was 4.09%, excluding the 4 basis point benefit from accretable yield reassessments. The effects of the change in earning assets mix and yield on both the acquired and originated portfolio was a 4 basis point drop. We experienced 3 basis points of benefit from lower deposit rates, excluding the impact of the Danvers acquisition. Finally, we picked up 3 basis points from Danvers by investing some of our excess cash and loans, which offer a higher yield than securities.  
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin, excluding the impact of accretable yield reassessments, grew modestly in the quarter despite a continued environment of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market. Operating margin is equal to reported margin as there was no impact from accretable yield reassessments in the quarter. As we've said in the past, we expect our net interest margin to remain above 4% for the rest of the year. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and strong capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.46 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 18 months.
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide. Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. This slide provides you with the remaining accretable yield by acquisition, as well as relevant credit information by acquisition. During the third quarter, we booked accretion of $72 million. It's also worth noting that the additional non-accretable difference of $374 million compares favorably to $242 million of acquired nonperforming loans. So if credit were to remain on its current trajectory, there may be additional yield enhancements as a result of future re-classes from the non-accretable difference or credit mark to accretable yield or interest income.
Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. The loan portfolios produced total loan growth of 14.8% quarter-over-quarter annualized or 23% quarter-over-quarter annualized of originated loan growth. This marks the third consecutive quarter of originated loan growth greater than 10%, which reflects a strong momentum within the franchise. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining the outstanding customer service standards of a small bank.  Importantly, our customers and others within the market recognize that we did not pull back in the last economic crisis and supported them over the last few years. So much of the growth is word-of-mouth referrals from our long-term customers.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $878 million. 36% or $315 million came from the C&I category. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 areas: People's United Equipment Finance, formally known as Fin Fed, and asset-based lending. Both experienced solid quarter-over-quarter growth. People's United Equipment Finance grew $65 million in the quarter. And within asset-based lending, our mortgage warehouse business contributed $127 million. 26% or $230 million came from the commercial real estate category. As we've grown, we've seen more opportunities to act as the lead in larger deals. The portfolio remains very broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. 
With commercial line utilization relatively flat over the past couple of years, we believe our loan growth does largely reflect market share gains. We believe customers are making a trade toward customer service. As a result, much of our growth is coming from larger banks that are not offering the same customer experience. 36% or $320 million came from residential mortgages. Of the residential mortgage originations, 85% were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages.
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. The legacy branch network contributed $221 million of the $269 million total growth, excluding the impact to Danvers. As you'd expect, we are working to maintain stability among core deposit relationships at Danvers while eliminating higher rate product that doesn't make sense for our franchise. Our de novo branches, those in our emerging markets of Westchester County and the Boston MSA, continued to deliver strong growth, adding $72 million in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to be pleased with the reception to our brand of banking in the Boston MSA. 
The acquired portfolio did shrink modestly, but deposit rates at those branches and overall mix improved. The runoff at those branches was predominantly high-rate CDs and municipal deposits. Recall when we announced these transactions, our intention was and remains to move the deposit rates of the acquired institutions in line with our legacy branches.
As of the end of third quarter of '11, the weighted average core deposit retention rate of the acquired banks since acquisitions -- since acquisition closed is 101%, which we are very pleased with. The weighted average cost of deposits of the acquired banks has dropped to 110 basis points, so we have more work to do, but we're making good progress. And in the coming quarters, deposit rates will continue to move toward the franchise-wide deposit rate, which was 56 basis points in the third quarter.
Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We know that if we grow our loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 very challenging years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 14% respectively.
Slide 10 provides a breakout of non-interest income. Our non-interest income increased by $8.4 million quarter-over-quarter, excluding the acquired loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio that occurred in both the second quarter and the third quarter, as well as the effect of mortgage-backed securities gain and the impact of the Danvers acquisition. Non-interest income was further supported by $4.7 million of prepayment fees, bolstered by expectations for a long-term, low-rate environment. The good news is that in most cases, we have been able to retain the customers.
We experienced a $2.4 million increase from additional insurance revenues, which largely reflects seasonal strength. As we have discussed for some time now, the Durbin Amendment went into effect October 1, and we have and will continue to be working to offset its impact.
On Slide 11, you can see a full quarter of Danvers expenses and our non-interest expense numbers. Operating expenses, including the impact of the Danvers acquisition, were essentially flat. We did incur $9.3 million in FHLB prepayment penalties, which relates to the strategic decision to reduce wholesale borrowings. These borrowings were high-cost funding, especially relative to our strong funding base. Perhaps more importantly, they were callable, which means that when rates did rise, the FHLB would call them and force us to find alternative funding at likely higher rates.
On Slide 12, the efficiency ratio decreased to 63.1% for the third quarter compared to 65.7% in the second quarter. This reflects the Smithtown conversion and the partial benefit of Danvers cost savings.
Slides 13 and 14 are a quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers in the industry. As mentioned earlier, we have recently modified our peer group to include more commercially oriented institutions. These charts reflect the performance of our new peers. Nonperforming assets at 1.88% of originated loans and REO are approximately 40% below the peer group and top 50 banks. I continue to be encouraged by the overall positive credit performance of our loan portfolio, which is attributable to a heritage of strong underwriting. 
Looking at Slide 14. Net charge-offs declined to 27 basis points, approximately 25% of our peers. As we've said in the past, we see the charge-offs numbers as slightly volatile. If we exclude the single credit discussed last quarter, charge-offs to every loan -- average loans are 22 basis points in the second quarter, and this quarter is effectively in line with that low level.
On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is approximately 1.5%, a healthy measure. The allowance for loan losses on retail loans increased slightly this quarter in conjunction with the higher levels of originated retail loan growth. As you all know, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology which has not changed. Mixed shift explains the modest decline in the overall coverage ratio from the prior quarter.
Slide 16 illustrates one of the best measures of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 98 basis points, continuing to move toward our return on average asset goal of 1.25%. We expect future return on average asset improvements to come from additional loan and deposit growth, enhanced fee income, cross-sell initiatives, full quarter impact of the Danvers system conversion, which took place last weekend, as well as a continued benefit of the overhead cost-reduction initiatives we disclosed last quarter and additional cost-reduction efforts.
Slide 17 illustrates our improved return on average assets, as well as our continued capital deployment progress. We don't believe in holding a war chest of capital, so we expect to see a continued increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital.
On Slide 18, the 5 transactions we have completed since 2010 have served to rebuild profitability and have significantly reduced the operating dividend payout ratio. We expect continued progress on this metric in the quarters ahead.
On Slide 19, we've updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with tangible common equity at 12.5% compared to industry levels of 7.5% and Tier 1 common at 15%, well above the 9% recently advertised for the large European banks and well above normalized levels of 8%, 8.5% for an jinstitution of our size in the Basel III world. 
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

Once again, ou",951,"Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.3 million or $0.19 per share, with net income of $52.9 million or $0.15 per share. Once again, our objectives have been and continue to be straightforward and twofold: one, to optimize existing businesses; and two, efficiently deploy capital. The third quarter represents significant progress against these goals.
To the first objective, we have a simple strategy, which is to focus on organic loan and deposit growth while expanding our fee businesses and reducing non-interest expense. This quarter, loans grew at a 15% linked-quarter annualized rate. And deposits grew at a 6% annualized rate in a seasonally lowest period. While deposit rates declined by 2 basis points to 56 basis points in the quarter, our efficiency ratio improved to 63.1% in the quarter. 
Another way we are optimizing the businesses is to fine -- by fine-tuning our balance sheet. During the quarter, we sold $507 million of mortgage-backed securities. This was done to reduce book value at risk resulting from higher prepayment speeds. Separately, we repaid FHLB advances acquired through the acquisitions of RiverBank and Danversbank, totaling $284 million in order to reduce our wholesale borrowings, which now only represent 1.7% of our total funding.
In environments like this, we know that asset quality is a critically important differentiator for us. Our asset quality has remained at industry-leading levels throughout this crisis. This quarter, our non-performing assets, as a percentage of originated loans, REO and repossessed assets decreased to 1.88% of loans and REO compared to 2.05% in the second quarter of 2011.
Now on to the second objective, capital deployment. During the quarter, we repurchased $15.8 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $11.81. While we were disappointed to see our stock trade at the levels it did in the third quarter, it presented us a significant opportunity to repurchase shares. It's worth noting we issued 18.5 million shares as part of the Danvers transaction at a price of $13.44. And since the Danvers transaction was announced in January, we've repurchased 20.4 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.10, which offset the dilution from issuing stock in the transaction and effectively converted it to a cash transaction. 
Additionally, we're pleased to announce that our board authorized an additional $18 million share repurchase program. This amounts to 5% of our current shares outstanding. This program does not have an expiration date. The progress on both of these objectives resulted in a stronger earnings stream, which produced an operating dividend payout ratio of 85%, down from 95% past quarter and 200.4% the prior year period.
On Slide 3, we review recent important initiatives. This past weekend, we successfully completed the Danvers core system conversion. This is our fourth successful core system conversion this year and our sixth over the past 2 years. The entire franchise now operates under a single core operating system and brand. The result of this experience is a true competency for this organization. We now have a strong track record of conversion execution, capturing targeted cost savings and now beginning to realize revenue synergies as well. 
We have submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to convert People's United Bank to a national bank charter from its current federal savings bank charter. The conversion to a national bank charter will enhance our ability to achieve our financial goals as our commercial growth will no longer be limited by the thrift lending test. Further, we will benefit from the OCC's deep understanding of and experience in supervising large commercially oriented financial institutions. 
With the Fed's announcement in August and expectations that interest rates will be held at very low levels through mid-2013, we are taking a more active approach toward deposit rate reductions. We expect another 2 basis points of improvement in our total cost of deposits in the fourth quarter as a result of these actions.
We are excited to report that in September, we signed a lease for our first de novo branch in Manhattan at 250 Park Avenue on the corner of 47th Street, currently the Audi dealership. Park Avenue and 47th Street is a high-traffic location, a couple of blocks from Grand Central Terminal, perfectly situated to expand the People's United Bank brand presence and visibility in the nation's largest market, the New York Metro area. 
We currently serve our Fairfield and Westchester County along -- excuse me, as well as the Long Island customers in over 100 conveniently located branches. This site will provide those who commute to and regularly visit the city with even more flexibility in banking with us. While New York City is clearly a different market, we've seen strong growth in the one Manhattan branch we acquired through the Smithtown transaction. Our confidence as we expand in this market is also based on our successful de novo branch activity in Westchester, where we have grown 6 branches to nearly $500 million in deposits in less than 4 years and on your Boston area branch growth of $100 million across 5 branches in less than a year.
Related to the charter conversion, we've also undertaken to change our peer group, listed in our appendix, to include only commercially oriented banks and exclude the traditional thrift business models, a few of which had been included in our prior peer group. It really pleases me to see our company gain so much momentum over the past year. Everyone here is focused on continued progress as we move forward. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Kirk."

On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.11% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, core second quarter net interest margin was 4.09%, excluding the 4 basis point benefit from accretable yield reassessments. The effects of the change in earning assets mix and yield on both the acquired and originated portfolio was a 4 basis point drop. We experienced 3 basis points of benefit from lower deposit rates, excluding the impact of the Danvers acquisition. Finally, we picked up 3 basis points from Danvers by investing some of our excess cash and loans, which offer a higher yield than securities.  
On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin, excluding the impact of accretable yield reassessments, grew modestly in the quarter despite a continued environment of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market. Operating margin is equal to reported margin as there was no impact from accretable yield reassessments in the quarter. As we've said in the past, we expect our net interest margin to remain above 4% for the rest of the year. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and strong capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.46 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 18 months.
Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide. Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. This slide provides you with the remaining accretable yield by acquisition, as well as relevant credit information by acquisition. During the third quarter, we booked accretion of $72 million. It's also worth noting that the additional non-accretable difference of $374 million compares favorably to $242 million of acquired nonperforming loans. So if credit were to remain on its current trajectory, there may be additional yield enhancements as a result of future re-classes from the non-accretable difference or credit mark to accretable yield or interest income.
Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in gross loans. The loan portfolios produced total loan growth of 14.8% quarter-over-quarter annualized or 23% quarter-over-quarter annualized of originated loan growth. This marks the third consecutive quarter of originated loan growth greater than 10%, which reflects a strong momentum within the franchise. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining the outstanding customer service standards of a small bank.  Importantly, our customers and others within the market recognize that we did not pull back in the last economic crisis and supported them over the last few years. So much of the growth is word-of-mouth referrals from our long-term customers.
Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $878 million. 36% or $315 million came from the C&I category. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 areas: People's United Equipment Finance, formally known as Fin Fed, and asset-based lending. Both experienced solid quarter-over-quarter growth. People's United Equipment Finance grew $65 million in the quarter. And within asset-based lending, our mortgage warehouse business contributed $127 million. 26% or $230 million came from the commercial real estate category. As we've grown, we've seen more opportunities to act as the lead in larger deals. The portfolio remains very broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. 
With commercial line utilization relatively flat over the past couple of years, we believe our loan growth does largely reflect market share gains. We believe customers are making a trade toward customer service. As a result, much of our growth is coming from larger banks that are not offering the same customer experience. 36% or $320 million came from residential mortgages. Of the residential mortgage originations, 85% were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages.
You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. The legacy branch network contributed $221 million of the $269 million total growth, excluding the impact to Danvers. As you'd expect, we are working to maintain stability among core deposit relationships at Danvers while eliminating higher rate product that doesn't make sense for our franchise. Our de novo branches, those in our emerging markets of Westchester County and the Boston MSA, continued to deliver strong growth, adding $72 million in the quarter. Importantly, we continue to be pleased with the reception to our brand of banking in the Boston MSA. 
The acquired portfolio did shrink modestly, but deposit rates at those branches and overall mix improved. The runoff at those branches was predominantly high-rate CDs and municipal deposits. Recall when we announced these transactions, our intention was and remains to move the deposit rates of the acquired institutions in line with our legacy branches.
As of the end of third quarter of '11, the weighted average core deposit retention rate of the acquired banks since acquisitions -- since acquisition closed is 101%, which we are very pleased with. The weighted average cost of deposits of the acquired banks has dropped to 110 basis points, so we have more work to do, but we're making good progress. And in the coming quarters, deposit rates will continue to move toward the franchise-wide deposit rate, which was 56 basis points in the third quarter.
Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We know that if we grow our loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 very challenging years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 14% respectively.
Slide 10 provides a breakout of non-interest income. Our non-interest income increased by $8.4 million quarter-over-quarter, excluding the acquired loan sales from the Smithtown portfolio that occurred in both the second quarter and the third quarter, as well as the effect of mortgage-backed securities gain and the impact of the Danvers acquisition. Non-interest income was further supported by $4.7 million of prepayment fees, bolstered by expectations for a long-term, low-rate environment. The good news is that in most cases, we have been able to retain the customers.
We experienced a $2.4 million increase from additional insurance revenues, which largely reflects seasonal strength. As we have discussed for some time now, the Durbin Amendment went into effect October 1, and we have and will continue to be working to offset its impact.
On Slide 11, you can see a full quarter of Danvers expenses and our non-interest expense numbers. Operating expenses, including the impact of the Danvers acquisition, were essentially flat. We did incur $9.3 million in FHLB prepayment penalties, which relates to the strategic decision to reduce wholesale borrowings. These borrowings were high-cost funding, especially relative to our strong funding base. Perhaps more importantly, they were callable, which means that when rates did rise, the FHLB would call them and force us to find alternative funding at likely higher rates.
On Slide 12, the efficiency ratio decreased to 63.1% for the third quarter compared to 65.7% in the second quarter. This reflects the Smithtown conversion and the partial benefit of Danvers cost savings.
Slides 13 and 14 are a quick reminder of our superior credit quality, which has remained far stronger than peers in the industry. As mentioned earlier, we have recently modified our peer group to include more commercially oriented institutions. These charts reflect the performance of our new peers. Nonperforming assets at 1.88% of originated loans and REO are approximately 40% below the peer group and top 50 banks. I continue to be encouraged by the overall positive credit performance of our loan portfolio, which is attributable to a heritage of strong underwriting. 
Looking at Slide 14. Net charge-offs declined to 27 basis points, approximately 25% of our peers. As we've said in the past, we see the charge-offs numbers as slightly volatile. If we exclude the single credit discussed last quarter, charge-offs to every loan -- average loans are 22 basis points in the second quarter, and this quarter is effectively in line with that low level.
On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is approximately 1.5%, a healthy measure. The allowance for loan losses on retail loans increased slightly this quarter in conjunction with the higher levels of originated retail loan growth. As you all know, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology which has not changed. Mixed shift explains the modest decline in the overall coverage ratio from the prior quarter.
Slide 16 illustrates one of the best measures of our progress. Our operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 98 basis points, continuing to move toward our return on average asset goal of 1.25%. We expect future return on average asset improvements to come from additional loan and deposit growth, enhanced fee income, cross-sell initiatives, full quarter impact of the Danvers system conversion, which took place last weekend, as well as a continued benefit of the overhead cost-reduction initiatives we disclosed last quarter and additional cost-reduction efforts.
Slide 17 illustrates our improved return on average assets, as well as our continued capital deployment progress. We don't believe in holding a war chest of capital, so we expect to see a continued increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital.
On Slide 18, the 5 transactions we have completed since 2010 have served to rebuild profitability and have significantly reduced the operating dividend payout ratio. We expect continued progress on this metric in the quarters ahead.
On Slide 19, we've updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with tangible common equity at 12.5% compared to industry levels of 7.5% and Tier 1 common at 15%, well above the 9% recently advertised for the large European banks and well above normalized levels of 8%, 8.5% for an institution of our size in the Basel III world. 
Now I'll pass it back to Jack."

But in terms of what we're seeing in current originations out there, generally, in the C&I business, we're seeing spreads running about 150 to 200 over LIBOR. And those tend to be floating rate businesses. As you understand, about 40% of our loan book is floating rate adjustable. I think if you're looking at business banking, which is a more important -- which is a reasonably more important part of our business because of the franchise and the size of the franchise, there we see the margin is better, tend to run 250 to 300 over. And I would say that in the -- in your CRE businesses, right now, you're in that 200-plus range over as well, 225 to 250. So I think in the different businesses that spreads have compressed them a bit quarter-over-quarter. We are still able in many of our transactions to get floors, which is helpful in terms of sort of mitigating some of the downside of it."
