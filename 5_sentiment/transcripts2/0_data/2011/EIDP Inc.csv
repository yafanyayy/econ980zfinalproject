The pot delivered a strong finish to a great year. And during the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we've been steadfastly focused on our 2010 directives with disciplined execution across the board",715,"Great. Thank you, Karen and good morning, everyone. The pot delivered a strong finish to a great year. And during the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we've been steadfastly focused on our 2010 directives with disciplined execution across the board. Our consistent focus on market-driven innovation, cost and capital productivity and differential allocation of resources delivered very strong results for the year. And we look back on 2010 as the year we benefited from recovery, created our own momentum and emerged as a stronger, well-positioned company.
We did it by building on the aggressive actions we took in response to the global financial crisis and I'm not just talking about the restructuring and cost-cutting, I'm referring to the thoughtful, strategic choices that we made, specifically to prepare for global economic recovery and truly emerge a more agile and disciplined company.
To site up a few examples, we accelerated the implementation of the pot production systems at our plant site. We redeployed employees on megaprojects to structurally reduced working capital and we made tough choices on our underperforming assets and we afforded not to cut our R&D spend. Our 2010 results are summarized on Slide 2. And with that in a way that is consistent with our internal set of directives. We delivered sales growth of 21% with a wide various by business reflecting how different markets were affected by the global financial crisis and how our business has responded.
We delivered strong topline growth in areas that were minimally affected by the global crisis such as production agriculture and photovoltaics. This businesses executed well with new product launches, share gains, improved margins and strong momentum as we head into 2011. We also delivered outstanding growth at certain businesses benefited from early recovery and restocking such as TiO2, electronics, parts of our chemical businesses and polymers. As an example, we were prepared when auto builds recovered more than twice as fast as expected last year. 
Certain industrial markets were slower to recover as expected, mid cycle businesses such as  Nomex and Kevlar started to rebound mid year. And while their recovery has been a bit more muted, we expect more to come in 2011. In the meantime, we continue to develop new applications for fine denier Kevlar in anticipated of the Cooper River planned startup, which will occur later this year.
Finally, construction markets remained weak throughout the year. While total company sales were up 21% for the year, sales in developing markets grew 27%. We delivered exceptionally strong performance in China and India. Sales in greater China, including Taiwan, were over $3.3 billion, increasing more than 50%. All of our segment contributed to this growth with especially strong results in electronics and communications and performance materials. Sales in India were up over 40% to $678 million with the biggest gains coming from our performance chemicals and Agriculture & Nutrition segments.
The backbone of our topline growth this year remains market-driven innovation. Our steadfast investment in R&D-driven recession allowed us to intensify our efforts in new product introductions. Now we did it by staying close to our customers. And I mean that literally as well as figuratively. We partnered with customers to run product tests and commercial in their facilities. New product introductions were up 23% in 2010 on the hills of a 60% increase in 2009.
Moving on to cost, we delivered more than $650 million in fixed cost productivity and benefits from restructuring. We exceeded our original goal of $600 million. We're poised to deliver an additional $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011. Raw materials were up 6% last year and our price increase more than covered higher cost with an impressive full year spread of $0.44, something we could only deliver because our customers recognize the value and competitive advantage that our products provide.
Finally, we ended the year with free cash flow of $3.1 billion. This was buoyed by working capital productivity improvements of over $700 million, well ahead of our $400 million goal. In 2010 was the year of emerging stronger, in 2011 will be the year of building on our momentum. And I'll come back with more thoughts on 2011 at the end of the call. First, Nick will review our financial performance in more detail. Nick?"

I'm sitting here that way because DuPont had a great quarter and a solid finish to the year. As the global economy recovers, we grow volume and price up in all major regions of the world. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation that we've laid over the past two years. You know, 2010 was a transformational year for the company as we begin to replace pharmaceutical royalties with profitable growth from all other business units.
Let's just take a minute to review some of the great accomplishments that we've had versus our goals. Let's start with Slide 3, which is a summary of the earnings per share and sales results. Fourth quarter reported earnings per share were $0.40, which includes a $0.10 charge for one-time items. These items include a $0.13 per share charge relating to early extinguishment of debt and a charge of $0.03 per share for upfront license payment. These charges were offset by couple of benefits. We had a $0.04 benefit relating to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance and a $0.02 benefit per share for the partial reversal of prior year's restructuring charges.
Earnings per share on an underlying basis were $0.50 compared to $0.44 in the prior year. When you look at consolidated net sales, you see $7.4 billion, which was up 15% versus the prior year from price of 12% volume gains, 6% positive local price and 2% negative currency impact on a 1% reduction from some portfolio changes. Volume was up in all segments and in all major regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions and this reflects our continued strong pricing discipline that we execute across all of our businesses.
Let's turn now to the segment review and let's begin with Agriculture & Nutrition on Slide 4. Fourth quarter sales increased 13% to $1.5 billion with $117 million pretax seasonal losses. Sales were up in all businesses with robust volume growth in both Seed and Crop Protection. For the full year, our teams delivered 10% sales growth, 15% earnings growth and a 70 basis point P2 margin expansion. These results were delivered despite competitive pressures across all markets as our disciplined business models and our intense focus on the growers prevailed. And I have to tell you, this momentum will continue into 2011.
Taking a closer look within this segment. Crop protection product sales for the quarter, excluding the device businesses impact, increased significantly on global demand on insect protection products and driven products. Regionally, volume increases were broad-based with particular strength in Latin America, offsetting weaker prices across most regions. For the full year of 2010, crop protection product sales, excluding divested businesses impacted, were up moderately. Our volume increase was led by Rynaxypyr, which approached an impressive $400 million in global sales after just three years in the market.
U.S. dollar pricing remained relatively flat versus prior year. We outperformed the market based on the strength of our new products. The team executed their strategy, delivering increased sales, earnings and margins while making key pipeline advancements that provided for continued growth and profits for the future.
Moving onto Seeds. Fourth quarter sales of $582 million increased 25%, reflecting 12% volume growth across all regions. 10% increase in U.S. dollar prices and 3% favorable portfolio change. Volume growth reflects a strong start to the North American season for both corn and soybean. In addition, Latin America corn and soybeans were up. Brazil soybean volume increases were due to a late start to their season as a result of some weather. Both regional increases were partly offset by sales pattern shift to the first quarter in Europe. Price was flat to up and each region, attribute to lower validation of Pioneer products and services. The earnings impact of higher sales and stronger equity contribution from China performance on Seed earnings were offset primarily by postseason activities as well as growth investments.
For the full year 2010, our Pioneer team delivered another year of mid-teens sales growth and high-teens earnings growth, success was underpinned by increased acreage, share gains in North America, technology penetration in Brazil and success growing in China. Specifically, 2010 Seed sales were up 14% to $5.3 billion, reflecting both volume and U.S. dollar price contributions.
For Nutrition & Health, sales for the quarter and full year were slightly up on increased specialty protein offerings, offset by commodity costs business. We continue to drive the step change performance through productivity along with application development and differentiated offerings targeted at improved health, wellness and safety.
Looking ahead for the first half of 2011 for the Agriculture & Nutrition segment, we expect to increase sales and earnings moderately. Key value diverse include Seed and Crop Protection products, volume growth and net price improvements in Seed business, offset by slight currency headwinds and growth investments weighted more heavily to the first half. The split of the quarters one and two will play out over the next few months, but our current assumptions are for growth to be split evenly between the quarters.
Now let's turn to Slide 5, Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $773 million improved 33% compared to the same period last year with 24% from volume improvement and 9% higher prices. Pricing was primarily metal pass through. Pretax earnings of $98 million are $37 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance was led by Asia Pacific with 50% revenue growth followed by U.S. and Europe at 14% each. Portable take sales in total, including sales in our other segments, for over $1.1 billion in 2010, which was more than double the 2009 results.
For the full year, the Electronics & Communications segment grew sales 44% and delivered P2 margins of 16%, a significant improvement from 2009 margins. For the first quarter, instead of the normal seasonal decline, we expect sales into consumer electronics market to be flat to slightly up. We continue to anticipate Peavy market growth around the 20% for this year. Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be substantially above prior year, including the impact of higher metal prices.
Now on Slide 6, you'll see performance chemicals segment. Sales of $1.7 billion increased 26%, primarily due to 14% higher price and 13% higher volume. Both BPT and VC&F had greater than 20% sales growth this quarter. The sales growth was broad-based across all regions with Asia Pacific and North America serving as the largest contributors. The markets were titanium dioxide and industrial chemicals, grew with the global recovery and resulted in of $315 million, which is a 51% increase year-over-year. The impact to the bottom line was further enhanced through the ongoing productivity initiatives such DuPont Production System DuPont Integrated Business management.
For the full year, performance chemicals sales were up 27%, principally on 18% volume and 10% price. And crossing the billion-dollar PTOI mark for the first time. As we move into 2011, we see continued growth in the various markets where we participate. For the first quarter, sales will be up significantly. Sales to capacity continues to be tight for most of performance chemicals markets. And as a result, we will continue to focus on debottlenecking incremental capacity expansion to drive both earnings and productivity.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1 billion increased by 3% on stronger volume with local pricing gain offset by currency. Demand was driven by continued strengthening in heavy-duty truck markets in North America and Europe and the growth in the global automotive market. PTOI was $71 billion, essentially flat versus prior year. For the full year, Coating sales were up 11% on 9% volume, supported in part with global auto builds up 22%. Earnings were up 3x on sales and strong productivity results.
As we move into 2011, we expect global auto builds to be up about 5% with a 4% increase in the first quarter. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly year-over-year with essentially flat margins.
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 8. Sales were up 11% with 9% volume and 5% selling price increases, partially offset by some minor portfolio changes. Continued strength in the automotive, electronics and packaging markets helped drive the growth despite some supply chains destocking by our customers in order to manage their year-end inventory positions.
For the full year, Performance Materials had sales of $6.3 billion, a 32% increase over prior years and are $978 million, which is more than triple its earnings from a year ago. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly. Packaging and product demand remains stable. And as you heard with Performance Coatings, global auto builds continue to rise albeit at a much more modest pace. We also expect to benefit from some anticipated restocking in the supply chains.
On Slide 9, you see the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 13% on improved volume with the standouts being Europe growing sales by 17% and Asia Pacific at a 19% rate. Strong demand from industrial markets was responsible for the growth and led to increased sales of Nomex and Tyvek. PTOI was $92 million, a decrease due to higher raw materials, higher spending aramids growth initiatives and in asset impairment that was partially offset by separate gain on an asset sale.
Additionally, this quarter, we closed our acquisition of MECS, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of DuPont Sustainable Solutions. As you recall, MECS is the leading global provider of salt puric acid process technology, increasing our addressable markets in clean air and clean fuel offerings. DuPont Sustainable Solutions is now fully engaged in integrating and leveraging MECS's capabilities in the cleantech space.
For the full year 2010, Safety & Protection had sales of $3.4 billion, which is a 20% increase over prior year. Market dynamics improved as we move through the year for this mid-cycle business with notable strength in industrial and automotive markets. For the year, Safety & Protection earned $449 million. Looking at the first quarter of 2011, the market fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in industrial and in automotive. Sales are expected to be significantly higher with improved PTOI margins.
Now let's turn to the corporate view of the fourth quarter looking at the earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 10. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.06 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of both currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we've been very proactive over the past year in implementing price increases in the face of anticipated increases in  variable costs. On a full-year basis, this spread is a positive $0.44 per share.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, fourth quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up versus last year fourth quarter where many of our raw materials had reached a low point. For the full year, we saw an increase in our raws of 6% over 2009. As we look forward to 2011, we expect to see continued pressure on raw materials, energy and freight cost. And we're now forecasting an increase of about 4% to 5%.
Volume improvement resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.21 per share compared to the same period previous year. As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions with double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America. The graph depicting sales by geographic region shown on Slide 11.
Continuing with a variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. These includes an $0.08 incremental non-cash pension charge along with actions in the fourth quarter to support growth such as increased investment in CRD and specific marketing initiatives.
On a full-year basis, our fixed cost are 42% of sales versus 46% last year. So you can see we're well on our way to meeting our target of fixed cost being 39% of sales in 2012. And currently taking actions to support growth, DuPont delivered more than $650 million of fixed cost savings, ahead of our commitment to deliver $400 million of fixed cost productivity and $200  million in incremental restructuring benefits for the full year.
As we told you during our Investor Day last month, we'll deliver yet another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011. In addition to the productivity and growth, we expect our full year 2011 incremental non-cash pension expense to be $60 million pretax, which is about $140 million lower than we had previously communicated, reflecting favorable movements in both the discount rates and the asset returns.
For the fourth quarter, currency was a headwind of $0.03. And for the first quarter, we expect a similar year-over-year headwind. The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.08 variance. Reduce pharmaceutical earnings were a $0.14 a negative impact. Fourth quarter Pharma earnings were $87 million, above in line with our expectations and $160 million below prior year. Our full-year 2011 estimate for Pharma pretax earnings is about $200 million or approximately $219 million less than what we realized in 2010.
The last point on the earnings-per-share waterfall chart is the fourth quarter 2010 tax base rate, which was an $0.11 benefit versus prior year. The base tax rate this quarter was a negative 14.9% versus a positive 16.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. We have two primary drivers for the negative tax rate in the quarter. The first is a lower-than-expected full-year tax rate, reflecting a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in low tax jurisdictions outside of U.S. The full benefit of which was realized in the quarter.
The change in our total year expected tax rate must be adjusted in the fourth quarter, hence the incremental lower rate is applied to full year's earnings. Secondly, U.S. tax law changes, including the R&D tax credit, were all recorded during this quarter. For those of you who used our prior guidance of 23% full-year tax rate for 2010, we estimate the difference between that tax rate and our actual full year base tax rate of 18.8% results in about the $0.18 benefit range.
In light of the favorable geographic mix of earnings and U.S. R&D tax credit, we're lowering our guidance for our 2011 base tax rate from 22% to 23% to a new range of 20% to 21%.
Let's turn now to the balance sheet and cash that's shown on Slide 12. We ended the year with $3.1 billion of free cash flow versus our goal of greater than $1.7 billion. This outstanding performance is a result of strong sales in earnings throughout the year and equally strong commitment to productivity. Keep in mind, this includes a previously unforecasted $500 million voluntary contribution to our principal U.S. pension plan that was made in September.
During 2010, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and the end of the year with a net debt of $3.5 billion, $1.4 billion less than our position in December 2009. As you recall, we committed to $1 billion of working capital productivity over three-year period beginning in 2010. Based net working capital levels, we delivered more than $700 million of that in the 2010 year. Here again, we have a process around working capital productivity to ensure that we continue to deliver on these commitments. And I reaffirmed to you our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2011.
Regarding dividends, yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our 426 consecutive quarterly dividend. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. In summary, for the fourth quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started out in the fourth quarter of 2009 continued and expanded throughout 2010. This along with our pricing discipline and productivity focus delivered strong quarterly results as well as for the full year.
Turning to the first quarter of 2011, we expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but in a more moderate pace that we've experienced to date. As you heard described earlier, we continue to see strong demand globally across many of our businesses. In addition, we expect continued growth in our Agriculture & Nutrition segment. For our full-year 2011 outlook, DuPont leadership team remains steadfast and confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans.
We are raising our guidance from a range of $3.30 to $3.60 per share to a new range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share. This of course excludes the impact of the planned acquisition, which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis. The driver for the increase in our guidance is our lower tax rate driven by increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions outside of U.S. and reduced non-cash pension expense. These benefits are partially offset by an increase share count.
We ended 2010 with 932 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis versus our original estimate during the Investor Day of 915 million shares or about 2% additional shares, representing a $0.06 per share headwind in 2011. This increase in guidance is based in our confidence and our continued ability to deliver results.
On Slide 13, looking strictly at segment pretax operating income, excluding significant items, we saw 39% growth in 2010. And if you exclude Pharma, our growth was nearly 80%. As I said in the start, we have a plan for 2010 and we executed against that plan. First we put our innovation to work and grew our businesses across the globe. Second, we drove productivity to expand our margins. And third, we delivered strong cash performance and reduce net debt by $1.4 billion. We executed extremely well this year and we expect continued positive results in 2011. Now I'll turn it back over to Ellen."

And two weeks ago, the submitted its position as the leader industrial biotechnology with our announcement to acquire Danisco. Both companies are working hard to drive through those legal and regulatory milestones to close the transaction. Today, we are right where we expected to be in this process, having received approval from the data financial authority and launched a tender offer for Danisco shares last week.
We continue to expect the close of the transaction early in the second quarter subject, of course, to the regulatory reviews. I'd like to update you on our integration effort. I've selected Jim Collins, the integration leader for our planned acquisition. And Jim from his stellar leadership of the crop protection business. While you may not know is that Jim has been part of several previous integration teams including Pioneer, LLC and Protein Technologies International, now known as Soleil. And Jim has brings an excellent track record of delivering results and his passion and knowledge on the food and biotech areas makes him the right person for the job. Now as we committed to you during our UNESCO announcement, we will keep you updated on our progress in this tender. And during the integration, jim will be a key part of this growth story.
As we move through the process in Denmark, we will keep you posted and I do want to underscore one important point. We won a competitive process with a full and fair price, giving Danisco shareholders an attractive premium for their investment that also reflects the future value we believe this combined company can deliver for our own investors. My commitment to you is that we will stay disciplined throughout the tender offer process and the integration and keep you when we achieve key milestones.
Of course, we've known Danisco and Genesco has been partners for the past decade, and one key personality trait our company share is our commitment to science and innovation. For DuPont, science and innovation are the engines that drive our growth in what sets us apart from our peers, and whether it's product introduction that drives higher value and higher margins, or whether it's manufacturing excellent or proprietary technology that contribute to our low-cost position, science and innovation remain critical to our success at DuPont.
When I talk about science and innovation at DuPont, I'd like give samples of how they translate into commercial success. The examples I'll share with you have the distinction of having just won a DuPont export award, a very prestigious recognition within the company. One of our export awards was earned by a team from crop protection which launched a program in 2009 call precision pack. Now, precision pack is a dispensing system designed by DuPont and provided the retailers so they can customizable both the formulation in a very precise amount to meet individual grower needs. The system design has to make some formidable challenges both in its precision and its safe handling of the component.
Retailers have to be trained and serviced in a different way, and in the end this was a very successful program. It was well-designed and well executed. Retailers were delighted to offer custom solution to their growers. And we saw sales grow against generic competition who could not follow with solutions tailored to the individual grower needs.
Another excellent awards comes from our Electronic & Communications business. It was a push back in 2008 to develop a new black, for using copper lace for flexible circuit to be used by our auto OEM, who was interested in an all-black cylinder to complement their sleek designs. The conventional field is amber in color. So our multi-functional team hang together and developed the product and delighted this OEM customer. But it didn't stop there. They leveraged this new material and applications for smartphones, notebooks and tablet PCs. And these are just two of our excellent award winners and there are many, many other outstanding examples of excellence in science and innovation where an awards ceremony here in Wilmington last week where we honored all the winners.
I wanna close by reiterating that I expect 2011 to be a year for DuPont to build on our hard-earned momentum. When we designed the accountability structure that we put in place starting in 2009, one of my priorities was to have the flexibility to accommodate potential acquisitions. Meaning that our organization and reporting structure needed to enable our businesses to stay focused on delivering results well in integration team went about its work. And now people have more than a full year under their belts and this accountability structure and the structure has to work the way we planned. And we welcome the integration task that we have ahead of us and we will stay focused on fulfilling our directives for 2011 day-by-day and quarter-by-quarter.
We have another exciting year ahead of us and we have the resources and growth plans, the disciplined processes and market momentum. In summary, the focus is on execution and I expect the same executional excellence from my leadership team this year as they've demonstrated in 2010. And with that, I'm happy to take your questions."

So we're going to see a moderating growth in the automotive still. And so our growth rate that we saw in the U.S. for the year, which was well under double digit is going to be probably more in the high single-digit numbers in like of that. So the years, I think him is going to continue to have some strength because a 10% automotive growth as well as good ad season in that. Europe is going to have a mix recovery pictures. So I think there's going to be continued, a little bit stronger, maybe 2.5 GDP in Germany and there's a strong export market. Were not expecting much out of automotive there. Eastern Europe's going to come back more strongly, probably -- well, actually moderating there. So I think Europe is going to be a mixed picture as we go forward. Asia Pacific is going to be an area of strength for us between were automotive is, between where photovoltaics are and electronics are, and things like TiO2 and an increasing acquisition there. And we're going to see, kind of growth rate but not reflective of last year like 50% in China but they're going to be very, very strong. In Latin America, I think you're going to see there that all the automotive is not going to drive Ag, drive business there, Agriculture & Nutrition will. And so I think you'll going to see some well above GDP growth in Latin America, GDP in Latin America is about 4% in 2011 is what our estimates are.

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The DuPont delivered a strong finish to a great year. And during the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we've been steadfastly focused on our 2010 directives with disciplined execution across the board. Our consistent focus on market-driven innovation, cost and capital productivity and differential allocation of resources delivered very strong results for the year. And we will look back on 2010 as the year we benefited from recovery, created our own momentum and emerged as a stronger, well-positioned company.
We did it by building on the aggressive actions we took in response to the global financial crisis and I'm not just talking about the restructuring and cost-cutting, I'm referring to the thoughtful, strategic choices that we made, specifically to prepare for global economic recovery and truly emerge a more agile and disciplined company.
To site up a few examples, we accelerated the implementation of the DuPont production systems at our plant site. We redeployed employees on megaprojects to structurally reduce working capital, and we made tough choices on our underperforming assets and we had afforded not to cut our R&D spend. 
Our 2010 results are summarized on Slide 2. So with that winded in a way that is consistent with our internal set of directives. We delivered sales growth of 21% with a wide variance by business reflecting how different markets were affected by the global financial crisis and how our business has responded.
We delivered strong topline growth in areas that were minimally affected by the global crisis such as production agriculture and photovoltaics. These businesses executed well with new product launches, share gains, improved margins and strong momentum as we head into 2011. We also delivered outstanding growth at certain businesses benefited from early recovery and restocking such as TiO2, electronics, parts of our chemical businesses and polymers. As an example, we were prepared when auto builds recovered more than twice as fast as expected last year. 
Certain industrial markets were slower to recover as expected mid-cycle businesses such as  Nomex and Kevlar started to rebound midyear. And while their recovery has been a bit more muted, we expect more to come in 2011. In the meantime, we continue to develop new applications for fine denier Kevlar in anticipation of the Cooper River plant startup, which will occur later this year.
Finally, construction markets remained weak throughout the year. While total company sales were up 21% for the year, sales in developing markets grew 27%. We delivered exceptionally strong performance in China and India. Sales in greater China, including Taiwan, were over $3.3 billion, increasing more than 50%. All of our segment contributed to this growth with especially strong results in electronics and communications and performance materials. Sales in India were up over 40% to $678 million with the biggest gains coming from our performance chemicals and Ag & Nutrition segments.
The backbone of our topline growth this year remains market-driven innovation. Our steadfast investment in R&D-driven recession allowed us to intensify our efforts in new product introductions. So we did it by staying close to our customers, and I mean that literally as well as figuratively. We partnered with customers to run product tests and commercial prove outs in their facilities. New product introductions were up 23% in 2010 on the hills of a 60% increase in 2009.
Moving on to cost, we delivered more than $650 million in fixed cost productivity and benefits from restructuring. We exceeded our original goal of $600 million. We're poised to deliver an additional $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011. Raw materials were up 6% last year and our price increase more than covered higher cost with an impressive full year spread of $0.44, something we could only deliver because our customers recognize the value and competitive advantage that our products provide.
Finally, we ended the year with free cash flow of $3.1 billion. This was buoyed by working capital productivity improvements of over $700 million, well ahead of our $400 million goal. If 2010 was the year of emerging stronger, then 2011 will be the year of building on our momentum. And I'll come back with more thoughts on 2011 at the end of the call. First, Nick will review our financial performance in more detail. Nick?"

I'm sitting here that way because DuPont had a great quarter and a solid finish to the year. As the global economy recovers, we grow volume and price up in all major regions of the world. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation that we've laid over the past two years. You know, 2010 was a transformational year for the company as we begin to replace pharmaceutical royalties with profitable growth from all other business units.
Let's just take a minute to review some of the great accomplishments that we've had versus our goals. Let's start with Slide 3, which is a summary of the earnings per share and sales results. Fourth quarter reported earnings per share were $0.40, which includes a $0.10 charge for onetime items. These items include a $0.13 per share charge relating to early extinguishment of debt and a charge of $0.03 per share for upfront license payment. These charges were offset by couple of benefits. We had a $0.04 benefit relating to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance and a $0.02 benefit per share for the partial reversal of prior year's restructuring charges.
Earnings per share on an underlying basis were $0.50 compared to $0.44 in the prior year. When you look at consolidated net sales, you see $7.4 billion, which was up 15% versus the prior year, comprised of 12% volume gains, 6% positive local price and 2% negative currency impact on a 1% reduction from some portfolio changes. Volume was up in all segments and in all major regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions and this reflects our continued strong pricing discipline that we execute across all of our businesses.
Let's turn now to the segment review and let's begin with Ag & Nutrition on Slide 4. Fourth quarter sales increased 13% to $1.5 billion with $117 million pretax seasonal losses. Sales were up in all businesses with robust volume growth in both Seed and Crop Protection. For the full year, our teams delivered 10% sales growth, 15% earnings growth and a 70 basis point PTOI margin expansion. These results were delivered despite competitive pressures across all markets as our disciplined business models and our intense focus on the growers prevailed. And I have to tell you, this momentum will continue into 2011.
Taking a closer look within this segment. Crop protection product sales for the quarter excluding the divested businesses impact, increased significantly on global demand for Rynaxypyr insect protection products and picoxystrobin fungicide products.  Regionally, volume increases were broad-based with particular strength in Latin America, offsetting weaker prices across most regions. For the full year of 2010, crop protection product sales, excluding divested businesses impacted, were up moderately. Our volume increase was led by Rynaxypyr, which approached an impressive $400 million in global sales after just three years in the market.
U.S. dollar pricing remained relatively flat versus prior year. We outperformed the market based on the strength of our new products. The team executed their strategy, delivering increased sales, earnings and margins while making key pipeline advancements that provided for continued growth and profits for the future.
Moving onto Seeds. Fourth quarter sales of $582 million increased 25%, reflecting 12% volume growth across all regions. 10% increase in U.S. dollar prices and 3% favorable portfolio change. Volume growth reflects a strong start to the North American season for both corn and soybeans. In addition, Latin America corn and soybeans were up. Brazil soybean volume increases were due to the late start to their season as a result of some weather. 
Both regional increases were partly offset by sales pattern shift to the first quarter in Europe. Price was flat to up and each region, attributable to lower validation of pioneer products and services. The earnings impact of higher sales and stronger equity contribution from China performance on Seed earnings were offset primarily by postseason activities as well as growth investments.
For the full year 2010, our Pioneer team delivered another year of mid-teens sales growth and high-teens earnings growth, success was underpinned by increased acreage, share gains in North America, technology penetration in Brazil and success growing in China. Specifically, 2010 Seed sales were up 14% to $5.3 billion, reflecting both volume and U.S. dollar price contributions.
For Nutrition & Health, sales for the quarter and full year were slightly up on increased specialty protein offerings, offset by commodity costs business. We continue to drive step change performance through productivity along with application development and differentiated offerings targeted at improved health, wellness and safety.
Looking ahead for the first half of 2011 for the Ag & Nutrition segment, we expect to increase sales and earnings moderately. Key value drivers include seed and crop protection products; volume growth and net price improvements in Seed business, offset by slight currency headwinds; and growth investments weighted more heavily to the first half. The split of the quarters, one and two, will play out over the next few months, but our current assumptions are for growth to be split evenly between the quarters.
Now let's turn to Slide 5. Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $773 million improved 33% compared to the same period last year with 24% from volume improvement and 9% higher prices. Pricing was primarily metal pass-through. Pretax earnings of $98 million up $37 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance was led by Asia Pacific with 50% revenue growth followed by U.S. and Europe at 14% each. Photovoltaic sales in total, including sales in our other segments,  were over $1.1 billion in 2010, which was more than double the 2009 results.
For the full year, the Electronics & Communications segment grew sales 44% and delivered PTOI margins of 16%, a significant improvement from 2009 margins. For the first quarter, instead of the normal seasonal decline, we expect sales into consumer electronics markets to be flat to slightly up. We continue to anticipate PV market growth around the 20% for this year. Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be substantially above prior year, including the impact of higher metal prices.
Now on Slide 6, you'll see Performance Chemicals segment. Sales of $1.7 billion increased 26%, primarily due to 14% higher price and 13% higher volume. Both DTT and DC&F had greater than 20% sales growth this quarter. The sales growth was broad-based across all regions with Asia Pacific and North America serving as the largest contributors. The markets for titanium dioxide and industrial chemicals, grew with the global recovery and resulted in a PTOI of $315 million, which is a 51% increase year-over-year. The impact to the bottom line was further enhanced through the ongoing productivity initiatives such as DuPont Production Systems and DuPont Integrated Business management.
For the full year, performance chemicals sales were up 27%, principally on 18% volume and 10% price and crossing the billion-dollar PTOI mark for the first time. As we move into 2011, we see continued growth in the various markets where we participate. For the first quarter, sales will be up significantly. Sales to capacity continues to be tight for most of performance chemicals markets. And as a result, we will continue to focus on debottlenecking incremental capacity expansion to drive both earnings and productivity.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1 billion increased by 3% on stronger volume with local pricing gains offset by currency. Demand was driven by continued strengthening in heavy-duty truck markets in North America and Europe and growth in the global automotive market. PTOI was $71 billion, essentially flat versus prior year. For the full year, Coating sales were up 11% on 9% volume, supported in part with global auto builds up 22%. Earnings were up 3x on sales and strong productivity results.
As we move into 2011, we expect global auto builds to be up about 5% with a 4% increase in the first quarter. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly year-over-year with essentially flat margins.
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 8. Sales were up 11% with 9% volume and 5% selling price increases, partially offset by some minor portfolio changes. Continued strength in the automotive, electronics and packaging markets helped drive the growth despite some supply chains destocking by our customers in order to manage their year-end inventory positions.
For the full year, Performance Materials had sales of $6.3 billion, a 32% increase over prior years and are $978 million, which is more than triple its earnings from a year ago. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly. Packaging and products demand remains stable, and as you heard with Performance Coatings, global auto builds continue to rise albeit at a much more modest pace. We also expect to benefit from some anticipated restocking in the supply chains.
On Slide 9, you see the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 13% on improved volume with the standouts being Europe growing sales by 17% and Asia Pacific at a 19% rate. Strong demand from industrial markets was responsible for the growth and led to increased sales of Nomex and Tyvek. PTOI was $92 million, a decrease due to higher raw materials, higher spending aramids growth initiatives and an asset impairment that was partially offset by a separate gain on an asset sale.
Additionally, this quarter, we closed our acquisition of MECS, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of DuPont Sustainable Solutions. As you recall, MECS is the leading global provider of sulfuric acid process technology, increasing our addressable markets in clean air and clean fuel offerings. DuPont Sustainable Solutions is now fully engaged in integrating and leveraging MECS's capabilities in the cleantech space.
For the full year 2010, Safety & Protection had sales of $3.4 billion, which is a 20% increase over prior year. Market dynamics improved as we move through the year for this mid-cycle business with notable strength in industrial and automotive markets. For the year, Safety & Protection earned $449 million. Looking at the first quarter of 2011, the market fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in industrial and in automotive. Sales are expected to be significantly higher with improved PTOI margins.
Now let's turn to the corporate view of the fourth quarter looking at the earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 10. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.06 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of both currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we've been very proactive over the past year implementing price increases in the face of anticipated increases in  variable costs. On a full-year basis, this spread is a positive $0.44 per share.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, fourth quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up versus last year of fourth quarter, where many of our raw materials had reached a low point. For the full year, we saw an increase in our raws of 6% over 2009. As we look forward to 2011, we expect to see continued pressure on raw materials, energy and freight cost. And we're now forecasting an increase of about 4% to 5%.
Volume improvement resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.21 per share compared to the same period, previous year. As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions with double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America, with the graph depicting sales by geographic region shown on Slide 11.
Continuing with the variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. These includes an $0.08 incremental non-cash pension charge, along with actions in the fourth quarter to support growth such as increased investment in CRD [ph] and some specific marketing initiatives.
On a full-year basis, our fixed cost are 42% of sales versus 46% last year. So you can see we're well on our way to meeting our target of fixed cost being 39% of sales in 2012. Concurrently taking actions to support growth, DuPont delivered more than $650 million of fixed cost savings, ahead of our commitment to deliver $400 million in fixed cost productivity and $200  million in incremental restructuring benefits for the full year.
As we told you during our Investor Day last month, we'll deliver yet another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011. In addition to the productivity and growth, we expect our full year 2011 incremental non-cash pension expense to be $60 million pretax, which is about $140 million lower than we had previously communicated, reflecting favorable movements in both the discount rates and the asset returns.
For the fourth quarter, currency was a headwind of $0.03. And for the first quarter, we expect a similar year-over-year headwind. The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.08 variance. Reduced pharmaceutical earnings were at $0.14 negative impact. Fourth quarter Pharma earnings were $87 million, about in line with our expectations and $160 million below prior year. Our full-year 2011 estimate for Pharma pretax earnings is about $200 million or approximately $219 million less than what we realized in 2010.
The last points on the earnings-per-share waterfall chart is the fourth quarter 2010 tax base rate, which was an $0.11 benefit versus prior year. The base tax rate this quarter was a negative 14.9% versus a positive 16.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. We have two primary drivers for the negative tax rate in the quarter. The first is a lower-than-expected full-year tax rate, reflecting a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in  low-tax jurisdictions outside of U.S., the full benefit of which was realized in the quarter.
The change in our total year expected tax rate must be adjusted in the fourth quarter, hence the incremental lower rate is applied to full year's earnings. Secondly, the U.S. tax law changes, including the R&D tax credit, were all recorded during this quarter. For those of you who used our prior guidance of 23% full-year tax rate for 2010, we estimate the difference between that tax rate and our actual full-year base tax rate of 18.8% results in about the $0.18 benefit range.
In light of the favorable geographic mix of earnings and U.S. R&D tax credit, we are lowering our guidance for our 2011 base tax rate from 22% to 23% to a new range of 20% to 21%.
Let's turn now to the balance sheet and cash that's shown on Slide 12. We ended the year with $3.1 billion of free cash flow versus our goal of greater than $1.7 billion. This outstanding performance is a result of strong sales in earnings throughout the year and equally strong commitment to productivity. Keep in mind, this includes a previously unforecasted $500 million voluntary contribution to our principal U.S. pension plan that was made in September.
During 2010, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and end of the year with a net debt of $3.5 billion, $1.4 billion less than our position in December of 2009. As you recall, we committed to $1 billion of working capital productivity over a three-year period beginning in 2010. Based on net working capital levels, we delivered more than $700 million of that in the 2010 year. Here again, we have a process around working capital productivity to ensure that we continue to deliver on these commitments. And I reaffirm to you our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2011.
Regarding dividends, yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our 426 consecutive quarterly dividend. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. In summary, for the fourth quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started out in the fourth quarter of 2009 continued and expanded throughout 2010. This, along with our pricing discipline and productivity focus, delivered strong quarterly results as well as for the full year.
Turning to the first quarter of 2011, we expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but in a more moderate pace that we've experienced to date. As you heard described earlier, we continue to see strong demand globally across many of our businesses. In addition, we expect continued growth in our Ag & Nutrition segment. For our full-year 2011 outlook, DuPont leadership team remains steadfast and confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans.
We are raising our guidance from a range of $3.30 to $3.60 per share to a new range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share. This, of course, excludes the impact of the planned initial acquisition, which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis. The driver for the increase in our guidance is our lower tax rate, driven by increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and reduced non-cash pension expense. These benefits are partially offset by an increased share count.
We ended 2010 with 932 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis versus our original estimate during the Investor Day of 915 million shares or about 2% additional shares, representing a $0.06 per share headwind in 2011. This increase in guidance is based on our confidence and our continued ability to deliver results.
On Slide 13, looking strictly at segment pretax operating income, excluding significant items, we saw  39% growth in 2010. And if you exclude Pharma, our growth was nearly 80%. As I said in the start, we have a plan for 2010, and we executed against that plan. First, we put our innovation to work and grew our businesses across the globe. Second, we drove productivity to expand our margins. And third, we delivered strong cash performance and reduced net debt by $1.4 billion. We executed extremely well this year and we expect continued positive results in 2011. Now I'll turn it back over to Ellen."

Last month on our Investor Day, we shared our plans for continued strong growth. We raised the performance target on our businesses, and we detailed our financial assumptions and growth targets for 2011. And two weeks ago, DuPont cemented its position as the leader industrial biotechnology with our announcement to acquire Danisco. Both companies are working hard to drive through those legal and regulatory milestones to close the transaction. Today, we are right where we expected to be in this process, having received approval from the data financial authority and launched a tender offer for Danisco shares last week.
We continue to expect the close of the transaction early in the second quarter subject, of course, to the regulatory reviews. I'd like to update you on our integration effort. I've selected Jim Collins, as the integration leader for our planned acquisition. You know Jim from his stellar leadership of the crop protection business. What you may not know is that Jim has been part of several previous integration teams including Pioneer, Griffin LLC and Protein Technologies International, that now known as Soleil[ph] . And Jim brings an excellent track record of delivering results and his passion and knowledge on the food and biotech areas makes him the right person for the job. Now as we committed to you during our Danisco announcement, we will keep you updated on our progress in this tender. And during the integration, Jim will be a key part of this growth story.
As we move through the process in Denmark, we will keep you posted. And I do want to underscore one important point. We won a competitive process with a full and fair price, giving Danisco shareholders an attractive premium for their investments that also reflects in the future value, we believe, this combined company can deliver for our own investors. My commitment to you is that we will stay disciplined throughout the tender offer process and the integration and keep you aprised when we achieve key milestones.
Of course, we've known Danisco and Genencor as our partners for the past decade, and one key personality trait our company share is our commitment to science and innovation. For DuPont, science and innovation are the engines that drive our growth and what sets us apart from our peers, and whether it's product introduction that drives higher value and higher margins, or whether it's manufacturing excellent or proprietary technology that contribute to our low-cost position, science and innovation remain critical to our success at DuPont.
When I talk about science and innovation at DuPont, I'd like give samples of how they translate into commercial success. The examples I'll share with you have the distinction of having just won a DuPont Excellence Award, that's a very prestigious recognition within the company. One of our Excellence Awards was earned by a team from crop protection, which launched a program in 2009 called Precision Pac. Now Precision Pac is a dispensing system designed by DuPont and provided the retailers so they can customize both the formulation in a very precise amount to [indiscernible] herbicides meet individual grower needs. The system design had to make some formidable challenges both in its precision and its safe handling of the component.
Retailers have to be trained and serviced in a different way, and in the end this was a very successful program. It was well-designed and well executed. Retailers were delighted to offer custom solution to their growers. And we saw sales growth against generic competition who could not follow with solutions tailored to the individual grower needs.
Another Excellence Awards comes from our Electronic & Communications business. It was approached back in 2008 to develop a new black [indiscernible] for using copper lace for printed flexible circuit to be used by our auto OEM, who was interested in an all-black cylinder to complement their sleek designs. The conventional film is amber in color. So our multi-functional team came together and developed the product and delighted this OEM customer, but it didn't stop there. They leveraged this new material and applications for smartphones, notebooks and tablet PCs. And these are just two of our excellent award winners and there are many, many other outstanding examples of excellence in science and innovation were an awards ceremony here in Wilmington last week where we honored all the winners.
I wanna close by reiterating that I expect 2011 to be a year for DuPont to build on our hard-earned momentum. When we designed the accountability structure that we put in place starting in 2009, one of my priorities was to have the flexibility to accommodate potential acquisitions. Meaning that our organizational and reporting structure needed to enable our businesses to stay focused on delivering results while an integration team went about its work. And now people have more than a full year under their belts and this accountability structure and the structure has to work the way we planned. And we welcome the integration task that we have ahead of us and we will stay focused on fulfilling our directives for 2011 day-by-day and quarter-by-quarter.
We have another exciting year ahead of us and we have the resources and growth plans, the disciplined processes and market momentum. In summary, the focus is on execution, and I expect the same executional excellence from my leadership team this year as they've demonstrated in 2010. And with that, I'm happy to take your questions."

A lot of that underpinning is their domestic consumption, which is on the rise in China.

Some other raw materials that they're going to be seeing some increases that we're forecasting are things like ethane, HMD, [ph] acid, chlorine, some of our solvents or some of our pigments. Those are the areas where we see raw materials continuing to rise throughout the year. When you look at our ability to price that in the marketplace, obviously that's going to vary from business to business.

We had talked to you about sales for 2011 being about $33 billion to $34 billion. That thinking has not changed. So the change that I've given you in the range of EPS, sales are still around that $33 billion to $34 billion. We talked about raw material price increases going up about 4% to 5%. And as I mentioned, that's a pretty dynamic thing. But right now, that's our best thinking. That's net of our productivity gains that we would have in that area. We continue to drive productivity, both fixed and working capital productivity. And our thinking right now in our model has at $300 million of fixed cost productivity and about $300 million of working capital productivity. So when you talk about some of the changes that have occurred now in the new guidance, one is around the tax rate changes and that's going from the 22% to 23% down to the 20% to 21%. And I would think about that as the underlying performance of the business. So when you look at our geographic sales base and where we're operating, what we're saying is, on an ongoing basis, the 20% to 21% rate is more reflective of our underlying businesses and where they are participating around the world. The pension adjustment, as I mentioned, went from $200 million down to $60 million increase year-over-year. Take all that together and you add on top of that the outstanding share that I mentioned going up, it puts you at the range we are now forecasting at the 345 to 375 range."

The biggest change in the U.S",380,"Kevin, let me take you on a walk around the world around the topline and give you some perspective on that, because I think you're interested in that as. well. In the U.S., GDP is going to be the same in '11 as it was in '10. The biggest change in the U.S, from our perspective, is going to be the automotive industry. Where in 2010, I think, U.S. and Canada were up over 30% overnight and '11, it was only, I guess, 11%. So we're going to see a moderating growth in the automotive, still. And so our growth rate that we saw in the U.S. for the year, which was well under the double digit is going to be probably more in the high single-digit numbers and the like of that. So the U.S., I think, is going to continue to have some strength because a 10% automotive growth as well as good Ag season in that. Europe is going to have a mix recovery pictures. So we think that it's going to be continued, a little bit stronger, maybe 2.5 GDP in Germany and there's a strong export market. We're not expecting much out of automotive there. Eastern Europe's going to come back more strongly, probably -- well, actually moderating there. So I think Europe is going to be a mixed picture as we go forward. Asia Pacific is going to be an area of strength for us between where automotive is, between where photovoltaics are and electronics are, and things like TiO2 and an increasing Ag position there. That Europe we're going to see, kind of growth rate, it may not be reflective of last year like 50% in China but they're going to be very, very strong. In Latin America, I think you're going to see there that all the automotive is not going to drive Ag outside their Ag business there, Ag & Nutrition will. And so I think, you are going to see some well above-GDP growth in Latin America. GDP in Latin America is about 4% in 2011 is what our estimates are. So I think that our position in Ag, our position in TiO2, photovoltaics and the recovery in Safety & Protection are kind of bode well for our volume 2011."

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The DuPont delivered a strong finish to a great year. And during the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we've been steadfastly focused on our 2010 directives with disciplined execution across the board. Our consistent focus on market-driven innovation, cost and capital productivity and differential allocation of resources delivered very strong results for the year. We will look back on 2010 as the year we benefited from recovery, created our own momentum and emerged as a stronger, well-positioned company.
We did it by building on the aggressive actions we took in response to the global financial crisis, and I'm not just talking about the restructuring and cost-cutting, I'm referring to the thoughtful, strategic choices that we made, specifically to prepare for global economic recovery and truly emerge a more agile and disciplined company.
To site just a few examples, we accelerated the implementation of DuPont production systems at our plant site. We redeployed employees on megaprojects to structurally reduce working capital, and we made tough choices on underperforming assets, and we had the fortitude not to cut our R&D spend. 
Our 2010 results are summarized on Slide 2. So with that winded in a way that is consistent with our internal set of directives. We delivered sales growth of 21% with a wide variance by business reflecting how different markets were affected by the global financial crisis, and how our businesses responded.
We delivered strong topline growth in areas that were minimally affected by the global crisis such as production agriculture and photovoltaics. These businesses executed well with new product launches, share gains, improved margins and strong momentum as we head into 2011. We also delivered outstanding growth at certain businesses benefited from early recovery and restocking such as TiO2, electronics, parts of our chemical businesses and polymers. As an example, we were prepared when auto builds recovered more than twice as fast as expected last year. 
Certain industrial markets were slower to recover as expected. Mid-cycle businesses, such as  Nomex and Kevlar, started to rebound midyear. And while their recovery has been a bit more muted, we expect more to come in 2011. In the meantime, we continue to develop new applications for fine denier Kevlar in anticipation of the Cooper River plant startup, which will occur later this year.
Finally, construction markets remained weak throughout the year. While total company sales were up 21% for the year, sales in developing markets grew 27%. We delivered exceptionally strong performance in China and India. Sales in greater China, including Taiwan, were over $3.3 billion, increasing more than 50%. All of our segments contributed to this growth with especially strong results in Electronics and Communications and Performance Materials. Sales in India were up over 40% to $678 million with the biggest gains coming from our Performance Chemicals and Ag & Nutrition segments.
The backbone of our topline growth this year remains market-driven innovation. Our steadfast investment in R&D-driven recession allowed us to intensify our efforts in new product introductions. So we did it by staying close to our customers, and I mean that literally as well as figuratively. We partnered with customers to run product tests and commercial prove outs in their facilities. New product introductions were up 23% in 2010 on the heels of a 60% increase in 2009.
Moving on to costs, we delivered more than $650 million in fixed cost productivity and benefits from restructuring. We exceeded our original goal of $600 million. We're poised to deliver an additional $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011. Raw materials were up 6% last year, and our price increase more than covered higher costs with an impressive full year spread of $0.44, something we could only deliver because our customers recognize the value and competitive advantage that our products provide.
Finally, we ended the year with free cash flow of $3.1 billion. This was buoyed by working capital productivity improvements of over $700 million, well ahead of our $400 million goal. If 2010 was the year of emerging stronger, then 2011 will be the year of building on our momentum. And I'll come back with more thoughts on 2011 at the end of the call. First, Nick will review our financial performance in more detail. Nick?"

I'm sitting here that way because DuPont had a great quarter and a solid finish to the year. As the global economy recovers, we grow volume and price up in all major regions of the world. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation that we've laid over the past two years. You know, 2010 was a transformational year for the company as we began to replace pharmaceutical royalties with profitable growth from all other business units.
Let's just take a minute to review some of the great accomplishments that we've had versus our goals. Let's start with Slide 3, which is a summary of the earnings per share and sales results. Fourth quarter reported earnings per share were $0.40, which includes a $0.10 charge for onetime items. These items include a $0.13 per share charge relating to early extinguishment of debt and a charge of $0.03 per share for upfront license payment. These charges were offset by couple of benefits. We had a $0.04 benefit relating to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance and a $0.02 benefit per share for the partial reversal of prior year's restructuring charges.
Earnings per share on an underlying basis were $0.50 compared to $0.44 in the prior year. When you look at consolidated net sales, you see $7.4 billion, which was up 15% versus the prior year, comprised of 12% volume gains, 6% positive local price and 2% negative currency impact on a 1% reduction from some portfolio changes. Volume was up in all segments and in all major regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, and this reflects our continued strong pricing discipline that we execute across all of our businesses.
Let's turn now to the segment review, and let's begin with Ag & Nutrition on Slide 4. Fourth quarter sales increased 13% to $1.5 billion with $117 million pretax seasonal losses. Sales were up in all businesses with robust volume growth in both Seed and Crop Protection. For the full year, our teams delivered 10% sales growth, 15% earnings growth and a 70 basis point PTOI margin expansion. These results were delivered despite competitive pressures across all markets as our disciplined business models and our intense focus on the growers prevailed. And I have to tell you, this momentum will continue into 2011.
Taking a closer look within this segment. Crop protection product sales for the quarter excluding the divested businesses impact, increased significantly on global demand for Rynaxypyr insect protection products and picoxystrobin fungicide products.  Regionally, volume increases were broad-based with particular strength in Latin America, offsetting weaker prices across most regions. For the full year of 2010, crop protection product sales, excluding divested businesses impacted, were up moderately. Our volume increase was led by Rynaxypyr, which approached an impressive $400 million in global sales after just three years in the market.
U.S. dollar pricing remained relatively flat versus prior year. We outperformed the market based on the strength of our new products. The team executed their strategy, delivering increased sales, earnings and margins while making key pipeline advancements that provided for continued growth and profits for the future.
Moving onto Seeds. Fourth quarter sales of $582 million increased 25%, reflecting 12% volume growth across all regions, 10% increase in U.S. dollar prices and 3% favorable portfolio change. Volume growth reflects a strong start to the North American season for both corn and soybeans. In addition, Latin America corn and soybeans were up. Brazil soybean volume increases were due to the late start to their season as a result of some weather. 
Both regional increases were partly offset by sales pattern shift to the first quarter in Europe. Price was flat to up and each region, attributable to lower validation of pioneer products and services. The earnings impact of higher sales and stronger equity contribution from China performance on Seed earnings were offset primarily by postseason activities as well as growth investments.
For the full year 2010, our Pioneer team delivered another year of mid-teens sales growth and high-teens earnings growth. Success was underpinned by increased acreage, share gains in North America, technology penetration in Brazil and success growing in China. Specifically, 2010 Seed sales were up 14% to $5.3 billion, reflecting both volume and U.S. dollar price contributions.
For Nutrition & Health, sales for the quarter and full year were slightly up on increased specialty protein offerings, offset by commodity crush [ph] business. We continue to drive step change performance through productivity along with application development and differentiated offerings targeted at improved health, wellness and safety.
Looking ahead for the first half of 2011 for the Ag & Nutrition segment, we expect to increase sales and earnings moderately. Key value drivers include seed and crop protection products; volume growth and net price improvements in Seed business, offset by slight currency headwinds; and growth investments weighted more heavily to the first half. The split of the quarters, one and two, will play out over the next few months, but our current assumptions are for growth to be split evenly between the quarters.
Now let's turn to Slide 5. Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $773 million improved 33% compared to the same period last year with 24% from volume improvement and 9% higher prices. Pricing was primarily metal pass-through. Pretax earnings of $98 million up $37 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance was led by Asia Pacific with 50% revenue growth followed by U.S. and Europe at 14% each. Photovoltaic sales in total, including sales in our other segments, were over $1.1 billion in 2010, which was more than double the 2009 results.
For the full year, the Electronics & Communications segment grew sales 44% and delivered PTOI margins of 16%, a significant improvement from 2009 margins. For the first quarter, instead of the normal seasonal decline, we expect sales into consumer electronics markets to be flat to slightly up. We continue to anticipate PV market growth around the 20% for this year. Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be substantially above prior year, including the impact of higher metal prices.
Now on Slide 6, you'll see Performance Chemicals segment. Sales of $1.7 billion increased 26%, primarily due to 14% higher price and 13% higher volume. Both DTT and DC&F had greater than 20% sales growth this quarter. The sales growth was broad-based across all regions with Asia Pacific and North America serving as the largest contributors. The markets for titanium dioxide and industrial chemicals, grew with the global recovery and resulted in a PTOI of $315 million, which is a 51% increase year-over-year. The impact to the bottom line was further enhanced through the ongoing productivity initiatives such as DuPont Production Systems and DuPont Integrated Business management.
For the full year, Performance Chemicals sales were up 27%, principally on 18% volume and 10% price and crossing the billion-dollar PTOI mark for the first time. As we move into 2011, we see continued growth in the various markets where we participate. For the first quarter, sales will be up significantly. Sales to capacity continues to be tight for most of Performance Chemicals markets. And as a result, we will continue to focus on debottlenecking incremental capacity expansion to drive both earnings and productivity.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1 billion increased by 3% on stronger volume with local pricing gains offset by currency. Demand was driven by continued strengthening in heavy-duty truck markets in North America and Europe and growth in the global automotive market. PTOI was $71 million, essentially flat versus prior year. For the full year, Coating sales were up 11% on 9% volume, supported in part with global auto builds up 22%. Earnings were up 3x on sales and strong productivity results.
As we move into 2011, we expect global auto builds to be up about 5% with a 4% increase in the first quarter. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly year-over-year with essentially flat margins.
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 8. Sales were up 11% with 9% volume and 5% selling price increases, partially offset by some minor portfolio changes. Continued strength in the automotive, electronics and packaging markets helped drive the growth despite some supply chains destocking by our customers in order to manage their year-end inventory positions.
For the full year, Performance Materials had sales of $6.3 billion, a 32% increase over prior years and are $978 million, which is more than triple its earnings from a year ago. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly. Packaging and products demand remains stable, and as you heard with Performance Coatings, global auto builds continue to rise albeit at a much more modest pace. We also expect to benefit from some anticipated restocking in the supply chains.
On Slide 9, you see the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 13% on improved volume with the standouts being Europe growing sales by 17% and Asia Pacific at a 19% rate. Strong demand from industrial markets was responsible for the growth and led to increased sales of Nomex and Tyvek. PTOI was $92 million, a decrease due to higher raw materials, higher spending aramids growth initiatives and an asset impairment that was partially offset by a separate gain on an asset sale.
Additionally, this quarter, we closed our acquisition of MECS, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of DuPont Sustainable Solutions. As you recall, MECS is the leading global provider of sulfuric acid process technology, increasing our addressable market in clean air and clean fuel offerings. DuPont Sustainable Solutions is now fully engaged in integrating and leveraging MECS's capabilities in the clean tech space.
For the full year 2010, Safety & Protection had sales of $3.4 billion, which is a 20% increase over prior year. Market dynamics improved as we move through the year for this mid-cycle business with notable strength in industrial and automotive markets. For the year, Safety & Protection earned $449 million. Looking at the first quarter of 2011, the market fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in industrial and in automotive. Sales are expected to be significantly higher with improved PTOI margins.
Now let's turn to the corporate view of the fourth quarter looking at the earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 10. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.06 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of both currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we've been very proactive over the past year implementing price increases in the face of anticipated increases in variable costs. On a full-year basis, this spread is a positive $0.44 per share.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, fourth quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up versus last year fourth quarter, where many of our raw materials had reached a low point. For the full year, we saw an increase in our raws of 6% over 2009. As we look forward to 2011, we expect to see continued pressure on raw materials, energy and freight cost. And we're now forecasting an increase of about 4% to 5%.
Volume improvement resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.21 per share compared to the same period, previous year. As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions with double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America. There is a graph depicting sales by geographic region shown on Slide 11.
Continuing with the variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. These includes an $0.08 incremental non-cash pension charge, along with actions in the fourth quarter to support growth such as increased investment in CR&D and some specific marketing initiatives.
On a full-year basis, our fixed costs are 42% of sales versus 46% last year. So you can see we're well on our way to meeting our target of fixed costs being 39% of sales in 2012. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, DuPont delivered more than $650 million of fixed cost savings, ahead of our commitment to deliver $400 million in fixed cost productivity and $200 million in incremental restructuring benefits for the full year.
As we told you during our Investor Day last month, we'll deliver yet another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011. In addition to the productivity and growth, we expect our full year 2011 incremental non-cash pension expense to be $60 million pretax, which is about $140 million lower than we had previously communicated, reflecting favorable movements in both the discount rates and the asset returns.
For the fourth quarter, currency was a headwind of $0.03. And for the first quarter, we expect a similar year-over-year headwind. The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.08 variance. Reduced pharmaceutical earnings were at $0.14 negative impact. Fourth quarter Pharma earnings were $87 million, about in line with our expectations and $160 million below prior year. Our full-year 2011 estimate for Pharma pretax earnings is about $200 million or approximately $290 million less than what we realized in 2010.
The last points on the earnings-per-share waterfall chart is the fourth quarter 2010 tax base rate, which was an $0.11 benefit versus prior year. The base tax rate this quarter was a negative 14.9% versus a positive 16.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. We have two primary drivers for the negative tax rate in the quarter. The first is a lower-than-expected full-year tax rate, reflecting a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in low-tax jurisdictions outside of U.S.; the full benefit of which was realized in the quarter.
The change in our total year expected tax rate must be adjusted in the fourth quarter, hence the incremental lower rate is applied to full year's earnings. Secondly, the U.S. tax law changes, including the R&D tax credit, were all recorded during this quarter. For those of you who used our prior guidance of 23% full-year tax rate for 2010, we estimate the difference between that tax rate and our actual full-year base tax rate of 18.8% results in about the $0.18 per share benefit range.
In light of the favorable geographic mix of earnings and U.S. R&D tax credit, we are lowering our guidance for our 2011 base tax rate from 22% to 23% to a new range of 20% to 21%.
Let's turn now to the balance sheet and cash that's shown on Slide 12. We ended the year with $3.1 billion of free cash flow versus our goal of greater than $1.7 billion. This outstanding performance is a result of strong sales in earnings throughout the year and equally strong commitment to productivity. Keep in mind, this includes a previously unforecasted $500 million voluntary contribution to our principal U.S. pension plan that was made in September.
During 2010, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and end of the year with a net debt of $3.5 billion, $1.4 billion less than our position in December of 2009. As you recall, we committed to $1 billion of working capital productivity over a three-year period beginning in 2010. Based on net working capital levels, we delivered more than $700 million of that in the 2010 year. Here again, we have a process around working capital productivity to ensure that we continue to deliver on these commitments. And I’ll reaffirm to you our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2011.
Regarding dividends, yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our 426 consecutive quarterly dividend. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. In summary, for the fourth quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started out in the fourth quarter of 2009 continued and expanded throughout 2010. This, along with our pricing discipline and productivity focus, delivered strong quarterly results as well as for the full year.
Turning to the first quarter of 2011, we expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but in a more moderate pace than we've experienced to date. As you heard described earlier, we continue to see strong demand globally across many of our businesses. In addition, we expect continued growth in our Ag & Nutrition segment. For our full-year 2011 outlook, DuPont leadership team remains steadfast and confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans.
We are raising our guidance from a range of $3.30 to $3.60 per share to a new range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share. This, of course, excludes the impact of the planned initial acquisition, which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis. The driver for the increase in our guidance is our lower tax rate, driven by increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and reduced non-cash pension expense. These benefits are partially offset by an increased share count.
We ended 2010 with 932 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis versus our original estimate during the Investor Day of 915 million shares or about 2% additional shares, representing a $0.06 per share headwind in 2011. This increase in guidance is based on our confidence and our continued ability to deliver results.
On Slide 13, looking strictly at segment pretax operating income, excluding significant items, we saw 39% growth in 2010. And if you exclude Pharma, our growth was nearly 80%. As I said in the start, we have a plan for 2010, and we executed against that plan. First, we put our innovation to work and grew our businesses across the globe. Second, we drove productivity to expand our margins. And third, we delivered strong cash performance and reduced net debt by $1.4 billion. We executed extremely well this year and we expect continued positive results in 2011. Now I'll turn it back over to Ellen."

Last month at our Investor Day, we shared our plans for continued strong growth. We raised the performance targets on our businesses, and we detailed our financial assumptions and growth targets for 2011. And two weeks ago, DuPont",912,"Great. Thank you, Nick. Last month at our Investor Day, we shared our plans for continued strong growth. We raised the performance targets on our businesses, and we detailed our financial assumptions and growth targets for 2011. And two weeks ago, DuPont cemented its position as the leader industrial biotechnology with our announcement to acquire Danisco. Both companies are working hard to drive through the legal and regulatory milestones to close the transaction. Today, we are right where we expected to be in this process, having received approval from the data financial authority and launched a tender offer for Danisco shares last week.
We continue to expect the close of the transaction early in the second quarter subject, of course, to the regulatory reviews. I'd like to update you on our integration effort. I've selected Jim Collins, as the integration leader for our planned acquisition. You know Jim from his stellar leadership of the Crop Protection business. What you may not know is that Jim has been part of several previous integration teams including Pioneer, Griffin LLC and Protein Technologies International, that now known as Soleil[ph] . And Jim brings an excellent track record of delivering results, and his passion and knowledge on the food and biotech areas makes him the right person for the job. Now as we committed to you during our Danisco announcement, we will keep you updated on our progress in this tender. And during the integration, and Jim will be a key part of this growth story.
As we move through the process in Denmark, we will keep you posted. And I do want to underscore one important point. We won a competitive process with a full and fair price, giving Danisco shareholders an attractive premium for their investment that also reflects in the future value, we believe, this combined company can deliver for our own investors. My commitment to you is that we will stay disciplined throughout the tender offer process and the integration and keep you apprised when we achieve key milestones.
Of course, we've known Danisco and Genencor as our partners for the past decade, and one key personality trait our company share is our commitment to science and innovation. For DuPont, science and innovation are the engines that drive our growth and what sets us apart from our peers, and whether it's product introduction that drives higher value and higher margins, or whether it's manufacturing excellent or proprietary technology that contribute to our low-cost position, science and innovation remain critical to our success at DuPont.
When I talk about science and innovation at DuPont, I'd like give samples of how they translate into commercial success. The examples I'll share with you have the distinction of having just won a DuPont Excellence Award, that's a very prestigious recognition within the company. One of our Excellence Awards was earned by a team from Crop Protection, which launched a program in 2009 called PrecisionPac. Now PrecisionPac is a dispensing system designed by DuPont and provided to retailers so they can customize both the formulation in a very precise amount to [indiscernible] herbicides to meet individual grower needs. The system design had to make some formidable challenges both in its precision and its safe handling of the component.
Retailers had to be trained and serviced in a different way, and in the end this was a very successful program. It was well-designed and well executed. Retailers were delighted to offer custom solution to their growers. And we saw sales growth against generic competition who could not follow with solutions tailored to the individual grower needs.
Another Excellence Awards comes from our Electronic & Communications business. It was approached back in 2008 to develop a new black [indiscernible] for using copper lace for printed flexible circuit to be used by our auto OEM, who was interested in an all-black cylinder to complement this sleek designs. The conventional film is amber in color. So our multi-functional team came together and developed a product and delighted this OEM customer, but it didn't stop there. They leveraged this new material and applications for smartphones, notebooks and tablet PCs. And these are just two of our excellent award winners, and there are many, many other outstanding examples of excellence in science and innovation when the an awards ceremony here in Wilmington last week where we honored all the winners.
I want to close by reiterating that I expect 2011 to be a year for DuPont to build on our hard-earned momentum. When we designed the accountability structure that we put in place starting in 2009, one of my priorities was to have the flexibility to accommodate potential acquisitions. Meaning that our organizational and reporting structure needed to enable our businesses to stay focused on delivering results, while an integration team went about its work. And now our people have more than a full year under their belts and this accountability structure and the structure has worked the way we planned. And we welcome the integration task that we have ahead of us, and we will stay focused on fulfilling our directives for 2011 day-by-day and quarter-by-quarter.
We have another exciting year ahead of us, and we have the resources, the growth plans, the disciplined processes and market momentum. In summary, the focus is on execution, and I expect the same executional excellence from my leadership team this year as they demonstrated in 2010. And with that, I'm happy to take your questions."

And so in 2011, commodity pricing in the Crop Protection market may be increasing. But we see it as a market that's going to be enhanced by the fact that the farmer wants to protect yields, and it's going to be using everything he can to get the most out of his acres this year."

We see that as a market that continues to be tight with capacity utilizations above 90% and with no real major expansions on the horizon. So it's a classic commodity chemical market when capacity utilization is high, prices tend to rise. We don't tend to comment on any individual price increase.

But for talking purposes,  I think you can think about the write up of PP&E, that type of thing, as ongoing. And then the onetime sort of charges relating to that $0.30 to $0.45, that would be the cost associated with executing our synergies. And we said our synergies is $130 million, so think about cost associated with that,  almost like 1x sort of number. And then the other one, which is going to represent a lion's proportion of that,  is the inventory piece. And you've got to write up that inventory, and that's going to be a onetime effect as well because you're going to be able to cost that out over the current year and then after that, you'll get into a normal cost of goods sold sort of recording situation.

We continue to drive productivity, both fixed and working capital productivity. And our thinking right now in our model has at $300 million of fixed cost productivity and about $300 million of working capital productivity. So when you talk about some of the changes that have occurred now in the new guidance, one is around the tax rate changes and that's going from the 22% to 23% down to the 20% to 21%.

So when you look at our geographic sales base and where we're operating, what we're saying is, on an ongoing basis, the 20% to 21% rate is more reflective of our underlying businesses and where they are participating around the world.

In the U.S., GDP is going to be the same in '11 as it was in '10. The biggest change in the U.S, from our perspective, is going to be the automotive industry. Whereas in 2010, I think, U.S. and Canada were up over 30% overnight and '11, it was only, I guess, 11%. So we're going to see a moderating growth in the automotive, still. And so our growth rate that we saw in the U.S. for the year, which was well under the double digits is going to be probably more in the high single-digit numbers and the like of that. So the U.S., I think, is going to continue to have some strength because of 10% automotive growth as well as good Ag season in that. Europe is going to have a mix recovery pictures. So we think that it's going to be continued, a little bit stronger, maybe 2.5 GDP in Germany, and there's a strong export market. We're not expecting much out of automotive there. Eastern Europe's going to come back more strongly, probably -- well, actually moderating there. So I think Europe is going to be a mixed picture as we go forward. Asia Pacific is going to be an area of strength for us between where automotive is, between where photovoltaics are and electronics are, and things like TiO2 and an increasing Ag position there. That Europe we're going to see, kind of growth rate, it may not be reflective of last year like 50% in China but they're going to be very, very strong. In Latin America, I think you're going to see there that all the automotive is not going to drive Ag outside our business there, Ag & Nutrition will. And so I think, you are going to see some well above-GDP growth in Latin America. GDP in Latin America is about 4% in 2011 is what our estimates are. So I think that our position in Ag, our position in TiO2, photovoltaics and the recovery in Safety & Protection are going to bode well for our volume 2011."

I'm pleased to report very strong results in the first quarter. They reflect disciplined execution across our businesses. And since we reorganized the company 18 months ago, we have consistently focused on market-driven innovation, differential allocation resources and productivity, and this focus continued to pay off. Each reporting segment contributed to our robust performance this quarter. And as a result, we are raising our full year's earnings guidance. 
Sales were up 18% with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and in every region. The largest volume gains were in our growth segment, Safety & Protection , Ag & Nutrition, Electronics & Communications. Success on the top line is directly connected to DuPont's innovation that our customers want, and I'd like to share a couple of examples of how our businesses are driving growth and differentiation through new products. 
The first example comes from Safety & Protection . We work closely with law enforcement and military to address their needs for protection. We took our groundbreaking Kevlar XP technology that was already commercial for law enforcement, and we extended its unique construction of Kevlar fibers for Hard Armor application. This new material enabled weight savings up to 20%, while maintaining essential ballistic protection, a significant benefit where the soldiers and the officers who risk their lives every day.
Most importantly, this innovation allows lighter, thinner helmets than ever before and is designed to work in helmet manufacturer existing equipment. Kevlar XP for Hard Armor is also going to benefit from the new capabilities and supply from DuPont's Kevlar facility expansion in Cooper River, South Carolina, which is on track to start at the end of the year. 
The second example is from Performance Polymer. Last spring, Diane has announced the launch of a new family of products. These resins provide a change in heat-resistant properties and open up new opportunities for metal replacement and automotive applications. Thus, they reduce weight and improve fuel economy.
During the past 12 months, commercial adoption has been 75% faster than previous launches of a similar nature. And the size of the development over 60 programs, which is outstanding as soon after launch. Last fall, General Motors won an award from the Society of Plastic Engineers for the most innovative use of plastics based on Zytel PLUS. And in short, there's a great momentum with this family of resins with the innovative approach to lightweighting, which is quarterly in the sweet spot of the megatrend to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. 
Now there are plenty of product examples in our Ag business. And since Jim's on the call today, I'm going to let him talk about how innovation is contributing to their strong performance this year. As I mentioned earlier, growth in the quarter was broad-based. One of the standout achievements was our performance in developing markets. Many years ago, we recognized the importance of these markets and we laid the groundwork with the basic sales force and people skilled in application development. And over the past five to six years, we had research and development laboratories in locations like Shanghai, Hyderabad and Paulinia, Brazil. Localizing the science is a very important part of our growth story. And through these flies, we are able to identify directly service local needs tied to the megatrends of increasing agricultural productivity, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and protecting people on the environment.
And the result of these efforts is that for the full year of 2010, Developing Markets represents 32% of our total company sales, and in the first quarter, sales to those markets grew by 30%.
Moving to the bottom line, first quarter earnings per share were up 23% versus prior year. And if you back to the segment level, pretax operating income, excluding Pharmaceuticals, was up 31%. Earnings benefit from price increases significantly outpacing higher raw materials and energy costs. And furthermore, we remain vigilant in our focus on productivity with respect to fixed cost, variable cost and working capital. And we are tracking well, against our full year targets in all three areas.
So let me elaborate with one example of our Coatings business is seeing their productivity efforts fall to the bottom line. This quarter, they reduced total fixed cost as a percent of sales by 380 basis points compared to the prior year. This resulted from a combination of restructuring, action and plant-based projects driven by DuPont Production Systems. In addition, the business improved their working capital in areas by nearly 20% using tools and best practices through DuPont Integrated Business Management. We call it the IBM. The team drove label productivity through a detailed review of contract terms and through Six Sigma lean projects.
Now I'd like to give you an update on Japan. Dupont was very fortunate that our employees and your families are safe and accounted for comparatively speaking our production and research facilities were spared from major impact. Our manufacturing and technical facility was the most impacted, and it's well on its way to being repaired and restarted. The DuPont in Japan and around the world have been working tirelessly with our customers and our suppliers to provide assistance and develop workaround solution and get back to business.
This is a challenging situation as always. Our focus is on the customer. We continue to help our Japan-based customers and partners restore operations and productivity in the markets they serve. It's too early to estimate the full impact for the events in Japan. We'll continue to monitor and stay very close to the development there.

I'm delighted to report that in the first quarter, DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and we're off to a great start for the year. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation we laid over the past two years. You can see that the momentum from the previous two years is continuing into 2011. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, and we'll start with Slide 2, which is the summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share on both a reported and an underlying basis is $1.52 compared to $1.24 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of $10 billion were up 18% versus the prior year comprised of 9% volume gains, 8% positive local price increase and 1% benefit from portfolio changes. Volume was up in all segments and in all regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, reflecting our continued strong pricing discipline.
Let's now turn to the corporate view of the first quarter looking at earnings per share analysis on Slide 3. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.27 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable costs, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be very proactive implementing price increases in the face of anticipating increases in variable cost.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, first quarter raw material energy and freight costs were up 8% versus last year's first quarter. For the full year, we now anticipate an increase of about 10% to 12% over 2010. This is up from our initial guidance in January of about 4% to 5% with about three percentage points of this increase being metals-related.
Volume improvements resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.28 per share compared to the same period previous year. As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions with double-digit increases in Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA. There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 4. 
Continuing now with the very variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduce earnings by $0.20 per share versus last year. This reflects actions in the first quarter to support growth such as increased investments in Seed, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, the Tedlar expansion in Circleville along with some R&D and very specific market initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day in December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we're on track to meet that commitment. Year-over-year, currency was a $0.01 benefit in the quarter. We believe this will continue as a tailwind for the second quarter and full year at current levels. The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.07 variance. Reduced Pharmaceutical earnings were a $0.14 negative impact. First quarter Pharma earnings were $50 million, in line with our expectations and about $170 million below what the prior year's performance was. Our full year 2011 estimate for Pharma pretax earnings remains about $200 million, approximately $290 million less than that in 2010.
Next on the waterfall is higher shares outstanding, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. On a fully diluted basis, we had 941 million average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2011 versus 912 million shares last year. This includes a 5 million share repurchase that we enacted in the first quarter.
The last point on the EPS waterfall chart is our first quarter 2011 base tax rate, which was a benefit of $0.04 versus the prior year. This base tax rate this quarter was 21.3% versus 23.4% in the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expect the full year 2011 base tax rate in the 20% to 21% range.
I want to highlight the difference between our first quarter base tax rate of 21.3% and the effective tax rate of 15.2%. The difference in rate is caused by taxes generated from our balance sheet hedging program we refer to as exchange, gains and losses or EG&L. When the tax benefited on EG&L is matched with the pretax loss, the quarter-over-quarter impact of the exchange gains and the loss is a $0.05 benefit and is included in the other category of our waterfall. We provided more detailed on Schedule B in the news release to show you the exact impact of our hedging program and the effect it had on our effective tax rate.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 5. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $1.8 billion. Higher net income was offset by increases in working capital to support the strong revenue growth and capital spending for expansion projects. At the end of the first quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis versus first quarter 2010, we were able to increase networking capital turnover by 14%, reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity gains in the area of working capital this year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that.
We paid our 426 consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. 
In summary for the first quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started in the fourth quarter 2009 continued and expanded. This, along with our market-driven innovation, pricing discipline and productivity, delivered strong quarterly results.
Let's turn now to the second quarter 2011. We expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but in a more moderate pace than we've experienced today. As you'll hear from Jim and Karen, we continue to see strong demand globally across most of our businesses. 
Let's move to Slide 6 for our full year 2011 outlook. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. We're raising our guidance from a range of $3.50 to $3.75 per share to $3.65 per share to $3.85 per share. This excludes the impact of the planned Danisco acquisition, which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis. The main driver for the increase in our guidance is stronger business results, especially in Safety & Protection  and Performance Chemicals as well as in the developing markets.
In addition, we see some benefit from the currency from weaker dollar. These are somewhat offset by increased pressures on raw material prices, increased share count and the automotive and electronic supply chain impacts that we've seen from Japan. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to talk more about Ag & Nutrition segment. Jim?"

Ag & Nutrition is off to a strong start for what we expect is another year of growth across our businesses.

Ag & Nutrition is off to a strong start for what we expect is another year of growth across our businesses. On Slide 7, you'll see sales grew 18% to $3.8 billion, and earnings grew 21% to $1.1 billion. Our teams delivered volume growth in Seeds and Crop Protection products, good price realization in Seeds, as well as good execution in the integration of our proactive strategy. Earnings growth were underpinned by increased sales, which more than offset increased cost.
Starting with Seed sales, first quarter reached $2.6 billion, an increase of 19% with 10% higher volumes, 6% U.S. dollar price gains and 3% impact from portfolio of changes. While each region posted solid sales growth, due to the results reflected strong performance in North America and an early strong start in Europe. 
Specifically in North America, sales increased moderately as we continue to relentlessly execute our right product right acre strategy. The growth represented net price gains underpinned by new product introductions as well as volume growth on top of the strong start to the season in the fourth quarter of 2010. There are numerous North American successes unfolding in the 2011 selling season. A few examples include the successful integration of five PROaccess partners, the fast penetration of T series corn hybrids to about 30% of our lineup and the continued strength of Pioneer brand soybeans. But perhaps the most exciting is the traction of the industry's first integrated and reduced rep Product for below the ground in six Optimum AcreMax 1. The product, which is initially targeted for northern Iowa Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota will be on more than 3 million acres this summer. And this is simply a phenomenal product launch. Growers saw it in demonstration plots in 2010, and they're planning it in big numbers in 2011. And remember, this is our first in a line of integrated reduced refuge products that we'll bring to the market.
Our sales teams are again placing demonstration products of our 2012 commercial launches with key growers as we speak. For example, we're demonstrating Optimum AcreMax, aboveground insect protection products and Optimum AcreMax extra above and below ground insect protection products. We're planning to have well over 1,500 growers in the firsthand experience with these products this summer. Both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax extra products are pending EPA approvals, which we estimate to be in around the third quarter of 2011 and plenty of time for 2012 planning.
Turning to our European business, increased corn sales reflects a nice rebound of the Ag economy. Net pricing gains, coupled with an early start to the season, which creates some timing differences that significantly favor first quarter. In Crop Protection, sales were up significantly as higher volumes more than offset portfolio of changes and weaker U.S. dollar pricing. The strong volume performance was a combination of continued penetration of our new products and early strong start in the northern hemisphere and the channel stocking in response to high grower demand for Crop Protection.
On a product segment basis, volume is up across all of our segments that weed, disease and insect control products. Within insect control, Rynaxypyr continues to strongly contribute to our growth. And based on the rapid penetration we're seeing across all markets, it will grow another 25% in 2011 to $500 million in sales. Importantly, we're on track with investments supporting the registration and launch preparation of other new products in our robust pipeline such as planned management herbicide in our new fungicides as we continue to rapidly capitalize on innovations.
Turning to our Nutrition & Health business, their transformation were delivered improve productivity, as well as improved mix towards specialty products. All in, the execution of their plan delivered higher sales, earnings and margins in the quarter. Looking ahead to second quarter for the Ag & Nutrition reporting segment, we expect sales growth of about 10% and earnings percent growth to be in the mid to high single digits as compared to the same period last year.
This reflects strong business performance but also reflects the jump on the season we saw in the first quarter, which we're estimating about $0.04 to $0.05 earnings per share impact. Specifically, the Seed business anticipates a strong finish to the North America planting season and lower sales in the EU related to the seasonal shifts we saw in the first quarter.
Crop Protection also anticipates broad geographic and product volume growth, however at a reduced pace. Also, considered in our updated outlook our absences of onetime net proceeds from the second quarter of 2010 divested Crop Protection business offset by onetime net proceeds for a sale that was transacted in April of 2011.
With the seasonal nature of Ag, explaining quarterly performance is always challenging. So let me leave you with an updated full year Ag & Nutrition picture. We anticipate performing at the upper end of our long-term commitment of 8% to 10% sales and 15% to 17% earnings growth. The plan we put in place back in 2006 and '07 has delivered success year in and year out. The businesses have never been stronger as we continue to focus on our customers, delivering innovation and driving disciplined execution.
Karen, I'll hand it back to you."
268053,118466507,116285,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Now let's turn to Slide 8 in Electronics & Communications. Sales of $811 million improved 29% compared to the same period last year with 9% volume improvement and 20% higher prices, primarily metal pass-through pricing. Pretax earnings",883,"Okay. Thanks, Jim. Now let's turn to Slide 8 in Electronics & Communications. Sales of $811 million improved 29% compared to the same period last year with 9% volume improvement and 20% higher prices, primarily metal pass-through pricing. Pretax earnings of $111 million are $6 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance was led by Asia Pacific was 26% volume growth, tacked sales were up substantially and strong demand for smartphones and tablet PCs also contributed.
The business continues in capacity expansion and new product with a focus on innovation for the PV market. For the second quarter, Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be substantially above prior year, driven by the anticipated impact from metal price pass-through and demand in PV and consumer electronic with earnings up slightly, reflecting potential Japan impact. We continued to anticipate significant market growth for photovoltaic for the full year. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and Performance Chemicals. $1.8 billion in sales was a year-over-year improvement of 27% with a 21% increase in price and 6% on volume. Pretax earnings of $394 million were $204 million greater than the same period last year with PTOI margins climbing to 22%. Robust global demand across TiO2, refrigerants and fluoropolymer-s gave lift to the segment in all regions demonstrated its rate above 20%. Both hear much attention these days, chemicals and fluoroproducts also performed impressively. Our Teflon fluoroproducts demonstrated nice growth going into many industrial applications with cabling and coating. Additionally, our industry-leading refrigerant, ISCEON and Suva were in high demand as we ramp up for the summer. To recognize our operations team in Performance Chemicals this quarter, several of our businesses are experiencing high sales capacity ratios and our teams implants extremely well to maximize our output.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. This is the peak season for many of the segments product. Performance Chemicals sales and earnings are expected to grow substantially year-over-year, given tight supply in the face of strong demand for several of our products. Productivity effort through DuPont Production System should continue to deliver additional capacity to better serve the market.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 in Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $993 million increased by 10% on stronger pricing and volume gains. Demand was driven by growth in the global automotive market and continued strengthening in the heavy-duty truck market in North America. Pretax operating income was $65 million, 44% above prior year on stronger sales and improved operating leverage. For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up modestly year-over-year with earnings up moderately. Increases will be driven by similar patterns in the automotive aftermarket and continued strength in the heavy-duty truck segment, offsetting a significant decrease in second quarter auto builds due to Japan impact.
There's still a lot of uncertainty around Japan. With respect to auto builds, various third-party reports anticipate a 10% to 15% reduction in second quarter versus prior forecast or all-in about 6% below last year. The expectation is that most of the reduced sales outside of Japan will be made up during the second half of the year with builds inside Japan not fully recovering until 2012.
Full year global sales are still expected to be up about 4% after a good start in the first quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 11 in Performance Materials. Segment sales of $1.7 billion were up 11% on 7% higher volume and 6% higher price, offsetting a 2% portfolio change made in 2010. Strong demand for high-performance polymers like and sterling drove sales in the automotive, electronic and packaging application. In particular, European automotive performed very well this quarter as our innovative plastics helped customers reduce cost and weight. For this segment, pretax operating income was $288 million, a 25% increase versus prior year, including benefits from cost productivity. For the second quarter, we foresee sales growing modestly and PTOI declining slightly versus a strong cost period. Prior year included a $27 million benefit from a gain on the sale of the business and an insurance recovery.
As a result of the Japan earthquake and tsunami, automotive markets will have some intermediate term impacts that are not fully known at this time. However, we see continued strength in other regions of the globe, which we expect to largely offset the near-term revenue impact from Japan. 
Lastly, let's move to Safety & Protection  on Slide 12., where we see continued evidence of the midcycle recovery. Sales climbed 22% on 14% volume growth with 1% price and a 7% increase from the next acquisition, which is integrating nicely into our Sustainable Solutions business.
Nomex, Tyvek and Kevlar all contributed to segment growth with strong demand from industrial markets. Pretax operating income climbed $43 million to $145 million on higher volume and increased operating leverage. Despite growth spending on Cooper River and other investments, the business delivered a 200 basis point improvement in pretax operating margin this quarter.
Looking ahead to second quarter, we see sales increasing significantly and pretax operating income growing substantially with continued operating leverage. We have a positive outlook for industrial and automotive markets, overcoming a sluggish housing market. Additionally, our Cooper River facility continues on track for and end-of-the-year startup. 
And with that, Ellen I'll turn the call back to you."

Danisco shareholder have a choice to make between uncertainty of our offer or the rest of the deal going away, offer up is scheduled to end on April 29.
Now I want to recap my key message points. First, DuPont is executing well. We have very clear strategies and plans for each business and start to constantly raise the bar and outperform our competitors. On Slide 13, you can see an abbreviated version of the 2011 directives that I use with employees to drive focus, to drive performance and to drive accountability. We also have business specific commitments that are aligned with these directives and are externally benchmarks for each business in the major markets they serve. We have a disciplined managing process to evaluate progress against these targets, to evaluate new opportunities as well as contingency plans. And we have the discipline and flexibility to respond to dynamic conditions and unforeseen events such as the tragedy in Japan.
Second, we remain focused on our customers and our markets. Our relationships and important market insights translate into a number of cripple work processing. They range from new product development to customer service to supply chain decision. Our customer focus and organization structure also enables us to respond quickly to opportunities, and that's why we're able to deliver 18% sales growth and 23% earnings per share growth in the quarter. A very strong start to the year givens us increased confidence and raising our earnings outlook to the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. And obviously, this excludes any impact from the planned acquisition of Danisco.
Finally, you heard Nick discuss the various headwinds and tailwinds that lie ahead, and I want to leave you with this. In a dynamic and in times uncertain environment, you can kind on DuPont. My leadership team understands the levers we can pull to respond to the challenges we face, and whether they're unmet needs of a customer or servicing in a market, participating Japan's recovery or countering a competitive threat, I believe we demonstrated as much over the past two years. We're very proud of the track record of executing well, and we are committed to building on it. 
So with that, we are now very happy to take your questions."

And so if you take a look at where prices today certainly is unprecedented but at the same time been quite as much higher than they were before or prices today, versus a decade ago or things like that. So the economics there are pretty constant. If you have a constant dollar basis, we're not back yet to the eight in terms of pricing. So it's a hard market to predict because there's a lot of things that come into play, but capacity utilization is the major one. And companies are trying to de-bottleneck. We're certainly well on our way to meet our needs there for the next few years. But it's a dynamic situation, which I personally experienced, which is one that helps me not predict straight lines in that industry because it's an industry that does tend to run."

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report very strong results in the first quarter. They reflect disciplined execution across our businesses. And since we reorganized the company 18 months ago, we have consistently foc",963,"All right. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report very strong results in the first quarter. They reflect disciplined execution across our businesses. And since we reorganized the company 18 months ago, we have consistently focused on market-driven innovation, differential allocation of resources and productivity, and this focus continues to pay off. Each reporting segment contributed to our robust performance this quarter. And as a result, we are raising our full year's earnings guidance. 
Sales were up 18% with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and in every region. The largest volume gains were in our growth segment, Safety & Protection , Ag & Nutrition, Electronics & Communications. Success on the top line is directly connected to DuPont's innovation that our customers want, and I'd like to share a couple of examples of how our businesses are driving growth and differentiation through new products. 
The first example comes from Safety & Protection. We work closely with law enforcement and military to address their needs for protection, and we took our groundbreaking Kevlar XP technology that was already commercial for law enforcement vests, and we extended its unique construction of Kevlar fibers for Hard Armor application. This new material enabled weight savings up to 20%, while maintaining essential ballistic protection, a significant benefit for the soldiers and the officers who risk their lives every day.
Most importantly, this innovation allows lighter, thinner helmets than ever before and is designed to work in helmet manufacturer's existing equipment. Kevlar XP for Hard Armor is also going to benefit from the new capabilities and supply from DuPont's Kevlar facility expansion in Cooper River, South Carolina, which is on track to start up at the end of this year. 
A second example is from Performance Polymer. Last spring, Diane Gulyas announced the launch of a new family of products branded as Zytel PLUS. These resins provide a step change in heat-resistant properties and opened up new opportunities for metal replacement and automotive application. Thus, they reduce weight and improve fuel economy. During the past 12 months, commercial adoption has been 75% faster than previous launches of a similar nature. And the size of the development pool is over 60 programs, which is outstanding this soon after launch. 
Last fall, General Motors won an award from the Society of Plastics Engineers for the most innovative use of plastics based on Zytel PLUS. And in short, there's a great momentum with this family of resins with the innovative approach to light weighting, which is squarely in the sweet spot of the megatrend to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. 
Now there are plenty of product examples in our Ag business and since Jim's on the call today, I'm going to let him talk about how innovation is contributing to their strong performance this year. 
As I mentioned earlier, growth in the quarter was broad-based. One of the standout achievements was our performance in developing markets. Many years ago, we recognized the importance of these markets, and we laid the groundwork with the basic sales force and people skilled in application development. And over the past 5 to 6 years, we had research and development laboratories in locations like Shanghai, Hyderabad and Paulinia, Brazil. Localizing the science is a very important part of our growth story. And through these labs, we were able to identify and directly service local needs tied to the megatrends of increasing agricultural productivity, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and protecting people and the environment.
And the result of these efforts is that for the full year of 2010, developing markets represents 32% of our total company sales, and in the first quarter, sales to those markets grew by 30%.
Moving to the bottom line. First quarter earnings per share were up 23% versus prior year. And if you peel back that to the segment level, pretax operating income, excluding Pharmaceuticals, was up 31%. Earnings benefited from price increases significantly outpacing higher raw materials and energy costs. And furthermore, we remain vigilant in our focus on productivity with respect to fixed costs, variable costs and working capital. And we are tracking well against our full year targets in all three areas.
So let me elaborate with one example of how our Coatings business is seeing their productivity efforts fall to the bottom line. This quarter, they reduced total fixed costs as a percent of sales by 380 basis points compared to the prior year. This resulted from a combination of restructuring, action and plant-based projects driven by DuPont Production Systems. In addition, the business improved their working capital in the area of payables by nearly 20% using tools and best practices through DuPont Integrated Business Management, we call it the IBM. The team drove payable productivity through a detailed review of contract terms and through Six Sigma Lean projects.
Now I'd like to give you an update on Japan. Dupont was very fortunate that our employees and their families are safe and accounted for and comparatively speaking, our production and research facilities were spared from major impact. Our Utsonomiya manufacturing and technical facility was the most impacted, and it's well on its way to being repaired and restarted. The DuPont-ers in Japan and around the world have been working tirelessly with our customers and our suppliers to provide assistance and develop workaround solutions and get back to business. This is a challenging situation as always. Our focus is on the customer. We continue to help our Japan-based customers and partners restore operations and productivity in the markets they serve. It's too early to estimate the full impact of events in Japan. We'll continue to monitor and stay very close to the development there. 
Now let me turn the call over to Nick. Nick?"

I'm delighted to report that in the first quarter, DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and we're off to a great start for the year. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation we've laid over the past 2 years. You can see that the momentum from the previous two years is continuing into 2011. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals. And we'll start with Slide 2, which is the summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share on both a reported and an underlying basis was $1.52 compared to $1.24 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of $10 billion were up 18% versus the prior year comprised of 9% volume gains, 8% positive local price increase and 1% benefit from portfolio changes. Volume was up in all segments and in all regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, reflecting our continued strong pricing discipline.
Let's now turn to the corporate view of the first quarter, looking at earnings per share analysis on Slide 3. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.27 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable costs, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continued to be very proactive implementing price increases in the face of anticipating increases in variable costs.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, first quarter raw material energy and freight costs were up 8% versus last year's first quarter. For the full year, we now anticipate an increase of about 10% to 12% over 2010. This is up from our initial guidance in January of about 4% to 5% with about 3 percentage points of this increase being metals related.
Volume improvements resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.28 per share compared to the same period previous year. As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions with double-digit increases in Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA. There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 4. 
Continuing now with the very variance analysis, let's move to fixed costs. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed costs reduced earnings by $0.20 per share versus last year. This reflects actions in the first quarter to support growth such as increased investments in Seed, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, the Tedlar expansion in Circleville along with some R&D and very specific market initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day in December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we're on track to meet that commitment. Year-over-year, currency was a $0.01 benefit in the quarter. We believe this will continue as a tailwind for the second quarter and full year at current levels. 
The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.07 variance. Reduced Pharmaceutical earnings were a $0.14 negative impact. First quarter Pharma earnings were $50 million, in line with our expectations and about $170 million below what the prior year's performance was. Our full year 2011 estimate for Pharma pretax earnings remains about $200 million, approximately $290 million less than that in 2010.
Next on the waterfall is higher shares outstanding, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. On a fully diluted basis, we had 941 million average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2011 versus 912 million shares last year. This includes a 5 million share repurchase that we enacted in the first quarter.
The last point on the EPS waterfall chart is our first quarter 2011 base tax rate, which was a benefit of $0.04 versus the prior year. This base tax rate this quarter was 21.3% versus 23.4% in the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expect a full year 2011 base tax rate in the 20% to 21% range.
I want to highlight the difference between our first quarter base tax rate of 21.3% and the effective tax rate of 15.2%. The difference in rate is caused by taxes generated from our balance sheet hedging program we refer to as exchange, gains and losses or EG&L. When the tax benefit on EG&L is matched with the pretax loss, the quarter-over-quarter impact of the exchange, gains and loss is $0.05 benefit and is included in the other category of our waterfall. We provided more detail on Schedule B in the news release to show you the exact impact of our hedging program and the effect it had on our effective tax rate.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 5. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $1.8 billion. Higher net income was offset by increases in working capital to support the strong revenue growth and capital spending for expansion projects. At the end of the first quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis versus first quarter 2010, we were able to increase networking capital turnover by 14%, reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity gains in the area of working capital this year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that.
We paid our 426th consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. 
In summary for the first quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started in the fourth quarter 2009 continued and expanded. This, along with our market-driven innovation, pricing discipline and productivity focus, delivered strong quarterly results.
Let's turn now to the second quarter 2011. We expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but in a more moderate pace than we've experienced today. As you'll hear from Jim and Karen, we continue to see strong demand globally across most of our businesses. 
Let's move to Slide 6 for our full year 2011 outlook. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. We're raising our guidance from a range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share to $3.65 to $3.85 per share. This excludes the impact of the planned Danisco acquisition, which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis. The main driver for the increase in our guidance is stronger business results, especially in Safety & Protection  and Performance Chemicals as well as in the developing markets.
In addition, we see some benefit from the currency from weaker dollar. These are somewhat offset by increased pressures on raw material prices, increased share count and the automotive and electronic supply chain impacts that we've seen from Japan. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to talk more about Ag & Nutrition segment. Jim?"
268053,118466507,116398,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Ag & Nutrition is off to a strong start for what we expect is going to be another year of growth across our businesses. On Slide 7, you'll see sales grew 18% to $3.8 billion, and earnings grew 21% to $1.1 billion. Our teams delivered volume",881,"Thanks, Nick. Ag & Nutrition is off to a strong start for what we expect is going to be another year of growth across our businesses. On Slide 7, you'll see sales grew 18% to $3.8 billion, and earnings grew 21% to $1.1 billion. Our teams delivered volume growth in Seeds and Crop Protection products, good net price realization in Seeds, as well as good execution and integration of our PROaccess strategy. Earnings growth were underpinned by increased sales, which more than offset increased cost.
Starting with Seed sales. First quarter reached $2.6 billion, an increase of 19% with 10% higher volumes, 6% U.S. dollar price gains and 3% impact from portfolio changes. While each region posted solid sales growth, 2/3 of the results reflected strong performance in North America and an early strong start in Europe. 
Specifically in North America, sales increased moderately as we continue to relentlessly execute our Right Product, Right Acre strategy. The growth represented net price gains underpinned by new product introductions as well as volume growth on top of a strong start to the season in the fourth quarter of 2010. There are numerous North American successes unfolding in the 2011 selling season. A few examples include the successful integration of 5 PROaccess partners, the fast penetration of P series corn hybrids to about 40% of our lineup and the continued strength of Pioneer brand soybeans. But perhaps the most exciting is the traction of the industry's first integrated and reduced refuge product for belowground insects, Optimum AcreMax 1. The product, which is initially targeted for northern Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Dakotas will be on more than 3 million acres this summer, and this is simply a phenomenal product launch. Growers saw it in demonstration plots in 2010, and they're planning it in big numbers in 2011. And remember, this is our first in a line of integrated reduced refuge products that we'll bring to the market. Our sales teams are again placing demonstration products of our 2012 commercial launches with key growers as we speak. For example, we're demonstrating Optimum AcreMax aboveground insect protection products and Optimum AcreMax XTRA above- and belowground insect protection products. We're planning to have well over 1,500 growers gaining firsthand experience with these products this summer. Both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA products are pending EPA approvals, which we estimate to be in around the third quarter of 2011 and plenty of time for 2012 planning.
Turning to our European Feed business. Increased corn sales reflects a nice rebound of the Ag economy. Net pricing gains, coupled with an early start to the season, which created some timing differences that significantly favor first quarter. In Crop Protection, sales were up significantly as higher volumes more than offset portfolio changes and weaker U.S. dollar pricing. The strong volume performance was a combination of continued penetration of our new products and early strong start in the northern hemisphere and the channel stocking in response to high grower demand for Crop Protection.
On a product segment basis, volume was up across all of our segments of weed, disease and insect control products. Within insect control, Rynaxypyr continues to strongly contribute to our growth. And based on the rapid penetration we're seeing across all markets, it will grow another 25% in 2011 to $500 million in sales. Importantly, we're on track with investments supporting the registration and launch preparation of other new products in our robust pipeline such as land management herbicides and our new fungicides as we continue to rapidly capitalize on new innovations.
Turning to our Nutrition & Health business. Their transformation work delivered improved productivity as well as improved mix towards specialty products. All in, the execution of their plan delivered higher sales, earnings and margins in the quarter. 
Looking ahead to second quarter for the Ag & Nutrition reporting segment, we expect sales growth of about 10% and earnings percent growth to be in the mid- to high single digits as compared to the same period last year. This reflects strong business performance, but also reflects the jump on the season we saw in the first quarter, which we're estimating at about $0.04 to $0.05 earnings per share impact. Specifically, the Seed business anticipates a strong finish to the North America planting season and lower sales in the EU surely due to the seasonal shifts we saw in the first quarter.
Crop Protection also anticipates broad geographic and product volume growth, however at a reduced pace. Also considered in our updated outlook, our absences of onetime net proceeds from the second quarter of 2010 divested Crop Protection business offset by onetime net proceeds for a sale that was transacted in April of 2011.
With the seasonal nature of Ag, explaining quarterly performance is always challenging, so let me leave you with an updated full year Ag & Nutrition picture. We anticipate performing at the upper end of our long-term commitment of 8% to 10% sales and 13% to 17% earnings growth. The plan we put in place back in 2006 and '07 has delivered success year in and year out. The businesses have never been stronger as we continue to focus on our customers, delivering innovation and driving disciplined execution.
Karen, I'll hand it back to you."
268053,118466507,116398,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and Electronics & Communications. Sales of $811 million improved 29% compared to the same period last year with 9% volume improvement and 20% higher prices, primarily metal pass-through pricing. Pretax earnings",900,"Okay. Thanks, Jim. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and Electronics & Communications. Sales of $811 million improved 29% compared to the same period last year with 9% volume improvement and 20% higher prices, primarily metal pass-through pricing. Pretax earnings of $111 million are $6 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance was led by Asia Pacific with 26% volume growth, photovoltaic sales were up substantially and strong demand for smartphones and tablet PCs also contributed.
The business continues its investment in capacity expansions and new products with a focus on innovation for the PV market. For the second quarter, Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be substantially above prior year, driven by the anticipated impact from metal price pass-through and demand in PV and consumer electronic with earnings up slightly, reflecting potential Japan's impact. We continue to anticipate significant market growth for photovoltaics for the full year. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and Performance Chemicals. $1.8 billion in sales was a year-over-year improvement of 27% with a 21% increase in price and 6% on volume. Pretax earnings of $394 million were $204 million greater than the same period last year with PTOI margins climbing to 22%. Robust global demand across TiO2, refrigerants and fluoropolymers gave lift to this segment, and all regions demonstrated growth rates above 20%. While TiO2 gets much of the attention these days, let me emphasize on our Chemicals and Fluoroproducts business also performed impressively. Our Teflon fluoroproducts demonstrated nice growth going into many industrial applications like cabling and coating. Additionally, our industry-leading refrigerant, ISCEON and Suva, were in high demand as we ramp up for the summer. I'd like to recognize our operations team in Performance Chemicals this quarter, several of our businesses are experiencing ""high sales to capacity"" ratios and our teams [indiscernible] extremely well to maximize our output.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. This is the peak season for many of the segments' products. Performance Chemicals' sales and earnings are expected to grow substantially year-over-year, given tight supply in the face of strong demand for several of our products. Productivity effort through DuPont Production System should continue to deliver additional capacity to better serve the market.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 in Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $993 million increased by 10% on stronger pricing and volume gains. Demand was driven by growth in the global automotive market and continued strengthening in the heavy-duty truck market in North America. Pretax operating income was $65 million, 44% above prior year on stronger sales and improved operating leverage. 
For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up modestly year-over-year with earnings up moderately. Increases will be driven by seasonal patterns in the automotive aftermarket and continued strength in the heavy-duty truck segment, offsetting a significant decrease in second quarter auto builds due to Japan impact.
There's still a lot of uncertainty around Japan. With respect to auto builds, various third-party reports anticipate a 10% to 15% reduction in second quarter versus prior forecast or, all in, about 6% below last year. The expectation is that most of the reduced sales outside of Japan will be made up during the second half of the year with builds inside Japan not fully recovering until 2012. Full year global sales are still expected to be up about 4% after a good start in the first quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 11 and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $1.7 billion were up 11% on 7% higher volume and 6% higher price, offsetting a 2% portfolio change made in 2010. Strong demand for high-performance polymers like Zytel and Surlyn drove sales in the automotive, electronics and packaging applications. In particular, European automotive performed very well this quarter as our innovative plastics helped customers reduce cost and weight. 
For this segment, pretax operating income was $288 million, a 25% increase versus prior year, including benefits from cost productivity. 
For the second quarter, we foresee sales growing modestly and PTOI declining slightly versus a strong cost period. Prior year included a $27 million benefit from a gain on the sale of a business and an insurance recovery.
As a result of the Japan earthquake and tsunami, automotive markets will have some intermediate-term impacts that are not fully known at this time. However, we see continued strength in other regions of the globe, which we expect to largely offset the near-term revenue impact from Japan. 
Lastly, let's move to Safety & Protection on Slide 12, where we see continued evidence of the mid-cycle recovery. Sales climbed 22% on 14% volume growth with 1% price and a 7% increase from Nomex acquisition, which is integrating nicely into our Sustainable Solutions business. Nomex, Tyvek and Kevlar all contributed to segment growth with strong demand from industrial markets. 
Pretax operating income climbed $43 million to $145 million on higher volume and increased operating leverage. Despite growth spending on Cooper River and other investments, the business delivered a 200 basis point improvement in pretax operating margin this quarter.
Looking ahead to second quarter, we see sales increasing significantly and pretax operating income growing substantially with continued operating leverage. We have a positive outlook for industrial and automotive markets, overcoming a sluggish housing market. Additionally, our Cooper River facility continues on track for its ""end of the year"" startup. 
And with that, Ellen, I'll turn the call back to you."

All regulatory conditions have been met to complete our tender offer, and we've made up our provision clear. Our offer is full, fair and firm. Danisco shareholders have a choice to make between the certainty of our offer or the risk of the deal going away, and that offer period is scheduled to end on April 29.
Now I want to recap my key message points. First, DuPont is executing well. We have very clear strategies and plans for each business and strive to constantly raise the bar and outperform our competitors. On Slide 13, you can see an abbreviated version of the 2011 directives that I use with employees to drive focus, to drive performance and to drive accountability. We also have business-specific commitments that are aligned with these directives and are externally benchmarks for each business in the major markets they serve. We have a disciplined managing process to evaluate progress against these targets, to evaluate new opportunities as well as contingency plans. We have the discipline and flexibility to respond to dynamic conditions and unforeseen events such as the tragedy in Japan.
Second, we remain focused on our customers and our markets. Our relationships and important market insights translate into a number of [indiscernible] work processing. They range from new product development to customer service to supply chain decision. Our customer focus and organization structure also enables us to respond quickly to opportunities, and it's why we're able to deliver 18% sales growth and 23% earnings per share growth in the quarter. A very strong start to the year gives us increased confidence in raising our earnings outlook to the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share and obviously this excludes any impact from the planned acquisition of Danisco.
Finally, you heard Nick discuss the various headwinds and tailwinds that lie ahead, and I want to leave you with this: in a dynamic and in times uncertain environment, you can kind on DuPont. My leadership team understands the levers we can pull to respond to the challenges we face and whether they're unmet needs of a customer or servicing in a tight market, participating Japan's recovery or countering a competitive threat, I believe we demonstrated as much over the past 2 years. We're very proud of the track record of executing well, and we are committed to building on it. 
So with that, we are now very happy to take your questions."

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report very strong results in the first quarter. They reflect disciplined execution across our businesses.

I'm pleased to report very strong results in the first quarter. They reflect disciplined execution across our businesses. And since we reorganized the company 18 months ago, we have consistently focused on market-driven innovation, differential allocation of resources and productivity, and this focus continues to pay off. Each reporting segment contributed to our robust performance this quarter. And as a result, we are raising our full year's earnings guidance. 
Sales were up 18% with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and in every region. The largest volume gains were in our growth segment, Safety & Protection , Ag & Nutrition, Electronics & Communications. Success on the top line is directly connected to DuPont's innovation that our customers want, and I'd like to share a couple of examples of how our businesses are driving growth and differentiation through new products. 
The first example comes from Safety & Protection. We work closely with law enforcement and military to address their needs for protection, and we took our groundbreaking Kevlar XP technology that was already commercial for law enforcement vests, and we extended its unique construction of Kevlar fibers for Hard Armor application. This new material enables weight savings up to 20%, while maintaining essential ballistic protection, a significant benefit for the soldiers and the officers who risk their lives every day.
Most importantly, this innovation allows lighter, thinner helmets than ever before and is designed to work in helmet manufacturer's existing equipment. Kevlar XP for Hard Armor is also going to benefit from the new capabilities and supply from DuPont's Kevlar facility expansion in Cooper River, South Carolina, which is on track to start up at the end of this year. 
A second example is from Performance Polymer. Last spring, Diane Gulyas announced the launch of a new family of products branded as Zytel PLUS. These resins provide a step change in heat-resistant properties and opened up new opportunities for metal replacement and automotive application. Thus, they reduce weight and improve fuel economy. During the past 12 months, commercial adoption has been 75% faster than previous launches of a similar nature. And the size of the development pool is over 60 programs, which is outstanding this soon after launch. 
Last fall, General Motors won an award from the Society of Plastics Engineers for the most innovative use of plastics based on Zytel PLUS. And in short, there's a great momentum with this family of resins with the innovative approach to light weighting, which is squarely in the sweet spot of the megatrend to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. 
Now there are plenty of product examples in our Ag business and since Jim's on the call today, I'm going to let him talk about how innovation is contributing to their strong performance this year. 
As I mentioned earlier, growth in the quarter was broad-based. One of the standout achievements was our performance in developing markets. Many years ago, we recognized the importance of these markets, and we laid the groundwork with the basic sales force and people skilled in application development. And over the past 5 to 6 years, we added research and development laboratories in locations like Shanghai, Hyderabad and Paulinia, Brazil. Localizing the science is a very important part of our growth story. And through these labs, we were able to identify and directly service local needs tied to the megatrends of increasing agricultural productivity, reducing dependence on fossil fuels and protecting people and the environment.
And a result of these efforts is that for the full year of 2010, developing markets represents 32% of our total company sales, and in the first quarter, sales to those markets grew by 30%.
Moving to the bottom line. First quarter earnings per share were up 23% versus prior year. And if you peel back that to the segment level, pretax operating income, excluding Pharmaceuticals, was up 31%. Earnings benefited from price increases significantly outpacing higher raw materials and energy costs. And furthermore, we remain vigilant in our focus on productivity with respect to fixed costs, variable costs and working capital. And we are tracking well against our full year targets in all three areas.
So let me elaborate with one example of how our Coatings business is seeing their productivity efforts fall to the bottom line. This quarter, they reduced total fixed costs as a percent of sales by 380 basis points compared to the prior year. This resulted from a combination of restructuring, action and plant-based projects driven by DuPont Production Systems. In addition, the business improved their working capital in the area of payables by nearly 20% using tools and best practices through DuPont Integrated Business Management, we call it the IBM. The team drove payable productivity through a detailed review of contract terms and through Six Sigma Lean projects.
Now I'd like to give you an update on Japan. Dupont was very fortunate that our employees and their families are safe and accounted for and comparatively speaking, our production and research facilities were spared from major impact. Our Utsonomiya manufacturing and technical facility was the most impacted, and it's well on its way to being repaired and restarted. The DuPont-ers in Japan and around the world have been working tirelessly with our customers and our suppliers to provide assistance and develop workaround solutions and get back to business. This is a challenging situation as always. Our focus is on the customer. We continue to help our Japan-based customers and partners restore operations and productivity in the markets they serve. It's too early to estimate the full impact of events in Japan. We'll continue to monitor and stay very close to the development there. 
Now let me turn the call over to Nick. Nick?"

This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundatio",1178,"Thank you, Ellen. And good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report that in the first quarter, DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and we're off to a great start for the year. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation we've laid over the past 2 years. You can see that the momentum from the previous two years is continuing into 2011. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals. And we'll start with Slide 2, which is the summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share on both a reported and an underlying basis was $1.52 compared to $1.24 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of $10 billion were up 18% versus the prior year comprised of 9% volume gains, 8% positive local price increase and 1% benefit from portfolio changes. Volume was up in all segments and in all regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, reflecting our continued strong pricing discipline.
Let's now turn to the corporate view of the first quarter, looking at earnings per share analysis on Slide 3. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.27 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable costs, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be very proactive implementing price increases in the face of anticipating increases in variable costs.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, first quarter raw material energy and freight costs were up 8% versus last year's first quarter. For the full year, we now anticipate an increase of about 10% to 12% over 2010. This is up from our initial guidance in January of about 4% to 5% with about 3 percentage points of this increase being metals related.
Volume improvements resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.28 per share compared to the same period previous year. As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions with double-digit increases in Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA. There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 4. 
Continuing now with the very variance analysis, let's move to fixed costs. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed costs reduced earnings by $0.20 per share versus last year. This reflects actions in the first quarter to support growth such as increased investments in Seed, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, the Tedlar expansion in Circleville along with some R&D and very specific market initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day in December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we're on track to meet that commitment. Year-over-year, currency was a $0.01 benefit in the quarter. We believe this will continue as a tailwind for the second quarter and full year at current levels. 
The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.07 variance. Reduced Pharmaceutical earnings were a $0.14 negative impact. First quarter Pharma earnings were $50 million, in line with our expectations and about $170 million below what the prior year's performance was. Our full year 2011 estimate for Pharma pretax earnings remains about $200 million, approximately $290 million less than that in 2010.
Next on the waterfall is higher shares outstanding, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. On a fully diluted basis, we had 941 million average shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2011 versus 912 million shares last year. This includes a 5 million share repurchase that we enacted in the first quarter.
The last point on the EPS waterfall chart is our first quarter 2011 base tax rate, which was a benefit of $0.04 versus the prior year. This base tax rate this quarter was 21.3% versus 23.4% in the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expect a full year 2011 base tax rate in the 20% to 21% range.
I want to highlight the difference between our first quarter base tax rate of 21.3% and the effective tax rate of 15.2%. The difference in rate is caused by taxes generated from our balance sheet hedging program we refer to as exchange, gains and losses or EG&L. When the tax benefit on EG&L is matched with the pretax loss, the quarter-over-quarter impact of the exchange, gains and loss is $0.05 benefit and is included in the other category of our waterfall. We provided more detail on Schedule B in the news release to show you the exact impact of our hedging program and the effect it had on our effective tax rate.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 5. First quarter free cash flow was a seasonal outflow of $1.8 billion. Higher net income was offset by increases in working capital to support the strong revenue growth and capital spending for expansion projects. At the end of the first quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis versus first quarter 2010, we were able to increase networking capital turnover by 14%, reducing our working capital needs and in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity gains in the area of working capital this year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A credit rating and work to maintain the associated metrics to support that.
We paid our 426th consecutive quarterly dividend in March. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. 
In summary for the first quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started in the fourth quarter 2009 continued and expanded. This, along with our market-driven innovation, pricing discipline and productivity focus, delivered strong quarterly results.
Let's turn now to the second quarter 2011. We expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but in a more moderate pace than we've experienced today. As you'll hear from Jim and Karen, we continue to see strong demand globally across most of our businesses. 
Let's move to Slide 6 for our full year 2011 outlook. DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. We're raising our guidance from a range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share to $3.65 to $3.85 per share. This excludes the impact of the planned Danisco acquisition, which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis. The main driver for the increase in our guidance is stronger business results, especially in Safety & Protection  and Performance Chemicals as well as in the developing markets.
In addition, we see some benefit from the currency from weaker dollar. These are somewhat offset by increased pressures on raw material prices, increased share count and the automotive and electronic supply chain impacts that we've seen from Japan. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to talk more about Ag & Nutrition segment. Jim?"
268053,118466507,116617,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Ag & Nutrition is off to a strong start for what we expect is going to be another year of growth across our businesses. On Slide 7, you'll see sales grew 18% to $3.8 billion, and earnings grew 21% to $1.1 billion. Our teams delivered volume",881,"Thanks, Nick. Ag & Nutrition is off to a strong start for what we expect is going to be another year of growth across our businesses. On Slide 7, you'll see sales grew 18% to $3.8 billion, and earnings grew 21% to $1.1 billion. Our teams delivered volume growth in Seeds and Crop Protection products, good net price realization in Seeds, as well as good execution and integration of our PROaccess strategy. Earnings growth were underpinned by increased sales, which more than offset increased cost.
Starting with Seed sales. First quarter reached $2.6 billion, an increase of 19% with 10% higher volumes, 6% U.S. dollar price gains and 3% impact from portfolio changes. While each region posted solid sales growth, 2/3 of the results reflected strong performance in North America and an early strong start in Europe. 
Specifically in North America, sales increased moderately as we continue to relentlessly execute our Right Product, Right Acre strategy. The growth represented net price gains underpinned by new product introductions as well as volume growth on top of a strong start to the season in the fourth quarter of 2010. There are numerous North American successes unfolding in the 2011 selling season. A few examples included the successful integration of 5 PROaccess partners, the fast penetration of P series corn hybrids to about 40% of our lineup and the continued strength of Pioneer brand soybeans. But perhaps the most exciting is the traction of the industry's first integrated and reduced refuge product for belowground insects, Optimum AcreMax 1. The product, which is initially targeted for northern Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Dakotas will be on more than 3 million acres this summer, and this is simply a phenomenal product launch. Growers saw it in demonstration plots in 2010, and they're planning it in big numbers in 2011. And remember, this is our first in a line of integrated reduced refuge products that we'll bring to the market. Our sales teams are again placing demonstration products of our 2012 commercial launches with key growers as we speak. For example, we're demonstrating Optimum AcreMax aboveground insect protection products and Optimum AcreMax XTRA above- and belowground insect protection products. We're planning to have well over 1,500 growers gaining firsthand experience with these products this summer. Both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA products are pending EPA approvals, which we estimate to be in around the third quarter of 2011 and plenty of time for 2012 planning.
Turning to our European Feed business. Increased corn sales reflects a nice rebound to the Ag economy. Net pricing gains, coupled with an early start to the season, which created some timing differences that significantly favor first quarter. In Crop Protection, sales were up significantly as higher volumes more than offset portfolio changes and weaker U.S. dollar pricing. The strong volume performance was a combination of continued penetration of our new products and early strong start in the northern hemisphere and the channel stocking in response to high grower demand for Crop Protection.
On a product segment basis, volume was up across all of our segments of weed, disease and insect control products. Within insect control, Rynaxypyr continues to strongly contribute to our growth. And based on the rapid penetration we're seeing across all markets, it will grow another 25% in 2011 to $500 million in sales. Importantly, we're on track with investments supporting the registration and launch preparation of other new products in our robust pipeline such as land management herbicides and our new fungicides as we continue to rapidly capitalize on new innovations.
Turning to our Nutrition & Health business. Their transformation work delivered improved productivity as well as improved mix towards specialty products. All in, the execution of their plan delivered higher sales, earnings and margins in the quarter. 
Looking ahead to second quarter for the Ag & Nutrition reporting segment, we expect sales growth of about 10% and earnings percent growth to be in the mid- to high single digits as compared to the same period last year. This reflects strong business performance, but also reflects the jump on the season we saw in the first quarter, which we're estimating at about $0.04 to $0.05 earnings per share impact. Specifically, the Seed business anticipates a strong finish to the North America planting season and lower sales in the EU surely due to the seasonal shifts we saw in the first quarter.
Crop Protection also anticipates broad geographic and product volume growth, however at a reduced pace. Also considered in our updated outlook, our absences of onetime net proceeds from the second quarter of 2010 divested Crop Protection business offset by onetime net proceeds for a sale that was transacted in April of 2011.
With the seasonal nature of Ag, explaining quarterly performance is always challenging, so let me leave you with an updated full year Ag & Nutrition picture. We anticipate performing at the upper end of our long-term commitment of 8% to 10% sales and 13% to 17% earnings growth. The plan we put in place back in 2006 and '07 has delivered success year in and year out. The businesses have never been stronger as we continue to focus on our customers, delivering innovation and driving disciplined execution.
Karen, I'll hand it back to you."
268053,118466507,116617,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2011",2011-04-21,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and Electronics & Communications. Sales of $811 million improved 29% compared to the same period last year with 9% volume improvement and 20% higher prices, primarily metal pass-through pricing. Pretax earnings",902,"Okay. Thanks, Jim. Now let's turn to Slide 8 and Electronics & Communications. Sales of $811 million improved 29% compared to the same period last year with 9% volume improvement and 20% higher prices, primarily metal pass-through pricing. Pretax earnings of $111 million are $6 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance was led by Asia Pacific with 26% volume growth, photovoltaic sales were up substantially and strong demand for smartphones and tablet PCs also contributed.
The business continues its investment in capacity expansions and new products with a focus on innovation for the PV market. For the second quarter, Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be substantially above prior year, driven by the anticipated impact from metal price pass-through and demand in PV and consumer electronic with earnings up slightly, reflecting potential Japan impact. We continue to anticipate significant market growth for photovoltaics for the full year. 
Moving on to Slide 9 and Performance Chemicals. $1.8 billion in sales was a year-over-year improvement of 27% with a 21% increase in price and 6% on volume. Pretax earnings of $394 million were $204 million greater than the same period last year with PTOI margins climbing to 22%. Robust global demand across TiO2, refrigerants and fluoropolymers gave lift to this segment, and all regions demonstrated growth rates above 20%. While TiO2 gets much of the attention these days, let me emphasize that our Chemicals and Fluoroproducts business also performed impressively. Our Teflon fluoroproducts demonstrated nice growth going into many industrial applications like cabling and coating. Additionally, our industry-leading refrigerant, ISCEON and Suva, were in high demand as we ramp up for the summer. I'd like to recognize our operations team in Performance Chemicals this quarter, several of our businesses are experiencing ""high sales to capacity"" ratios and our teams ran the plants extremely well to maximize our output.
Looking ahead to the second quarter. This is the peak season for many of the segments' products. Performance Chemicals' sales and earnings are expected to grow substantially year-over-year, given tight supply in the face of strong demand for several of our products. Productivity effort through DuPont Production System should continue to deliver additional capacity to better serve the market.
Now let's turn to Slide 10 in Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $993 million increased by 10% on stronger pricing and volume gains. Demand was driven by growth in the global automotive market and continued strengthening in the heavy-duty truck market in North America. Pretax operating income was $65 million, 44% above prior year on stronger sales and improved operating leverage. 
For the second quarter, we expect segment sales to be up modestly year-over-year with earnings up moderately. Increases will be driven by seasonal patterns in the automotive aftermarket and continued strength in the heavy-duty truck segment, offsetting a significant decrease in second quarter auto builds due to Japan impact.
There's still a lot of uncertainty around Japan. With respect to auto builds, various third-party reports anticipate a 10% to 15% reduction in second quarter versus prior forecast or, all in, about 6% below last year. The expectation is that most of the reduced sales outside of Japan will be made up during the second half of the year with builds inside Japan not fully recovering until 2012. Full year global sales are still expected to be up about 4% after a good start in the first quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 11 and Performance Materials. Segment sales of $1.7 billion were up 11% on 7% higher volume and 6% higher price, offsetting a 2% portfolio change made in 2010. Strong demand for high-performance polymers like Zytel and Surlyn drove sales in the automotive, electronics and packaging applications. In particular, European automotive performed very well this quarter as our innovative plastics helped customers reduce cost and weight. 
For this segment, pretax operating income was $288 million, a 25% increase versus prior year, including benefits from cost productivity. 
For the second quarter, we foresee sales growing modestly and PTOI declining slightly versus a strong cost period. Prior year included a $27 million benefit from a gain on the sale of a business and an insurance recovery.
As a result of the Japan earthquake and tsunami, automotive markets will have some intermediate-term impacts that are not fully known at this time. However, we see continued strength in other regions of the globe, which we expect to largely offset the near-term revenue impact from Japan. 
Lastly, let's move to Safety & Protection on Slide 12, where we see continued evidence of the mid-cycle recovery. Sales climbed 22% on 14% volume growth with 1% price and a 7% increase from Nomex acquisition, which is integrating nicely into our Sustainable Solutions business. Nomex, Tyvek and Kevlar all contributed to segment growth with strong demand from industrial markets. 
Pretax operating income climbed $43 million to $145 million on higher volume and increased operating leverage. Despite growth spending on Cooper River and other investments, the business delivered a 200 basis point improvement in pretax operating margin this quarter.
Looking ahead to second quarter, we see sales increasing significantly and pretax operating income growing substantially with continued operating leverage. We have a positive outlook for industrial and automotive markets, overcoming a sluggish housing market. Additionally, our Cooper River facility continues on track for its ""end of the year"" startup. 
And with that, Ellen, I'll turn the call back to you."

Danisco shareholders have a choice to make between the certainty of our offer or the risk of the deal going away, and that offer period is scheduled to end on April 29.
You know, I want to recap my key message points. First, DuPont is executing well. We have very clear strategies and plans for each business and strive to constantly raise the bar and outperform our competitors. On Slide 13, you can see an abbreviated version of the 2011 directives that I use with employees to drive focus, to drive performance and to drive accountability. We also have business-specific commitments that are aligned with these directives and are externally benchmarks for each business in the major markets they serve. We have a disciplined managing process to evaluate progress against these targets, to evaluate new opportunities as well as contingency plans. We have the discipline and flexibility to respond to dynamic conditions and unforeseen events such as the tragedy in Japan.
Second, we remain focused on our customers and our markets. Our relationships and important market insights translate into a number of triple work processes. They range from new product development to customer service to supply chain decision. Our customer focus and organization structure also enables us to respond quickly to opportunities, and it's why we're able to deliver 18% sales growth and 23% earnings per share growth in the quarter. A very strong start to the year gives us increased confidence in raising our earnings outlook to the range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share and obviously this excludes any impact from the planned acquisition of Danisco.
Finally, you heard Nick discuss the various headwinds and tailwinds that lie ahead, and I want to leave you with this: in a dynamic and in times uncertain environment, you can kind on DuPont. My leadership team understands the levers we can pull to respond to the challenges we face and whether they're unmet needs of a customer or servicing in a tight market, participating Japan's recovery or countering a competitive threat, I believe we demonstrated as much over the past 2 years. We're very proud of the track record of executing well, and we are committed to building on it. 
So with that, we are now very happy to take your questions."

I'm pleased with the continued strong momentum from our second quarter results. Sales were up 19% with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and major region. Sales to Developing Markets gre",1142,"Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with the continued strong momentum from our second quarter results. Sales were up 19% with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and major region. Sales to Developing Markets grew 29%. Overall, we had excellent pricing performance driven by innovative new products and disciplined pricing actions across all businesses. Volume was up 2% for the quarter compared to 9% in the first quarter. For the full year, our expectation is for 5% organic volume growth. Factors affecting volume growth is specific to the quarter included the timing of a very strong start to the Ag season weighted towards the first quarter at the expense of the second, as well as the impact from the Japanese earthquake and flooding in the United States, which we will recover in the second half. In spite of these items that were very unique to the second quarter, our volume growth year-to-date is about 5% and we expect that trend line to continue through the second half. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through what we're seeing in the major markets we serve. Let's start with Agriculture, where we're wrapping up a very successful selling season in the Northern Hemisphere. In line with our right product, right acre-feet strategy, our sales team deliver a constant stream of new products that optimize performance and profitability field by field. Broad customer acceptance leads us to expect share gains in North American corn and soybeans is one measure to grow our validation this season, and we'll announce those share gains later this summer.
Healthy farm economics and high-value product innovations are the backbone of success for both our Seed and our Crop Protection businesses. 
Moving to electronics. is an important growth market for us. We expect module builds to be up nearly 15% this year, and as we always state, the road is a bit bumpy. In the first quarter, we saw Module inventory builds as production outpaced demand. Now this situation continued into the second quarter and with the further increases in inventory coupled with significant price and margin pressures on the supply chain. While the market has begun to adjust, we expect the correction to continue into the second half. Positive news came from generate Germany signaling that they will keep their existing subsidy level of tax and not make the anticipated cut in July as was once thought. 
We expect PV installations to be up significantly in the third quarter as compared to the second, helping to work off inventories in the low Cell & Module production to pick up again. PV installation in the second half should reach levels of about 11 to 12 gigawatts nearly double the rate from the first half on stronger demand in Germany, Italy, USA and China. 
Given silver price escalation and extreme volatility, we've launched a new generation of Solamet metallization paste called Solamet PV 17x. Now this flat silver paste is quickly establishing a new global standard for high efficiency and crystalline silicon solar cells, while also reducing field repace consumption by about 10% on average, a significant achievement given the strong drive to higher efficiency and lower cost in the portable industry.
Looking at consumer electronics, we see continued strength in smartphones and tablet PCs since both applications use a number of advanced materials. Demand for plasma deployed is stable. For our automotive market, light vehicle builds went down 1% about as expected as the world worked through supply chain issues related to the tragic earthquake in Japan. We believe most of the issues are behind the industry now and expect production to catch up in the third and fourth quarters with full year vehicle build up about 5%.
In terms of market penetration, we see growing demand for vehicle weight plating us OEMs around the world strive for improved vehicle efficiency. Today, in developed markets, roughly 15% to 18% of the average vehicle weight is plastic. Now this percentage is much lower in emerging markets as we see significant growth opportunities in both markets for lightweighting with a potential for developed markets to reach 25% in the next 5 years. Now DuPont is uniquely positioned with products like Zytel PLUS and strong applications development both in people and facilities, and there we'll place around the world to capitalize on this trend.
Finally, construction markets remain weak and we anticipate housing starts in 2011 to be a flat versus 2010. This is another market where we continue to work on opportunities for more energy-efficient material as well as additional penetration in the commercial market. 
Now I'd like to update you on the Danisco acquisition. The acquisition represented about 3 percentage points of our sales growth in the quarter. We are making outstanding progress on the integration and thanks to our planning process that began in January with the formation of a fully dedicated integration team. They laid the groundwork to prepare for day 1 business continuity, coupled with a detailed engagement plan to integrate the organizations and, most importantly, to deliver on the cost and revenues energy. 
So on Day One, we are more than ready. And the leadership team kicked up a welcome week we visited innovation centers lab, offices, manufacturing plants across the globe, personally reaching more than 2/3 of the Danisco and DuPont employees to part of Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences businesses. The meetings were led by Danisco and DuPont executives and conveyed a consistent message of collaboration, innovation and sustainable growth.
The integration team is working at day by day, and is on track versus the plan. The goal in synergies are fully transparent and the business leadership is accountable; to deliver and build our competitive advantage. And while the integration work is well underway, we are now reporting combined financials starting with 1 month of sales data in the mix this quarter. Clearly, we're adding 2 very attractive businesses to our portfolio that are consistent with DuPont's growth strategy and squarely in the sweet spot of 2 mega trends, exceeding growing population in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.
Now let's move on to the bottom line for the 22nd quarter. Earnings were $1.37 per share, excluding significant items, up 17% versus last year on an underlying basis. At the segment level, pretax operating income was up 20% x items. Earnings benefited from solid segment performance particularly of strong occlusion to the Northern Hemisphere planting season, as well as price increases significantly outpacing dryer raw material, energy and food cost in our industrial businesses. Furthermore, we remain vigilant with our focus on productivity with respect to fixed cost, variable cost and working capital and are tracking ahead of our full year target in these 3 areas. 
So with that, I will now turn the call over to Nick."
268053,118466537,147658,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and benefited from the diversity and the strength of our portfolio. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation",1326,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and benefited from the diversity and the strength of our portfolio. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation that we've laid over the last 2 years, focusing on innovation, productivity and differential portfolio management. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, and let's start with Slide 3, which is the summary of the earnings per share and sales results.
Earnings per share were $1.37, as Ellen said, on an underlying basis compared to $1.17 in the prior year. Including significant items relating to the Danisco acquisition, earnings on a reported basis were $1.29 per share. Consolidated net sales of $10.3 billion were up 19% versus the prior year, comprised of 2% volume gains, 11% positive local price, 3% benefit from portfolio changes, primarily the Danisco acquisition, and 3% currency benefit. Volume was up in all major regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, reflecting our continued strong pricing discipline.
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the second quarter by looking at the earnings per share variance analysis shown on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.34 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be very proactive implementing price increases, pricing our new products for the enhanced value they deliver. 
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, second quarter raw material, energy and freight cost were up 13% versus last year's second quarter. For the full year, we expect this to be an increase of about 10% to 12% over 2010 and are expecting prices sequentially to peak in the third quarter and then begin to moderate into the fourth quarter.
Volume improvement resulted in incremental earnings benefit of $0.06 per share compared to the previous year. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately. While sales were up 19% this quarter, volume was dampened by strong Ag first quarter volume at the expense of the second quarter coupled with the impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami on the auto supply chains, impacting our Performance Materials and Performance Coatings businesses. We're having good success with DuPont Production Systems capacity release projects. And for the full year, we're anticipating company volumes to be about 5% increase over prior year. 
Continuing with our variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Again, excluding currency volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.19 per share versus last year. This includes our actions in the second quarter to support growth such as our increased investments in Ag or the new Kevlar plant that we added in the Cooper River, the Kevlar expansion at Circleville along with other very specific R&D and marketing initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day in December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we are well on track to meeting this commitment with actual fixed cost productivity of more than $180 million for the first half of 2011. 
Year-over-year, currency was a benefit of $0.07 in the quarter and $0.08 for the first half. At current exchange rates, currency would continue as a tailwind for us during the second half of this year. The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.02 variance, and this is principally due to the absence of some prior year asset sales. Included in this variance is farmer earnings, which were $80 million this quarter versus $70 million the prior year. Our full year 2011 estimate for farmer pretax is now about $230 million, approximately $260 million less than that which we received in 2010. While second quarter Farmer earnings were higher than expected due to some inventory building in the supply chain, we anticipate that the second half of 2011 will return to those lower levels.
Next, on the waterfall, is higher shares outstanding, which reduced earnings by about $0.04 per share. On a fully diluted basis, we had 944 million average shares in the second quarter of 2011. In income tax on the earnings per share waterfall shows a negative $0.03. This base tax rate this quarter was 23% versus 21.5% in the second quarter last year and our guidance of 20% to 21%, creating a headwind of $0.05 a share versus guidance. We are updating full year base tax rate to the upper end of our previous range, which was 20% to 21%.
The last point on the earnings per share waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.01 on an underlying basis. We had previously estimated potential dilution in the full year reporting earnings of $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis for the Danisco acquisition. With the acquisition now complete, I'd like to update that today. We now estimate that Danisco will dilute earnings per share on a reported basis by $0.18 to $0.29 per share this year, which consists of really 2 pieces. First, we expect the underlying earnings contribution to be $0.05 positive for the full year 2011. This includes additional interest expense and the amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition. Secondly, we expect significant items associated with a transaction and cost to achieve these synergies, up about $0.23 to $0.34 range, which includes the $0.08 per share charge that we took this quarter. 
Through the graph depicting sales by region on Slide 5, and if you look there, you see we delivered strong performance in developing markets with sales up 29% in the second quarter as well as year-to-date.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash shown on Slide 6. Second quarter free cash flow was a $0.4 billion inflow with higher net income partially offset by increases in working capital to support the strong revenue growth and the capital spending for the expansion projects. At the end of the second quarter on a 12-month trailing basis versus second quarter 2010, we were able to increase our networking capital turnover ratio by about 11%. This all excludes the Danisco impact, thus reducing our working capital needs in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of working capital productivity this year. 
Our strong balance sheet continues to serve as well. We value our A, AA credit rating and we worked hard to maintain that associated metrics that support that rating. We announced our 428th consecutive quarterly dividend earlier this month. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
In summary, for the second quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started in the fourth quarter 2009 continued. This, along with our market-driven innovation, our pricing discipline, and our role at this focus on productivity, delivered strong quarterly results. 
Turning now to the second half of 2011. We expect the growth that we've seen in our businesses to continue but at a more moderate pace than we've experienced to date. As you'll hear from Karen, we continue to see strong demand globally across many of our businesses.
For the full 2011 output, DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. Therefore, we are raising our guidance from a range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share to $3.90 to $4.05 per share, excluding significant items. The main driver for the increase in our guidance is the stronger business results especially in businesses like Performance Chemicals, as well as in the developing markets. In addition, we see some benefit from currency with the weaker dollar. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Karen to review segment results. Karen?"

Starting with the Agriculture segment encompassing the Seed and Crop Protection businesses on Slide 7. Sales of $3 billion grew 10%, with 6% USB price gain and 4% volume growth. Earnings grew 11% to $826 million. First half sales of $6.5 bil",2078,"Thanks, Nick. Starting with the Agriculture segment encompassing the Seed and Crop Protection businesses on Slide 7. Sales of $3 billion grew 10%, with 6% USB price gain and 4% volume growth. Earnings grew 11% to $826 million. First half sales of $6.5 billion grew 15% with 9% higher volume, 5% USB price gains and 1% favorable impact of portfolio changes. Earnings increased 16% to $1.9 billion. 
Across all regions, our teams executed well, responding to market demands delivering solid volume growth in Seed and Crop Protection, good net price realization in Seeds as well as good integration of our PROaccess strategy. 
Reviewing the individual businesses, starting with Seeds. Second quarter sales grew to $2.2 billion, increasing 9% with first half sales growing to $4.9 billion, up 14%. Growth across both periods was underpinned by favorable contributions from volume, price and portfolio changes. While all regions contributed to Seeds sales growth, Right Product, Right Acre strategy in North America clearly carried the quarter and locked in share gains in both crops. The growth drivers in North America corn include the introduction and ramp-up of our newest hybrid and the launch of our AcreMax 1 refuge-in-the-bag product. 
To reiterate an exciting data point from the selling season, Optimum AcreMax 1 is on almost 4 million acres this summer. Growers have spoken with resounding endorsement of the product, and remember, this is our first in a line of integrated and reduced refuge product we will bring to the market. Our sales teams play demonstration plots of both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA product with key growers so they can experience the product this growing season. We received Canadian approvals last week for Optimum AcreMax making it the first integrated refuge BT corn product that targets above ground only to receive approval in the North America Seed marketplace. 
Our next important milestone is EPA approval, which we expect in the third quarter 2011 in time for the 2012 planting season. Growth drivers in North American soybeans are similar to those in corn. We focus on local product development, including new varieties that bring customers higher valued disease-resistant packages every year. Our PROaccess businesses are embracing our products not only converting their line to our products but also growing their footprint.
Moving to Europe. Increased corn sales in the quarter and for the half reflect a nice rebound of the Ag economy supporting net price gains coupled with an early start to the season with sales that significantly favored the first quarter. 
Moving to Crop Protection. Sales for the quarter and first half were up 11% and 16%, respectively. In both periods, higher volumes and USD prices more than offset the negative impact of portfolio changes. The business continues its pace to meet or beat industry growth founded on these new product introduction. On a product basis in the quarter, volume was up across disease and insect control product. Rynaxypyr continues its climb over $500 million in sales for full year 2011. On a regional basis, sales grew nicely in each region with the exception of weather-related loss materially in Canada.
Looking ahead to second half for the Agriculture segment. We expect sales growth of about 10% and modestly larger earnings losses as compared to same period previous year. Second half sales outlook anticipate a solid Southern Hemisphere season in both Crop Protection and Seed. Also consider their updated outlook, our investments supporting increased marketing efforts, R&D buildout and the registration and launch preparation of other new products from our robust pipeline as well as the absence of sales and earnings from the April 2011 divested business in Crop Protection. For the full year, we anticipate our execution against the plan will deliver low teens sales growth and 17% to 18% earnings growth. Our customer-focused innovation-centric plans will continue to underpin growth for the rest of 2011 and beyond.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 in Electronics and Communications segment. Sales of $891 million improved 36% compared to the same period last year, with 9% volume improvement and 27% higher prices primarily metal pass-through pricing. Pretax earnings of $103 million are $5 million lower than the same period last year. The segment had a onetime net cost in the quarter of about $20 million, associated with rapidly increasing metal prices that were not passed through. PV sales were up significantly and strong demand for smartphones and Tablet PCs also contributed. However, we did see PV sales soften toward the end of the quarter from channel inventory buildup as module production outpaced installation. The business continues its investment in capacity expansion and new products with a focus on innovation in the PV market.
For the second half, ENC sales are expected to be significantly above prior year, driven by the demand in PV and consumer electronics with earnings up moderately. We continue to anticipate PV market growth of near 15% for the full year with growth stronger toward the end of the year of the inventory of PV modules is expected to decline in the third quarter and stronger growth is expected in the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $123 million reflect the acquisition of Danisco's enzyme business in late May and 3 months of DuPont's commercial biomaterials businesses, which includes Sorona and Bio-PDO. This segment had pretax operating income of $10 million this quarter, including about $2 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. As a reminder, earnings include DuPont's relatively new biomaterials business, which is expected to grow towards our previously stated goal of 15% PTOI margin while continuing to invest for growth and Danisco's well-established high-margin enzyme businesses.
Danisco's businesses include Grain Processing, Animal Nutrition, Fabric & Household Care and Food Enzymes. We expect the combination of these businesses net of the amortization of purchased intangible to produce low double-digit margins on sales of about $600 million for the second half of 2011.
Turning now to Slide 10 in our Nutrition & Health segment, which encompasses Enablers, Bioactives and Solae soy ingredients. Sales of $486 million grew 64%, reflecting organic sales growth of 6% and the acquisition impact from the Danisco specialty food ingredients business. Earnings of $38 million reflected higher sales, more than offsetting higher cost, including about $7 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. The newly formed segment has a leadership position in the specialty food ingredients industry. The team is well on its way to integrate, streamline and transform. 
As an example of the progress towards their goal, Solae continues to improve productivity and enhance the product mix towards specialty products driving sales, earnings and margins higher in the quarter. As we look to the second half, the business has 3 key goals: first, to continue progress with sales and margin gains across the business; second, to continue focused integration efforts to execute on cost and sales synergies as we merge the businesses; and third, to utilize strong technology position to create growth through new products and applications.
Delivering against these goals, we anticipate second half sales of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Our ongoing expectation for top line growth of the combined segment is high single digits. Second half earnings will increase with higher sales, offset in part with raw material increases and about $45 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition in addition to growth investment and other onetime associated with the integration. Pretax margins will be mid-single digits inclusive of purchase accounting. 
Now let's turn to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. This segment delivered $2 billion in sales this quarter, an increase of 27% due predominantly to price and robust demand for our offerings. Pretax earnings grew 84% to $503 million with margins expanding by an impressive 780 basis points. This performance has delivered despite weather-related supply disruptions for industrial chemicals due to flooding in the Midwest early in the quarter.
As we've described in previous quarters, this is a broad-based story that includes not only TiO2 but also refrigerants, fluoropolymers and industrial chemical. For example, we saw tremendous demand for our fluoropolymer materials in cabling and electronics, as well as industrial chemicals like cyanide for precious metal mining. Likewise, the market's strong demand for TiO2 continues, driven by robust growth in developing markets particularly Asia. As a result, we continue to sell every pound of TiO2 we can make and we are proceeding well with our 350 kilo ton capacity expansion that we announced in May. For the remainder of the year, we see no demand for this segment. Even with normal seasonality in products like refrigerants, Performance Chemicals sales are expected to be up significantly year-over-year and earnings up substantially. Given tight supply in certain product lines, our operations team have been working relentlessly to deliver improvement as we find ways to produce additional product.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 in Performance Coating. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased by 15% on 14% stronger pricing and 1% higher volume. Including currency benefits, the segment achieved double-digit pricing increases in all of its major market segments. Sales volume were up in heavy-duty truck market in North America and other industrial markets. Pretax operating income was $73 million, $2 million below prior year with benefit from stronger sales offset by 19% higher raw material energy and freight cost.
For the second half, we expect segment sales to be up moderately year-over-year with earnings up modestly. While autobuilds were down 1% in the quarter, builds are forecast to be up 6% in the second half with full year global builds expected to be up about 5%. This segment anticipate continued from material price pressure with actions in all market segments to maintain and improve margins.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 in Performance Materials. Segment sales of $1.7 billion were up 11% on 14% higher prices, offset by volume and a 2010 portfolio change. Pretax earnings of $254 million decreased 3% due to the impact of the Japan disaster, as well as the absence of a $27 million of benefit in 2010 from a gain on the sale of a business and an insurance recovery.
Excluding the 2010 onetime benefit, pretax operating income was up moderately despite higher raw materials. The Performance Materials key markets in automotive, electronics and packaging provided much of the lift for the quarter. Our lightweighting value proposition in automotive is resonating well, with our customers who are seeking to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency with high-performance plastics like Zytel PLUS. 
Meanwhile, supply remains tight for other Performance Polymers, which go into packaging and infrastructure applications. So for the second half, we expect modest sales growth with essentially flat pretax earnings. As a reminder, there was a $31 million benefit in the fourth quarter last year related to an acquisition as early termination of a supply agreement.
We see automotive builds recovering from the second quarter and stable packaging market. Overall, while raw material costs will remain elevated, we expect some moderation in the rate of growth. Using DuPont Production Systems to enhance asset productivity remains a key focus for this segment. 
Finally, let's move to Safety & Protection on Slide 14. Sales is $1 billion represented 21% growth with 8% from the MECS acquisition, 7% increased volume and 6% higher selling prices. On the earnings side, pretax operating income increased 18% to $143 million inclusive of growth investments in the quarter.
Diving into the details, organic sales growth came from our market-leading Kevlar, Nomex and Tyvek products going into industrial and public sector markets around the world. Our safety consulting business also continues the integration of MECS and I'm pleased to report that the acquisition is performing in line with our expectations.
Moving to construction. The market for both residential and commercial remains weak overall. Despite U.S. housing starts above consensus in June, there's still no sign of a sustained recovery for now. 
Turning our view to the second half, we expect sales to grow modestly with pretax operating income increasing substantially. Our industrial markets continue to recover. As a result, profitability climbed because our leverage improved. Additionally, we have accelerated our progress on our light tenure Kevlar capacity in South Carolina. The team at Cooper River is now ahead of schedule in producing our most advanced Kevlar for customer qualifications. This positions us very well for an end of your commercial startup and strong sales momentum heading into 2012.
Ellen, I'll turn the call back to you."

We've raised our full year guidance, increasing the midpoint by $0.23, and I just wanted to take a minute to emphasize a few key points about our outlook. First and foremost, the plan's executing well. We continue to deliver innovation and value new products, manufacturing processes and our productivity work. We constantly check our progress against the competition with the intent to outperform. Second, we continue to stay close to our customers and markets. Markets were always dynamic and we're seeing mixed signals at this point in time. 
An example is China. China markets are expected to slow in response to tightening fiscal policy measures taken by the government, and as a result, we expect the sales growth in China to slow to about 20% in the second half compared to 30% growth in the first half. On the other hand, we expect recovery in automotive markets with light vehicle builds up 6% to 7% in the second half. The key is to anticipate changes, continue to innovate and deliver value to our customers and be very disciplined about our execution.
Finally, we're excited about the Danisco acquisition and are well on our way to a very successful integration with outlined our expectation for about $0.05 benefit the underlying earnings for the full year and we'll come back to you with our 2012 expectations as part of our total company story at our Investor Day, which is planned for December 13 in Wilmington, Delaware, and we hope that you can join us then.

We have Optimum AcreMax 1 and the pending EPA approval on AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA. At this point, we sold 30% converted from triple to AcreMax 1 next year will probably come in around 55%.

Sales were up 19% with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and major region. Sales of developing markets grew 29%. Overall, we had excellent pricing performance driven by innovative new products and disciplined pricing actions across all businesses. Volume was up 2% for the quarter compared to 9% in the first quarter. 
For the full year, our expectation is for 5% organic volume growth. Factors affecting volume growth specific to the quarter, included the timing of a very strong start to the Ag season weighted towards the first quarter at the expense of the second, as well as the impact from the Japanese earthquake and flooding in the United States, which we will recover in the second half. In spite of these items that were very unique to the second quarter, our volume growth year-to-date is about 5% and we expect that trend line to continue through the second half. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through what we're seeing in the major markets we serve. Let's start with Agriculture, where we're wrapping up a very successful selling season in the northern hemisphere. In line with our right product, right acre-feet strategy, our sales team deliver a constant stream of new products that optimize performance and profitability field by field. Broad customer acceptance leads us to expect share gains in North American corn and soybeans is one measure to grow our validation this season, and we'll announce those share gains later this summer.  Healthy farm economics and high-value product innovations are the backbone of success for both our Seed and our Crop Protection businesses. 
Moving to Electronics. Photovoltaics is an important growth market for us. We expect module builds to be up nearly 15% this year, and as we always state, the road is a bit bumpy. In the first quarter, we saw Module inventory build as production outpaced demand. Now this situation continued into the second quarter and with the further increases in inventories, coupled with significant price and margin pressures on the supply chain. While the market has begun to adjust, we expect the correction to continue into the second half. Positive news came from Germany signaling that they will keep their existing subsidy level of tax and not make the anticipated cut in July as was once thought. 
We expect PV installations to be up significantly in the third quarter as compared to the second, helping to work off inventories and allow cell and module production to pick up again. PV installations in the second half should reach levels of about 11 to 12 gigawatts nearly double the rate from the first half on stronger demand in Germany, Italy, USA and China. 
Given silver price escalation and extreme volatility, we've launched a new generation of Solamet metallization paste called Solamet PV17x. Now this flat side silver paste is quickly establishing a new global standard for high efficiency and crystalline silicon solar cells, while also reducing silver paste consumption by about 10% on average, a significant achievement given the strong drive to higher efficiency and lower cost in the photovoltaic industry.
Looking at consumer electronics, we see continued strength in smartphones and tablet PCs since both applications use a number of advanced DuPont materials. Demand for plasma displays has been stable. For our automotive market, light vehicle builds were down 1%, about as expected as the world worked through supply chain issues related to the tragic earthquake in Japan. We believe most of the issues are behind the industry now and expect production to catch up in the third and fourth quarters with full year vehicle build, up about 5%.
In terms of market penetration, we see growing demand for vehicle lightweighting as OEMs around the world strive for improved vehicle efficiency. Today, in developed markets, roughly 15% to 18% of the average vehicle weight is plastic. Now this percentage is much lower in emerging markets and we see significant growth opportunities in both markets for lightweighting with the potential for developed markets to reach 25% in the next 5 years. Now DuPont is uniquely positioned with products like Zytel PLUS and strong applications development both in people and facilities. And they're well placed around the world to capitalize on this trend.
Finally, construction markets remain weak and we anticipate housing starts in 2011 to be a flat versus 2010. This is another market where we continue to work on opportunities for more energy-efficient material as well as additional penetration in the commercial market. 
Now I'd like to update you on the Danisco acquisition. The acquisition represented about 3 percentage points of our sales growth in the quarter. We're making outstanding progress on the integration, and thanks to our planning process that began in January with the formation of a fully dedicated integration team. They laid the groundwork to prepare for day 1 business continuity, coupled with a detailed engagement plan to integrate the organizations and, most importantly, to deliver on the cost and revenues synergy. 
So on Day 1 came, we were more than ready. And the leadership team kicked off a welcome week, we visited innovation centers labs, offices, manufacturing plants across the globe, personally reaching more than 2/3 of the Danisco and DuPont employees to our part of the Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences businesses. Now these council meetings were led by Danisco and DuPont executives and conveyed a consistent message of collaboration, innovation and sustainable growth. The integration team is working at day by day, cadence and is on track versus the plan. The goal and synergies are fully transparent and the business leadership is accountable to deliver and build our competitive advantage. 
And while the integration work is well underway, we are now reporting combined financials starting with 1 month of sales data in the mix this quarter. Clearly, we're adding 2 very attractive businesses to our portfolio that are consistent with DuPont's growth strategy and squarely in the sweet spot of 2 mega trends, exceeding the growing population in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.
Now let's move to the bottom line for the second quarter. Earnings were $1.37 per share, excluding significant items, up 17% versus last year on an underlying basis. At the segment level, pretax operating income was up 20% x items. Earnings benefited from solid segment performance particularly of strong conclusion to the northern hemisphere planning season, as well as price increases significantly outpacing dryer raw material, energy and freight cost in our industrial businesses. Furthermore, we remain vigilant with our focus on productivity with respect to fixed cost, variable cost and working capital and are tracking ahead of our full year targets in these 3 areas. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Nick."

I'm pleased to report that DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and benefited from the diversity and the strength of our portfolio. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation",1324,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and benefited from the diversity and the strength of our portfolio. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation that we've laid over the last 2 years, focusing on innovation, productivity and differential portfolio management. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, and let's start with Slide 3, which is the summary of the earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $1.37, as Ellen said, on an underlying basis compared to $1.17 in the prior year. Including significant items relating to the Danisco acquisition, earnings on a reported basis were $1.29 per share. Consolidated net sales of $10.3 billion were up 19% versus the prior year, comprised of 2% volume gains, 11% positive local price, 3% benefit from portfolio changes, primarily the Danisco acquisition and 3% currency benefit. Volume was up in all major regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, reflecting our continued strong pricing discipline.
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the second quarter by looking at the earnings per share variance analysis shown on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.34 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be very proactive implementing price increases. Pricing our new products for the enhanced value they deliver. 
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, second quarter raw material, energy and freight cost were up 13% versus last year's second quarter. For the full year, we expect this to be an increase of about 10% to 12% over 2010 and are expecting prices sequentially to peak in the third quarter and then begin to moderate into the fourth quarter.
Volume improvement resulted in incremental earnings benefit of $0.06 per share compared to the previous year. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately. While sales were up 19% this quarter, volume was dampened by strong Ag first quarter volumes at the expense of the second quarter coupled with the impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami on the auto supply chains, impacting our Performance Materials and Performance Coatings businesses. We're having good success with DuPont Production Systems capacity release projects. And for the full year, we're anticipating company volumes to be about 5% increase over prior year. 
Continuing with our variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Again, excluding currency volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.19 per share versus last year. This includes our actions in the second quarter to support growth such as our increased investments in Ag or the new Kevlar plant that we added in Cooper River, the Tedlar expansion at Circleville along with other very specific R&D and marketing initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day in December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we are well on track to meeting this commitment with actual fixed cost productivity of more than $180 million for the first half of 2011. 
Year-over-year, currency was a benefit of $0.07 in the quarter and $0.08 for the first half. At current exchange rates, currency would continue as a tailwind for us during the second half of this year. The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.02 variance, and this is principally due to the absence of some prior-year asset sales. Included in this variance is farmer earnings, which were $80 million this quarter versus $70 million the prior year. Our full year 2011 estimate for farmer pretax is now about $230 million, approximately $260 million less than that, which we received in 2010. While second quarter farmer earnings were higher than expected due to some inventory building in the supply chain, we anticipate that the second half of 2011 will return to those lower levels.
Next, on the waterfall, is higher shares outstanding, which reduced earnings by about $0.04 per share. On a fully diluted basis, we had 944 million average shares in the second quarter of 2011. In income tax on the earnings per share waterfall shows a negative $0.03. This base tax rate this quarter was 23% versus 21.5% in the second quarter of last year and our guidance of 20% to 21%, creating a headwind of $0.05 a share versus guidance. We are updating full year base tax rate to the upper end of our previous range, which was 20% to 21%.
The last point on the earnings per share waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.01 on an underlying basis. We had previously estimated potential dilution in the full year reporting earnings of $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis for the Danisco acquisition. With the acquisition now complete, I'd like to update that today. We now estimate that Danisco will dilute earnings per share on a reported basis by $0.18 to $0.29 per share this year, which consists of really 2 pieces. First, we expect the underlying earnings contribution to be $0.05 positive for the full year 2011. This includes additional interest expense and the amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition. Secondly, we expect significant items associated with the transaction and cost to achieve these synergies, up about $0.23 to $0.34 range, which includes the $0.08 per share charge that we took this quarter. 
Through the graph depicting sales by region on Slide 5. And if you look there, you see we delivered strong performance in developing markets with sales up 29% in the second quarter as well as year-to-date.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash shown on Slide 6. Second quarter free cash flow was a $0.4 billion inflow with higher net income partially offset by increases in working capital to support the strong revenue growth and the capital spending for the expansion projects. At the end of the second quarter on a 12-month trailing basis versus second quarter 2010, we were able to increase our net working capital turnover ratio by about 11%. This all excludes the Danisco impact, thus reducing our working capital needs in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of working capital productivity this year. 
Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A, AA credit rating and we work hard to maintain that associated metrics that support that rating. We announced our 428th consecutive quarterly dividend earlier this month. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
In summary, for the second quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started in the fourth quarter 2009 continued. This, along with our market-driven innovation, our pricing discipline, and our relentless focus on productivity, delivered strong quarterly results. 
Turning now to the second half of 2011. We expect the growth that we've seen in our businesses to continue, but at a more moderate pace than we've experienced to date. As you'll hear from Karen, we continue to see strong demand globally across many of our businesses.
For the full 2011 outlook, DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. Therefore, we are raising our guidance from a range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share to $3.90 to $4.05 per share, excluding significant items. The main driver for the increase in our guidance is the stronger business results especially in businesses like Performance Chemicals, as well as in the developing markets. In addition, we see some benefit from currency with the weaker dollar. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Karen to review segment results. Karen?"
268053,118466537,147823,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Starting with the Agriculture segment encompassing the Seed and Crop Protection businesses on Slide 7. Sales of $3 billion grew 10%, with 6% USD price gain and 4% volume growth. Earnings grew 11% to $826 million. First half sales of $6.5 bil",2086,"Thanks, Nick. Starting with the Agriculture segment encompassing the Seed and Crop Protection businesses on Slide 7. Sales of $3 billion grew 10%, with 6% USD price gain and 4% volume growth. Earnings grew 11% to $826 million. First half sales of $6.5 billion grew 15% with 9% higher volume, 5% USD price gains and 1% favorable impact of portfolio changes. Earnings increased 16% to $1.9 billion. 
Across all regions, our teams executed well, responding to market demands, delivering solid volume growth in Seed and Crop Protection, good net price realization in Seeds, as well as good integration of our PROaccess strategy. 
Reviewing the individual businesses, starting with Seeds. Second quarter sales grew to $2.2 billion, increasing 9% with first half sales growing to $4.9 billion, up 14%. Growth across both periods was underpinned by favorable contributions from volume, price and portfolio changes. While all regions contributed to seed sales growth, right product, right acre strategy in North America clearly carried the quarter and locked in share gains in both crops. The growth drivers in North America corn include the introduction and ramp-up of our newest hybrids and the launch of our AcreMax 1 refuge-in-the-bag product. 
To reiterate an exciting data point from the selling season, Optimum AcreMax 1 is on almost 4 million acres this summer. Growers have spoken with resounding endorsement of the product. And remember, this is our first in a line of integrated and reduced refuge products we will bring to the market. Our sales teams place demonstration plots of both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA product with key growers so they can experience the product this growing season. We received Canadian approvals last week for Optimum AcreMax making it the first integrated refuge Bt corn product that targets above-ground only pass to receive approval in the North America seed marketplace. 
Our next important milestone is EPA approval, which we expect in the third quarter 2011 in time for the 2012 planting season. Growth drivers in North American soybeans are similar to those in corn. We focus on local product development, including new varieties that bring customers higher valued disease-resistant packages every year. Our PROaccess businesses are embracing our products not only converting their line to our products but also growing their footprint.
Moving to Europe. Increased corn sales in the quarter and for the half reflect a nice rebound of the Ag economy supporting net price gains coupled with an early start to the season with sales that significantly favored the first quarter. 
Moving to Crop Protection. Sales for the quarter and first half were up 11% and 16%, respectively. In both periods, higher volumes and USD prices more than offset the negative impact of portfolio changes. The business continues its pace to meet or beat industry growth founded on these new product introduction. On a product basis in the quarter, volume was up across weed-, disease- and insect-controlled products. Rynaxypyr continues its climb over $500 million in sales for full year 2011. On a regional basis, sales grew nicely in each region with the exception of weather-related loss materially [ph] growth in Canada.
Looking ahead to second half for the Agriculture segment. We expect sales growth of about 10% and modestly larger earnings losses as compared to same period previous year. Second half sales outlook anticipate a solid southern hemisphere season in both Crop Protection and Seed. Also considered in our updated outlook, our investments supporting increased marketing efforts, R&D buildout and the registration and launch preparation of other new products from our robust pipeline, as well as the absence of sales and earnings from the April 2011 divested business in Crop Protection. For the full year, we anticipate our execution against the plan, we'll deliver a low-teens sales growth and 17% to 18% earnings growth. Our customer-focused, innovation-centric plans will continue to underpin growth for the rest of 2011 and beyond.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 in Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $891 million improved 36% compared to the same period last year, with 9% volume improvement and 27% higher prices primarily metals pass through pricing. Pretax earnings of $103 million are $5 million lower than the same period last year. The segment had a onetime net cost in the quarter of about $20 million, associated with rapidly increasing metal prices that were not passed through. PV sales were up significantly and strong demand for smartphones and Tablet PCs also contributed. However, we did see PV sales soften toward the end of the quarter from channel inventory buildup as module production outpaced installation. The business continues its investment in capacity expansion and new products with a focus on innovation in the PV market.
For the second half, E&C sales are expected to be significantly above prior year, driven by the demand in PV and consumer electronics with earnings up moderately. We continue to anticipate PV market growth of near 15% for the full year with growth stronger toward the end of the year as the inventory of PV modules is expected to decline in the third quarter and stronger growth is expected in the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $123 million reflect the acquisition of Danisco's enzyme business in late May and 3 months of DuPont's commercial biomaterials businesses, which includes Sorona and Bio-PDO. This segment had pretax operating income of $10 million this quarter, including about $2 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. As a reminder, earnings include DuPont's relatively new biomaterials business, which is expected to grow towards our previously stated goal of 15% PTOI margin while continuing to invest for growth and Danisco's well-established, high-margin enzyme businesses.
Danisco's businesses include Grain Processing, Animal Nutrition, Fabric & Household Care and Food Enzymes. We expect the combination of these businesses net of the amortization of purchased intangible to produce low-double digit margins on sales of about $600 million for the second half of 2011.
Turning now to Slide 10 in our Nutrition & Health segment, which encompasses Enablers, Bioactive and Solae soy ingredients. Sales of $486 million grew 64%, reflecting organic sales growth of 6% and the acquisition impact from the Danisco specialty food ingredients business. Earnings of $38 million reflected higher sales, more than offsetting higher cost, including about $7 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. The newly formed segment has a leadership position in the specialty foods ingredient industry. The team is well on its way to integrate, streamline and transform. 
As an example of the progress towards their goal, Solae continues to improve productivity and enhance the product mix towards specialty products driving sales, earnings and margins higher in the quarter. As we look to the second half, the business has 3 key goals: First, to continue progress with sales and margin gains across the business; second, to continue focused integration efforts to execute on cost and sales synergies as we merge the businesses; and third, to utilize strong technology position to create growth through new products and applications.
Delivering against these goals, we anticipate second half sales of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Our ongoing expectation for top line growth of the combined segment is high-single digits. Second half earnings will increase with higher sales, offset in part with raw material increases and about $45 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition, in addition to growth investment and other onetime associated with the integration. Pretax margins will be mid-single digits inclusive of purchase accounting. 
Now let's turn to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. This segment delivered $2 billion in sales this quarter, an increase of 27% due predominantly to price and robust demand for our offerings. Pretax earnings grew 84% to $503 million with margins expanding by an impressive 780 basis points. This performance has delivered despite weather-related supply disruptions for industrial chemicals due to flooding in the Midwest early in the quarter.
As we've described in previous quarters, this is a broad-based story that includes not only TiO2 but also refrigerants, fluoropolymers and industrial chemical. For example, we saw a tremendous demand for our fluoropolymer materials in cabling and electronics, as well as industrial chemicals like cyanide for precious metal mining. Likewise, the market's strong demand for TiO2 continues, driven by robust growth in developing markets particularly Asia. As a result, we continue to sell every pound of TiO2 we can make and we're proceeding well with our 350 kilo ton capacity expansion that we announced in May. 
For the remainder of the year, we see no let up in demand for this segment. Even with normal seasonality in products like refrigerants, Performance Chemicals sales are expected to be up significantly year-over-year and earnings up substantially. Given tight supply in certain product lines, our operations' team have been working relentlessly to deliver uptime improvements as we find ways to produce additional product.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 in Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased by 15% on 14% stronger pricing and 1% higher volume. Including currency benefits, the segment achieved double-digit pricing increases in all of its major market segments. Sales volume were up in heavy-duty truck market in North America and other industrial market. Pretax operating income was $73 million, $2 million below prior year with benefit from stronger sales offset by 19% higher raw material energy and freight cost.
For the second half, we expect segment sales to be up moderately year-over-year with earnings up modestly. While auto builds were down 1% in the second quarter, builds are forecast to be up 6% in the second half with full year global builds expected to be up about 5%. This segment anticipate continued raw material price pressure with actions in all market segments to maintain and improve margins.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 in Performance Materials. Segment sales of $1.7 billion were up 11% on 14% higher prices, offset by volume and a 2010 portfolio change. Pretax earnings of $254 million decreased 3% due to the impact of the Japan disaster, as well as the absence of a $27 million benefit in 2010 from a gain on the sale of a business and an insurance recovery.
Excluding the 2010 onetime benefit, pretax operating income was up moderately despite higher raw materials. Performance Materials key markets in automotive, electronics and packaging provided much of the lift for the quarter. Our lightweighting value proposition in automotive is resonating well, with our customers who are seeking to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency with high-performance plastics like Zytel PLUS. 
Meanwhile, supplies remains tight for other Performance Polymers, which go into packaging and infrastructure application. But for the second half, we expect modest sales growth with essentially flat pretax earnings. As a reminder, there was a $31 million benefit in the fourth quarter of last year related to an acquisition and early termination of a supply agreement.
We see automotive builds recovering from the second quarter and stable packaging market. Overall, while raw material costs will remain elevated, we expect some moderation in the rate of growth. Using DuPont Production Systems to enhance asset productivity remains a key focus for this segment. 
Finally, let's move to Safety & Protection on Slide 14. Sales is $1 billion represented 21% growth with 8% from the MECS acquisition, 7% increased volume and 6% higher selling prices. On the earnings side, pretax operating income increased 18% to $143 million inclusive of growth investments in the quarter.
Diving into the details, organic sales growth came from our market-leading Kevlar, Nomex and Tyvek products going into industrial and public sector markets around the world. Our safety consulting business also continues the integration of MECS and I'm pleased to report that the acquisition is performing in line with our expectation.
Moving to construction. The market for both residential and commercial remains weak overall. Despite U.S. housing starts above consensus in June, there's little sign of a sustained recovery for now. 
Turning our view to the second half, we expect sales to grow modestly with pretax operating income increasing substantially. Our industrial markets continue to recover. As a result, profitability climbs because our leverage improved. Additionally, we have accelerated our progress on our light tenure Kevlar capacity in South Carolina. The team at Cooper River is now ahead of schedule in producing our most advanced Kevlar for customer qualifications. This positions us very well for an end of your commercial startup and a strong sales momentum heading into 2012. Ellen, I'll turn the call back to you."

First and foremost, DuPont is executing well. We continued to deliver innovation and value in new products, manufacturing processes and our productivity work. We constantly check our progress against the competition with the intent to outperform. 
Second, we continue to stay close to our customers and markets. Markets were always dynamic and we're seeing mixed signals at this point in time. An example is China. China markets are expected to slow in response to tightening fiscal policy measures taken by the government. And as a result, we expect DuPont sales growth in China to slow to about 20% in the second half compared to 30% growth in the first half. On the other hand, we expect recovery in automotive markets with light vehicle builds up 6% to 7% in the second half. The key is to anticipate changes, continue to innovate and deliver value to our customers, and be very disciplined about our execution.
Finally, we're excited about the Danisco acquisition and are well on our way to a very successful integration. We've outlined our expectation for about $0.05 benefit to underlying earnings for the full year, and we'll come back to you with our 2012 expectations as part of our total company story at our Investor Day, which is planned for December 13 in Wilmington, Delaware.

Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a number of risks and assumptions.
We urge you to review DuPont's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. 
We will also refer to non-GAAP measures and request that you refer to the reconciliations to GAAP statements provided with our earnings news release and on our website. And finally, we have posted supplemental information on our website that we hope is helpful to your understanding of our company's performance. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ellen."

I'm pleased with the continued strong momentum from our second quarter results. Sales were up 19% with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and major region. Sales of developing markets gre",1143,"Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with the continued strong momentum from our second quarter results. Sales were up 19% with double-digit increases in every reporting segment and major region. Sales of developing markets grew 29%. Overall, we had excellent pricing performance driven by innovative new products and disciplined pricing actions across all businesses. Volume was up 2% for the quarter compared to 9% in the first quarter. 
For the full year, our expectation is for 5% organic volume growth. Factors affecting volume growth specific to the quarter, included the timing of a very strong start to the Ag season weighted towards the first quarter at the expense of the second, as well as the impact from the Japanese earthquake and flooding in the United States, which we will recover in the second half. In spite of these items that were very unique to the second quarter, our volume growth year-to-date is about 5% and we expect that trend line to continue through the second half. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to walk through what we're seeing in the major markets we serve. Let's start with Agriculture, where we're wrapping up a very successful selling season in the northern hemisphere. In line with our right product, right acre-feet strategy, our sales team deliver a constant stream of new products that optimize [indiscernible] performance and profitability field by field. Broad customer acceptance leads us to expect share gains in North American corn and soybeans is one measure of grower validation this season, and we'll announce those share gains later this summer.  Healthy farm economics and high-value product innovations are the backbone of success for both our Seed and our Crop Protection businesses. 
Moving to Electronics. Photovoltaics is an important growth market for us. We expect module builds to be up nearly 15% this year, and as we always state, the road is a bit bumpy. In the first quarter, we saw Module inventory build as production outpaced demand. Now this situation continued into the second quarter and led the further increases in inventories, coupled with significant price and margin pressures on the supply chain. While the market has begun to adjust, we expect the correction to continue into the second half. Positive news came from Germany signaling that they will keep their existing subsidy level intact and not make the anticipated cut in July as was once thought. 
We expect PV installations to be up significantly in the third quarter as compared to the second, helping to work off inventories and allow cell and module production to pick up again. PV installations in the second half should reach levels of about 11 to 12 gigawatts nearly double the rate from the first half on stronger demand in Germany, Italy, USA and China. 
Given silver price escalation and extreme volatility, we've launched a new generation of Solamet metallization paste called Solamet PV17x. Now this front side silver paste is quickly establishing a new global standard for high efficiency in crystalline silicon solar cells, while also reducing silver paste consumption by about 10% on average, a significant achievement given the strong drive to higher efficiency and lower cost in the photovoltaic industry.
Looking at consumer electronics, we see continued strength in smartphones and tablet PCs since both applications use a number of advanced DuPont materials. Demand for plasma displays has been stable. For automotive markets, light vehicle builds were down 1%, about as expected as the world worked through supply chain issues related to the tragic earthquake in Japan. We believe most of the issues are behind the industry now and expect production to catch up in the third and fourth quarters with full year vehicle builds up about 5%.
In terms of market penetration, we see growing demand for vehicle lightweighting as OEMs around the world strive for improved vehicle efficiency. Today, in developed markets, roughly 15% to 18% of the average vehicle weight is plastic. Now this percentage is much lower in emerging markets and we see significant growth opportunities in both markets for lightweighting with the potential for developed markets to reach 25% in the next 5 years. Now DuPont is uniquely positioned with products like Zytel PLUS and strong applications development both in people and facilities. And they're well placed around the world to capitalize on this trend.
Finally, construction markets remain weak and we anticipate housing starts in 2011 to be flat versus 2010. This is another market where we continue to work on opportunities for more energy-efficient materials as well as additional penetration in the commercial market. 
Now I'd like to update you on the Danisco acquisition. The acquisition represented about 3 percentage points of our sales growth in the quarter. We're making outstanding progress on the integration, and thanks to a planning process that began in January with the formation of a fully dedicated integration team. They laid the groundwork to prepare for day 1 business continuity, coupled with a detailed engagement plan to integrate the organizations and, most importantly, to deliver on the cost and revenues synergy. 
So when Day 1 came, we were more than ready. And the leadership team kicked off a welcome week, we visited innovation centers labs, offices, manufacturing plants across the globe, personally reaching more than 2/3 of the Danisco and DuPont employees who are part of the Nutrition & Health and Industrial Biosciences businesses. Now these townhall meetings were led by Danisco and DuPont executives and conveyed a consistent message of collaboration, innovation and sustainable growth. The integration team is working at day by day, cadence and is on track versus the plan. The goals and synergies are fully transparent and the business leadership is accountable to deliver and build on competitive advantage. 
And while the integration work is well underway, we are now reporting combined financials starting with 1 month of sales data in the mix this quarter. Clearly, we're adding 2 very attractive businesses to our portfolio that are consistent with DuPont's growth strategy and squarely in the sweet spot of 2 mega trends, feeding a growing population and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.
Now let's move to the bottom line for the second quarter. Earnings were $1.37 per share, excluding significant items, up 17% versus last year on an underlying basis. At the segment level, pre-tax operating income was up 20% x items. Earnings benefited from solid segment performance particularly of strong conclusion to the northern hemisphere planning season, as well as price increases significantly outpacing higher raw material, energy and freight cost in our industrial businesses. Furthermore, we remain vigilant with our focus on productivity with respect to fixed cost, variable cost and working capital and are tracking ahead of our full year targets in these 3 areas. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Nick."

I'm pleased to report that DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and benefited from the diversity and the strength of our portfolio. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation",1325,"Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that DuPont delivered yet another strong quarter and benefited from the diversity and the strength of our portfolio. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation that we've laid over the last 2 years, focusing on innovation, productivity and differential portfolio management. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, and let's start with Slide 3, which is the summary of the earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $1.37, as Ellen said, on an underlying basis compared to $1.17 in the prior year. Including significant items relating to the Danisco acquisition, earnings on a reported basis were $1.29 per share. Consolidated net sales of $10.3 billion were up 19% versus the prior year, comprised of 2% volume gains, 11% positive local price, 3% benefit from portfolio changes, primarily the Danisco acquisition and 3% currency benefit. Volume was up in all major regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, reflecting our continued strong pricing discipline.
Now let's turn to a corporate view of the second quarter by looking at the earnings per share variance analysis shown on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable cost, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.34 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be very proactive implementing price increases. Pricing our new products for the enhanced value they deliver. 
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, second quarter raw material, energy and freight cost were up 13% versus last year's second quarter. For the full year, we expect this to be an increase of about 10% to 12% over 2010 and are expecting prices sequentially to peak in the third quarter and then begin to moderate into the fourth quarter.
Volume improvement resulted in incremental earnings benefit of $0.06 per share compared to the previous year. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately. While sales were up 19% this quarter, volume was dampened by a strong Ag first quarter volumes at the expense of the second quarter coupled with the impact of the Japan earthquake and tsunami on the auto supply chains, impacting our Performance Materials and Performance Coatings businesses. We're having good success with DuPont Production Systems capacity release projects. And for the full year, we're anticipating company volumes to be about 5% increase over prior year. 
Continuing with our variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Again, excluding currency volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.19 per share versus last year. This includes our actions in the second quarter to support growth such as our increased investments in Ag or the new Kevlar plant that we've added in Cooper River, the Tedlar expansion at Circleville along with other very specific R&D and marketing initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day in December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we are well on track to meeting this commitment with actual fixed cost productivity of more than $180 million for the first half of 2011. 
Year-over-year, currency was a benefit of $0.07 in the quarter and $0.08 for the first half. At current exchange rates, currency would continue as a tailwind for us during the second half of this year. The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.02 variance, and this is principally due to the absence of some prior-year asset sales. Included in this variance is farmer earnings, which were $80 million this quarter versus $70 million the prior year. Our full year 2011 estimate for farmer pre-tax is now about $230 million, approximately $260 million less than that which we received in 2010. While second quarter farmer earnings were higher than expected due to some inventory building in the supply chain, we anticipate that the second half of 2011 will return to those lower levels.
Next, on the waterfall, is higher shares outstanding, which reduced earnings by about $0.04 per share. On a fully diluted basis, we had 944 million average shares in the second quarter of 2011. In income tax on the earnings per share waterfall shows a negative $0.03. This base tax rate this quarter was 23% versus 21.5% in the second quarter of last year and our guidance of 20% to 21%, creating a headwind of $0.05 a share versus guidance. We are updating full year base tax rate to the upper end of our previous range, which was 20% to 21%.
The last point on the earnings per share waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.01 on an underlying basis. We had previously estimated potential dilution in the full year reporting earnings of $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis for the Danisco acquisition. With the acquisition now complete, I'd like to update that today. We now estimate that Danisco will dilute earnings per share on a reported basis by $0.18 to $0.29 per share this year, which consists of really 2 pieces. First, we expect the underlying earnings contribution to be $0.05 positive for the full year 2011. This includes additional interest expense and the amortization expense associated with intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition. Secondly, we expect significant items associated with the transaction and cost to achieve these synergies, of about $0.23 to $0.34 range, which includes the $0.08 per share charge that we took this quarter. 
Through the graph depicting sales by region on Slide 5. And if you look there, you see we delivered strong performance in developing markets with sales up 29% in the second quarter as well as year-to-date.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash shown on Slide 6. Second quarter free cash flow was a $0.4 billion inflow with higher net income partially offset by increases in working capital to support the strong revenue growth and the capital spending for the expansion projects. At the end of the second quarter on a 12-month trailing basis versus second quarter 2010, we were able to increase our net working capital turnover ratio by about 11%. This all excludes the Danisco impact, thus reducing our working capital needs in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of working capital productivity this year. 
Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A, AA credit rating and we work hard to maintain that associated metrics that support that rating. We announced our 428th consecutive quarterly dividend earlier this month. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and to return excess cash to our shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
In summary, for the second quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started in the fourth quarter 2009 continued. This, along with our market-driven innovation, our pricing discipline, and our relentless focus on productivity, delivered strong quarterly results. 
Turning now to the second half of 2011. We expect the growth that we've seen in our businesses to continue, but at a more moderate pace than we've experienced to date. As you'll hear from Karen, we continue to see strong demand globally across many of our businesses.
For the full 2011 outlook, DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. Therefore, we are raising our guidance from a range of $3.65 to $3.85 per share to $3.90 to $4.05 per share, excluding significant items. The main driver for the increase in our guidance is the stronger business results especially in businesses like Performance Chemicals, as well as in the developing markets. In addition, we see some benefit from currency with the weaker dollar. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Karen to review segment results. Karen?"
268053,118466537,147977,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Starting with the Agriculture segment encompassing the Seed and Crop Protection businesses on Slide 7. Sales of $3 billion grew 10%, with 6% USD price gains and 4% volume growth. Earnings grew 11% to $826 million. First half sales of $6.5 bi",2084,"Thanks, Nick. Starting with the Agriculture segment encompassing the Seed and Crop Protection businesses on Slide 7. Sales of $3 billion grew 10%, with 6% USD price gains and 4% volume growth. Earnings grew 11% to $826 million. First half sales of $6.5 billion grew 15% with 9% higher volume, 5% USD price gains and 1% favorable impact of portfolio changes. Earnings increased 16% to $1.9 billion. 
Across all regions, our teams executed well, responding to market demands, delivering solid volume growth in Seeds and Crop Protection, good net price realization in Seeds, as well as good integration of our PROaccess strategy. 
Reviewing the individual businesses, starting with Seeds. Second quarter sales grew to $2.2 billion, increasing 9% with first half sales growing to $4.9 billion, up 14%. Growth across both periods was underpinned by favorable contributions from volume, price and portfolio changes. While all regions contributed to seed sales growth, right product, right acre strategy in North America clearly carried the quarter and locked in share gains in both crops. The growth drivers in North America corn include the introduction and ramp-up of our newest hybrids and the launch of our AcreMax 1 refuge-in-the-bag product. 
To reiterate an exciting data point from the selling season, Optimum AcreMax 1 is on almost 4 million acres this summer. Growers have spoken with resounding endorsement of the product. And remember, this is our first in a line of integrated and reduced refuge products we will bring to the market. Our sales teams place demonstration plots of both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA product with key growers so they can experience the product this growing season. We received Canadian approvals last week for Optimum AcreMax making it the first integrated refuge Bt corn product that targets above-ground only pests to receive approval in the North American seed marketplace. 
Our next important milestone is EPA approval, which we expect in the third quarter 2011 in time for the 2012 planning season. Growth drivers in North American soybeans are similar to those in corn. We focus on local product development, including new varieties that bring customers higher valued disease-resistant packages every year. Our PROaccess businesses are embracing our products not only converting their line to our products but also growing their footprint.
Moving to Europe. Increased corn sales in the quarter and for the half reflect a nice rebound of the Ag economy supporting net price gains coupled with an early start to the season with sales that significantly favored the first quarter. 
Moving to Crop Protection. Sales for the quarter and first half were up 11% and 16%, respectively. In both periods, higher volumes and USD prices more than offset the negative impact of portfolio changes. The business continues its pace to meet or beat industry growth founded on these new product introductions. On a product basis in the quarter, volume was up across weed-, disease- and insect-controlled products. Rynaxypyr continues its climb over $500 million in sales for full year 2011. On a regional basis, sales grew nicely in each region with the exception of weather-related loss cereal acres in Canada.
Looking ahead to second half for the Agriculture segment. We expect sales growth of about 10% and modestly larger earnings losses as compared to same period previous year. Second half sales outlook anticipates a solid southern hemisphere season in both Crop Protection and Seed. Also considered in our updated outlook, are investments supporting increased marketing efforts, R&D buildout and the registration and launch preparation of other new products from our robust pipeline, as well as the absence of sales and earnings from the April 2011 divested business in Crop Protection. For the full year, we anticipate our execution against the plan, will deliver low-teens sales growth and 17% to 18% earnings growth. Our customer-focused, innovation-centric plans will continue to underpin growth for the rest of 2011 and beyond.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 in Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $891 million improved 36% compared to the same period last year, with 9% volume improvement and 27% higher prices primarily metals pass through pricing. Pre-tax earnings of $103 million are $5 million lower than the same period last year. The segment had a onetime net cost in the quarter of about $20 million, associated with rapidly increasing metal prices that were not passed through. PV sales were up significantly and strong demand for smartphones and Tablet PCs also contributed. However, we did see PV sales soften toward the end of the quarter from channel inventory buildup as module production outpaced installation. The business continues its investment in capacity expansions and new products with the focus on innovation in the PV market.
For the second half, E&C sales are expected to be significantly above prior year, driven by the demand in PV and consumer electronics with earnings up moderately. We continue to anticipate PV market growth of near 15% for the full year with growth stronger toward the end of the year as the inventory of PV modules is expected to decline in the third quarter and stronger growth is expected in the fourth quarter.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $123 million reflect the acquisition of Danisco's enzyme business in late May and 3 months of DuPont's commercial biomaterials businesses, which includes Sorona and Bio-PDO. This segment had pre-tax operating income of $10 million this quarter, including about $2 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. As a reminder, earnings include DuPont's relatively new biomaterials business, which is expected to grow towards our previously stated goal of 15% PTOI margin while continuing to invest for growth and Danisco's well-established, high-margin enzyme businesses.
Danisco's businesses include Grain Processing, Animal Nutrition, Fabric & Household Care and Food Enzymes. We expect the combination of these businesses net of the amortization of purchased intangibles to produce low-double digit margins on sales of about $600 million for the second half of 2011.
Turning now to Slide 10 in our Nutrition & Health segment, which encompasses Enablers, Bioactive and Solae soy ingredients. Sales of $486 million grew 64%, reflecting organic sales growth of 6% and the acquisition impact from the Danisco specialty food ingredients business. Earnings of $38 million reflected higher sales, more than offsetting higher cost, including about $7 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition. The newly formed segment has a leadership position in the specialty foods ingredient industry. The team is well on its way to integrate, streamline and transform. 
As an example of the progress towards their goal, Solae continues to improve productivity and enhance the product mix towards specialty products driving sales, earnings and margins higher in the quarter. As we look to the second half, the business has 3 key goals: First, to continue progress with sales and margin gains across the business; second, to continue focused integration efforts to execute on cost and sales synergies as we merge the businesses; and third, to utilize strong technology position to create growth through new products and applications.
Delivering against these goals, we anticipate second half sales of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion. Our ongoing expectation for top line growth of the combined segment is high-single digits. Second half earnings will increase with higher sales, offset in part with raw material increases and about $45 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition, in addition to growth investment and other onetime associated with the integration. Pre-tax margins will be mid-single digits inclusive of purchase accounting. 
Now let's turn to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. This segment delivered $2 billion in sales this quarter, an increase of 27% due predominantly to price and robust demand for our offerings. Pre-tax earnings grew 84% to $503 million with margins expanding by an impressive 780 basis points. This performance has delivered despite weather-related supply disruptions for industrial chemicals due to flooding in the Midwest early in the quarter.
As we've described in previous quarters, this is a broad-based story that includes not only TiO2 but also refrigerants, fluoropolymers and industrial chemical. For example, we saw tremendous demand for our fluoropolymer materials in cabling and electronics, as well as industrial chemicals like cyanide for precious metal mining. Likewise, the market's strong demand for TiO2 continues, driven by robust growth in developing markets particularly Asia. As a result, we continue to sell every pound of TiO2 we can make and we're proceeding well with our 350 kilo ton capacity expansion that we announced in May. 
For the remainder of the year, we see no let up in demand for this segment. Even with normal seasonality in products like refrigerants, Performance Chemicals sales are expected to be up significantly year-over-year and earnings up substantially. Given tight supply in certain product lines, our operations' teams have been working relentlessly to deliver uptime improvements as we find ways to produce additional product.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 in Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1.1 billion increased by 15% on 14% stronger pricing and 1% higher volume. Including currency benefits, the segment achieved double-digit pricing increases in all of its major market segments. Sales volumes were up in heavy-duty truck market in North America and other industrial market. Pre-tax operating income was $73 million, $2 million below prior year with benefit from stronger sales offset by 19% higher raw material energy and freight costs.
For the second half, we expect segment sales to be up moderately year-over-year with earnings up modestly. While auto builds were down 1% in the second quarter, builds are forecast to be up 6% in the second half with full year global builds expected to be up about 5%. This segment anticipate continued raw material price pressure with actions in all market segments to maintain and improve margins.
Now let's turn to Slide 13 in Performance Materials. Segment sales of $1.7 billion were up 11% on 14% higher prices, offset by volume and a 2010 portfolio change. Pre-tax earnings of $254 million decreased 3% due to the impact of the Japan disaster, as well as the absence of a $27 million benefit in 2010 from a gain on the sale of a business and an insurance recovery.
Excluding the 2010 onetime benefit, pre-tax operating income was up moderately despite higher raw materials. Performance Materials key markets in automotive, electronics and packaging provided much of the lift for the quarter. Our lightweighting value proposition in automotive is resonating well, with our customers who are seeking to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency with high-performance plastics like Zytel PLUS. 
Meanwhile, supplies remains tight for our other Performance Polymers, which go into packaging and infrastructure application. But for the second half, we expect modest sales growth with essentially flat pre-tax earnings. As a reminder, there was a $31 million benefit in the fourth quarter of last year related to an acquisition and early termination of a supply agreement.
We see automotive builds recovering from the second quarter and stabled packaging market. Overall, while raw material costs will remain elevated, we expect some moderation in the rate of growth. Using DuPont Production Systems to enhance asset productivity remains a key focus for this segment. 
Finally, let's move to Safety & Protection on Slide 14. Sales of $1 billion represented 21% growth with 8% from the MECS acquisition, 7% increased volume and 6% higher selling prices. On the earnings side, pre-tax operating income increased 18% to $143 million inclusive of growth investments in the quarter.
Diving into the details, organic sales growth came from our market-leading Kevlar, Nomex and Tyvek products going into industrial and public sector markets around the world. Our safety consulting business also continues the integration of MECS and I'm pleased to report that the acquisition is performing in line with our expectation.
Moving to construction. The market for both residential and commercial remains weak overall. Despite U.S. housing starts above consensus in June, there's little sign of a sustained recovery for now. 
Turning our view to the second half, we expect sales to grow modestly with pre-tax operating income increasing substantially. Our industrial markets continue to recover. As a result, profitability climbs because our leverage improves. Additionally, we have accelerated our progress on our light [indiscernible] Kevlar capacity in South Carolina. The team at Cooper River is now ahead of schedule in producing our most advanced Kevlar for customer qualifications. This positions us very well for an end of year commercial startup and a strong sales momentum heading into 2012. Ellen, I'll turn the call back to you."

Second, we continue to stay close to our customers and markets. Markets were always dynamic and we're seeing mixed signals at this point in time. An example is China. China markets are expected to slow in response to tightening fiscal policy measures taken by the government. And as a result, we expect DuPont sales growth in China to slow to about 20% in the second half compared to 30% growth in the first half. On the other hand, we expect recovery in automotive markets with light vehicle builds up 6% to 7% in the second half. The key is to anticipate changes, continue to innovate and deliver value to our customers, and be very disciplined about our execution.
Finally, we're excited about the Danisco acquisition and are well on our way to a very successful integration.

When we get the details later, know the acres, we're going to be able to dissect that and give you a better view to that. So it's probably better not to just speculate on it at this point in time. As far as next season goes, you got to look at a couple of the basics. Farm income remains strong. There's new product opportunities with the new hybrids and varieties that are coming on. We have Optimum AcreMax 1 and the pending EPA approval on AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA. At this point, we're about 30% converted from triple to AcreMax 1, next year will probably come in around 55%. So I think that the innovation continues, the progression continues and I think that next season will be good."

DuPont turned in a strong third quarter with underlying earnings of $0.69 per share. Double-digit sales increases in all segments and regions and our relentless focus on execution contributed to these outstanding results. 
Our Agriculture and Nutrition Health segments which represent nearly 1/3 of DuPont annual sales benefited from strong secular demands related to food and production agriculture. Latin American volume was up 17%, with a strong start to their planting season and demand for our high-performing products and services. Auto builds were up 5% in the quarter, but we saw an interesting dynamic with respect to the 2 businesses that primarily serve that market.  Performance Coatings grew volume 4% on part due to higher OEM build rate, while at the same time, Performance Polymers had a volume decline with automotive supply chain destocking to ensure lean inventories at year end. Industrial markets were mixed with certain business is very strong and others experiencing a pause as customers wait for a clearer view of the economy to emerge. Against this backdrop, we executed very well, capitalizing on certain growth markets, on our segment and innovation and aggressive productivity.  These were major contributors to the quarter. 
We continued to strengthen our position versus secular themes in agriculture, nutrition, alternative energy, safety  and protection. We've expanded our footprint in the developing markets, which represents about 1/3 of the company's sales year-to-date. We remain focused on customers in all our markets, delivering high-value products and services while all the while understanding downstream demand signals and planning accordingly.  We remain focused on productivity and are well ahead of our 2011 goals of $300 million in benefit in each of fixed cost and working capital productivity. Finally,

268053,118466559,177033,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","environment. Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $0.69 on an underlying basis, compa",1157,"environment. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $0.69 on an underlying basis, compared to $0.40 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of $9.2 billion were up 32% versus the prior year, comprised of 15% positive local price, 12% benefit from portfolio changes, which primarily related to the Danisco acquisition, 4% currency benefit and 1% volume gains. All segments had double-digit sales increases. Volume was especially strong in our Ag segment, with a strong early start to the sales season in the southern hemisphere. Local currency prices were up double digits in all regions, continuing to reflect our strong pricing discipline. 
Now, let's turn to the corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.37 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable costs, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be successful implementing price increases by pricing our new products for the enhanced value that they deliver. 
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, third quarter raw material energy and freight costs were up about 17% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year, we expect this to be an increase of 12% to 13% over 2010, with significantly higher costs again in the fourth quarter. We don't expect to see the impact of moderating raw material prices until 2012.
Volume improvement resulted in incremental earnings benefit of $0.07 per share compared to the previous year. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately on the chart. Ag volumes were especially strong this quarter, with an early start to the southern hemisphere season and on a year-to-date basis, total company volumes are up 4%.
Continuing with the variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. This includes actions in the third quarter to support growth such as investments in ag the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, TiO2 expansions, along with R&D and specific marketing initiatives. 
As we told you during our Investor Day last December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we are on track to meet this commitment with actual fixed cost productivity of more than $250 million through the third quarter in 2011.
Year-over-year, currency has been benefit of $0.08 in the quarter and $0.16 year-to-date. At current exchange rates, currency should be neutral in the fourth quarter versus our previous expectation of a $0.04 tailwind.
Next, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.05 variance in the quarter. Our goal continues to be achieved 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, in the quarter, there was significant volatility in exchange rates which created a reduction in earnings. As is typical, the reconciliation is on Schedule E in the earnings news release. It shows you the exact impact our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.
Higher shares outstanding reduced earnings by $0.02 this quarter. During the quarter, we continued our long-standing practice of offsetting the share dilution from employee compensation and bought back 8.8 million shares, which is nearly 1% of the total shares outstanding. There was minimal impact on the shares outstanding this quarter since the buyback was not completed until late September.
Income tax on the earnings per share waterfall is a positive $0.05. The base tax rate this quarter was 18.5% versus 24.1% in the third quarter of 2010. However, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be about 21%.
Next, on the waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.04 on an underlying basis. As you can see on Slide 16, we now expect an underlying earnings contribution of about $0.07 for the full year 2011. This includes additional interest expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets, as well as some integration cost that are not included in our accrual for one-time items. We estimate that Danisco will dilute earnings per share on a reported basis by $0.16 to $0.18 this year. This includes underlying results, plus significant items of $0.23 to $0.25 associated with transaction and cost to achieve synergies. We recorded significant items of $0.13 per share charge this quarter, plus $0.08 per share in the second quarter, for a total of $0.21 year-to-date.
The last point on the earnings per share waterfall chart is Other, which shows a negative $0.04 variance. This is principally due to reduced farmer earnings which were $70 million this quarter versus $111 million prior year. Our full year 2011 estimate for farmer pretax earnings is now about $270 million, approximately $220 million less than what we received in 2010.
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5, and you can see that we delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 38% in the third quarter and 32% to date year-to-date.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6, third quarter free cash flow was a $605 million inflow of capital, partially offset by higher capital spending for expansion projects. At the end of the third quarter, on a 12-month trailing basis versus third quarter 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by 11%. This is excluding Danisco impact, thus reducing our working capital needs in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity this year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A2 credit rating and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that rating.
We announced our 429th consecutive quarterly dividend last week. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
So in summary, for the third quarter, you can once again see the strength of the results that our diversified portfolio delivered. As we transform our portfolio, more market-driven innovation businesses and with reduced impact from cyclical businesses, we continue to deliver these superior results.
For our full year 2011 outlook, DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. As such, we are increasing our guidance from a range of $3.90 to $4.05 per share to the upper half of that range with new guidance of $3.97 to $4.05 per share, excluding significant items. The main driver for this increase is stronger third quarter of business results, especially in ag and developing markets. 
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Karen to review the segment results. Karen?"

These outstandi",1798,"Thanks, Nick. Let's start with Agriculture on Slide 7. We are continuing another great year for our Agriculture businesses, with strong third quarter results. Sales of $1.4 billion grew 41%, with volume gains of 26% and price gains of 15%. These outstanding results were broad-based and led by a strong early start to the Latin American summer season. The seasonal PTOI loss of $69 million reflects increased sales offset by growth investments and the impact from divested businesses. We estimate about $80 million in sales shifted from fourth quarter to the third quarter, with an associated earnings impact of about $0.05 per share. 
Focusing on individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $596 million were up 27% on double-digit gains in all segments. Rynaxypyr insecticide continues to lead the portfolio growth. We are raising our full year sales estimate for this blockbuster product to over $575 million, representing an increase of more than 40% in a single year with continued share gains in insect control.
From a regional perspective, double-digit volume gains were posted in each region, but Latin America stood out, delivering over 30% growth, with particularly strong demand in specialty crops and sugarcane.
Moving to the Seed business, sales were $772 million, up 56%. The quarter primarily reflected a successful early start in Latin America. Our teams there mobilized quickly and responded well to the significant increase in corn hectares, delivering both volume and price gains. In soybeans, we expect hectares to be up modestly and our sales to be up double digits on both volumes and price gains. 
Our strategy in Latin America is paying off. We have a great sales model, strategic production assets and locally developed top-performing products. This holistic plan is supported by many years of investments we've made in the region that are clearly resulting in growth today and will continue to support the business in the years ahead.
Turning to a brief update on North America, during the third quarter, both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA products received EPA approval for integrated and reduced refuge, adding to our many regulatory successes over the past several months. Farmers managed many complexities, with insect protection and refuge management just a couple of examples. The Optimum AcreMax family of products is important because it provides our growers the convenience of an integrated refuge while maintaining the same high-yielding performance they are accustomed to.  Optimum AcreMax XTRA product will supplement our successful 2011 launch of Optimum AcreMax 1, while enhancing our right product, right acre approach to the market. Optimum AcreMax is the industry's first integrated and reduced refuge for the doubles market, focused on aboveground insect protection. 
Finally, and most importantly, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which is now coming to a close. They are seeing consistent, high-yielding product performance from our product lineup, confirming another reason we continue to gain position in the market. We look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest in mid-November.
Moving now to the segment full year outlook, with 3 quarters behind us, we are raising our full year expectations. We expect to deliver mid teens sales growth, coupled with earnings growth in the low 20s. As we move to our 2012, the fundamentals for agriculture remain positive. We will relentlessly focus on helping our farmers drive productivity to rebuild global stocks, helping them to meet the needs of a growing world.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 in Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $841 million improved 20% compared to the same period last year, with 8% lower volume and 28% higher prices of which 24% was metals passthrough. Pretax earnings of $99 million were $27 million lower than the same period last year, reflecting inventory destocking in photovoltaics and softening in plasma displays and packaging graphics. 
As expected, PV sales were down in the quarter due to an excess of inventory in the supply chain. We now believe that these excess inventory levels will continue through year-end and it will be early 2012  before inventory is correct and we see a rebound in manufacturing. We've seen PV volumes up 12% year-to-date. 
For fourth quarter, Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be slightly below prior year, driven by continued destocking in PV and slowing in consumer electronics, with earnings down significantly on lower volume and mix.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 in Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $293 million reflect a full quarter of Danisco's Enzyme business and DuPont's Commercial Biomaterials business. We saw strong volume growth in enzymes, especially in animal feed with new product launches. This segment had PTOI of $34 million this quarter, including about $4 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition and $3 million in integration costs that were not included in the significant items on Schedule B of our press release.
While sales will be slightly lower in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality in enzymes, we continue to see good growth across these product lines and expect and the year with PTOI margin in low double-digits.
Turning now to Slide 10 in our Nutrition & Health segment, which encompasses enablers, bioactives and Solae soy ingredients. Sales of $844 million grew 17% with the acquisition impact from Danisco's Specialty Food Ingredients business, coupled with volume and price gains of 4% and 6% respectively on the DuPont legacy business. Earnings of $55 million reflected sales more than offsetting higher cost, including the cost of integration and about $22 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition.
Solae soy product sales were up moderately, reflecting both volume and price improvements over the same period last year. Importantly, a business-critical mission to enhance product mix towards specialty soy offerings is progressing well as the Specialty Soy business delivered double-digit growth in the quarter, with the continued penetration into health-related product.
The acquired businesses of bioactives and enablers grew on a pro forma basis of about 14%, underpinned by favorable currency, pricing gains and volume growth. The volume growth was led by cultures and sweetener product lines.
During the third quarter, our teams continued their focus on growing the business, as well as executing the integration. On the integration front, teams are driving both cost synergies, as well as sales synergies.
Moving to the outlook, we continue to anticipate fourth quarter sales of $800 million to $900 million. Our ongoing expectation for top line growth of the combined segment is high single digits. Fourth quarter earnings will increase with higher sales, offset in part with raw material increases, about $22 million of amortization expense associated with the Danisco acquisition in addition to growth investments in other one-time integration costs.  Pretax margins will be mid-single digits, inclusive of purchase accounting.
Let's turn to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales of $2.1 billion and increased 28% due predominantly to price. Importantly, the increase in price was double-digits for both our Titanium Dioxide business and our Chemicals and Fluoroproducts business. TiO2 and flouropolymers were the standouts this quarter and we sold every pound we could make. Meanwhile, refrigerants and industrial chemicals saw decline in volume due to economic slowing principally in Europe and the United States.
Turning to the bottom line. PTOI more than doubled to $593 million, demonstrating the robust earnings power of this segment. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be up significantly, and PTOI to be up substantially. The global economic uncertainty continues for the seasonally light fourth quarter and we see a slowing of demand across all major product lines. Still, the fundamentals of TiO2 are as healthy as ever, with increasing population growth and growing use per capita and our segment performance will continue to be strong.
Now, let's turn to Slide 12 in Performance Coatings. Sales of $1.1 billion increased by 17% on 13% stronger pricing and 4% higher volume. Including currency benefits, this segment achieved double-digit pricing increases in all of its major market segments. Sales volumes were also up in all major segments, with the strongest growth in heavy-duty trucks in North America. PTOI of $72 million increased $8 million, led by refinish, with benefits from stronger sales, partially offset by 10% higher raw material energy and freight cost.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment sales to be up moderately year-over-year, with earnings up modestly.  Auto builds are forecast to be up 5% in the fourth quarter, with full year global builds expected to be up about 4%. This segment expects continued raw material price pressure and anticipates actions in all market segments to maintain and improve margins.
Turning now to Slide 13 in Performance Materials, sales increased 11% with 18% in price more than offsetting a 7% drop in volume. Price increase has covered rising ingredient costs this quarter. Channel destocking was evident in each region and impacted all Performance Polymers market segments. Auto OEM rebound and demand, post the Japanese earthquake, was offset by channel destocking and softening in consumer and industrial markets. Packaging and infrastructure demand was stable, while ethylene copolymers production-related supply issues which began in the first quarter, were resolved early in the third quarter. Segment PTOI dropped 18% due primarily to lower volumes.
For the fourth quarter, Performance Materials sales are expected to be up moderately, with flat PTOI. PTOI would be up substantially without last year's one-time, $31 million gain.
Turning to the market view. Auto OEM builds are expected to grow 5% globally in the quarter and we expect stable packaging markets, with some continued softening in industrial and consumer market segments.  We foresee raw material costs like butadiene and ethane to remain elevated.
Moving now to Slide 14, Safety & Protection sales climbed 15% on higher selling prices combined with the MECS acquisition. Volume was flat overall, with industrial market destocking in sectors such as chemical protection and energy solutions. Public sector demand was lower given reduced government spending worldwide. Automotive and aerospace were bright spots in the quarter as our products high strengths to weight ratio provides advantages in fuel economy and durability.  On a regional basis, Europe and Latin America volumes offset declines in the United States and Asia.
PTOI of $118 million was down 12% due to increased growth spending, including the Cooper River startup and weaker mix in protection technologies.
For the fourth quarter, we see pockets of destocking, but continued strength in automotive and aerospace. As a result, S&P sales are expected to be up significantly and PTOI up substantially compared to easy comps in the fourth quarter 2010. Additionally, we are rolling out our latest Kevlar AP product in automotive hoses, belts and fiber-optic cable, giving our customers enhanced performance and improved cost-effectiveness.
So this concludes our segment reviews, and now, I'll turn the call back to Ellen."

Industrial production is growing in the manufacturing sector and DuPont sales volumes were flattish this quarter, which we view as a pause with gradual recovery likely to resume in 2012. 
Recovery's been slower in Europe except for Germany, which experienced a strong export recovery. There are parts of Europe that are in or near recession and our own results for the third quarter indicate a very mixed bag. Volumes in Western Europe were down, while volumes in developing Europe, Middle East and Africa were up. We see pockets of opportunity in agriculture, nutrition, automotive markets in developing countries that are focusing on where the growth in these markets are in the subregions are very specifically. 
Our Latin American growth outlook is positive for DuPont. We expect about half our 2011 sales in Latin America will be in the agriculture and nutrition and health segments. And we're positioned for growth in these segments.
Finally, we remain positive on Asia. We expect a soft landing in China, with GDP growth next year around 8%. There are certainly pockets of concerns such as inflation and currency effects, although these are outweighed by the positive impact of growing local demand. We remain bullish on the continued growth prospects in that region. 
Now let's shift to the broader markets. We expect robust ag fundamentals for the long-term, driven by population growth and desire for more protein and healthier foods. These market trends can only be satisfied through innovative products that deliver greater value to the grower and the consumer. Today, DuPont has positive momentum coming from a strong planting season underway Latin America. At the same time, our sales reps and agronomists are working with farmers in Europe and North America during the fall harvest to make decisions for the 2012  planting season. You know, these intimate conversations allow us to position the right product on the right acre by optimizing farmer productivity and profitability for next season.
Global auto builds are expected to be up 5% in the fourth quarter, with positive momentum in 2012. And while there may be destocking in the fourth quarter, the underlying demand signals point to volume growth next year. Electronic markets are soft right now, and if the upcoming holiday season plays out, we can better assess the supply chain inventories and underlying demand heading into next year. Longer term photovoltaic market should continue on the pace of growth of about 15% to 20% compounded annually, although we expect this growth directory to remain lumpy. 
And finally, with regard to titanium dioxide, the industry is now in its seasonally slow fourth quarter. We expect to see customers to be conservative and manage their year-end inventory in the uncertain economic environment. The pause we experience now is most evident in China, given their actions to tighten fiscal policy and combat inflation. But if we look at TiO2 volumes sold in Asia, they're up only slightly year-over-year.
As we normally do, we'll take advantage of this seasonally low quarter to implement preventive maintenance on our plant sites which have been running at extremely high sales capacity all year. And we expect to enter 2012 well-positioned for the seasonal increase in demands which usually peaks in the second quarter.
As we look ahead with all these factors in mind, it's important to remember that DuPont is a far different company than it was just a few years ago. Our portfolio has changed most recently with the addition of Danisco, and if you think about it broadly, nearly 1/3 of the company's sales are in Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segment on a pro forma basis for 2011 and compare that to roughly 1 quarter in 2008. We further shape the portfolio with restructuring, including the permanent shutdown of certain underperforming assets, and if you add it up since 2008, we've invested non-strategic assets with about $400 million in annualized sales. 
In addition to shaping the portfolio, we are executing well. Innovation remains the backbone of the company with an arsenal of new products that deliver higher yields, healthier and better food, more efficient solar cells, more energy-efficient vehicles, new applications for personal protection just to name a few. 31% of last year's sales were from new products that were 4 years old or less. And productivity continues to be our way of life. We implemented $1 billion in fixed cost productivity in 2009 and expect an additional $900 million between 2010 and 2011. We implemented working capital productivity of a similar magnitude. Based in part on our innovation and productivity success, segment margins, excluding pharma, our 230 basis points higher year-to-date compared to the first 3 quarters of 2008. 
Today, DuPont is well-positioned to navigate uncertain times. We stay close to our markets, plan for short-term contingencies and continue to execute well. Our best is yet to come.

I think one of the biggest changes that we've made since 2008 is to really get downstream and understand, not just what our distributors or converters are telling us, but what the real demand is. And let me use like photovoltaics as an example. The biggest difference that occurred in the last 3 months is our understanding of the inventory in that channel. And that's why we are saying that the fourth quarter's going to be slower than we were thinking a quarter ago and that the recovery will occur in the 2012. So but everybody is cautious. There's a lot of lack of confidence going on out there. And I mean we see that, the other example I give you is in automotive where builds were up. We saw positive volume in OEM paint and saw negative volume or destocking in polymers. And we're building the same amount of cars, and penetration rates are very similar. So the difference is the confidence factor there. So I think I'd go back to the biggest difference is our ability to get the information, our ability to use that and convert it into action and take it to the bottom line, from a productivity standpoint and keeping focused on these programs. But I'll tell you, this is something that our leadership team is dealing with and focused on day in day out because we want to make sure that we are there for our customers have volume needs and that we're taking the appropriate reactions if volume is a little light. So it's a daily focus."

If you take a look at it, the volume for the materials and photovoltaics is starting to shift from Europe into Asia as the builds are going on more prominently in Asia. We see that in our regional buildout. All as we take a look at the margin and the market forecast, we put in all of the impact on subsidies. Now if you take a look at it, when these subsidies come down, a lot of times the economics are matching with a reduction in price on the modules. And so, then the economics of the installation is not really changed. And so, all of these things we've taken into account. But I think the biggest difference is that it is not that the installs are slowing down. The builds are slowing down because of the inventory that's been build up in the channel. And so we dissect that, we spend a lot of time on the in the last 3 months and pretty confident in that 15% to 20% growth rate long-term. Just to give you a look on the year, we're pretty confident that the data on installs of 18.8 gigawatts is right. What we did not have is clear view on in July is the amount of inventory, the number of gigawatts in inventory. Back in July, it was looking more like 4 to 5. Now we've seen ranges as high as 9 in inventory and that's why we think that it will impact the production schedules there."

It's clear that import costs are rising. But at the same time, price is normally dictated by availability and capacity utilization of the assets. In the last couple of years, I guess since 2008, there's been 5% capacity taken out of the high end pigment market. So we're dealing with less capacity today for the high-end product than we did 3 years ago. You always have to balance those things, but the 1 thing that's clear is that we know that it's a commodity and it will come and go and it has over the years.

I think the increases that you're seeing us doing really represent the strong underlying performance that we are experiencing in our businesses. And it's very much in line with our expectations that we had in place. Keep in mind a couple of other things, Brian. When you look at the $0.13 earnings per share that we were above the street expectation of any dial in the $0.05 on the Ag side that we're talking about from quarter 4 that showed up in quarter 3. A long way of my comments around currency. We were anticipating in our numbers and we have given you guidance of a $0.04 benefit on currency in the fourth quarter. Those 2 together give you $0.09, which is that $0.04 we're talking about in our midpoint increase. You can calculate it looking at the Street's expectation of $0.52 for the quarter and do a similar type calculation, and you get very much in line with where we are today, around our range. So I think no matter how you look at it, it strongly supports the increase in guidance that we've given for the full year now."

And as you well know, the contributions to pension is driven by the PPA side versus GAAP on the accounting piece of it. When we look at the PPA requirements there around our pension, there's a couple of factors that come into play. Obviously the discount rate is an important factor and can sway the numbers considerably. And to be honest with you, we are now locked in on our discount rate. We had that lock in, in September election. And the other factor is the return on the assets. And I've seen the return assets swing several hundred basis points in a period of 2, 3 months. So it's difficult to pin down exactly what the cash contribution might be for the pension in 2012. But I guess I would say, if I was to look at things exactly the way they are today, John, and assume that nothing changes from a market perspective between now and year-end, you're probably looking at something in the range of several hundred million versus anything like $1 billion.

DuPont turned in a strong third quarter with underlying earnings of $0.69 per share. Double-digit sales increases in all segments and regions and our relentless focus on execution contributed to these outstanding results.
Our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments, which represent nearly 1/3 of DuPont annual sales, benefited from strong secular demands related to food and production agriculture. Latin American volume was up 17%, with a strong start to their planting season and demand for our high-performing products and services. Auto builds were up 5% in the quarter, but we saw an interesting dynamic with respect to the 2 businesses that primarily serve that market. Performance Coatings grew volume 4% on part due to higher OEM build rate, while at the same time, Performance Polymers had a volume decline with automotive supply chain destocking to ensure lean inventories at year end. Industrial markets were mixed with certain businesses very strong and others experiencing a pause as customers wait for a clearer view of the economy to emerge. Against this backdrop, we executed very well, capitalizing on certain growth markets, our strength and innovation and aggressive productivity. These were major contributors to the quarter.
We continued to strengthen our position versus secular themes in agriculture, nutrition, alternative energy, safety and protection. We've expanded our footprint in the developing markets, which represents about 1/3 of the company's sales year-to-date. We remain focused on customers in all our markets, delivering high-value products and services, now all the while, understanding downstream demand signals and planning accordingly.  We remain focused on productivity and are well ahead of our 2011 goals of $300 million in benefit in each of fixed cost and working capital productivity.

Earnings per share were $0.69 on an underlying basis, compa",1157,"environment. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $0.69 on an underlying basis, compared to $0.40 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of $9.2 billion were up 32% versus the prior year, comprised of 15% positive local price, 12% benefit from portfolio changes, which primarily related to the Danisco acquisition, 4% currency benefit and 1% volume gains. All segments had double-digit sales increases. Volume was especially strong in our Ag segment, with a strong early start to the sales season in the southern hemisphere. Local currency prices were up double digits in all regions, continuing to reflect our strong pricing discipline.
Now let's turn to the corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.37 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable costs, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be successful implementing price increases by pricing our new products for the enhanced value that they deliver.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, third quarter raw material energy and freight costs were up about 17% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year, we expect this to be an increase of 12% to 13% over 2010, with significantly higher costs again in the fourth quarter. We don't expect to see the impact of moderating raw material prices until 2012.
Volume improvement resulted in incremental earnings benefit of $0.07 per share compared to the previous year. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately on the chart. Ag volumes were especially strong this quarter, with an early start to the southern hemisphere season, and on a year-to-date basis, total company volumes are up 4%.
Continuing with the variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. This includes actions in the third quarter to support growth such as investments in ag, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, TiO2 expansions along with R&D and specific marketing initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day last December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we are on track to meet this commitment with actual fixed cost productivity of more than $250 million through the third quarter in 2011.
Year-over-year, currency has been benefit of $0.08 in the quarter and $0.16 year-to-date. At current exchange rates, currency should be neutral in the fourth quarter versus our previous expectation of a $0.04 tailwind.
Next, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.05 variance in the quarter. Our goal continues to be achieved 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, in the quarter, there was significant volatility in exchange rates which created a reduction in earnings. As is typical, the reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release. It shows you the exact impact our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.
Higher shares outstanding reduced earnings by $0.02 this quarter. During the quarter, we continued our long-standing practice of offsetting the share dilution from employee compensation and bought back 8.8 million shares, which is nearly 1% of the total shares outstanding. There was minimal impact on the shares outstanding this quarter since the buyback was not completed until late September.
Income tax on the earnings per share waterfall is a positive $0.05. The base tax rate this quarter was 18.5% versus 24.1% in the third quarter of 2010. However, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be about 21%.
Next, on the waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.04 on an underlying basis. As you can see on Slide 16, we now expect an underlying earnings contribution of about $0.07 for the full year 2011. This includes additional interest expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets, as well as some integration costs that are not included in our accrual for onetime items. We estimate that Danisco will dilute earnings per share on a reported basis by $0.16 to $0.18 this year. This includes underlying results plus significant items of $0.23 to $0.25 associated with transaction and cost to achieve synergies. We recorded significant items of $0.13 per share charge this quarter plus $0.08 per share in the second quarter for a total of $0.21 year-to-date.
The last point on the earnings per share waterfall chart is Other, which shows a negative $0.04 variance. This is principally due to reduced farmer earnings, which were $70 million this quarter versus $111 million prior year. Our full year 2011 estimate for farmer pretax earnings is now about $270 million, approximately $220 million less than what we received in 2010.
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5, and you can see that we delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 38% in the third quarter and 32% to date -- year-to-date.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Third quarter free cash flow was a $605 million inflow of capital, partially offset by higher capital spending for expansion projects. At the end of the third quarter on a 12-month trailing basis versus third quarter 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by 11%. This is excluding Danisco impact, thus, reducing our working capital needs in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity this year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A2 credit rating, and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that rating.
We announced our 429th consecutive quarterly dividend last week. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
So in summary, for the third quarter, you can once again see the strength of the results that our diversified portfolio delivered. As we transform our portfolio, more market-driven innovation businesses and with reduced impact from cyclical businesses, we continue to deliver these superior results.
For our full year 2011 outlook, DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. As such, we are increasing our guidance from a range of $3.90 to $4.05 per share to the upper half of that range, with new guidance of $3.97 to $4.05 per share, excluding significant items. The main driver for this increase is stronger third quarter business results, especially in ag and developing markets.
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Karen to review the segment results. Karen?"
268053,118466559,177184,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2011",2011-10-25,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Nick. Let's start with Agriculture on Slide 7. We are continuing another great year for our Agriculture businesses with strong third quarter results. Sales of $1.4 billion grew 41%, with volume gains of 26% and price gains of 15%. These outstandin",1799,"Thanks, Nick. Let's start with Agriculture on Slide 7. We are continuing another great year for our Agriculture businesses with strong third quarter results. Sales of $1.4 billion grew 41%, with volume gains of 26% and price gains of 15%. These outstanding results were broad based and led by a strong early start to the Latin American summer season. The seasonal PTOI loss of $69 million reflects increased sales offset by growth investments and the impact from divested businesses. We estimate about $80 million in sales shifted from fourth quarter to the third quarter, with an associated earnings impact of about $0.05 per share.
Focusing on individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $596 million were up 27% on double-digit gains in all segments. Rynaxypyr insecticide continues to lead the portfolio growth. We are raising our full year sales estimate for this blockbuster product to over $575 million, representing an increase of more than 40% in a single year with continued share gains in insect control.
From a regional perspective, double-digit volume gains were posted in each region, but Latin America stood out, delivering over 30% growth, with particularly strong demand in specialty crops and sugarcane.
Moving to the Seed business, sales were $772 million, up 56%. The quarter primarily reflected a successful early start in Latin America. Our teams there mobilized quickly and responded well to the significant increase in corn hectares, delivering both volume and price gains. In soybeans, we expect hectares to be up modestly and our sales to be up double digits on both volume and price gains.
Our strategy in Latin America is paying off. We have a great sales model, strategic production assets and locally developed top-performing products. This holistic plan is supported by many years of investments we've made in the region that are clearly resulting in growth today and will continue to support the business in the years ahead.
Turning to a brief update on North America. During the third quarter, both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA products received EPA approval for integrated and reduced refuge, adding to our many regulatory successes over the past several months. Farmers managed many complexities, with insect protection and refuge management just a couple of examples. The Optimum AcreMax family of products is important because it provides our growers the convenience of an integrated refuge while maintaining the same high-yielding performance they are accustomed to.  Optimum AcreMax XTRA product will supplement our successful 2011 launch of Optimum AcreMax 1, while enhancing our ""Right Product, Right Acre"" approach to the market. Optimum AcreMax is the industry's first integrated and reduced refuge for the doubles market, focused on aboveground insect protection.
Finally and most importantly, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which is now coming to a close. They are seeing consistent, high-yielding product performance from our product lineup, confirming another reason we continue to gain position in the market. We look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest in mid-November.
Moving now to the segment full year outlook. With 3 quarters behind us, we are raising our full year expectations. We expect to deliver mid-teens sales growth, coupled with earnings growth in the low 20s. As we move to our 2012, the fundamentals for agriculture remain positive. We'll relentlessly focus on helping our farmers drive productivity to rebuild global stocks, helping them to meet the needs of a growing world.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $841 million improved 20% compared to the same period last year, with 8% lower volume and 28% higher prices of which 24% was metals passthrough. Pretax earnings of $99 million were $27 million lower than the same period last year, reflecting inventory destocking in photovoltaics and softening in plasma displays and packaging graphics.
As expected, PV sales were down in the quarter due to an excess of inventory in the supply chain. We now believe that these excess inventory levels will continue through year end, and it will be early 2012 before inventory is correct and we see a rebound in manufacturing. We've seen PV volumes up 12% year-to-date.
For fourth quarter, Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be slightly below prior year, driven by continued destocking in PV and slowing in consumer electronics, with earnings down significantly on lower volume and mix.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $293 million reflect a full quarter of Danisco's enzyme business and DuPont's commercial biomaterials business. We saw strong volume growth in enzymes, especially in animal feed with new product launches. This segment had PTOI of $34 million this quarter, including about $4 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition and $3 million in integration costs that were not included in the significant items on Schedule B of our press release.
While sales will be slightly lower in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality in enzymes, we continue to see good growth across these product lines and expect to end the year with PTOI margin in low-double digit.
Turning now to Slide 10 and our Nutrition & Health segment, which encompasses enablers, bioactives and Solae soy ingredients. Sales of $844 million grew 17% with the acquisition impact from Danisco's specialty food ingredients business, coupled with volume and price gains of 4% and 6% respectively on the DuPont legacy business. Earnings of $55 million reflected sales more than offsetting higher cost, including the cost of integration and about $22 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition.
Solae soy product sales were up moderately, reflecting both volume and price improvements over the same period last year. Importantly, a business-critical mission to enhance product mix towards specialty soy offerings is progressing well as the specialty soy business delivered double-digit growth in the quarter with the continued penetration into health-related product.
The acquired businesses of bioactives and enablers grew on a pro forma basis of about 14%, underpinned by favorable currency, pricing gains and volume growth. The volume growth was led by cultures and sweetener product lines.
During the third quarter, our teams continued their focus on growing the business as well as executing the integration. On the integration front, teams are driving both cost synergies as well as sales synergies.
Moving to the outlook. We continue to anticipate fourth quarter sales of $800 million to $900 million. Our ongoing expectation for top line growth of the combined segment is high-single digits. Fourth quarter earnings will increase with higher sales, offset in part with raw material increases, about $22 million of amortization expense associated with the Danisco acquisition in addition to growth investments and other onetime integration costs. Pretax margins will be mid-single digits, inclusive of purchase accounting.
Let's turn to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales of $2.1 billion increased 28% due predominantly to price. Importantly, the increase in price was double digits for both our titanium dioxide business and our chemicals and fluoroproducts business. TiO2 and flouropolymers were the standouts this quarter, and we sold every pound we could make. Meanwhile, refrigerants and industrial chemicals saw declines in volume due to economic slowing principally in Europe and the United States.
Turning to the bottom line. PTOI more than doubled to $593 million, demonstrating the robust earnings power of this segment. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be up significantly and PTOI to be up substantially. The global economic uncertainty continues for the seasonally light fourth quarter, and we see a slowing of demand across all major product lines. Still, the fundamentals of TiO2 are as healthy as ever, with increasing population growth and growing use per capita, and our segment performance will continue to be strong.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Sales of $1.1 billion increased by 17% on 13% stronger pricing and 4% higher volume. Including currency benefits, this segment achieved double-digit pricing increases in all of its major market segments. Sales volumes were also up in all major segments with the strongest growth in heavy-duty trucks in North America. PTOI of $72 million increased $8 million led by refinish, with benefits from stronger sales partially offset by 10% higher raw material energy and freight costs.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment sales to be up moderately year-over-year with earnings up modestly. Auto builds are forecast to be up 5% in the fourth quarter, with full year global builds expected to be up about 4%. This segment expects continued raw material price pressure and anticipates actions in all market segments to maintain and improve margins.
Turning now to Slide 13 and Performance Materials. Sales increased 11% with 18% in price more than offsetting a 7% drop in volume. Price increases covered rising ingredient costs this quarter. Channel destocking was evident in each region and impacted all Performance Polymers market segments. Auto OEM rebound and demand, post the Japanese earthquake, was offset by channel destocking and softening in consumer and industrial markets. Packaging and infrastructure demand was stable, while ethylene copolymers production-related supply issues, which began in the first quarter, were resolved early in the third quarter. Segment PTOI dropped 18% due primarily to lower volumes.
For the fourth quarter, Performance Materials sales are expected to be up moderately with flat PTOI. PTOI would be up substantially without last year's onetime $31 million gain.
Turning to the market view. Auto OEM builds are expected to grow 5% globally in the quarter, and we expect stable packaging markets with some continued softening in industrial and consumer market segments. We foresee raw material costs like butadiene and ethane to remain elevated.
Moving now to Slide 14. Safety & Protection sales climbed 15% on higher selling prices combined with the MECS acquisition. Volume was flat overall with industrial market destocking in sectors such as chemical protection and energy solutions. Public sector demand was lower given reduced government spending worldwide. Automotive and aerospace were bright spots in the quarter as our product's high strengths to weight ratio provides advantages in fuel economy and durability. On a regional basis, Europe and Latin America volumes offset declines in the United States and Asia.
PTOI of $118 million was down 12% due to increased growth spending, including the Cooper River startup and weaker mix in protection technologies.
For the fourth quarter, we see pockets of destocking but continued strength in automotive and aerospace. As a result, S&P sales are expected to be up significantly and PTOI up substantially compared to easy comps in the fourth quarter 2010. Additionally, we are rolling out our latest Kevlar AP product in automotive hoses, belts and fiber optic cable, giving our customers enhanced performance and improved cost effectiveness.
So this concludes our segment reviews, and now I'll turn the call back to Ellen."

We continue to stay close to our customers across all markets and geographies, and by doing so, we collect the information we need to help us better evaluate the demand signals and importantly, distinguish between underlying deman",930,"Great. Thank you, Karen. We continue to stay close to our customers across all markets and geographies, and by doing so, we collect the information we need to help us better evaluate the demand signals and importantly, distinguish between underlying demand and destocking.
Now I'd like to share some perspectives on the geographic markets, followed by some comments on some of the broader markets like electronics, automotive, industrial and agriculture. In North America, we see a slow recovery continuing. While there are issues of unemployment and weak consumer confidence, there are also some positive signs such as rising retail and automotive sales. Personal savings rates have normalized and credits begun to grow. Industrial production is growing in the manufacturing sector, and DuPont sales volumes were flattish this quarter, which we view as a pause with gradual recovery likely to resume in 2012.
Recovery has been slower in Europe except for Germany, which had experienced a strong export recovery. There are parts of Europe that are in or near recession, and our own results for the third quarter indicate a very mixed bag. Volumes in Western Europe were down, while volumes in developing Europe, Middle East and Africa were up. We see pockets of opportunity in agriculture, nutrition, automotive markets and developing countries that are focusing on where the growth in these markets are and the subregions are very specifically.
Our Latin American growth outlook is positive for DuPont. We expect about half our 2011 sales in Latin America will be in the agriculture and nutrition and health segments, and we're positioned for growth in these segments.
Finally, we remain positive on Asia. We expect a soft landing in China, with GDP growth next year around 8%. There are certainly pockets of concerns such as inflation and currency effects, although these are outweighed by the positive impacts of growing local demand. We remain bullish on the continued growth prospects in that region.
Now let's shift to the broader markets. We expect robust ag fundamentals for the long term, driven by population growth and desire for more protein and healthier foods. These market trends can only be satisfied through innovative products that deliver greater value to the grower and the consumer. Today, DuPont has positive momentum coming from a strong planting season underway Latin America. At the same time, our sales reps and agronomists are working with farmers in Europe and North America during the fall harvest to make decisions for the 2012  planting season. These intimate conversations allow us to position the right product on the right acre, thus, optimizing farmer productivity and profitability for next season.
Global auto builds are expected to be up 5% in the fourth quarter with positive momentum in 2012, and while there may be destocking in the fourth quarter, the underlying demand signals point to volume growth next year. Electronic markets are soft right now, and as the upcoming holiday season plays out, we can better assess supply chain inventories and underlying demand heading into next year. Longer-term photovoltaic market should continue on a pace of growth of about 15% to 20% compounded annually, although we expect this growth trajectory to remain lumpy.
And finally with regard to titanium dioxide, the industry is now in its seasonally slow fourth quarter. We expect to see customers to be conservative and manage their year-end inventory in the uncertain economic environment. The pause we experience now is most evident in China given their actions to tighten fiscal policy and combat inflation, but if we look at TiO2 volumes sold in Asia, they're up only slightly year-over-year.
As we normally do, we'll take advantage of this seasonally low quarter to implement preventive maintenance at our plant sites, which have been running at extremely high sales capacity all year. And we expect to enter 2012 well positioned for the seasonal increase in demand, which usually peaks in the second quarter.
As we look ahead with all these factors in mind, it's important to remember that DuPont is a far different company than it was just a few years ago. Our portfolio has changed most recently with the addition of Danisco, and if you think about it broadly, nearly 1/3 of the company's sales are in Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments on a pro forma basis for 2011 and compare that to roughly one quarter in 2008. We have further shaped the portfolio with restructuring including the permanent shutdown of certain underperforming assets, and if you add it up since 2008, we divested non-strategic assets with about $400 million in annualized sales.
In addition to shaping the portfolio, we are executing well. Innovation remains the backbone of the company with an arsenal of new products that deliver higher yields, healthier and better food, more efficient solar cells, more energy-efficient vehicles, new applications for personal protection just to name a few. 31% of last year's sales were from new products that were 4 years old or less, and productivity continues to be a way of life. We implemented $1 billion in fixed cost productivity in 2009 and expect an additional $900 million between 2010 and 2011. We implemented working capital productivity of a similar magnitude. Based in part on our innovation and productivity success, segment margins excluding pharma are 230 basis points higher year-to-date compared to the first 3 quarters of 2008.
Today, DuPont is well positioned to navigate uncertain times. We stay close to our markets, plan for short-term contingencies and continue to execute well. Our best is yet to come.
Karen, I'll turn it back to you for questions."

I think one of the biggest changes that we've made since 2008 is to really get downstream and understand, not just what our distributors or converters are telling us, but what the real demand is, and let me use like photovoltaics as an example. The biggest difference that occurred in the last 3 months is our understanding of the inventory in that channel, and that's why we are saying that the fourth quarter's going to be slower than we were thinking a quarter ago and that a recovery will occur in the 2012. So -- but everybody is cautious. There's a lot of lack of confidence going on out there. And I mean we see that, the other example I'd give you is in automotive where builds were up. We saw positive volume in OEM paint and saw negative volume or destocking in polymers, and it's -- we're building the same amount of cars and penetration rates are very similar. So the difference is the confidence factor there. So I think I'd go back to the biggest difference is our ability to get the information, our ability to use that and convert it into action and take it to the bottom line from a productivity standpoint and keeping focused on these programs. But I'll tell you, this is something that our leadership team is dealing with and focused on day in day out because we want to make sure that we're there for our customers who have volume needs and that we're taking the appropriate actions if volume is a little light. So it's a daily focus."

All -- as we take a look at the market and the market forecast, we put in all of the kind of impact on subsidies. Now if you take a look at it, when these subsidies come down, a lot of times the economics are matching with the reduction in price on the modules, and so then the economics of the installation is not really changed. And so all of these things we've taken into account. But I think the biggest difference is that it is not that the installs are slowing down. The builds are slowing down because of the inventory that's been build up in the channel, and so we as we dissect that -- and we spend a lot of time on that in the last 3 months -- we're pretty confident in that 15% to 20% growth rate long term. Just to give you a look on the year, we're pretty confident that the data on installs of 18.8 gigawatts is right. What we did not have as clear a view on in July as we do today is the amount of inventory, the number of gigawatts in inventory. Back in July, it was looking more like 4 to 5. Now I've seen ranges as high as 9 in inventory, and that's why we think that the -- it will impact the production schedules there."

It's clear that import costs are rising, but at the same time, price is normally dictated by availability and capacity utilization of the assets. In the last couple of years, I guess since 2008, there's been 5% capacity taken out of the high-end pigment market. So we're dealing with less capacity today for the high-end product than we did 3 years ago. You always have to balance those things, but the one thing that's clear is that we know that it's a commodity, and it will come and go and it has over the years, and the most important part for us is to continue to focus on the long-term fundamentals, continue to focus on our advantage manufacturing process technology and continue to work with customers.

I'll reiterate a little bit of what Ellen just said. When you look at our pricing and how we determine our pricing with our customer base, it's really driven by the value we're bringing to our customers, and that value is coming through the innovation. So it's not fully really connected to the raw material side in many of our businesses. On some, as Ellen pointed out, there is that connection, but in most, it's independent of that raw side. But specifically to the raw material question, you're asking, Don, you've seen the increase year-over-year by quarter continue to go up as the year has unfolded. We had like 8% in the first quarter. We went up to 13% this quarter. It's 17% year-over-year, and I'm expecting the next quarter to be about a 14% increase year-over-year. It's going to give us about that 13 percentage point increase for the full year basis. As far as next year goes, Don, I'm going to be talking a lot more detail around that at our December Investor Day, and we'll be sharing with you what our current thinking is around raw materials as the 2012 unfolds. But keep in mind, as 2012 unfolds, we'll continue to be bringing that innovation to the market and bringing the value to our customers that will really be the determinant around our pricing and allow us to maintain that spread that we've, as you pointed out, been able to continue now for several, several quarters."

And on a full year basis, when you look at the working capital increase that we're going to have versus the sales increase that we're having in the same period, you're looking at something in the low 20s type of sales percentage increase. When you look at that and the working capital that we're talking about, you're going to see productivity, as I mentioned, 11% type productivity, which is well on the path of realizing the $300 million working capital productivity that we had projected.

Those 2 together give you $0.09, which is that $0.04 we're talking about in our midpoint increase.

And as you well know, the contributions to pension is driven by the PPA side versus GAAP on the accounting piece of it. When we look at the PPA requirements there around our pension, there's a couple of factors that come into play. Obviously, the discount rate is an important factor and can sway the numbers considerably. And to be honest with you, we are now locked in on our discount rate. We had that locked in, in the September election. And the other factor is the return on the assets, and I've seen the return on assets swing several hundred basis points in a period of 2, 3 months, so it's difficult to pin down exactly what the cash contribution might be for the pension in 2012. But I guess I would say, if I was to look at things exactly the way they are today, John, and assume that nothing changes from a market perspective between now and year end, you're probably looking at something in the range of several hundred million versus anything like $1 billion.

So productivity, they continue to focus on it. Fixed costs as a percent of sales is down 110 basis points in the third quarter of '11 versus third quarter of '10. I still maintain and talk into the team there that we can get to a PTOI margin target of 10% next year, and we continue to drive hard on that. And we'll see where it ends up. We just -- John McCool's been there just a year now with the new team. I think they're making great progress, and we'll see where they end up."

DuPont turned in a strong third quarter with underlying earnings of $0.69 per share. Double-digit sales increases in all segments and regions and our relentless focus on execution contributed to these outstanding results.
Our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments, which represent nearly 1/3 of DuPont annual sales, benefited from strong secular demands related to food and production agriculture. Latin American volume was up 17%, with a strong start to their planting season and demand for our high-performing products and services. Auto builds were up 5% in the quarter, but we saw an interesting dynamic with respect to the 2 businesses that primarily serve that market. Performance Coatings grew volume 4% on part due to higher OEM build rate, while at the same time, Performance Polymers had a volume decline with automotive supply chain destocking to ensure lean inventories at year end. Industrial markets were mixed with certain businesses very strong and others experiencing a pause as customers wait for a clearer view of the economy to emerge. Against this backdrop, we executed very well, capitalizing on certain growth markets, our strength and innovation and aggressive productivity. These were major contributors to the quarter.
We continued to strengthen our position versus secular themes in agriculture, nutrition, alternative energy, safety and protection. We've expanded our footprint in the developing markets, which represents about 1/3 of the company's sales year-to-date. We remain focused on customers in all our markets, delivering high-value products and services, now all the while, understanding downstream demand signals and planning accordingly.  We remain focused on productivity and are well ahead of our 2011 goals of $300 million in benefit in each of fixed cost and working capital productivity.

Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $0.69 on an underlying basis, compa",1123,"environment. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $0.69 on an underlying basis, compared to $0.40 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of $9.2 billion were up 32% versus the prior year, comprised of 15% positive local price, 12% benefit from portfolio changes, which primarily related to the Danisco acquisition, 4% currency benefit and 1% volume gains. All segments had double-digit sales increases. Volume was especially strong in our Ag segment, with a strong early start to the sales season in the southern hemisphere. Local currency prices were up double digits in all regions, continuing to reflect our strong pricing discipline.
Now let's turn to the corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.37 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable costs. Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, third quarter raw material energy and freight costs were up about 17% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year, we expect this to be an increase of 12% to 13% over 2010, with significantly higher costs again in the fourth quarter. We don't expect to see the impact of moderating raw material prices until 2012.
Volume improvement resulted in incremental earnings benefit of $0.07 per share compared to the previous year. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately on the chart. Ag volumes were especially strong this quarter, with an early start to the southern hemisphere season, and on a year-to-date basis, total company volumes are up 4%.
Continuing with the variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. This includes actions in the third quarter to support growth such as investments in ag, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, TiO2 expansions along with R&D and specific marketing initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day last December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we are on track to meet this commitment with actual fixed cost productivity of more than $250 million through the third quarter in 2011.
Year-over-year, currency has been benefit of $0.008 in the quarter and $0.16 year-to-date. At current exchange rates, currency should be neutral in the fourth quarter versus our previous expectation of a $0.04 tailwind.
Next, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.05 variance in the quarter. Our goal continues to be achieved 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, in the quarter, there was significant volatility in exchange rates which created a reduction in earnings. As is typical, the reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release. It shows you the exact impact our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.
Higher shares outstanding reduced earnings by $0.02 this quarter. During the quarter, we continued our long-standing practice of offsetting the share dilution from employee compensation and bought back 8.8 million shares, which is nearly 1% of the total shares outstanding. There was minimal impact on the shares outstanding this quarter since the buyback was not completed until late September.
Income tax on the earnings per share waterfall is a positive $0.05. The base tax rate this quarter was 18.5% versus 24.1% in the third quarter of 2010. However, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be about 21%.
Next, on the waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.04 on an underlying basis. As you can see on Slide 16, we now expect an underlying earnings contribution of about $0.07 for the full year 2011. This includes additional interest expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets, as well as some integration costs that are not included in our accrual for onetime items. We estimate that Danisco will dilute earnings per share on a reported basis by $0.16 to $0.18 this year. This includes underlying results plus significant items of $0.23 to $0.25 associated with transaction and cost to achieve synergies. We recorded significant items of $0.13 per share charge this quarter plus $0.08 per share in the second quarter for a total of $0.21 year-to-date.
The last point on the earnings per share waterfall chart is Other, which shows a negative $0.04 variance. This is principally due to reduced farmer earnings, which were $70 million this quarter versus $111 million prior year. Our full year 2011 estimate for farmer pretax earnings is now about $270 million, approximately $220 million less than what we received in 2010.
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5, and you can see that we delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 38% in the third quarter and 32% to date -- year-to-date.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Third quarter free cash flow was a $605 million inflow of capital, partially offset by higher capital spending for expansion projects. At the end of the third quarter on a 12-month trailing basis versus third quarter 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by 11%. This is excluding Danisco impact, thus, reducing our working capital needs in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity this year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A2 credit rating, and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that rating.
We announced our 429th consecutive quarterly dividend last week. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
So in summary, for the third quarter, you can once again see the strength of the results that our diversified portfolio delivered. As we transform our portfolio, more market-driven innovation businesses and with reduced impact from cyclical businesses, we continue to deliver these superior results.
For our full year 2011 outlook, DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. As such, we are increasing our guidance from a range of $3.90 to $4.05 per share to the upper half of that range, with new guidance of $3.97 to $4.05 per share, excluding significant items. The main driver for this increase is stronger third quarter business results, especially in ag and developing markets.
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Karen to review the segment results. Karen?"

These outstandin",1799,"Thanks, Nick. Let's start with Agriculture on Slide 7. We are continuing another great year for our Agriculture businesses with strong third quarter results. Sales of $1.4 billion grew 41%, with volume gains of 26% and price gains of 15%. These outstanding results were broad based and led by a strong early start to the Latin American summer season. The seasonal PTOI loss of $69 million reflects increased sales offset by growth investments and the impact from divested businesses. We estimate about $80 million in sales shifted from fourth quarter to the third quarter, with an associated earnings impact of about $0.05 per share.
Focusing on individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $596 million were up 27% on double-digit gains in all segments. Rynaxypyr insecticide continues to lead the portfolio growth. We are raising our full year sales estimate for this blockbuster product to over $575 million, representing an increase of more than 40% in a single year with continued share gains in insect control.
From a regional perspective, double-digit volume gains were posted in each region, but Latin America stood out, delivering over 30% growth, with particularly strong demand in specialty crops and sugarcane.
Moving to the Seed business, sales were $772 million, up 56%. The quarter primarily reflected a successful early start in Latin America. Our teams there mobilized quickly and responded well to the significant increase in corn hectares, delivering both volume and price gains. In soybeans, we expect hectares to be up modestly and our sales to be up double digits on both volume and price gains.
Our strategy in Latin America is paying off. We have a great sales model, strategic production assets and locally developed top-performing products. This holistic plan is supported by many years of investments we've made in the region that are clearly resulting in growth today and will continue to support the business in the years ahead.
Turning to a brief update on North America. During the third quarter, both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA products received EPA approval for integrated and reduced refuge, adding to our many regulatory successes over the past several months. Farmers managed many complexities, with insect protection and refuge management just a couple of examples. The Optimum AcreMax family of products is important because it provides our growers the convenience of an integrated refuge while maintaining the same high-yielding performance they are accustomed to.  Optimum AcreMax XTRA product will supplement our successful 2011 launch of Optimum AcreMax 1, while enhancing our ""Right Product, Right Acre"" approach to the market. Optimum AcreMax is the industry's first integrated and reduced refuge for the doubles market, focused on aboveground insect protection.
Finally and most importantly, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which is now coming to a close. They are seeing consistent, high-yielding product performance from our product lineup, confirming another reason we continue to gain position in the market. We look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest in mid-November.
Moving now to the segment full year outlook. With 3 quarters behind us, we are raising our full year expectations. We expect to deliver mid-teens sales growth, coupled with earnings growth in the low 20s. As we move to our 2012, the fundamentals for agriculture remain positive. We'll relentlessly focus on helping our farmers drive productivity to rebuild global stocks, helping them to meet the needs of a growing world.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $841 million improved 20% compared to the same period last year, with 8% lower volume and 28% higher prices of which 24% was metals passthrough. Pretax earnings of $99 million were $27 million lower than the same period last year, reflecting inventory destocking in photovoltaics and softening in plasma displays and packaging graphics.
As expected, PV sales were down in the quarter due to an excess of inventory in the supply chain. We now believe that these excess inventory levels will continue through year end, and it will be early 2012 before inventory is correct and we see a rebound in manufacturing. We've seen PV volumes up 12% year-to-date.
For fourth quarter, Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be slightly below prior year, driven by continued destocking in PV and slowing in consumer electronics, with earnings down significantly on lower volume and mix.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $293 million reflect a full quarter of Danisco's enzyme business and DuPont's commercial biomaterials business. We saw strong volume growth in enzymes, especially in animal feed with new product launches. This segment had PTOI of $34 million this quarter, including about $4 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition and $3 million in integration costs that were not included in the significant items on Schedule B of our press release.
While sales will be slightly lower in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality in enzymes, we continue to see good growth across these product lines and expect to end the year with PTOI margin in low-double digit.
Turning now to Slide 10 and our Nutrition & Health segment, which encompasses enablers, bioactives and Solae soy ingredients. Sales of $844 million grew 17% with the acquisition impact from Danisco's specialty food ingredients business, coupled with volume and price gains of 4% and 6% respectively on the DuPont legacy business. Earnings of $55 million reflected sales more than offsetting higher cost, including the cost of integration and about $22 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition.
Solae soy product sales were up moderately, reflecting both volume and price improvements over the same period last year. Importantly, a business-critical mission to enhance product mix towards specialty soy offerings is progressing well as the specialty soy business delivered double-digit growth in the quarter with the continued penetration into health-related product.
The acquired businesses of bioactives and enablers grew on a pro forma basis of about 14%, underpinned by favorable currency, pricing gains and volume growth. The volume growth was led by cultures and sweetener product lines.
During the third quarter, our teams continued their focus on growing the business as well as executing the integration. On the integration front, teams are driving both cost synergies as well as sales synergies.
Moving to the outlook. We continue to anticipate fourth quarter sales of $800 million to $900 million. Our ongoing expectation for top line growth of the combined segment is high-single digits. Fourth quarter earnings will increase with higher sales, offset in part with raw material increases, about $22 million of amortization expense associated with the Danisco acquisition in addition to growth investments and other onetime integration costs. Pretax margins will be mid-single digits, inclusive of purchase accounting.
Let's turn to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales of $2.1 billion increased 28% due predominantly to price. Importantly, the increase in price was double digits for both our titanium dioxide business and our chemicals and fluoroproducts business. TiO2 and flouropolymers were the standouts this quarter, and we sold every pound we could make. Meanwhile, refrigerants and industrial chemicals saw declines in volume due to economic slowing principally in Europe and the United States.
Turning to the bottom line. PTOI more than doubled to $593 million, demonstrating the robust earnings power of this segment. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be up significantly and PTOI to be up substantially. The global economic uncertainty continues for the seasonally light fourth quarter, and we see a slowing of demand across all major product lines. Still, the fundamentals of TiO2 are as healthy as ever, with increasing population growth and growing use per capita, and our segment performance will continue to be strong.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Sales of $1.1 billion increased by 17% on 13% stronger pricing and 4% higher volume. Including currency benefits, this segment achieved double-digit pricing increases in all of its major market segments. Sales volumes were also up in all major segments with the strongest growth in heavy-duty trucks in North America. PTOI of $72 million increased $8 million led by refinish, with benefits from stronger sales partially offset by 10% higher raw material energy and freight costs.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment sales to be up moderately year-over-year with earnings up modestly. Auto builds are forecast to be up 5% in the fourth quarter, with full year global builds expected to be up about 4%. This segment expects continued raw material price pressure and anticipates actions in all market segments to maintain and improve margins.
Turning now to Slide 13 and Performance Materials. Sales increased 11% with 18% in price more than offsetting a 7% drop in volume. Price increases covered rising ingredient costs this quarter. Channel destocking was evident in each region and impacted all Performance Polymers market segments. Auto OEM rebound and demand, post the Japanese earthquake, was offset by channel destocking and softening in consumer and industrial markets. Packaging and infrastructure demand was stable, while ethylene copolymers production-related supply issues, which began in the first quarter, were resolved early in the third quarter. Segment PTOI dropped 18% due primarily to lower volumes.
For the fourth quarter, Performance Materials sales are expected to be up moderately with flat PTOI. PTOI would be up substantially without last year's onetime $31 million gain.
Turning to the market view. Auto OEM builds are expected to grow 5% globally in the quarter, and we expect stable packaging markets with some continued softening in industrial and consumer market segments. We foresee raw material costs like butadiene and ethane to remain elevated.
Moving now to Slide 14. Safety & Protection sales climbed 15% on higher selling prices combined with the MECS acquisition. Volume was flat overall with industrial market destocking in sectors such as chemical protection and energy solutions. Public sector demand was lower given reduced government spending worldwide. Automotive and aerospace were bright spots in the quarter as our product's high strengths to weight ratio provides advantages in fuel economy and durability. On a regional basis, Europe and Latin America volumes offset declines in the United States and Asia.
PTOI of $118 million was down 12% due to increased growth spending, including the Cooper River startup and weaker mix in protection technologies.
For the fourth quarter, we see pockets of destocking but continued strength in automotive and aerospace. As a result, S&P sales are expected to be up significantly and PTOI up substantially compared to easy comps in the fourth quarter 2010. Additionally, we are rolling out our latest Kevlar AP product in automotive hoses, belts and fiber optic cable, giving our customers enhanced performance and improved cost effectiveness.
So this concludes our segment reviews, and now I'll turn the call back to Ellen."

Thank you, Karen. We continue to stay close to our customers across all markets and geographies, and by doing so, we collect the information we need to help us better evaluate the demand signals and importantly, distinguish between underlying demand and destocking.
Now I'd like to share some perspectives on the geographic markets, followed by some comments on some of the broader markets like electronics, automotive, industrial and agriculture. In North America, we see a slow recovery continuing. While there are issues of unemployment and weak consumer confidence, there are also some positive signs such as rising retail and automotive sales. Personal savings rates have normalized and credits begun to grow. Industrial production is growing in the manufacturing sector, and DuPont sales volumes were flattish this quarter, which we view as a pause with gradual recovery likely to resume in 2012.
Recovery has been slower in Europe except for Germany, which had experienced a strong export recovery. There are parts of Europe that are in or near recession, and our own results for the third quarter indicate a very mixed bag. Volumes in Western Europe were down, while volumes in developing Europe, Middle East and Africa were up. We see pockets of opportunity in agriculture, nutrition, automotive markets and developing countries that are focusing on where the growth in these markets are and the subregions are very specifically.
Our Latin American growth outlook is positive for DuPont. We expect about half our 2011 sales in Latin America will be in the agriculture and nutrition and health segments, and we're positioned for growth in these segments.
Finally, we remain positive on Asia. We expect a soft landing in China, with GDP growth next year around 8%. There are certainly pockets of concerns such as inflation and currency effects, although these are outweighed by the positive impacts of growing local demand. We remain bullish on the continued growth prospects in that region.
Now let's shift to the broader markets. We expect robust ag fundamentals for the long term, driven by population growth and desire for more protein and healthier foods. These market trends can only be satisfied through innovative products that deliver greater value to the grower and the consumer. Today, DuPont has positive momentum coming from a strong planting season underway Latin America. At the same time, our sales reps and agronomists are working with farmers in Europe and North America during the fall harvest to make decisions for the 2012  planting season. These intimate conversations allow us to position the right product on the right acre, thus, optimizing farmer productivity and profitability for next season.
Global auto builds are expected to be up 5% in the fourth quarter with positive momentum in 2012, and while there may be destocking in the fourth quarter, the underlying demand signals point to volume growth next year. Electronic markets are soft right now, and as the upcoming holiday season plays out, we can better assess supply chain inventories and underlying demand heading into next year. Longer-term photovoltaic market should continue on a pace of growth of about 15% to 20% compounded annually, although we expect this growth trajectory to remain lumpy.
And finally with regard to titanium dioxide, the industry is now in its seasonally slow fourth quarter. We expect to see customers to be conservative and manage their year-end inventory in the uncertain economic environment. The pause we experience now is most evident in China given their actions to tighten fiscal policy and combat inflation, but if we look at TiO2 volumes sold in Asia, they're up only slightly year-over-year.
As we normally do, we'll take advantage of this seasonally low quarter to implement preventive maintenance at our plant sites, which have been running at extremely high sales capacity all year. And we expect to enter 2012 well positioned for the seasonal increase in demand, which usually peaks in the second quarter.
As we look ahead with all these factors in mind, it's important to remember that DuPont is a far different company than it was just a few years ago. Our portfolio has changed most recently with the addition of Danisco, and if you think about it broadly, nearly 1/3 of the company's sales are in Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments on a pro forma basis for 2011 and compare that to roughly one quarter in 2008. We have further shaped the portfolio with restructuring including the permanent shutdown of certain underperforming assets, and if you add it up since 2008, we divested non-strategic assets with about $400 million in annualized sales.
In addition to shaping the portfolio, we are executing well. Innovation remains the backbone of the company with an arsenal of new products that deliver higher yields, healthier and better food, more efficient solar cells, more energy-efficient vehicles, new applications for personal protection just to name a few. 31% of last year's sales were from new products that were 4 years old or less, and productivity continues to be a way of life. We implemented $1 billion in fixed cost productivity in 2009 and expect an additional $900 million between 2010 and 2011. We implemented working capital productivity of a similar magnitude. Based in part on our innovation and productivity success, segment margins excluding pharma are 230 basis points higher year-to-date compared to the first 3 quarters of 2008.
Today, DuPont is well positioned to navigate uncertain times. We stay close to our markets, plan for short-term contingencies and continue to execute well. Our best is yet to come.

The biggest difference that occurred in the last 3 months is our understanding of the inventory in that channel, and that's why we are saying that the fourth quarter's going to be slower than we were thinking a quarter ago and that a recovery will occur in the 2012. So -- but everybody is cautious. There's a lot of lack of confidence going on out there. And I mean we see that, the other example I'd give you is in automotive where builds were up. We saw positive volume in OEM paint and saw negative volume or destocking in polymers, and it's -- we're building the same amount of cars and penetration rates are very similar. So the difference is the confidence factor there. So I think I'd go back to the biggest difference is our ability to get the information, our ability to use that and convert it into action and take it to the bottom line from a productivity standpoint and keeping focused on those programs. But I'll tell you, this is something that our leadership team is dealing with and focused on day in day out because we want to make sure that we're there for our customers who have volume needs and that we're taking the appropriate actions if volume is a little light. So it's a daily focus."

If you take a look at it, the volume for the materials and photovoltaics is starting to shift from Europe into Asia as the builds are going on and more prominently in Asia, and we see that in our regional buildout. All -- as we take a look at the market and the market forecast, we put in all of the kind of impact on subsidies. Now if you take a look at it, when these subsidies come down, a lot of times the economics are matching with the reduction in price on the modules, and so then the economics of the installation is not really changed. And so all of these things we've taken into account. But I think the biggest difference is that it is not that the installs are slowing down. The builds are slowing down because of the inventory that's been built up in the channel, and so we as we dissect that -- and we spend a lot of time on that in the last 3 months -- we're pretty confident in that 15% to 20% growth rate long term. Just to give you a look on the year, we're pretty confident that the data on installs of 18.8 gigawatts is right. What we did not have as clear a view on in July as we do today is the amount of inventory, the number of gigawatts in inventory. Back in July, it was looking more like 4 to 5. Now I've seen ranges as high as 9 in inventory, and that's why we think that the -- it will impact the production schedules there."

It's clear that import costs are rising, but at the same time, price is normally dictated by availability and capacity utilization of the assets. In the last couple of years, I guess since 2008, there's been 5% capacity taken out of the high-end pigment market. So we're dealing with less capacity today for the high-end product than we did 3 years ago. You always have to balance those things, but the one thing that's clear is that we know that it's a commodity, and it will come and go and it has over the years, and the most important part for us is to continue to focus on the long-term fundamentals, continue to focus on our advantage manufacturing process technology and continue to work with customers. Advance notice is a really important thing in that industry, so they can help deal with it as well.

And as you well know, the contributions to pension is driven by the PPA side versus GAAP on the accounting piece of it. When we look at the PPA requirements there around our pension, there's a couple of factors that come into play. Obviously, the discount rate is an important factor and can sway the numbers considerably. And to be honest with you, we are now locked in on our discount rate. We had that locked in, in the September election. And the other factor is the return on the assets, and I've seen the return on assets swing several hundred basis points in a period of 2, 3 months, so it's difficult to pin down exactly what the cash contribution might be for the pension in 2012. But I guess I would say, if I was to look at things exactly the way they are today, John, and assume that nothing changes from a market perspective between now and year end, you're probably looking at something in the range of several hundred million versus anything like $1 billion. So just to give you a sense of where it is. And everything I'm talking about is really the principal U.S. Pension Plan when I deliver those comments to you."

DuPont turned in a strong third quarter with underlying earnings of $0.69 per share. Double-digit sales increases in all segments and regions and our relentless focus on execution contributed to these outstanding results.
Our Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments, which represent nearly 1/3 of DuPont annual sales, benefited from strong secular demands related to food and production agriculture. Latin American volume was up 17%, with a strong start to their planting season and demand for our high-performing products and services. Auto builds were up 5% in the quarter, but we saw an interesting dynamic with respect to the 2 businesses that primarily serve that market. Performance Coatings grew volume 4% on part due to higher OEM build rate, while at the same time, Performance Polymers had a volume decline with automotive supply chain destocking to ensure lean inventories at year end. Industrial markets were mixed with certain businesses very strong and others experiencing a pause as customers wait for a clearer view of the economy to emerge. Against this backdrop, we executed very well, capitalizing on certain growth markets, our strength and innovation and aggressive productivity. These were major contributors to the quarter.
We continued to strengthen our position versus secular themes in agriculture, nutrition, alternative energy, safety and protection. We've expanded our footprint in the developing markets, which represents about 1/3 of the company's sales year-to-date. We remain focused on customers in all our markets, delivering high-value products and services, now all the while, understanding downstream demand signals and planning accordingly.  We remain focused on productivity and are well ahead of our 2011 goals of $300 million in benefit in each of fixed cost and working capital productivity.

Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $0.69 on an underlying basis, compa",1157,"environment. 
Now I'd like to review the details of the quarter, pointing out our accomplishments versus goals, starting with Slide 3, which is a summary of earnings per share and sales results. Earnings per share were $0.69 on an underlying basis, compared to $0.40 in the prior year. Consolidated net sales of $9.2 billion were up 32% versus the prior year, comprised of 15% positive local price, 12% benefit from portfolio changes, which primarily related to the Danisco acquisition, 4% currency benefit and 1% volume gains. All segments had double-digit sales increases. Volume was especially strong in our Ag segment, with a strong early start to the sales season in the southern hemisphere. Local currency prices were up double digits in all regions, continuing to reflect our strong pricing discipline.
Now let's turn to the corporate view of the third quarter, looking at earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 4. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.37 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable costs, excluding the impact of currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we continue to be successful implementing price increases by pricing our new products for the enhanced value that they deliver. 
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, third quarter raw material energy and freight costs were up about 17% versus last year's third quarter. For the full year, we expect this to be an increase of 12% to 13% over 2010, with significantly higher costs again in the fourth quarter. We don't expect to see the impact of moderating raw material prices until 2012.
Volume improvement resulted in incremental earnings benefit of $0.07 per share compared to the previous year. This excludes the impact of Danisco, which is shown separately on the chart. Ag volumes were especially strong this quarter, with an early start to the southern hemisphere season, and on a year-to-date basis, total company volumes are up 4%.
Continuing with the variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. This includes actions in the third quarter to support growth such as investments in ag, the new Kevlar plant at Cooper River, TiO2 expansions along with R&D and specific marketing initiatives.
As we told you during our Investor Day last December, we will deliver another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011, and we are on track to meet this commitment with actual fixed cost productivity of more than $250 million through the third quarter in 2011.
Year-over-year, currency has been benefit of $0.008 in the quarter and $0.16 year-to-date. At current exchange rates, currency should be neutral in the fourth quarter versus our previous expectation of a $0.04 tailwind.
Next, exchange gains and losses was a negative $0.05 variance in the quarter. Our goal continues to be achieved 0 after-tax impact from our balance sheet hedging program. However, in the quarter, there was significant volatility in exchange rates which created a reduction in earnings. As is typical, the reconciliation is on Schedule D in the earnings news release. It shows you the exact impact our hedging program had on earnings, as well as the effective tax rate.
Higher shares outstanding reduced earnings by $0.02 this quarter. During the quarter, we continued our long-standing practice of offsetting the share dilution from employee compensation and bought back 8.8 million shares, which is nearly 1% of the total shares outstanding. There was minimal impact on the shares outstanding this quarter since the buyback was not completed until late September.
Income tax on the earnings per share waterfall is a positive $0.05. The base tax rate this quarter was 18.5% versus 24.1% in the third quarter of 2010. However, we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be about 21%.
Next, on the waterfall is Danisco, a benefit of $0.04 on an underlying basis. As you can see on Slide 16, we now expect an underlying earnings contribution of about $0.07 for the full year 2011. This includes additional interest expense and amortization expense associated with the acquired intangible assets, as well as some integration costs that are not included in our accrual for onetime items. We estimate that Danisco will dilute earnings per share on a reported basis by $0.16 to $0.18 this year. This includes underlying results plus significant items of $0.23 to $0.25 associated with transaction and cost to achieve synergies. We recorded significant items of $0.13 per share charge this quarter plus $0.08 per share in the second quarter for a total of $0.21 year-to-date.
The last point on the earnings per share waterfall chart is Other, which shows a negative $0.04 variance. This is principally due to reduced farmer earnings, which were $70 million this quarter versus $111 million prior year. Our full year 2011 estimate for farmer pretax earnings is now about $270 million, approximately $220 million less than what we received in 2010.
There's a graph depicting sales by geographic region on Slide 5, and you can see that we delivered strong performance in developing markets, with sales up 38% in the third quarter and 32% to date -- year-to-date.
Turning now to the balance sheet and cash on Slide 6. Third quarter free cash flow was a $605 million inflow of capital, partially offset by higher capital spending for expansion projects. At the end of the third quarter on a 12-month trailing basis versus third quarter 2010, we were able to increase net working capital turnover by 11%. This is excluding Danisco impact, thus, reducing our working capital needs in line with our commitment to deliver $300 million of productivity this year. Our strong balance sheet continues to serve us well. We value our A2 credit rating, and we work hard to maintain the associated metrics that support that rating.
We announced our 429th consecutive quarterly dividend last week. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling.
So in summary, for the third quarter, you can once again see the strength of the results that our diversified portfolio delivered. As we transform our portfolio, more market-driven innovation businesses and with reduced impact from cyclical businesses, we continue to deliver these superior results.
For our full year 2011 outlook, DuPont's leadership team remains confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans. As such, we are increasing our guidance from a range of $3.90 to $4.05 per share to the upper half of that range, with new guidance of $3.97 to $4.05 per share, excluding significant items. The main driver for this increase is stronger third quarter business results, especially in ag and developing markets.
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Karen to review the segment results. Karen?"

These outstandin",1799,"Thanks, Nick. Let's start with Agriculture on Slide 7. We are continuing another great year for our Agriculture businesses with strong third quarter results. Sales of $1.4 billion grew 41%, with volume gains of 26% and price gains of 15%. These outstanding results were broad based and led by a strong early start to the Latin American summer season. The seasonal PTOI loss of $69 million reflects increased sales offset by growth investments and the impact from divested businesses. We estimate about $80 million in sales shifted from fourth quarter to the third quarter, with an associated earnings impact of about $0.05 per share.
Focusing on individual businesses, let's start with Crop Protection. Sales of $596 million were up 27% on double-digit gains in all segments. Rynaxypyr insecticide continues to lead the portfolio growth. We are raising our full year sales estimate for this blockbuster product to over $575 million, representing an increase of more than 40% in a single year with continued share gains in insect control.
From a regional perspective, double-digit volume gains were posted in each region, but Latin America stood out, delivering over 30% growth, with particularly strong demand in specialty crops and sugarcane.
Moving to the Seed business, sales were $772 million, up 56%. The quarter primarily reflected a successful early start in Latin America. Our teams there mobilized quickly and responded well to the significant increase in corn hectares, delivering both volume and price gains. In soybeans, we expect hectares to be up modestly and our sales to be up double digits on both volume and price gains.
Our strategy in Latin America is paying off. We have a great sales model, strategic production assets and locally developed top-performing products. This holistic plan is supported by many years of investments we've made in the region that are clearly resulting in growth today and will continue to support the business in the years ahead.
Turning to a brief update on North America. During the third quarter, both Optimum AcreMax and AcreMax XTRA products received EPA approval for integrated and reduced refuge, adding to our many regulatory successes over the past several months. Farmers managed many complexities, with insect protection and refuge management just a couple of examples. The Optimum AcreMax family of products is important because it provides our growers the convenience of an integrated refuge while maintaining the same high-yielding performance they are accustomed to.  Optimum AcreMax XTRA product will supplement our successful 2011 launch of Optimum AcreMax 1, while enhancing our ""Right Product, Right Acre"" approach to the market. Optimum AcreMax is the industry's first integrated and reduced refuge for the doubles market, focused on aboveground insect protection.
Finally and most importantly, we're excited about what our growers are seeing during the harvest, which is now coming to a close. They are seeing consistent, high-yielding product performance from our product lineup, confirming another reason we continue to gain position in the market. We look forward to providing a summary of the North American harvest in mid-November.
Moving now to the segment full year outlook. With 3 quarters behind us, we are raising our full year expectations. We expect to deliver mid-teens sales growth, coupled with earnings growth in the low 20s. As we move to our 2012, the fundamentals for agriculture remain positive. We'll relentlessly focus on helping our farmers drive productivity to rebuild global stocks, helping them to meet the needs of a growing world.
Now let's turn to Slide 8 and Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $841 million improved 20% compared to the same period last year, with 8% lower volume and 28% higher prices of which 24% was metals passthrough. Pretax earnings of $99 million were $27 million lower than the same period last year, reflecting inventory destocking in photovoltaics and softening in plasma displays and packaging graphics.
As expected, PV sales were down in the quarter due to an excess of inventory in the supply chain. We now believe that these excess inventory levels will continue through year end, and it will be early 2012 before inventory is correct and we see a rebound in manufacturing. We've seen PV volumes up 12% year-to-date.
For fourth quarter, Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be slightly below prior year, driven by continued destocking in PV and slowing in consumer electronics, with earnings down significantly on lower volume and mix.
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and Industrial Biosciences. Segment sales of $293 million reflect a full quarter of Danisco's enzyme business and DuPont's commercial biomaterials business. We saw strong volume growth in enzymes, especially in animal feed with new product launches. This segment had PTOI of $34 million this quarter, including about $4 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition and $3 million in integration costs that were not included in the significant items on Schedule B of our press release.
While sales will be slightly lower in the fourth quarter due to normal seasonality in enzymes, we continue to see good growth across these product lines and expect to end the year with PTOI margin in low-double digit.
Turning now to Slide 10 and our Nutrition & Health segment, which encompasses enablers, bioactives and Solae soy ingredients. Sales of $844 million grew 17% with the acquisition impact from Danisco's specialty food ingredients business, coupled with volume and price gains of 4% and 6% respectively on the DuPont legacy business. Earnings of $55 million reflected sales more than offsetting higher cost, including the cost of integration and about $22 million amortization expense associated with the acquisition.
Solae soy product sales were up moderately, reflecting both volume and price improvements over the same period last year. Importantly, a business-critical mission to enhance product mix towards specialty soy offerings is progressing well as the specialty soy business delivered double-digit growth in the quarter with the continued penetration into health-related product.
The acquired businesses of bioactives and enablers grew on a pro forma basis of about 14%, underpinned by favorable currency, pricing gains and volume growth. The volume growth was led by cultures and sweetener product lines.
During the third quarter, our teams continued their focus on growing the business as well as executing the integration. On the integration front, teams are driving both cost synergies as well as sales synergies.
Moving to the outlook. We continue to anticipate fourth quarter sales of $800 million to $900 million. Our ongoing expectation for top line growth of the combined segment is high-single digits. Fourth quarter earnings will increase with higher sales, offset in part with raw material increases, about $22 million of amortization expense associated with the Danisco acquisition in addition to growth investments and other onetime integration costs. Pretax margins will be mid-single digits, inclusive of purchase accounting.
Let's turn to Performance Chemicals on Slide 11. Sales of $2.1 billion increased 28% due predominantly to price. Importantly, the increase in price was double digits for both our titanium dioxide business and our chemicals and fluoroproducts business. TiO2 and flouropolymers were the standouts this quarter, and we sold every pound we could make. Meanwhile, refrigerants and industrial chemicals saw declines in volume due to economic slowing principally in Europe and the United States.
Turning to the bottom line. PTOI more than doubled to $593 million, demonstrating the robust earnings power of this segment. For the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be up significantly and PTOI to be up substantially. The global economic uncertainty continues for the seasonally light fourth quarter, and we see a slowing of demand across all major product lines. Still, the fundamentals of TiO2 are as healthy as ever, with increasing population growth and growing use per capita, and our segment performance will continue to be strong.
Now let's turn to Slide 12 and Performance Coatings. Sales of $1.1 billion increased by 17% on 13% stronger pricing and 4% higher volume. Including currency benefits, this segment achieved double-digit pricing increases in all of its major market segments. Sales volumes were also up in all major segments with the strongest growth in heavy-duty trucks in North America. PTOI of $72 million increased $8 million led by refinish, with benefits from stronger sales partially offset by 10% higher raw material energy and freight costs.
For the fourth quarter, we expect segment sales to be up moderately year-over-year with earnings up modestly. Auto builds are forecast to be up 5% in the fourth quarter, with full year global builds expected to be up about 4%. This segment expects continued raw material price pressure and anticipates actions in all market segments to maintain and improve margins.
Turning now to Slide 13 and Performance Materials. Sales increased 11% with 18% in price more than offsetting a 7% drop in volume. Price increases covered rising ingredient costs this quarter. Channel destocking was evident in each region and impacted all Performance Polymers market segments. Auto OEM rebound and demand, post the Japanese earthquake, was offset by channel destocking and softening in consumer and industrial markets. Packaging and infrastructure demand was stable, while ethylene copolymers production-related supply issues, which began in the first quarter, were resolved early in the third quarter. Segment PTOI dropped 18% due primarily to lower volumes.
For the fourth quarter, Performance Materials sales are expected to be up moderately with flat PTOI. PTOI would be up substantially without last year's onetime $31 million gain.
Turning to the market view. Auto OEM builds are expected to grow 5% globally in the quarter, and we expect stable packaging markets with some continued softening in industrial and consumer market segments. We foresee raw material costs like butadiene and ethane to remain elevated.
Moving now to Slide 14. Safety & Protection sales climbed 15% on higher selling prices combined with the MECS acquisition. Volume was flat overall with industrial market destocking in sectors such as chemical protection and energy solutions. Public sector demand was lower given reduced government spending worldwide. Automotive and aerospace were bright spots in the quarter as our product's high strengths to weight ratio provides advantages in fuel economy and durability. On a regional basis, Europe and Latin America volumes offset declines in the United States and Asia.
PTOI of $118 million was down 12% due to increased growth spending, including the Cooper River startup and weaker mix in protection technologies.
For the fourth quarter, we see pockets of destocking but continued strength in automotive and aerospace. As a result, S&P sales are expected to be up significantly and PTOI up substantially compared to easy comps in the fourth quarter 2010. Additionally, we are rolling out our latest Kevlar AP product in automotive hoses, belts and fiber optic cable, giving our customers enhanced performance and improved cost effectiveness.
So this concludes our segment reviews, and now I'll turn the call back to Ellen."

We continue to stay close to our customers across all markets and geographies, and by doing so, we collect the information we need to help us better evaluate the demand signals and importantly, distinguish between underlying deman",930,"Great. Thank you, Karen. We continue to stay close to our customers across all markets and geographies, and by doing so, we collect the information we need to help us better evaluate the demand signals and importantly, distinguish between underlying demand and destocking.
Now I'd like to share some perspectives on the geographic markets, followed by some comments on some of the broader markets like electronics, automotive, industrial and agriculture. In North America, we see a slow recovery continuing. While there are issues of unemployment and weak consumer confidence, there are also some positive signs such as rising retail and automotive sales. Personal savings rates have normalized and credits begun to grow. Industrial production is growing in the manufacturing sector, and DuPont sales volumes were flattish this quarter, which we view as a pause with gradual recovery likely to resume in 2012.
Recovery has been slower in Europe except for Germany, which had experienced a strong export recovery. There are parts of Europe that are in or near recession, and our own results for the third quarter indicate a very mixed bag. Volumes in Western Europe were down, while volumes in developing Europe, Middle East and Africa were up. We see pockets of opportunity in agriculture, nutrition, automotive markets and developing countries that are focusing on where the growth in these markets are and the subregions are very specifically.
Our Latin American growth outlook is positive for DuPont. We expect about half our 2011 sales in Latin America will be in the agriculture and nutrition and health segments, and we're positioned for growth in these segments.
Finally, we remain positive on Asia. We expect a soft landing in China, with GDP growth next year around 8%. There are certainly pockets of concerns such as inflation and currency effects, although these are outweighed by the positive impacts of growing local demand. We remain bullish on the continued growth prospects in that region.
Now let's shift to the broader markets. We expect robust ag fundamentals for the long term, driven by population growth and desire for more protein and healthier foods. These market trends can only be satisfied through innovative products that deliver greater value to the grower and the consumer. Today, DuPont has positive momentum coming from a strong planting season underway Latin America. At the same time, our sales reps and agronomists are working with farmers in Europe and North America during the fall harvest to make decisions for the 2012  planting season. These intimate conversations allow us to position the right product on the right acre, thus, optimizing farmer productivity and profitability for next season.
Global auto builds are expected to be up 5% in the fourth quarter with positive momentum in 2012, and while there may be destocking in the fourth quarter, the underlying demand signals point to volume growth next year. Electronic markets are soft right now, and as the upcoming holiday season plays out, we can better assess supply chain inventories and underlying demand heading into next year. Longer-term photovoltaic market should continue on a pace of growth of about 15% to 20% compounded annually, although we expect this growth trajectory to remain lumpy.
And finally with regard to titanium dioxide, the industry is now in its seasonally slow fourth quarter. We expect to see customers to be conservative and manage their year-end inventory in the uncertain economic environment. The pause we experience now is most evident in China given their actions to tighten fiscal policy and combat inflation, but if we look at TiO2 volumes sold in Asia, they're up only slightly year-over-year.
As we normally do, we'll take advantage of this seasonally low quarter to implement preventive maintenance at our plant sites, which have been running at extremely high sales capacity all year. And we expect to enter 2012 well positioned for the seasonal increase in demand, which usually peaks in the second quarter.
As we look ahead with all these factors in mind, it's important to remember that DuPont is a far different company than it was just a few years ago. Our portfolio has changed most recently with the addition of Danisco, and if you think about it broadly, nearly 1/3 of the company's sales are in Agriculture and Nutrition & Health segments on a pro forma basis for 2011 and compare that to roughly one quarter in 2008. We have further shaped the portfolio with restructuring including the permanent shutdown of certain underperforming assets, and if you add it up since 2008, we divested non-strategic assets with about $400 million in annualized sales.
In addition to shaping the portfolio, we are executing well. Innovation remains the backbone of the company with an arsenal of new products that deliver higher yields, healthier and better food, more efficient solar cells, more energy-efficient vehicles, new applications for personal protection just to name a few. 31% of last year's sales were from new products that were 4 years old or less, and productivity continues to be a way of life. We implemented $1 billion in fixed cost productivity in 2009 and expect an additional $900 million between 2010 and 2011. We implemented working capital productivity of a similar magnitude. Based in part on our innovation and productivity success, segment margins excluding pharma are 230 basis points higher year-to-date compared to the first 3 quarters of 2008.
Today, DuPont is well positioned to navigate uncertain times. We stay close to our markets, plan for short-term contingencies and continue to execute well. Our best is yet to come.
Karen, I'll turn it back to you for questions."

I think one of the biggest changes that we've made since 2008 is to really get downstream and understand, not just what our distributors or converters are telling us, but what the real demand is, and let me use like photovoltaics as an example. The biggest difference that occurred in the last 3 months is our understanding of the inventory in that channel, and that's why we are saying that the fourth quarter's going to be slower than we were thinking a quarter ago and that a recovery will occur in the 2012. So -- but everybody is cautious. There's a lot of lack of confidence going on out there. And I mean we see that, the other example I'd give you is in automotive where builds were up. We saw positive volume in OEM paint and saw negative volume or destocking in polymers, and it's -- we're building the same amount of cars and penetration rates are very similar. So the difference is the confidence factor there. So I think I'd go back to the biggest difference is our ability to get the information, our ability to use that and convert it into action and take it to the bottom line from a productivity standpoint and keeping focused on those programs. But I'll tell you, this is something that our leadership team is dealing with and focused on day in day out because we want to make sure that we're there for our customers who have volume needs and that we're taking the appropriate actions if volume is a little light. So it's a daily focus."

All -- as we take a look at the market and the market forecast, we put in all of the kind of impact on subsidies. Now if you take a look at it, when these subsidies come down, a lot of times the economics are matching with the reduction in price on the modules, and so then the economics of the installation is not really changed. And so all of these things we've taken into account. But I think the biggest difference is that it is not that the installs are slowing down. The builds are slowing down because of the inventory that's been built up in the channel, and so we as we dissect that -- and we spend a lot of time on that in the last 3 months -- we're pretty confident in that 15% to 20% growth rate long term. Just to give you a look on the year, we're pretty confident that the data on installs of 18.8 gigawatts is right. What we did not have as clear a view on in July as we do today is the amount of inventory, the number of gigawatts in inventory. Back in July, it was looking more like 4 to 5. Now I've seen ranges as high as 9 in inventory, and that's why we think that the -- it will impact the production schedules there."

It's clear that import costs are rising, but at the same time, price is normally dictated by availability and capacity utilization of the assets. In the last couple of years, I guess since 2008, there's been 5% capacity taken out of the high-end pigment market. So we're dealing with less capacity today for the high-end product than we did 3 years ago. You always have to balance those things, but the one thing that's clear is that we know that it's a commodity, and it will come and go and it has over the years, and the most important part for us is to continue to focus on the long-term fundamentals, continue to focus on our advantage manufacturing process technology and continue to work with customers.

I don't think we've ever been stronger.

When you look at the $0.13 earnings per share that we were above the street's expectation, and you dial in the $0.05 on the Ag side that we're talking about from quarter 4 that showed up in quarter 3. Along with my comments around currency, we were anticipating in our numbers, and we had given you guidance of a $0.04 benefit on currency in the fourth quarter. Those 2 together give you $0.09, which is that $0.04 we're talking about in our midpoint increase. You can calculate it looking at the street's expectation of $0.52 for the quarter and do a similar type calculation, and you get very much in line with where we are today around our range.

And as you well know, the contributions to pension is driven by the PPA side versus GAAP on the accounting piece of it. When we look at the PPA requirements there around our pension, there's a couple of factors that come into play. Obviously, the discount rate is an important factor and can sway the numbers considerably. And to be honest with you, we are now locked in on our discount rate. We had that locked in, in the September election. And the other factor is the return on the assets, and I've seen the return on assets swing several hundred basis points in a period of 2, 3 months, so it's difficult to pin down exactly what the cash contribution might be for the pension in 2012. But I guess I would say, if I was to look at things exactly the way they are today, John, and assume that nothing changes from a market perspective between now and year end, you're probably looking at something in the range of several hundred million versus anything like $1 billion.

268053,114989048,1759992,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Great. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone.

Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. The DuPont delivered a strong finish to a great year. And during the fourth quarter and throughout the year, we've been steadfastly focused on our 2010 directives with disciplined execution across the board. Our consistent focus on market-driven innovation, cost and capital productivity and differential allocation of resources delivered very strong results for the year. We will look back on 2010 as the year we benefited from recovery, created our own momentum and emerged as a stronger, well-positioned company.
We did it by building on the aggressive actions we took in response to the global financial crisis, and I'm not just talking about the restructuring and cost-cutting, I'm referring to the thoughtful, strategic choices that we made, specifically to prepare for global economic recovery and truly emerge a more agile and disciplined company.
To site just a few examples, we accelerated the implementation of DuPont production systems at our plant site. We redeployed employees on megaprojects to structurally reduce working capital, and we made tough choices on underperforming assets, and we had the fortitude not to cut our R&D spend. 
Our 2010 results are summarized on Slide 2. So with that winded in a way that is consistent with our internal set of directives. We delivered sales growth of 21% with a wide variance by business reflecting how different markets were affected by the global financial crisis, and how our businesses responded.
We delivered strong topline growth in areas that were minimally affected by the global crisis such as production agriculture and photovoltaics. These businesses executed well with new product launches, share gains, improved margins and strong momentum as we head into 2011. We also delivered outstanding growth at certain businesses benefited from early recovery and restocking such as TiO2, electronics, parts of our chemical businesses and polymers. As an example, we were prepared when auto builds recovered more than twice as fast as expected last year. 
Certain industrial markets were slower to recover as expected. Mid-cycle businesses, such as  Nomex and Kevlar, started to rebound midyear. And while their recovery has been a bit more muted, we expect more to come in 2011. In the meantime, we continue to develop new applications for fine denier Kevlar in anticipation of the Cooper River plant startup, which will occur later this year.
Finally, construction markets remained weak throughout the year. While total company sales were up 21% for the year, sales in developing markets grew 27%. We delivered exceptionally strong performance in China and India. Sales in greater China, including Taiwan, were over $3.3 billion, increasing more than 50%. All of our segments contributed to this growth with especially strong results in Electronics and Communications and Performance Materials. Sales in India were up over 40% to $678 million with the biggest gains coming from our Performance Chemicals and Ag & Nutrition segments.
The backbone of our topline growth this year remains market-driven innovation. Our steadfast investment in R&D-driven recession allowed us to intensify our efforts in new product introductions. So we did it by staying close to our customers, and I mean that literally as well as figuratively. We partnered with customers to run product tests and commercial prove outs in their facilities. New product introductions were up 23% in 2010 on the heels of a 60% increase in 2009.
Moving on to costs, we delivered more than $650 million in fixed cost productivity and benefits from restructuring. We exceeded our original goal of $600 million. We're poised to deliver an additional $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011. Raw materials were up 6% last year, and our price increase more than covered higher costs with an impressive full year spread of $0.44, something we could only deliver because our customers recognize the value and competitive advantage that our products provide.
Finally, we ended the year with free cash flow of $3.1 billion. This was buoyed by working capital productivity improvements of over $700 million, well ahead of our $400 million goal. If 2010 was the year of emerging stronger, then 2011 will be the year of building on our momentum. And I'll come back with more thoughts on 2011 at the end of the call. First, Nick will review our financial performance in more detail. Nick?"
268053,114989048,1759992,"EI DuPont de Nemours & Co., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","EIDP, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ellen. Good morning, everybody.

I'm sitting here that way because DuPont had a great quarter and a solid finish to the year. As the global economy recovers, we grow volume and price up in all major regions of the world. This quarter's performance continues to build on the strong foundation that we've laid over the past two years. You know, 2010 was a transformational year for the company as we began to replace pharmaceutical royalties with profitable growth from all other business units.
Let's just take a minute to review some of the great accomplishments that we've had versus our goals. Let's start with Slide 3, which is a summary of the earnings per share and sales results. Fourth quarter reported earnings per share were $0.40, which includes a $0.10 charge for onetime items. These items include a $0.13 per share charge relating to early extinguishment of debt and a charge of $0.03 per share for upfront license payment. These charges were offset by couple of benefits. We had a $0.04 benefit relating to the reversal of a tax valuation allowance and a $0.02 benefit per share for the partial reversal of prior year's restructuring charges.
Earnings per share on an underlying basis were $0.50 compared to $0.44 in the prior year. When you look at consolidated net sales, you see $7.4 billion, which was up 15% versus the prior year, comprised of 12% volume gains, 6% positive local price and 2% negative currency impact on a 1% reduction from some portfolio changes. Volume was up in all segments and in all major regions of the world. Local currency prices were also up in all regions, and this reflects our continued strong pricing discipline that we execute across all of our businesses.
Let's turn now to the segment review, and let's begin with Ag & Nutrition on Slide 4. Fourth quarter sales increased 13% to $1.5 billion with $117 million pretax seasonal losses. Sales were up in all businesses with robust volume growth in both Seed and Crop Protection. For the full year, our teams delivered 10% sales growth, 15% earnings growth and a 70 basis point PTOI margin expansion. These results were delivered despite competitive pressures across all markets as our disciplined business models and our intense focus on the growers prevailed. And I have to tell you, this momentum will continue into 2011.
Taking a closer look within this segment. Crop protection product sales for the quarter excluding the divested businesses impact, increased significantly on global demand for Rynaxypyr insect protection products and picoxystrobin fungicide products.  Regionally, volume increases were broad-based with particular strength in Latin America, offsetting weaker prices across most regions. For the full year of 2010, crop protection product sales, excluding divested businesses impacted, were up moderately. Our volume increase was led by Rynaxypyr, which approached an impressive $400 million in global sales after just three years in the market.
U.S. dollar pricing remained relatively flat versus prior year. We outperformed the market based on the strength of our new products. The team executed their strategy, delivering increased sales, earnings and margins while making key pipeline advancements that provided for continued growth and profits for the future.
Moving onto Seeds. Fourth quarter sales of $582 million increased 25%, reflecting 12% volume growth across all regions, 10% increase in U.S. dollar prices and 3% favorable portfolio change. Volume growth reflects a strong start to the North American season for both corn and soybeans. In addition, Latin America corn and soybeans were up. Brazil soybean volume increases were due to the late start to their season as a result of some weather. 
Both regional increases were partly offset by sales pattern shift to the first quarter in Europe. Price was flat to up and each region, attributable to lower validation of pioneer products and services. The earnings impact of higher sales and stronger equity contribution from China performance on Seed earnings were offset primarily by postseason activities as well as growth investments.
For the full year 2010, our Pioneer team delivered another year of mid-teens sales growth and high-teens earnings growth. Success was underpinned by increased acreage, share gains in North America, technology penetration in Brazil and success growing in China. Specifically, 2010 Seed sales were up 14% to $5.3 billion, reflecting both volume and U.S. dollar price contributions.
For Nutrition & Health, sales for the quarter and full year were slightly up on increased specialty protein offerings, offset by commodity crush [ph] business. We continue to drive step change performance through productivity along with application development and differentiated offerings targeted at improved health, wellness and safety.
Looking ahead for the first half of 2011 for the Ag & Nutrition segment, we expect to increase sales and earnings moderately. Key value drivers include seed and crop protection products; volume growth and net price improvements in Seed business, offset by slight currency headwinds; and growth investments weighted more heavily to the first half. The split of the quarters, one and two, will play out over the next few months, but our current assumptions are for growth to be split evenly between the quarters.
Now let's turn to Slide 5. Electronics & Communications segment. Sales of $773 million improved 33% compared to the same period last year with 24% from volume improvement and 9% higher prices. Pricing was primarily metal pass-through. Pretax earnings of $98 million up $37 million higher than the same period last year. Strong performance was led by Asia Pacific with 50% revenue growth followed by U.S. and Europe at 14% each. Photovoltaic sales in total, including sales in our other segments, were over $1.1 billion in 2010, which was more than double the 2009 results.
For the full year, the Electronics & Communications segment grew sales 44% and delivered PTOI margins of 16%, a significant improvement from 2009 margins. For the first quarter, instead of the normal seasonal decline, we expect sales into consumer electronics markets to be flat to slightly up. We continue to anticipate PV market growth around the 20% for this year. Electronics & Communications sales are expected to be substantially above prior year, including the impact of higher metal prices.
Now on Slide 6, you'll see Performance Chemicals segment. Sales of $1.7 billion increased 26%, primarily due to 14% higher price and 13% higher volume. Both DTT and DC&F had greater than 20% sales growth this quarter. The sales growth was broad-based across all regions with Asia Pacific and North America serving as the largest contributors. The markets for titanium dioxide and industrial chemicals, grew with the global recovery and resulted in a PTOI of $315 million, which is a 51% increase year-over-year. The impact to the bottom line was further enhanced through the ongoing productivity initiatives such as DuPont Production Systems and DuPont Integrated Business management.
For the full year, Performance Chemicals sales were up 27%, principally on 18% volume and 10% price and crossing the billion-dollar PTOI mark for the first time. As we move into 2011, we see continued growth in the various markets where we participate. For the first quarter, sales will be up significantly. Sales to capacity continues to be tight for most of Performance Chemicals markets. And as a result, we will continue to focus on debottlenecking incremental capacity expansion to drive both earnings and productivity.
Now let's turn to Slide 7, Performance Coatings. Segment sales of $1 billion increased by 3% on stronger volume with local pricing gains offset by currency. Demand was driven by continued strengthening in heavy-duty truck markets in North America and Europe and growth in the global automotive market. PTOI was $71 million, essentially flat versus prior year. For the full year, Coating sales were up 11% on 9% volume, supported in part with global auto builds up 22%. Earnings were up 3x on sales and strong productivity results.
As we move into 2011, we expect global auto builds to be up about 5% with a 4% increase in the first quarter. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly year-over-year with essentially flat margins.
Turning now to Performance Materials on Slide 8. Sales were up 11% with 9% volume and 5% selling price increases, partially offset by some minor portfolio changes. Continued strength in the automotive, electronics and packaging markets helped drive the growth despite some supply chains destocking by our customers in order to manage their year-end inventory positions.
For the full year, Performance Materials had sales of $6.3 billion, a 32% increase over prior years and are $978 million, which is more than triple its earnings from a year ago. For the first quarter, we expect sales to be up modestly. Packaging and products demand remains stable, and as you heard with Performance Coatings, global auto builds continue to rise albeit at a much more modest pace. We also expect to benefit from some anticipated restocking in the supply chains.
On Slide 9, you see the Safety & Protection segment. Sales climbed 13% on improved volume with the standouts being Europe growing sales by 17% and Asia Pacific at a 19% rate. Strong demand from industrial markets was responsible for the growth and led to increased sales of Nomex and Tyvek. PTOI was $92 million, a decrease due to higher raw materials, higher spending aramids growth initiatives and an asset impairment that was partially offset by a separate gain on an asset sale.
Additionally, this quarter, we closed our acquisition of MECS, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of DuPont Sustainable Solutions. As you recall, MECS is the leading global provider of sulfuric acid process technology, increasing our addressable market in clean air and clean fuel offerings. DuPont Sustainable Solutions is now fully engaged in integrating and leveraging MECS's capabilities in the clean tech space.
For the full year 2010, Safety & Protection had sales of $3.4 billion, which is a 20% increase over prior year. Market dynamics improved as we move through the year for this mid-cycle business with notable strength in industrial and automotive markets. For the year, Safety & Protection earned $449 million. Looking at the first quarter of 2011, the market fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in industrial and in automotive. Sales are expected to be significantly higher with improved PTOI margins.
Now let's turn to the corporate view of the fourth quarter looking at the earnings per share variance analysis on Slide 10. Starting with price and variable costs, the quarter showed a net benefit of $0.06 per share. This reflects the difference between price and variable cost, excluding the impact of both currency and volume. Driven by our innovation and pricing discipline, we've been very proactive over the past year implementing price increases in the face of anticipated increases in variable costs. On a full-year basis, this spread is a positive $0.44 per share.
Excluding volume, currency and portfolio impacts, fourth quarter raw material, energy and freight costs were up versus last year fourth quarter, where many of our raw materials had reached a low point. For the full year, we saw an increase in our raws of 6% over 2009. As we look forward to 2011, we expect to see continued pressure on raw materials, energy and freight cost. And we're now forecasting an increase of about 4% to 5%.
Volume improvement resulted in an incremental earnings benefit of $0.21 per share compared to the same period, previous year. As I mentioned earlier, this benefit is broadly based across all segments and major regions with double-digit increases in Asia Pacific and Latin America. There is a graph depicting sales by geographic region shown on Slide 11.
Continuing with the variance analysis, let's move to fixed cost. Excluding currency, volume and portfolio impacts, fixed cost reduced earnings by $0.21 per share versus last year. These includes an $0.08 incremental non-cash pension charge, along with actions in the fourth quarter to support growth such as increased investment in CR&D and some specific marketing initiatives.
On a full-year basis, our fixed costs are 42% of sales versus 46% last year. So you can see we're well on our way to meeting our target of fixed costs being 39% of sales in 2012. Concurrent with taking actions to support growth, DuPont delivered more than $650 million of fixed cost savings, ahead of our commitment to deliver $400 million in fixed cost productivity and $200 million in incremental restructuring benefits for the full year.
As we told you during our Investor Day last month, we'll deliver yet another $300 million of fixed cost productivity in 2011. In addition to the productivity and growth, we expect our full year 2011 incremental non-cash pension expense to be $60 million pretax, which is about $140 million lower than we had previously communicated, reflecting favorable movements in both the discount rates and the asset returns.
For the fourth quarter, currency was a headwind of $0.03. And for the first quarter, we expect a similar year-over-year headwind. The other category on the waterfall shows a negative $0.08 variance. Reduced pharmaceutical earnings were at $0.14 negative impact. Fourth quarter Pharma earnings were $87 million, about in line with our expectations and $160 million below prior year. Our full-year 2011 estimate for Pharma pretax earnings is about $200 million or approximately $290 million less than what we realized in 2010.
The last points on the earnings-per-share waterfall chart is the fourth quarter 2010 tax base rate, which was an $0.11 benefit versus prior year. The base tax rate this quarter was a negative 14.9% versus a positive 16.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. We have two primary drivers for the negative tax rate in the quarter. The first is a lower-than-expected full-year tax rate, reflecting a more favorable geographic mix of earnings in low-tax jurisdictions outside of U.S.; the full benefit of which was realized in the quarter.
The change in our total year expected tax rate must be adjusted in the fourth quarter, hence the incremental lower rate is applied to full year's earnings. Secondly, the U.S. tax law changes, including the R&D tax credit, were all recorded during this quarter. For those of you who used our prior guidance of 23% full-year tax rate for 2010, we estimate the difference between that tax rate and our actual full-year base tax rate of 18.8% results in about the $0.18 per share benefit range.
In light of the favorable geographic mix of earnings and U.S. R&D tax credit, we are lowering our guidance for our 2011 base tax rate from 22% to 23% to a new range of 20% to 21%.
Let's turn now to the balance sheet and cash that's shown on Slide 12. We ended the year with $3.1 billion of free cash flow versus our goal of greater than $1.7 billion. This outstanding performance is a result of strong sales in earnings throughout the year and equally strong commitment to productivity. Keep in mind, this includes a previously unforecasted $500 million voluntary contribution to our principal U.S. pension plan that was made in September.
During 2010, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and end of the year with a net debt of $3.5 billion, $1.4 billion less than our position in December of 2009. As you recall, we committed to $1 billion of working capital productivity over a three-year period beginning in 2010. Based on net working capital levels, we delivered more than $700 million of that in the 2010 year. Here again, we have a process around working capital productivity to ensure that we continue to deliver on these commitments. And I’ll reaffirm to you our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million in 2011.
Regarding dividends, yesterday, our Board of Directors approved our 426 consecutive quarterly dividend. Our long-held strategy has been to maintain a strong balance sheet and return excess cash to shareholders unless the opportunity to invest for growth is compelling. In summary, for the fourth quarter, the year-over-year volume growth that started out in the fourth quarter of 2009 continued and expanded throughout 2010. This, along with our pricing discipline and productivity focus, delivered strong quarterly results as well as for the full year.
Turning to the first quarter of 2011, we expect the recovery that we've seen in our businesses to continue but in a more moderate pace than we've experienced to date. As you heard described earlier, we continue to see strong demand globally across many of our businesses. In addition, we expect continued growth in our Ag & Nutrition segment. For our full-year 2011 outlook, DuPont leadership team remains steadfast and confident in our business plans and our ability to execute against those plans.
We are raising our guidance from a range of $3.30 to $3.60 per share to a new range of $3.45 to $3.75 per share. This, of course, excludes the impact of the planned initial acquisition, which could reduce 2011 earnings by $0.30 to $0.45 per share on a reported basis. The driver for the increase in our guidance is our lower tax rate, driven by increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions outside of the U.S., and reduced non-cash pension expense. These benefits are partially offset by an increased share count.
We ended 2010 with 932 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis versus our original estimate during the Investor Day of 915 million shares or about 2% additional shares, representing a $0.06 per share headwind in 2011. This increase in guidance is based on our confidence and our continued ability to deliver results.
On Slide 13, looking strictly at segment pretax operating income, excluding significant items, we saw 39% growth in 2010. And if you exclude Pharma, our growth was nearly 80%. As I said in the start, we have a plan for 2010, and we executed against that plan. First, we put our innovation to work and grew our businesses across the globe. Second, we drove productivity to expand our margins. And third, we delivered strong cash performance and reduced net debt by $1.4 billion. We executed extremely well this year and we expect continued positive results in 2011. Now I'll turn it back over to Ellen."

Last month at our Investor Day, we shared our plans for continued strong growth.

Last month at our Investor Day, we shared our plans for continued strong growth. We raised the performance targets on our businesses, and we detailed our financial assumptions and growth targets for 2011. And two weeks ago, DuPont cemented its position as the leader industrial biotechnology with our announcement to acquire Danisco. Both companies are working hard to drive through the legal and regulatory milestones to close the transaction. Today, we are right where we expected to be in this process, having received approval from the data financial authority and launched a tender offer for Danisco shares last week.
We continue to expect the close of the transaction early in the second quarter subject, of course, to the regulatory reviews. I'd like to update you on our integration effort. I've selected Jim Collins, as the integration leader for our planned acquisition. You know Jim from his stellar leadership of the Crop Protection business. What you may not know is that Jim has been part of several previous integration teams including Pioneer, Griffin LLC and Protein Technologies International, that now known as Soleil[ph] . And Jim brings an excellent track record of delivering results, and his passion and knowledge on the food and biotech areas makes him the right person for the job. Now as we committed to you during our Danisco announcement, we will keep you updated on our progress in this tender. And during the integration, and Jim will be a key part of this growth story.
As we move through the process in Denmark, we will keep you posted. And I do want to underscore one important point. We won a competitive process with a full and fair price, giving Danisco shareholders an attractive premium for their investment that also reflects in the future value, we believe, this combined company can deliver for our own investors. My commitment to you is that we will stay disciplined throughout the tender offer process and the integration and keep you apprised when we achieve key milestones.
Of course, we've known Danisco and Genencor as our partners for the past decade, and one key personality trait our company share is our commitment to science and innovation. For DuPont, science and innovation are the engines that drive our growth and what sets us apart from our peers, and whether it's product introduction that drives higher value and higher margins, or whether it's manufacturing excellent or proprietary technology that contribute to our low-cost position, science and innovation remain critical to our success at DuPont.
When I talk about science and innovation at DuPont, I'd like give samples of how they translate into commercial success. The examples I'll share with you have the distinction of having just won a DuPont Excellence Award, that's a very prestigious recognition within the company. One of our Excellence Awards was earned by a team from Crop Protection, which launched a program in 2009 called PrecisionPac. Now PrecisionPac is a dispensing system designed by DuPont and provided to retailers so they can customize both the formulation in a very precise amount to [indiscernible] herbicides to meet individual grower needs. The system design had to make some formidable challenges both in its precision and its safe handling of the component.
Retailers had to be trained and serviced in a different way, and in the end this was a very successful program. It was well-designed and well executed. Retailers were delighted to offer custom solution to their growers. And we saw sales growth against generic competition who could not follow with solutions tailored to the individual grower needs.
Another Excellence Awards comes from our Electronic & Communications business. It was approached back in 2008 to develop a new black [indiscernible] for using copper lace for printed flexible circuit to be used by our auto OEM, who was interested in an all-black cylinder to complement this sleek designs. The conventional film is amber in color. So our multi-functional team came together and developed a product and delighted this OEM customer, but it didn't stop there. They leveraged this new material and applications for smartphones, notebooks and tablet PCs. And these are just two of our excellent award winners, and there are many, many other outstanding examples of excellence in science and innovation when the an awards ceremony here in Wilmington last week where we honored all the winners.
I want to close by reiterating that I expect 2011 to be a year for DuPont to build on our hard-earned momentum. When we designed the accountability structure that we put in place starting in 2009, one of my priorities was to have the flexibility to accommodate potential acquisitions. Meaning that our organizational and reporting structure needed to enable our businesses to stay focused on delivering results, while an integration team went about its work. And now our people have more than a full year under their belts and this accountability structure and the structure has worked the way we planned. And we welcome the integration task that we have ahead of us, and we will stay focused on fulfilling our directives for 2011 day-by-day and quarter-by-quarter.
We have another exciting year ahead of us, and we have the resources, the growth plans, the disciplined processes and market momentum. In summary, the focus is on execution, and I expect the same executional excellence from my leadership team this year as they demonstrated in 2010. And with that, I'm happy to take your questions."

Automotive sales in 2010 or builds in 2010 in China were a very -- contributed greatly to our results. And kind[ph] of two markets were strong and hit record highs in sales. A lot of that underpinning is their domestic consumption, which is on the rise in China. And although as a country, their GDP was probably 10-ish percent last year, it's going to moderate but only to 9% this year. So a very modest moderation as we continue to focus. For instance, auto build, China were up 10%, they're predicted to be the same. So we do think we have momentum in China. We have positioned ourselves very well in some key segments, and I think you'll continue to see us making progress in that area."

And as I mentioned in the dialogue there, that's really a pass through for us on our Electronics segment. Some other raw materials that they're going to be seeing some increases that we're forecasting are things like ethane, HMD, [ph] acid, chlorine, some of our solvents or some of our pigments. Those are the areas where we see raw materials continuing to rise throughout the year. When you look at our ability to price that in the marketplace, obviously that's going to vary from business to business. But if you look at, for instance, some of those things I mentioned relating to our TiO2 business, the market remains extremely tight in that area. And the other things I'll mention, Lucy, is the work we've done around pricing for value throughout the Corporation over the last several years really serves as well in environments such as that."

But for talking purposes,  I think you can think about the write up of PP&E, that type of thing, as ongoing.

And then the other one, which is going to represent a lion's proportion of that,  is the inventory piece.

So when you look at our geographic sales base and where we're operating, what we're saying is, on an ongoing basis, the 20% to 21% rate is more reflective of our underlying businesses and where they are participating around the world.

In the U.S., GDP is going to be the same in '11 as it was in '10. The biggest change in the U.S, from our perspective, is going to be the automotive industry. Whereas in 2010, I think, U.S. and Canada were up over 30% overnight and '11, it was only, I guess, 11%. So we're going to see a moderating growth in the automotive, still. And so our growth rate that we saw in the U.S. for the year, which was well under the double digits is going to be probably more in the high single-digit numbers and the like of that. So the U.S., I think, is going to continue to have some strength because of 10% automotive growth as well as good Ag season in that. Europe is going to have a mix recovery pictures. So we think that it's going to be continued, a little bit stronger, maybe 2.5 GDP in Germany, and there's a strong export market. We're not expecting much out of automotive there. Eastern Europe's going to come back more strongly, probably -- well, actually moderating there. So I think Europe is going to be a mixed picture as we go forward. Asia Pacific is going to be an area of strength for us between where automotive is, between where photovoltaics are and electronics are, and things like TiO2 and an increasing Ag position there. That Europe we're going to see, kind of growth rate, it may not be reflective of last year like 50% in China but they're going to be very, very strong. In Latin America, I think you're going to see there that all the automotive is not going to drive Ag outside our business there, Ag & Nutrition will. And so I think, you are going to see some well above-GDP growth in Latin America. GDP in Latin America is about 4% in 2011 is what our estimates are. So I think that our position in Ag, our position in TiO2, photovoltaics and the recovery in Safety & Protection are going to bode well for our volume 2011."

There has been a number of questions on 2011 and our outlook, and we see tremendous opportunity going forward given our diversed portfolio, given our broad geographic footprint, with markets that are in various stages of growth and recovery, 2010 was all about execution and delivering on our commitments. And we provided updates throughout the year, and you consistently heard me talk about three themes: Number one, the power of DuPont innovation; Second, productivity as a way of life with a disciplined managing process in place and third, differential portfolio of management with resources going to the highest growth of opportunity and accountability for results. So my point is, we executed well in 2010, and you should expect the same from us in 2011. And we look forward to updating you as the year unfolds. Thank you for joining us today."
