Yesterday, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2011financial results. The news release, as well as corresponding supplemental financial information, is available on our website at assurant.com.
Some of the statements we make during today's call may contain forward-looking information. Our actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements can be found in our 2010 Form 10-K, which can be accessed from our website. 
The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. Additionally, the presentation will contain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are meaningful in evaluating the company's performance.

Our first quarter results are consistent with our commitments made during our investor day last month. Though overall growth remains a challenge, we were encouraged by sales results in several of our targeted areas. We continue to provide products and services that offer value to our customers.
For the quarter, our annualized operating return on equity was 12.5% and our diluted book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income increased 3% since year end.
Turning toward the businesses, I’ll begin with Assurant Solutions, which is off to a good start this year with profits up by $9 million versus the first quarter of last year. We are starting to see the payback from Solutions’ risk management improvements implemented during the past few years.
The addition of new clients sets the stage for longer-term revenue growth at Solutions. However, 2011 revenues will be similar to 2010 levels because of the runoff of Circuit City business and the continued decline in the U.S. credit insurance business.
Pre-need had another good quarter in both sales and profitability as our partnership with SCI continues to help grow this business. 
Assurant Solutions products and services revolve around asset protection, peace of mind, and ease of doing business - a winning value proposition. Looking ahead, we believe Solutions is on track to produce a sustainable double-digit return on equity in 2012. 
Let’s turn next to Assurant Specialty Property, which had another strong quarter. We continue to see market contraction in the number of mortgage loans outstanding. Our results were essentially flat compared to last year after adjusting both periods for disclosed items. 
New clients added in 2010 helped to sustain the number of loans we track, which helped maintain gross and premiums. Process improvements are controlling expenses even as the business adds new clients and tracks more loans.
Adjacent products including renter’s insurance contributed nicely to overall results. This is an area we are targeting for growth and we are encouraged by the results. Net earned premiums in our other product categories were up 5% from the prior year.
We realize there are many changes being contemplated for the lending and mortgage servicing industries. Assurant Specialty Property complies with the regulations applicable to our business and will continue to do so.
We believe lender-placed insurance, which provides required coverage without any underwriting of individual properties, remains an important backstop for homeowners and lenders. Assurant Specialty Property is well-positioned to serve this market by providing great customer service supported by a sophisticated tracking platform. During 2011, we expect continued good performance at Specialty Property.
Weather activity will be the major variable impacting earnings. The recent April storm activity has created hardships for individuals we insure. I am proud to say our employees have responded quickly and we are making claim payments to policyholders in their time of need.
Longer-term, we anticipate placement rates for our lender-placed products will return to lower levels and we are managing our business accordingly. We believe this transition will take several years.
Next I’ll turn to Assurant Health. First quarter sales results and expense reductions demonstrate early progress in adapting to the new healthcare landscape. Both are key to transforming this business. We recognize, however, we are in the early innings, and must remain vigilant to achieve success.
This quarter we accrued a new obligation for premium rebates in our financial statements to comply with the minimum loss ratio requirements of healthcare reform. The sales of our new product portfolio increased sequentially. 
Our products were designed through extensive consumer research. We now have a new suite of products which offer customers affordable choices. We are encouraged by the early positive sales trends, which indicate that customers and distribution partners are seeing value in the products we offer. 
The [other] key to transformation is reducing expenses. We have made progress in the quarter on both a sequential and year-over-year comparison basis. While our goals are simple, the task remains challenging. We must continue to generate new sales and drive expense efficiencies throughout 2011 and beyond. A better customer experience and a simplified business model will help us achieve these goals.
We continue to expect breakeven results for full-year 2011. Over the long-term, we remain confident in our commitment to achieving a 4% after-tax margin. For Assurant employee benefits, results for the quarter were disappointing. As we mentioned at investor day, in the first quarter disability claim recovery rates slowed, and we lowered the reserve discount rate for new claims. 
In addition, we also expensed higher group life mortality. Our dental results continue to improve, and our sales activity picked up during the first quarter. We experienced meaningful sales growth in our voluntary and supplemental products, which are important drivers of long-term growth. We expect the remaining quarter results in 2011 will have better earnings than the first quarter, despite a lower discount rate for LTD reserves and lower reinvestment yields.
Now I will turn to our capital management activities. We ended the quarter with $585 million of capital, without taking dividends from our operating companies. For the full year, we still anticipate that dividends will be equal to operating earnings. 
In the first quarter, we returned nearly $190 million to shareholders. We paid our quarterly dividend and we repurchased stock at a discount to book value. We continue to see buybacks as an appropriate use of our capital.
We will remain disciplined in deploying our capital for long-term profitable growth. Now, Mike will walk you through the operating results for each business. Mike?

Net operating income increased by 32% versus the first quarter of 2010. Underwriting improvement in the UK and good performance from our pre-need life insurance operations contributed to the increase in net operating income.
Domestically, net earned premiums declined for the quarter due primarily to the continued runoff of Circuit City and domestic credit insurance. Presidents from these key sources were approximately $50 million lower compared to the first quarter of 2010 and in line with our expectations.
As we mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, full-year Circuit City and credit premiums are expected to decline by about $170 million compared to 2010. Domestic service continued presence increased in the wireless, retail, and automotive channels during the quarter.
Domestic combined ratio was 96.1% for the quarter. We expect it to move higher during the year as Circuit City winds down, but our long-term target remains at 98%. As we mentioned at investor day, we expect to achieve approximately $10 million of expense reduction this year that will help mitigate the impact of the runoff lines of business over time.
Internationally, we saw an increase of approximately 5% in net earned premiums versus the first quarter of 2010 driven premium by clients in Latin America. Sales momentum continued as gross written premiums rose 3% due to both existing and new client sales growth. 
The international combined ratio decreased 260 basis points from the first quarter of 2010, driven by better European loss experience. Sequentially, the international combined ratio grew by 70 basis points as increased expenditures were necessary to support the growth in Latin America. Remember that in the service contract business, there’s a lag effect. We generally incur expenses to establish new clients before we benefit from the resulting production.
We remain on track for a 200- to 600-basis point improvement over the course of 2011 and the international combined ratio compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. As was the case last year, the pace of the improvement will vary by quarter. Our long-term target for this ratio remains at 95%.
Pre-need life insurance net operating income increased by $3 million versus the first quarter of 2010, approximately $2 million of the increase was due to the relative change in the value of the CPI cap versus last year. We have a strong business model in pre-need, and are pleased with the 12% increase in sales during the first quarter.
Turning now to Assurant Specialty Property, net operating income was approximately $103 million including just over $7 million of after-tax adverse claim reserve development from the previously reported Arizona hailstorms in the fourth quarter of 2010. We had no reportable catastrophes in the first quarter of last year.
The addition of new clients and loan portfolios during 2010 and an increase in the overall placement rate to 2.35% continued to sustain revenue in our lender pleased business. First quarter net earned premiums, however, declined, primarily due to additional seeding activity to clients and increase catastrophe reinsurance premiums. The drop was partially offset by a 5% increase in other premiums, primarily driven by growth in our renters’ insurance product.
Operational improvements, along with reduced commissions caused by increases in client-seeded premiums, lowered expense ratio for the quarter. On an adjusted basis, we were pleased with the year-over-year combined ratio comparison. The current period includes $11.4 million of catastrophe-related losses versus none in 2010, and 2010 premiums included a $13.6 million benefit from an unearned premium reserve review.
Turning to catastrophe reinsurance, we have already placed about 75% of the 2011 program. We expect the pricing for the remaining 25% to be in line with last year. We’ll issue a comprehensive update in June comprehensive update in June detailing our complete 2011 reinsurance program.
Several regions of the country have experienced very high storm activity in April. While still very early, our preliminary estimate is that reportable catastrophe losses from these events will be at least $15 million pre-tax, which will be reflected in our second quarter results. We’ll update this estimate as necessary as new information becomes available.
I’ll now turn to Assurant Health. It’s important to note that prior results for Health are not directly comparable to current results due to changes associated with healthcare reform, most notably the required accruals for premium rebates. 
First quarter net operating income was $7 million, results include a reimbursement of approximately $4.8 million after-tax from a pharmacy services provider related to 2009 and 2010 activity. The higher tax rate for the quarter resulted from changes in allowable deductions under healthcare reform.
Net earned premiums for the quarter were $426.2 million net of a rebate liability of $22.4 million. We estimate that the full-year rebate liability will be in the $80-90 million range. We reduced expenses by 15%, or $21 million, from a year ago, and the business continues to drive expenses down further.
At Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income decreased to $6.5 million. The drop was primarily due to the less-favorable life and disability experience versus prior quarters, and the impact of lowering the reserve interest rate. 
Improved dental results partially offset the decline. Disability experience reflected lower claimant recovery rates over most of our block. Incident rates remain relative stable overall, though we did see increases in a block of assumed reinsurance business. We will be closely watching future experience as it unfolds, and will take corrective action as needed.
As we mentioned at our investor day, we lowered the reserve interest rate assumption to 4.75% for new long-term disability claims as of January 1, 2011. The interest rate for claim incurred prior to 2011 remains at 5.25%. The 50 basis point reduction had a $1.3 million after-tax on first quarter income and is expected to have a $5 million after-tax impact for the year.
First quarter net earned premiums were down compared to first quarter 2010 and are expected to be down for all of 2011. Premium persistency is being adversely impacted by the pricing actions on the disability reinsurance business I mentioned earlier. Premiums were also adversely impacted by lower sales last year. Sequentially, net earned premium is down less than 1%.
While earnings were disappointing at Employee Benefits, growth initiatives to expand the products suite and improve persistency are gaining traction. Sales for the quarter improve 12% including a 22% increase in voluntary sales. 
Turning to the corporate segment, losses improved versus the prior year, primarily due to changes in tax liabilities. Corporate results vary from quarter to quarter, but we expect the full-year loss to be approximately $55 million after-tax. 
In the first quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for about $173 million, representing more than 4% of the shares outstanding at year end 2010. In the second quarter, through April 21, we repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for approximately $42 million. The number of shares we brought back last quarter and last year clearly indicate our willingness to return capital to shareholders.
In the current environment, we believe further buybacks are appropriate. However, the pace at which we will repurchase shares during the next two quarters could moderate due to the storm seasons and timing of dividends from the operating companies. In addition, rating agency views on capital requirements are always a factor we consider.
And with that, I’ll turn the call back to Rob.

And that’s what’s going on there. It’s all in the course of how we do things, so that’s kind of what contributed to things.

So a combination of things, and the other thing to keep in mind in terms of the activity through April 21, compare it to last year for example, last year we had identified early in the year some capital initiatives that we were going to deploy to get more capital out of the business beyond earnings, so we took dividends in excess of operating earnings of about $200 million last year. You don’t see that sort of number thank you. We will always try to be as capital efficient as we can at the operating segment level. But really, earnings and dividends are going to be much more closely related thy, which is why we’re going to continue to be disciplined, as we have been every year, about timing the repurchase activity loosely with the dividend plan for the individual segments.

These commitments include profitable growth, reducing expenses and improving ROEs. Here’s some examples from the quarter.
Profit improvement continues at Assurant Solutions as we grow our wireless service contract and preneed businesses. At Specialty Property we are increasing loans tracked in our lender-placed business and expanding our offerings to rental property managers.
Our new strategy at Assurant Health is gaining traction as we sell new affordable products to provide consumers access to the healthcare system. We are also demonstrating strong expense management and at Assurant Employee Benefits, sales of voluntary products are gaining momentum, as we help employers provide more benefits for their employees.
Now, I will highlight our progress at each business. I’ll begin with Assurant Solutions, results continue to improve. The global economy continues to be a headwind for Assurant Solutions but we are winning new clients. This demonstrates our products and services are meeting customer needs.
We are setting the stage for longer term profitable growth, combined ratios are improving, preneed place sales remain at healthy levels and our sales pipeline is strong for service contracts including wireless. New sales help offset the continued run off of Circuit City and the decline in the domestic credit insurance business.
Overall, solutions 2011 earned premiums will be similar to 2010. We expect earned premiums to grow in 2012. We are well-positioned to deliver on our commitment of a double-digit ROE in 2012 with continued improvements expected in the out years.
Moving to Assurant Specialty Property, quarterly results reflect the impact of unprecedented weather-related events. We are helping our customers affected by the severe storms and will continue to do so as they rebuild and repair their properties.
Our business model leverages a sophisticated tracking system that ensures structures are covered for damage. Our strategic focus on aligning with market leaders in mortgage servicing is again paying dividends.
During the quarter, one of our clients at quarter acquired a portfolio of 200,000 loans. We will begin tracking these loans later in 2011, with premium production beginning in 2012. Adjacency growth opportunities look promising. We are building our niche renters business, focused on distribution through property managers.
In June, we acquired SureDeposit, the market leader in rental security deposit alternatives. The SureDeposit product is offered by property managers serving 1.5 million apartments in 4,500 communities. This product is beneficial to both renters and property managers. Early feedback from SureDeposit clients reinforces that there are opportunities to grow revenue with our full product suite. We are pleased that SureDeposit’s management team and employees are now part of the Assurant family.
For the remainder of 2011, we expect properties premiums will be consistent with year-to-date results. Earnings will be dependent upon catastrophes, particularly hurricanes.
Next, I’ll turn to Assurant Health. Second quarter results reflect continued progress in implementing our strategy, both consumers and distribution partners are recognizing the value and affordability of our health access and supplemental products.
We also improved efficiency in our operations as evidenced by a reduction in quarterly expenses of almost $24 million from a year ago. This is a tremendous accomplishment. It demonstrates our ability to adapt to changing markets.
For the balance of 2011, we must continue to generate sales and drive further expense efficiencies a better customer experience and a simplified business model will help us achieve these goals. We are achieving early success with our redeemed strategy. As a result, we are raising our 2011 net operating income outlook from breakeven to between $15 and $20 million after tax.
Assurant Employee Benefits continues to be challenged by a lack of job creation. This hurts revenue and creates a difficult environment for returning claimants to work. While we are disappointed with overall profit results, we are encouraged by the improvements we are achieving in our dental business.
During the quarter, overall sales increased, led by the growth in our voluntary products. Local and regional brokers are increasingly interested in voluntary products in the aftermath of healthcare reform. We are providing them with marketing and training support to help them generate sales as part of our key broker program, remember the voluntary products are a targeted growth area for benefits. For the remainder of 2011, we expect modest sequential improvement, primarily driven by our dental business at Assurant Employee Benefits.
I’ll now turn to corporate matters. During the quarter, we took approximately $160 million in dividends from our operating companies. We continue to exercise discipline in managing our capital. We repurchased 3 million shares of our stock, increased our quarterly dividend by 13% and acquired SureDeposit.
Capital at the end of the quarter was $650 million, including the $250 million buffer for tail event risks. For the full year, we expect operating company dividends will roughly equal our earnings. We believe further buybacks are appropriate, given our share price and we expect to continue share repurchases throughout the year.

Let’s start with Assurant Solutions, where second quarter 2011 net operating income was just under $40 million, a 31% increase versus the second quarter of 2010. Improved underwriting results in Canada, Europe and domestic service contracts",1130,"Thanks, Rob. Let’s start with Assurant Solutions, where second quarter 2011 net operating income was just under $40 million, a 31% increase versus the second quarter of 2010. Improved underwriting results in Canada, Europe and domestic service contracts drove the year-over-year increase.
Domestic net earned premiums increased in the wireless, retail and automotive channels. These increases were offset by declines from the continued run off of Circuit City and our domestic credit business.
The domestic combined ratio was 96.6% for the quarter due to improved seasonal loss experienced in our wireless business and lower general expenses versus last year. We expect this ratio to move slightly higher in the second half of the year but it should be less than its 98% long-term target for the full year.
Internationally, net earned premiums increased 16% versus the second quarter of 2010, driven by growth in Latin America from both new and existing clients. Premiums and fees were up slightly in Europe as we focus on wireless opportunities.
The international combined ratio decreased 320 basis points from the second quarter of 2010. The improvement was driven by better loss experience in Canada and profitable growth in Latin America. Improved results in Europe due to the pricing actions taken in the U.K. and growth in the rest of the region positively affected the combined ratio as well.
The international results improved despite the increase in new wireless client implementations which temporarily pressure the combined ratio. For 2011, we remain on track for a 200 to 600 basis point improvement in the international combined ratio versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
Preneed’s net operating income increased 11% versus the second quarter of 2010. Our partnership with SCI continues to generate strong sales for the business, these sales in excess of $200 million during the quarter led to higher invested assets and a corresponding increase in investment income.
Turning now to Assurant Specialty Property, net operating income was approximately $43 million. This includes nearly $43 million of after tax reportable catastrophe losses versus approximately $5 million of such losses in the same period last year. As a reminder, we define a reportable catastrophe loss as an ISO event that results in a loss of $5 million or more.
The addition of new lender placed clients and loan portfolios during 2010 and an increase in the overall placement rate continued to sustain gross earned premiums in our lender placed business. Second quarter net earned premiums declined slightly due to additional premiums seeded to clients and increased catastrophe reinsurance premiums. Excluding the reportable catastrophe losses, the combined ratio increased for the quarter due primarily to an increase in the frequency of weather-related losses.
During the second quarter, we announced the completion of our catastrophe reinsurance program, although the rates were comparable to last year, we bought additional coverage since our exposure has grown so our reinsurance premiums will be approximately $25 million higher this year, complete details are available on our website.
Turning next to Assurant Health, please remember that current results are not directly comparable to prior year results due to changes in our business model and the premium rebate accruals required under healthcare reform.
Second quarter 2011 net operating income was $5.2 million. The sequentially lower effective tax rate in the second quarter was driven by the improved profit outlook for the year. Higher expected pre-tax profits mean that the new limits on certain tax deductions will have a smaller impact on our effective tax rate.
Earned premiums for the quarter were $425 million, net of a premium rebate accrual of $17 million. We now estimate that the full year premium rebate liability will be in the $70 to $80 million range.
Delivering on our commitment to reduce expenses was an important driver of results. During the quarter, we cut expenses by 17% or $24 million from a year ago. We’ve made significant progress in putting Assurant Health on a path to profitability in this challenging environment. Future profitability will be impacted by the pace of our evolving product mix as we modify our business model to serve the needs of consumers.
At Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income was $8.5 million. The year-over-year decrease was due primarily to less favorable disability and life experience including the previously discussed impact of lowering the reserve discount rate. Improved dental results partially offset the decline. Disability incidence rates remain in line with expectations. However, disability experience in the second quarter continued to reflect lower claimant recovery rates.
Second quarter net earned premiums were down compared to the second quarter of 2010 and we expect full year 2011 premiums to be down as well. The decrease reflects pricing actions on a block of previously assumed disability business and lower prior year sales.
Growth in voluntary and supplemental products improved persistency in our primary book and signs of organic growth are partially offsetting the overall premium decline.
Turning now to corporate matters, as part of our ongoing investment portfolio management activities, the company executed a number of transactions during the quarter that modestly shorten the duration of our portfolio. The tax treatment of some of these transactions allowed us to release a tax valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets. This increased our net income and book value per share and will add to corporate capital as we file future tax returns.
We were very pleased to announce the SureDeposit acquisition during the second quarter for $45 million. We expect the internal rate of return on this investment to be well in excess of our cost of capital and we have the potential for even higher returns as we market our expanded product offering to our customers and those of SureDeposit.
Annualized net earned premiums for the acquired business are approximately $35 million. In 2011, we expect to earn about $10 million of premiums and fee income since it will take several months to transfer existing business and begin writing new business in our insurance paper.
Approximately $26 million of the purchase price was recorded as intangible assets and the remaining $19 million was allocated to goodwill. The intangible assets will be amortized through our income statement over approximately nine years. We expect the transaction to be accretive to our earnings this year.
As Rob mentioned, during the second quarter we repurchased 3 million shares for $110 million, bringing the total of the first half of 2011 to 7.4 million shares at a cost of $284 million. In the third quarter through July 22nd, we repurchased an additional 512,000 shares for approximately $18 million. We continue to view our share price is undervalued and expect to continue to repurchase shares during the remainder of the year.
And, with that, I’ll ask the operator to open the call for questions.

Let me -- maybe start and give you a couple of reconciliations and then I’ll talk a little bit more about the outlook and some of the other elements of capital management. But, we started the first -- we ended the first quarter, excuse me, with $5",438,"Sure. Let me -- maybe start and give you a couple of reconciliations and then I’ll talk a little bit more about the outlook and some of the other elements of capital management. But, we started the first -- we ended the first quarter, excuse me, with $585 million of holding company capital in aggregate. We took $160 million of dividends.
We spent or returned about $127 million to shareholders, $17 million in the form of shareholder dividends and then $110 million of repurchases. That leaves you at about 620. Then corporate had some cash in-flows which is really just a reflection of timing differences of about $30 million.
Keep in mind, in the first quarter that cash outflows were about 60. So you are looking at, again, the difference between cash and accruals. That leaves you with the 650 at the end of the second quarter. What’s not in there, okay, is the $45 million purchase price of SureDeposit. What we did there was rather than take a dividend from Specialty Property from earnings and then send the money back down to buy SureDeposit, Specialty Property just wrote the check out of their first half earnings.
Now, if you think about -- let’s talk about first half results and then on a go-forward basis, got about $250 million of net operating income in aggregate for the first half, $160 million of dividends. That leaves 90 of earnings that are still at the segments available for dividends. We spent -- Specialty Property spent $45 million of that. So we got to think about it as the first half earnings that were available for dividends in the second half, about $45 million.
Now, in terms of kind of the outlook and Rob and Mike both mentioned that we are expecting to be in the market, repurchasing shares for the balance of the year, which includes through cat season. We feel very good about the capital position, $400 million of deployable capital, some additional earnings available from the first half, as I mentioned.
On the M&A front, there’s nothing imminent and given our process and our rigor around M&A, it’s more likely that the deals that will meet our criteria are going to be smaller deals, similar in size to SureDeposit which are not going to affect our ability to buy back shares. So, again -- and on top of that, we’ve got shares that are very undervalued.
We’ve got 11 -- we’re trading at $11 below book value. So share repurchase is an appropriate use of deployable capital. We expect to be doing that throughout the rest of 2011.

I think if you can look on the balance sheet a little bit at the unearned premium within Solutions and that’s growing, again, as Mike pointed out, the Lowe’s account is heavily reinsured right now. But we are working hard to figure out how we can add additional value to that account. But Solutions is definitely finding some opportunities out there we feel, like that momentum is starting, so that’s good.

We are pleased with our continued progress in executing our strategy.  While our results this quarter reflect considerable storm activity, our focus on creating sustainable value for our shareholders remains strong.  Our long-term goals center on three key operating metrics: first, operating return on equity.  We reported an 8.6% return on an annualized basis excluding AOCI.  Catastrophe losses from the storm activity during Q2 and Q3 impacted our ROE; however, we expect ROE will increase in Q4 and future years as our businesses work to improve performance.
The second is book value per diluted share.  Book value has grown 9.4% year-to-date excluding AOCI.  We expect to end 2011 with a double-digit increase in this measure.  Third is revenue growth.  Our total revenues have not grown in 2011 but we are encouraged that we continue to sign new clients and introduce new products in a difficult economic environment.  Let me provide some additional color on the quarter.
I’ll begin with Assurant Solutions.  We solidified our international presence, reduced expenses, increased our wireless reach and maintained strong pre-need sales.  These actions all have contributed to better profitability.  Solutions generated meaningful new sales, both domestically and internationally, in a challenging global environment.  This can be seen in our growth in gross written premiums.  Solutions is well positioned to deliver on its commitment of a double-digit ROE in 2012.  Longer-term, we remain focused on progress toward the goals we have outlined.
2011 net earned premiums and fees will be similar to 2010, but we expect modest top line growth in 2012.   International, domestic service contracts and pre-need will be the key contributors.  We will continue to build our capabilities to serve the wireless marketplace and manage our programs and expenses for continued improvement in the international combined ratio.
Moving to Assurant Specialty Property, quarterly results reflect the impact of catastrophe losses.  Our priority is to help our customers affected by severe storms and we continue to assist them as they rebuild and repair their homes.  Our strategy to align with market leaders combined with the investments we have made in our tracking system allow us to respond quickly when portfolios move between servicers.  This meets an important need for our clients.  We are pleased to report that the new client portfolio we mentioned last quarter was successfully implemented earlier than we had previously anticipated.  As a result, this portfolio will now generate premiums beginning in Q4 2011.  We are well positioned for the movement of loan portfolios that we expect will continue in 2012.  
Several years ago, insurance for renters was identified as an underserved market by our Specialty Property Team.  We created a different way to connect with customers by partnering with owners and managers of multi-family housing properties.  This business generates about $100 million in annual net earned premiums and fees and we anticipate growth will continue in 2012.  The acquisition of SureDeposit, the market leader in rental security deposit alternatives, expands our product offerings.  We are pleased with our integration progress and the acquisition was accretive during the quarter.
Next, I’ll turn to Assurant Health.  Q3 results reflect continued progress as we implement our strategy.  Sales of our new Health Access and supplemental product offerings continue to gain traction.  These products are designed to address affordability needs of consumers.  We also enhance technologies so our distribution partners can more effectively serve customers.  We continue to drive toward a streamlined structure that will allow us to succeed under the minimum loss ratio regulations, and through the first nine months of 2011 we significantly reduced expenses compared to last year. It’s important to remember that 2011 is just the first year of the implementation of healthcare reform.  Additional provisions of the legislation will affect reported results in future years, but our focus remains the same - to generate sales and to realize further expense efficiencies.  A better customer experience and a simplified business model will help us achieve these goals. 
Moving to Assurant Employee Benefits, our results improved sequentially.  Progress in helping claimants return to work was the primary reason.  Our strategic focus on distribution through key brokers and our expanded product offerings continued to improve sales of voluntary products.  During the quarter, more than half of new sales came from supplemental and voluntary products. 
Before I turn it over to Mike, let me turn to corporate matters.  Our capital position remains strong.  We ended the quarter with corporate capital at a similar level to last quarter.  Our strong capital position allowed us to repurchase shares during hurricane season as we outlined on our last call.  We continue to believe our share price is attractive.  Now, Mike will walk you through the operating results for each business.  Mike?

Let’s start with Assurant Solutions, where Q3 net operating income was just over $35 million, a 9% increase versus Q3 of 2010.  Improved international underwriting experience drove the year-over-year increase.  Domestic net earned premiums",1108,"Thanks, Rob.  Let’s start with Assurant Solutions, where Q3 net operating income was just over $35 million, a 9% increase versus Q3 of 2010.  Improved international underwriting experience drove the year-over-year increase.  Domestic net earned premiums and fees increased in the automotive and wireless channels.  These increases were offset by declines from the continued runoff of Circuit City and our domestic credit business.  For the full year 2011 these runoff businesses are expected to reduce premiums by approximately $170 million compared to 2010. 
The domestic combined ratio of 99.4% for the quarter was similar to the prior year.  The combined ratio was sequentially higher as we saw variability with certain clients but we still expect to achieve our full-year domestic combined ratio target of 98%.  Internationally, net earned premiums and fees increased 14% versus Q3 2010 driven by growth in Latin America from both new and existing clients.  
The international combined ratio of 101.5% was 260 basis points lower than Q3 2010.  Favorable results in Latin America primarily drove the improvement.  We expect the Q4 ratio to be roughly level with Q3 as the stubborn economy in Europe and client installation costs in Latin America temporarily slow the pace of improvement. Pre-needs net operating income increased slightly versus Q3 of 2010 as our partnership with SCI continued to generate strong sales.  
Turning now to Assurant Specialty Properties, net operating income was approximately $44 million.  This reflects about $52 million of after-tax reportable catastrophe losses including losses from widespread coastal flooding versus no comparable losses in the same period last year.  As a reminder, we define a reportable catastrophe loss as an iso. event that results in a loss of $5 million or more.  Excluding the reportable catastrophe losses, the combined ratio increased for the quarter primarily due to an increase in the frequency of non-catastrophe weather related losses.
The new clients we added last year, loan portfolio acquisitions by existing clients and an increase in the overall placement rate continued to sustain gross earned premiums in our lender placed business.  Q3 net earned premiums and fees declined slightly versus 2010 due to additional premiums ceded to clients and decreased catastrophe reinsurance premiums.  Growth in multi-family housing products including SureDeposit partially offset the decline in net earned premiums and fees.
The increase in placement rates continues to reflect difficulties in the housing market.  We believe they will begin to decline gradually as we outlined in our Investor Day presentation. The pace of the decline will depend on a number of factors including macroeconomic trends, government intervention, and client-specific portfolio characteristics.
Turning next to Assurant Health, I’ll again remind you that current results are not directly comparable to prior years due to changes in our business model and the premium rebate accruals required under healthcare reform.  Net earned premiums and fees for the quarter were $438 million net of a rebate accrual of $9 million.  Our estimates of rebate accruals continue to fluctuate as we adjust our product pricing and evaluate developing loss experience.  We now estimate the year-end rebate liability will be in the range of $60 million to $65 million.  Sales of our new Health Access and supplemental products continued to show improvement during the quarter.  
Delivering on our commitment to reduce expenses was an important driver of Health’s results.  Q3 expenses were $34 million less than they were in 2010.  Year-to-date we have reduced our run rate expenses by over $50 million versus last year.  We now expect full-year 2011 after tax net operating income for Health to be in a range of $20 million to $25 million.  This includes a one-time provider reimbursement of $4.8 million after tax disclosed in Q1 of this year.  It also includes approximately $12 million after tax of favorable claim reserve development relative to year-end 2010 reserves.  Beginning in 2012, reserve development on products subject to the MLR will be factored into the rebate calculation, thus reducing its contribution to reported earnings.
At Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income was $13.6 million.  The year-over-year decrease reflects the extremely favorable disability experience in Q3 2010 and the lowering of the reserve discount rate earlier this year.  Life and dental results were slightly improved versus Q3 last year.  Q3 net earned premiums and fees declined slightly versus last year and we expect full-year 2011 premiums to be down as well.  The decrease primarily reflects pricing actions on a block of previously assumed disability business and lower prior-year sales.  A $5 million single premium transaction during Q3 along with growth in voluntary and supplemental product sales partially offset the decline.
Turning to corporate matters, our capital position at the end of Q2 allowed us to continue to repurchase shares during Q3 despite indications of storm activity early in the cat season.  During Q3 we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $76 million.  Total repurchases for the first nine months of 2011 were 9.6 million shares at a cost of $360 million.  In Q4 through October 21st we repurchased an additional 652,000 shares for approximately $24 million. 
Going forward, we anticipate that full-year operating company dividends will at least equal operating earnings and our capital management priorities have not changed.  Our goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by investing in our businesses to build long-term value and by returning capital versus buybacks and dividends.  As Rob said, we believe our share price is attractive and we expect to continue our repurchase activity during the remainder of the year.
Our investment portfolio continues to perform well.  Our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined asset/liability management minimize our portfolio turnover and help moderate the pace of decline in our portfolio yield.  We are carefully monitoring events in Europe and our direct and indirect investment exposures to that market are low and manageable.  In our supplement this quarter, we’ve included additional information about our Eurozone and European portfolio exposure.
In accordance with [FASBE] rules issued in 2010 we will change our methodology for capitalizing of acquisition costs beginning in 2012.  We estimate that our beginning shareholders’ equity will be reduced by between $140 million and $150 million, or approximately 3% upon adoption of the new rules.  The equity adjustment will be non-cash and affects only our GAAP financials.  Looking forward, we expect the overall impact of the change on 2012 reported earnings to be small, totaling less than $10 million after tax.
Overall, as Q3 results indicate, we are executing and realizing progress on the commitments we outlined on Investor Day.  As we continue to do so we will build a stronger business and create long-term value for our shareholders.  Now I’ll turn it back to Rob.

Before moving to Q&A I want to review our strategy of pursuing specialty niche markets.  Our business model and strategy are different by design.  As a result, certain macro factors have a muted impact on Assurant compared to others.  Let me offer a few examples.  Our risk-oriented approach to asset management has allowed us to avoid most asset classes that have been problematic.  We do not offer products with guaranteed payouts, embedded guarantees or a callable feature.  This mitigates the effects of lower interest rates on profitability, and the markets where we’ve chosen to operate are smaller and have fewer competitors compared to more general insurance markets such as auto or life insurance.  This niche focus has allowed us to become market leaders by serving the unmet needs of our customers and clients.
In spite of the macroeconomic challenges, we are well-positioned with a resilient and agile business model designed to adapt and withstand marketplace uncertainties.  Our agility and adaptability will remain important since we expect volatility in the economy to continue for the foreseeable future.  And with that, I’ll ask the Operator to open the call for questions.  Operator, our first question please.

Given the loss ratio constraints we had to evaluate each and every one of those areas.  A second is just an eye towards, as you look toward 2014 we know that we’re going to be in a guaranteed issuance environment and that has impacts on underwriting, and so that’s another area we focused on. 
Third, I think as we mentioned on prior calls, we have had to reduce compensation to agents along with the rest of the industry in order to be in compliance with the minimum loss ratio regulations or to be profitable there.  So a variety of different factors that we’ve tried to push all the buttons.

We ended Q2 with about $650 million of total capital, $400 million of which we view as deployable.  We took about $100 million worth of dividends from the operating entities.  We returned about $93 million to shareholders; $17 million via shareholder dividends and another $76 million through share repurchase.  Net outflows at corporate were about $17 million, the main one being a bond interest payment that we made in August.  So that gets you down to the $640 million number.
In terms of thinking about it going forward, we feel like we’ve got about $50 million of earnings available for dividends at the operating segments, so let me give you that reconciliation.  Net operating income at the segment level was about $350 million for the first three quarters.  We’ve taken about $255 million of dividends.  That leaves a balance of $95 million.  Remember in Q2, $45 million of the segments’ NOI, Property in particular, was used to purchase share deposits so that leaves about $50 million of dividends, earnings available for dividends to take up in Q4.  So when you think about what we’ve got as potential dividend capacity from the operating segments you’re thinking about Q4 earnings and we’ll allow you to put that number in plus $50 million.  
In terms of share repurchase, Rob mentioned we will be in the market.  We have been in the market in October; as Mike mentioned, another 650,000 or so shares for $24 million.  The availability and the visibility around earnings is much clearer now that we’re exiting cat season.  We will get in Q4, in the next several weeks guidance from the rating agencies, primarily [AFS] about capital requirements for the operating segments.  We’ll factor all of that in and assess the capital position and then look to again go back into the market and share repurchase.  Our preference there has always been [10D51].  We like to be in the market consistently at a measured pace so you can expect us to be buying our shares going forward because we do view them as attractive.

I think the first thing that’s important for everyone to remember is our client acquisition of Lowe’s last year was a deal we were very pleased to get but we outlined was going to largely be a reinsure deal at least at the beginning, which many of our deals can be.  And then we feel as we are able to prove value out, we’re able to take more things in if we can demonstrate value to the shareholders.  So that is the primary difference in the EFC business between gross written and earned, and there’s a little bit of that that goes on in some of our vehicle service contract business.  But Lowe’s is a big account with a lot of business that isn’t going to show net earned premiums.
Setting that aside, though, and we can look at the business excluding that, we have seen very nice growth in our written premium and that will translate, and it’s one of the reasons we believe we will show that modest premium growth next year despite the fact that we know we have runoff going on both of a few clients and our domestic credit business.

There’s no doubt that there’s a sizable gap between reinvestment yields and the portfolio book yields, and depending on the portfolio you’re talking about a 150 to 200 basis point gap where what’s rolling off versus what we’re replacing it with.  Our main focus right now is to minimize the turnover in the portfolio, continue to keep the unrealized gain in an unrealized position so that it flows through income and preserve the portfolio’s book yield. Now, over time that will migrate towards the reinvestment yield.  
The problem with estimating that is it’s a function of not only portfolio cash flows but operating cash flows, and so depending on which segments grow and what the nature of the duration of the liability stream that we’re reinvesting for - again, there’s lots of factors coming in there.  But what we’re not going to do is try and preserve the portfolio book yield by stretching for yield and not being paid for the risk that we’re taking.  So again, it’s hard to estimate what’s going to happen.  You can think about a 150 to 200 basis point gap in new money versus maturities and coupon flow but a lot of that again is variable.

But second I think it also is a great highlight on our strategy.  This was all about when we looked a number of years back at renter’s insurance we noticed that most people don’t have it.  And we kind of conjectured why that was and thought of there is inefficiency in the distribution process.  So our whole thought was, was there a different way to come at that market and serve an unmet need of the customer?  So when we looked at all of it, from really no business here we’ve grown this thing to $100 million and we think the market still has quite a room for growth.
The first thing when we got into the whole marketplace were property managers - we came up with a value proposition that resonated but they were quite concerned about occupancy rate in their dwellings.  As we’ve had adoption I think they’ve felt that this product doesn’t impact that and they like the product, so we think there’s expansion within the property managers themselves; w think there’s a general trend of home ownership to rental.  I think all these things could work to grow the business.  Now, we also need to put in context.  We know that the homeowner’s business will stabilize as we’ve talked about, and the premium on that product is considerably higher than it is in the renter’s product.  Nevertheless that renter’s business is a nice niche business.  It’s profitable and we think we can continue with double-digit growth for the next few years.

One: we are one of the writers of the NFIP Program.  This is a fee-based business where we take no risk.  And we are paid a small fee when claims happen - not very sizable compared to where it was but still it’s a nice little business.  I think of more importance is what is our flood exposure related to our homeowners business or manufactured housing business.  We can put this in a couple of different buckets.  First, the NFIP Program applies to flood zones that are outlined by the government and if a person drops their NFIP Program our lenders or our servicers require that we provide flood coverage, and we do and we got obviously flood claims during these last storms just like we got traditional wind claims. 
In addition, the flood program has a maximum of I believe a $250,000 coverage limit.  If someone has a home worth more than that, many of our lenders require that we provide gap coverage on flood.  Now, you can think about again, that can break into two components - ones that allowed their NFIP coverage to expire, we’re going to cover all that; others that have an NFIP program and we provide notice that their servicer wants more coverage.  Many of those people go and get their coverage on their own; for those that don’t we provide a gap coverage. 
Finally, on our manufactured housing, particularly the business that originated at purchase there is a flood coverage provided there as well.  Does that help?

We are pleased with our continued progress in executing our strategy.  While our results this quarter reflect considerable storm activity, our focus on creating sustainable value for our shareholders remains strong.  Our long-term goals center on 3 key operating metrics: first, operating return on equity.  We reported an 8.6% return on an annualized basis excluding AOCI.  Catastrophe losses from the storm activity during Q2 and Q3 impacted our ROE; however, we expect ROE will increase in Q4 and future years as our businesses work to improve performance. The second is book value per diluted share. Book value has grown 9.4% year-to-date excluding AOCI.  We expect to end 2011 with a double-digit increase in this measure.  Third is revenue growth.  Our total revenues have not grown in 2011 but we are encouraged that we continue to sign new clients and introduce new products in a difficult economic environment.  Let me provide some additional color on the quarter.  
I’ll begin with Assurant Solutions. We solidified our international presence, reduced expenses, increased our wireless reach and maintained strong pre-need sales.  These actions all have contributed to better profitability.  Solutions generated meaningful new sales, both domestically and internationally, in a challenging global environment.  This can be seen in our growth in gross written premiums.  Solutions is well positioned to deliver on its commitment of a double-digit ROE in 2012.  Longer-term, we remain focused on progress toward the goals we have outlined.  2011 net earned premiums and fees will be similar to 2010, but we expect modest top line growth in 2012.   International, domestic service contracts and pre-need will be the key contributors.  We will continue to build our capabilities to serve the wireless marketplace and manage our programs and expenses for continued improvement in the international combined ratio. 
Moving to Assurant Specialty Property, quarterly results reflect the impact of catastrophe losses.  Our priority is to help our customers affected by severe storms and we continue to assist them as they rebuild and repair their homes.  Our strategy to align with market leaders combined with the investments we have made in our tracking system allow us to respond quickly when portfolios move between servicers.  This meets an important need for our clients.  We are pleased to report that the new client portfolio we mentioned last quarter was successfully implemented earlier than we had previously anticipated.  As a result, this portfolio will now generate premiums beginning in Q4 2011.  We are well positioned for the movement of loan portfolios that we expect will continue in 2012.  
Several years ago, insurance for renters was identified as an underserved market by our Specialty Property Team.  We created a different way to connect with customers by partnering with owners and managers of multi-family housing properties.  This business generates about $100 million in annual net earned premiums and fees and we anticipate growth will continue in 2012.  The acquisition of SureDeposit, the market leader in rental security deposit alternatives, expands our product offerings.  We are pleased with our integration progress and the acquisition was accretive during the quarter.
Next, I’ll turn to Assurant Health.  Q3 results reflect continued progress as we implement our strategy.  Sales of our new Health Access and supplemental product offerings continue to gain traction.  These products are designed to address affordability needs of consumers.  We also enhance technologies so our distribution partners can more effectively serve customers.  We continue to drive toward a streamlined structure that will allow us to succeed under the minimum loss ratio regulations, and through the first 9 months of 2011 we significantly reduced expenses compared to last year. It’s important to remember that 2011 is just the first year of the implementation of healthcare reform.  Additional provisions of the legislation will affect reported results in future years, but our focus remains the same - to generate sales and to realize further expense efficiencies.  A better customer experience and a simplified business model will help us achieve these goals. 
Moving to Assurant Employee Benefits, our results improved sequentially.  Progress in helping claimants return to work was the primary reason.  Our strategic focus on distribution through key brokers and our expanded product offerings continued to improve sales of voluntary products.  During the quarter, more than half of new sales came from supplemental and voluntary products. Before I turn it over to Mike, let me turn to corporate matters.  
Our capital position remains strong.  We ended the quarter with corporate capital at a similar level to last quarter.  Our strong capital position allowed us to repurchase shares during hurricane season as we outlined on our last call.  We continue to believe our share price is attractive.  Now, Mike will walk you through the operating results for each business.  Mike?"
4026111,141044134,208454,"Assurant Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob.  Let’s start with Assurant Solutions, where Q3 net operating income was just over $35 million, a 9% increase versus Q3 of 2010.  Improved international underwriting experience drove the year-over-year increase.  Domestic net earned premiums",1108,"Thanks, Rob.  Let’s start with Assurant Solutions, where Q3 net operating income was just over $35 million, a 9% increase versus Q3 of 2010.  Improved international underwriting experience drove the year-over-year increase.  Domestic net earned premiums and fees increased in the automotive and wireless channels.  These increases were offset by declines from the continued runoff of Circuit City and our domestic credit business.  For the full year 2011 these runoff businesses are expected to reduce premiums by approximately $170 million compared to 2010. The domestic combined ratio of 99.4% for the quarter was similar to the prior year.  The combined ratio was sequentially higher as we saw variability with certain clients but we still expect to achieve our full-year domestic combined ratio target of 98%.  Internationally, net earned premiums and fees increased 14% versus Q3 2010 driven by growth in Latin America from both new and existing clients.  The international combined ratio of 101.5% was 260 basis points lower than Q3 2010.  Favorable results in Latin America primarily drove the improvement.  We expect the Q4 ratio to be roughly level with Q3 as the stubborn economy in Europe and client installation costs in Latin America temporarily slow the pace of improvement. Pre-needs net operating income increased slightly versus Q3 of 2010 as our partnership with SCI continued to generate strong sales.  
Turning now to Assurant Specialty Properties, net operating income was approximately $44 million.  This reflects about $52 million of after-tax reportable catastrophe losses including losses from widespread coastal flooding versus no comparable losses in the same period last year.  As a reminder, we define a reportable catastrophe loss as an iso event that results in a loss of $5 million or more.  Excluding the reportable catastrophe losses, the combined ratio increased for the quarter primarily due to an increase in the frequency of non-catastrophe weather related losses. 
The new clients we added last year, loan portfolio acquisitions by existing clients and an increase in the overall placement rate continued to sustain gross earned premiums in our lender placed business.  Q3 net earned premiums and fees declined slightly versus 2010 due to additional premiums ceded to clients and decreased catastrophe reinsurance premiums.  Growth in multi-family housing products including SureDeposit partially offset the decline in net earned premiums and fees. The increase in placement rates continues to reflect difficulties in the housing market.  We believe they will begin to decline gradually as we outlined in our Investor Day presentation. The pace of the decline will depend on a number of factors including macroeconomic trends, government intervention, and client-specific portfolio characteristics.
Turning next to Assurant Health, I’ll again remind you that current results are not directly comparable to prior years due to changes in our business model and the premium rebate accruals required under healthcare reform.  Net earned premiums and fees for the quarter were $438 million net of a rebate accrual of $9 million.  Our estimates of rebate accruals continue to fluctuate as we adjust our product pricing and evaluate developing loss experience.  We now estimate the year-end rebate liability will be in the range of $60 million to $65 million.  Sales of our new Health Access and supplemental products continued to show improvement during the quarter.  Delivering on our commitment to reduce expenses was an important driver of Health’s results.  Q3 expenses were $34 million less than they were in 2010.  Year-to-date we have reduced our run rate expenses by over $50 million versus last year.  We now expect full-year 2011 after tax net operating income for Health to be in a range of $20 million to $25 million.  This includes a one-time provider reimbursement of $4.8 million after tax disclosed in Q1 of this year.  It also includes approximately $12 million after tax of favorable claim reserve development relative to year-end 2010 reserves.  Beginning in 2012, reserve development on products subject to the MLR will be factored into the rebate calculation, thus reducing its contribution to reported earnings.
At Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income was $13.6 million.  The year-over-year decrease reflects the extremely favorable disability experience in Q3 2010 and the lowering of the reserve discount rate earlier this year.  Life and dental results were slightly improved versus Q3 last year.  Q3 net earned premiums and fees declined slightly versus last year and we expect full-year 2011 premiums to be down as well.  The decrease primarily reflects pricing actions on a block of previously assumed disability business and lower prior-year sales.  A $5 million single premium transaction during Q3 along with growth in voluntary and supplemental product sales partially offset the decline.
Turning to corporate matters, our capital position at the end of Q2 allowed us to continue to repurchase shares during Q3 despite indications of storm activity early in the cat season.  During Q3 we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $76 million.  Total repurchases for the first 9 months of 2011 were 9.6 million shares at a cost of $360 million.  In Q4 through October 21st we repurchased an additional 652,000 shares for approximately $24 million. Going forward, we anticipate that full-year operating company dividends will at least equal operating earnings and our capital management priorities have not changed.  Our goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by investing in our businesses to build long-term value and by returning capital versus buybacks and dividends.  As Rob said, we believe our share price is attractive and we expect to continue our repurchase activity during the remainder of the year.  
Our investment portfolio continues to perform well.  Our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined asset/liability management minimize our portfolio turnover and help moderate the pace of decline in our portfolio yield.  We are carefully monitoring events in Europe and our direct and indirect investment exposures to that market are low and manageable.  In our supplement this quarter, we’ve included additional information about our Eurozone and European portfolio exposure. In accordance with [FASBE] rules issued in 2010 we will change our methodology for capitalizing of acquisition costs beginning in 2012.  We estimate that our beginning shareholders’ equity will be reduced by between $140 million and $150 million, or approximately 3% upon adoption of the new rules.  The equity adjustment will be non-cash and affects only our GAAP financials.  Looking forward, we expect the overall impact of the change on 2012 reported earnings to be small, totaling less than $10 million after tax.
Overall, as Q3 results indicate, we are executing and realizing progress on the commitments we outlined on Investor Day.  As we continue to do so we will build a stronger business and create long-term value for our shareholders.  Now I’ll turn it back to Rob."

Before moving to Q&A I want to review our strategy of pursuing specialty niche markets.  Our business model and strategy are different by design.  As a result, certain macro factors have a muted impact on Assurant compared to others.  Let me offer a few examples.  Our risk-oriented approach to asset management has allowed us to avoid most asset classes that have been problematic.  We do not offer products with guaranteed payouts, embedded guarantees or a callability feature.  This mitigates the effects of lower interest rates on profitability, and the markets where we’ve chosen to operate are smaller and have fewer competitors compared to more general insurance markets such as auto or life insurance.  This niche focus has allowed us to become market leaders by serving the unmet needs of our customers and clients. In spite of the macroeconomic challenges, we are well-positioned with a resilient and agile business model designed to adapt and withstand marketplace uncertainties.  Our agility and adaptability will remain important since we expect volatility in the economy to continue for the foreseeable future.  And with that, I’ll ask the Operator to open the call for questions.  Operator, our first question please."

Given the loss ratio constraints we had to evaluate each and every one of those areas.  A second is just an eye towards, as you look toward 2014 we know that we’re going to be in a guaranteed issuance environment and that has impacts on underwriting, and so that’s another area we focused on.

Wireless, unlike other service contracts, is a product that earns immediately and is on a monthly basis, so we like that aspect of the business.  In addition to that, the wireless space, we found that there are other profit pools associated with this business than we had contemplated when we got into just the handheld protection business, so there are other offerings that actually show up not through premiums but through fee income on this business.  We have obviously the big installation of Telefonica underway.  That will take a number of years to fully realize premium levels because we’re after a broad client base that hasn’t been exposed to this product.  But we are up in a couple of the countries with more anticipated and we think that’ll be a slow build over time, but it will earn as we write the business immediately.  The key will be to growing the client base."

We ended Q2 with about $650 million of total capital, $400 million of which we view as deployable.  We took about $100 million worth of dividends from the operating entities.  We returned about $93 million to shareholders; $17 million via shareholder dividends and another $76 million through share repurchase.  Net outflows at corporate were about $17 million, the main one being a bond interest payment that we made in August.  So that gets you down to the $640 million number. In terms of thinking about it going forward, we feel like we’ve got about $50 million of earnings available for dividends at the operating segments, so let me give you that reconciliation.  Net operating income at the segment level was about $350 million for the first 3 quarters.  We’ve taken about $255 million of dividends.  That leaves a balance of $95 million.  Remember in Q2, $45 million of the segments’ NOI, Property in particular, was used to purchase share deposits so that leaves about $50 million of earnings available for dividends to take up in Q4.  So when you think about what we’ve got as potential dividend capacity from the operating segments you’re thinking about Q4 earnings and we’ll allow you to put that number in plus $50 million.  
In terms of share repurchase, Rob mentioned we will be in the market.  We have been in the market in October; as Mike mentioned, another 650,000 or so shares for $24 million.  The availability and the visibility around earnings is much clearer now that we’re exiting cat season.  We will get in Q4, in the next several weeks guidance from the rating agencies, primarily [AFS] about capital requirements for the operating segments.  We’ll factor all of that in and assess the capital position and then look to again go back into the market and share repurchase.  Our preference there has always been [10D51].  We like to be in the market consistently at a measured pace so you can expect us to be buying our shares going forward because we do view them as attractive."

I think the first thing that’s important for everyone to remember is our client acquisition of Lowe’s last year was a deal we were very pleased to get but we outlined was going to largely be a reinsure deal at least at the beginning, which many of our deals can be.  And then we think as we are able to prove value out, we’re able to take more things in if we can demonstrate value to the shareholders.  So that is the primary difference in the EFC business between gross written and earned, and there’s a little bit of that that goes on in some of our vehicle service contract business.  But Lowe’s is a big account with a lot of business that isn’t going to show net earned premiums. Setting that aside, though, and we can look at the business excluding that, we have seen very nice growth in our written premium and that will translate, and it’s one of the reasons we believe we will show that modest premium growth next year despite the fact that we know we have runoff going on both of a few clients and our domestic credit business."

Our main focus right now is to minimize the turnover in the portfolio, continue to keep the unrealized gain in an unrealized position so that it flows through income and preserve the portfolio’s book yield. Now, over time that will migrate towards the reinvestment yield.  The problem with estimating that is it’s a function of not only portfolio cash flows but operating cash flows, and so depending on which segments grow and what the nature of the duration of the liability stream that we’re reinvesting for - again, there’s lots of factors coming in there.  But what we’re not going to do is try and preserve the portfolio book yield by stretching for yield and not being paid for the risk that we’re taking.  So again, it’s hard to estimate what’s going to happen.  You can think about a 150 to 200 basis point gap in new money versus maturities and coupon flow but a lot of that again is variable.

But second I think it also is a great highlight on our strategy.  This was all about when we looked a number of years back at renter’s insurance we noticed that most people don’t have it. And we kind of conjectured why that was and thought of there is inefficiency in the distribution process.  So our whole thought was, was there a different way to come at that market and serve an unmet need of the customer?  So when we looked at all of it, from really no business here we’ve grown this thing to $100 million and we think the market still has quite a room for growth. The first thing when we got into the whole marketplace were property managers - we came up with a value proposition that resonated but they were quite concerned about occupancy rate in their dwellings.  As we’ve had adoption I think they’ve felt that this product doesn’t impact that and they like the product, so we think there’s expansion within the property managers themselves; we think there’s a general trend of home ownership to rental.  I think all these things could work to grow the business.  Now, we also need to put in context.  We know that the homeowner’s business will stabilize as we’ve talked about, and the premium on that product is considerably higher than it is in the renter’s product.  Nevertheless that renter’s business is a nice niche business.  It’s profitable and we think we can continue with double-digit growth for the next few years."

One: we are one of the writers of the NFIP Program.  This is a fee-based business where we take no risk.  And we are paid a small fee when claims happen - not very sizable compared to where it was but still it’s a nice little business.  I think of more importance is what is our flood exposure related to our homeowners business or manufactured housing business.  We can put this in a couple of different buckets.  First, the NFIP Program applies to flood zones that are outlined by the government and if a person drops their NFIP Program our lenders or our servicers require that we provide flood coverage, and we do and we got obviously flood claims during these last storms just like we got traditional wind claims. In addition, the flood program has a maximum of I believe a $250,000 coverage limit.  If someone has a home worth more than that, many of our lenders require that we provide gap coverage on flood.  Now, you can think about again, that can break into 2 components - ones that allowed their NFIP coverage to expire, we’re going to cover all that; others that have an NFIP program and we provide notice that their servicer wants more coverage.  Many of those people go and get their coverage on their own; for those that don’t we provide a gap coverage. Finally, on our manufactured housing, particularly the business that originated at purchase there is a flood coverage provided there as well.  Does that help?"

We are pleased with our continued progress in executing our strategy. While our results this quarter reflect considerable storm activity, our focus on creating sustainable value for our shareholders remains strong. Our long-term goals center on 3 key operating metrics: first, operating return on equity. We reported an 8.6% return on an annualized basis excluding AOCI. Catastrophe losses from the storm activity during Q2 and Q3 impacted our ROE; however, we expect ROE will increase in Q4 and future years as our businesses work to improve performance. The second is book value per diluted share. Book value has grown 9.4% year-to-date excluding AOCI. We expect to end 2011 with a double-digit increase in this measure. Third is revenue growth. Our total revenues have not grown in 2011 but we are encouraged that we continue to sign new clients and introduce new products in a difficult economic environment. Let me provide some additional color on the quarter. 
I’ll begin with Assurant Solutions. We solidified our international presence, reduced expenses, increased our wireless reach and maintained strong pre-need sales. These actions all have contributed to better profitability. Solutions generated meaningful new sales, both domestically and internationally, in a challenging global environment. This can be seen in our growth in gross written premiums. Solutions is well positioned to deliver on its commitment of a double-digit ROE in 2012. Longer-term, we remain focused on progress toward the goals we have outlined. 2011 net earned premiums and fees will be similar to 2010, but we expect modest top line growth in 2012.  International, domestic service contracts and pre-need will be the key contributors. We will continue to build our capabilities to serve the wireless marketplace and manage our programs and expenses for continued improvement in the international combined ratio. 
Moving to Assurant Specialty Property, quarterly results reflect the impact of catastrophe losses. Our priority is to help our customers affected by severe storms and we continue to assist them as they rebuild and repair their homes. Our strategy to align with market leaders combined with the investments we have made in our tracking system allow us to respond quickly when portfolios move between servicers. This meets an important need for our clients. We are pleased to report that the new client portfolio we mentioned last quarter was successfully implemented earlier than we had previously anticipated. As a result, this portfolio will now generate premiums beginning in Q4 2011. We are well positioned for the movement of loan portfolios that we expect will continue in 2012. 
Several years ago, insurance for renters was identified as an underserved market by our Specialty Property Team. We created a different way to connect with customers by partnering with owners and managers of multi-family housing properties. This business generates about $100 million in annual net earned premiums and fees and we anticipate growth will continue in 2012. The acquisition of SureDeposit, the market leader in rental security deposit alternatives, expands our product offerings. We are pleased with our integration progress and the acquisition was accretive during the quarter.
Next, I’ll turn to Assurant Health. Q3 results reflect continued progress as we implement our strategy. Sales of our new Health Access and supplemental product offerings continue to gain traction. These products are designed to address affordability needs of consumers. We also enhance technologies so our distribution partners can more effectively serve customers. We continue to drive toward a streamlined structure that will allow us to succeed under the minimum loss ratio regulations, and through the first 9 months of 2011 we significantly reduced expenses compared to last year. It’s important to remember that 2011 is just the first year of the implementation of healthcare reform. Additional provisions of the legislation will affect reported results in future years, but our focus remains the same - to generate sales and to realize further expense efficiencies. A better customer experience and a simplified business model will help us achieve these goals. 
Moving to Assurant Employee Benefits, our results improved sequentially. Progress in helping claimants return to work was the primary reason. Our strategic focus on distribution through key brokers and our expanded product offerings continued to improve sales of voluntary products. During the quarter, more than half of new sales came from supplemental and voluntary products. Before I turn it over to Mike, let me turn to corporate matters. 
Our capital position remains strong. We ended the quarter with corporate capital at a similar level to last quarter. Our strong capital position allowed us to repurchase shares during hurricane season as we outlined on our last call. We continue to believe our share price is attractive. Now, Mike will walk you through the operating results for each business. Mike?"
4026111,141044134,209140,"Assurant Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2011",2011-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rob. Let’s start with Assurant Solutions, where Q3 net operating income was just over $35 million, a 9% increase versus Q3 of 2010. Improved international underwriting experience drove the year-over-year increase. Domestic net earned premiums an",1108,"Thanks, Rob. Let’s start with Assurant Solutions, where Q3 net operating income was just over $35 million, a 9% increase versus Q3 of 2010. Improved international underwriting experience drove the year-over-year increase. Domestic net earned premiums and fees increased in the automotive and wireless channels. These increases were offset by declines from the continued runoff of Circuit City and our domestic credit business. For the full year 2011 these runoff businesses are expected to reduce premiums by approximately $170 million compared to 2010. The domestic combined ratio of 99.4% for the quarter was similar to the prior year. The combined ratio was sequentially higher as we saw variability with certain clients but we still expect to achieve our full-year domestic combined ratio target of 98%. Internationally, net earned premiums and fees increased 14% versus Q3 2010 driven by growth in Latin America from both new and existing clients. The international combined ratio of 101.5% was 260 basis points lower than Q3 2010. Favorable results in Latin America primarily drove the improvement. We expect the Q4 ratio to be roughly level with Q3 as the stubborn economy in Europe and client installation costs in Latin America temporarily slow the pace of improvement. Pre-needs net operating income increased slightly versus Q3 of 2010 as our partnership with SCI continued to generate strong sales. 
Turning now to Assurant Specialty Properties, net operating income was approximately $44 million. This reflects about $52 million of after-tax reportable catastrophe losses including losses from widespread coastal flooding versus no comparable losses in the same period last year. As a reminder, we define a reportable catastrophe loss as an ISO event that results in a loss of $5 million or more. Excluding the reportable catastrophe losses, the combined ratio increased for the quarter primarily due to an increase in the frequency of non-catastrophe weather related losses. 
The new clients we added last year, loan portfolio acquisitions by existing clients and an increase in the overall placement rate continued to sustain gross earned premiums in our lender placed business. Q3 net earned premiums and fees declined slightly versus 2010 due to additional premiums ceded to clients and decreased catastrophe reinsurance premiums. Growth in multi-family housing products including SureDeposit partially offset the decline in net earned premiums and fees. The increase in placement rates continues to reflect difficulties in the housing market. We believe they will begin to decline gradually as we outlined in our Investor Day presentation. The pace of the decline will depend on a number of factors including macroeconomic trends, government intervention, and client-specific portfolio characteristics.
Turning next to Assurant Health, I’ll again remind you that current results are not directly comparable to prior years due to changes in our business model and the premium rebate accruals required under healthcare reform. Net earned premiums and fees for the quarter were $438 million net of a rebate accrual of $9 million. Our estimates of rebate accruals continue to fluctuate as we adjust our product pricing and evaluate developing loss experience.  We now estimate the year-end rebate liability will be in the range of $60 million to $65 million. Sales of our new Health Access and supplemental products continued to show improvement during the quarter. Delivering on our commitment to reduce expenses was an important driver of Health’s results. Q3 expenses were $34 million less than they were in 2010. Year-to-date we have reduced our run rate expenses by over $50 million versus last year. We now expect full-year 2011 after tax net operating income for Health to be in a range of $20 million to $25 million. This includes a one-time provider reimbursement of $4.8 million after tax disclosed in Q1 of this year. It also includes approximately $12 million after tax of favorable claim reserve development relative to year-end 2010 reserves. Beginning in 2012, reserve development on products subject to the MLR will be factored into the rebate calculation, thus reducing its contribution to reported earnings.
At Assurant Employee Benefits, net operating income was $13.6 million. The year-over-year decrease reflects the extremely favorable disability experience in Q3 2010 and the lowering of the reserve discount rate earlier this year. Life and dental results were slightly improved versus Q3 last year. Q3 net earned premiums and fees declined slightly versus last year and we expect full-year 2011 premiums to be down as well. The decrease primarily reflects pricing actions on a block of previously assumed disability business and lower prior-year sales. A $5 million single premium transaction during Q3 along with growth in voluntary and supplemental product sales partially offset the decline.
Turning to corporate matters, our capital position at the end of Q2 allowed us to continue to repurchase shares during Q3 despite indications of storm activity early in the cat season. During Q3 we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $76 million. Total repurchases for the first 9 months of 2011 were 9.6 million shares at a cost of $360 million. In Q4 through October 21st we repurchased an additional 652,000 shares for approximately $24 million. Going forward, we anticipate that full-year operating company dividends will at least equal operating earnings and our capital management priorities have not changed. Our goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders by investing in our businesses to build long-term value and by returning capital versus buybacks and dividends. As Rob said, we believe our share price is attractive and we expect to continue our repurchase activity during the remainder of the year. 
Our investment portfolio continues to perform well. Our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined asset/liability management minimize our portfolio turnover and help moderate the pace of decline in our portfolio yield. We are carefully monitoring events in Europe and our direct and indirect investment exposures to that market are low and manageable. In our supplement this quarter, we’ve included additional information about our Eurozone and European portfolio exposure. In accordance with [FASBE] rules issued in 2010 we will change our methodology for capitalizing of acquisition costs beginning in 2012. We estimate that our beginning shareholders’ equity will be reduced by between $140 million and $150 million, or approximately 3% upon adoption of the new rules. The equity adjustment will be non-cash and affects only our GAAP financials. Looking forward, we expect the overall impact of the change on 2012 reported earnings to be small, totaling less than $10 million after tax.
Overall, as Q3 results indicate, we are executing and realizing progress on the commitments we outlined on Investor Day. As we continue to do so we will build a stronger business and create long-term value for our shareholders. Now I’ll turn it back to Rob."

Before moving to Q&A I want to review our strategy of pursuing specialty niche markets. Our business model and strategy are different by design. As a result, certain macro factors have a muted impact on Assurant compared to others. Let me offer a few examples. Our risk-oriented approach to asset management has allowed us to avoid most asset classes that have been problematic. We do not offer products with guaranteed payouts, embedded guarantees or a callability feature. This mitigates the effects of lower interest rates on profitability, and the markets where we’ve chosen to operate are smaller and have fewer competitors compared to more general insurance markets such as auto or life insurance. This niche focus has allowed us to become market leaders by serving the unmet needs of our customers and clients. In spite of the macroeconomic challenges, we are well-positioned with a resilient and agile business model designed to adapt and withstand marketplace uncertainties. Our agility and adaptability will remain important since we expect volatility in the economy to continue for the foreseeable future. And with that, I’ll ask the Operator to open the call for questions. Operator, our first question please."

Given the loss ratio constraints we had to evaluate each and every one of those areas. A second is just an eye towards, as you look toward 2014 we know that we’re going to be in a guaranteed issuance environment and that has impacts on underwriting, and so that’s another area we focused on.

We ended Q2 with about $650 million of total capital, $400 million of which we view as deployable. We took about $100 million worth of dividends from the operating entities. We returned about $93 million to shareholders; $17 million via shareholder dividends and another $76 million through share repurchase. Net outflows at corporate were about $17 million, the main one being a bond interest payment that we made in August. So that gets you down to the $640 million number. In terms of thinking about it going forward, we feel like we’ve got about $50 million of earnings available for dividends at the operating segments, so let me give you that reconciliation. Net operating income at the segment level was about $350 million for the first 3 quarters. We’ve taken about $255 million of dividends. That leaves a balance of $95 million. Remember in Q2, $45 million of the segments’ NOI, Property in particular, was used to purchase share deposits so that leaves about $50 million of earnings available for dividends to take up in Q4. So when you think about what we’ve got as potential dividend capacity from the operating segments you’re thinking about Q4 earnings and we’ll allow you to put that number in plus $50 million. 
In terms of share repurchase, Rob mentioned we will be in the market. We have been in the market in October; as Mike mentioned, another 650,000 or so shares for $24 million. The availability and the visibility around earnings is much clearer now that we’re exiting cat season. We will get in Q4, in the next several weeks guidance from the rating agencies, primarily [AFS] about capital requirements for the operating segments. We’ll factor all of that in and assess the capital position and then look to again go back into the market and share repurchase. Our preference there has always been [10D51] .

So that is the primary difference in the EFC business between gross written and earned, and there’s a little bit of that that goes on in some of our vehicle service contract business. But Lowe’s is a big account with a lot of business that isn’t going to show net earned premiums.

There’s no doubt that there’s a sizable gap between reinvestment yields and the portfolio book yields, and yet depending on the portfolio you’re talking about a 150 to 200 basis point gap where what’s rolling off versus what we’re replacing it with. Our main focus right now is to minimize the turnover in the portfolio, continue to keep the unrealized gain in an unrealized position so that it flows through income and preserve the portfolio’s book yield. Now, over time that will migrate towards the reinvestment yield. The problem with estimating that is it’s a function of not only portfolio cash flows but operating cash flows, and so depending on which segments grow and what the nature of the duration of the liability stream that we’re reinvesting for - again, there’s lots of factors coming in there. But what we’re not going to do is try and preserve the portfolio book yield by stretching for yield and not being paid for the risk that we’re taking. So again, it’s hard to estimate what’s going to happen. You can think about a 150 to 200 basis point gap in new money versus maturities and coupon flow but a lot of that again is variable.

But second I think it also is a great highlight on our strategy. This was all about when we looked a number of years back at renter’s insurance we noticed that most people don’t have it. And we kind of conjectured why that was and thought of there is inefficiency in the distribution process. So our whole thought was, was there a different way to come at that market and serve an unmet need of the customer? So when we looked at all of it, from really no business here we’ve grown this thing to $100 million and we think the market still has quite a room for growth. The first thing when we got into the whole marketplace were property managers - we came up with a value proposition that resonated but they were quite concerned about occupancy rate in their dwellings. As we’ve had adoption I think they’ve felt that this product doesn’t impact that and they like the product, so we think there’s expansion within the property managers themselves; we think there’s a general trend of home ownership to rental. I think all these things could work to grow the business. Now, we also need to put in context. We know that the homeowner’s business will stabilize as we’ve talked about, and the premium on that product is considerably higher than it is in the renter’s product. Nevertheless that renter’s business is a nice niche business. It’s profitable and we think we can continue with double-digit growth for the next few years."

One: we are one of the writers of the NFIP Program. This is a fee-based business where we take no risk. And we are paid a small fee when claims happen - not very sizable compared to where it was but still it’s a nice little business. I think of more importance is what is our flood exposure related to our homeowners business or manufactured housing business. We can put this in a couple of different buckets. First, the NFIP Program applies to flood zones that are outlined by the government and if a person drops their NFIP Program our lenders or our servicers require that we provide flood coverage, and we do and we got obviously flood claims during these last storms just like we got traditional wind claims. In addition, the flood program has a maximum of I believe a $250,000 coverage limit. If someone has a home worth more than that, many of our lenders require that we provide gap coverage on flood. Now, you can think about again, that can break into 2 components - ones that allowed their NFIP coverage to expire, we’re going to cover all that; others that have an NFIP program and we provide notice that their servicer wants more coverage. Many of those people go and get their coverage on their own; for those that don’t we provide a gap coverage. Finally, on our manufactured housing, particularly the business that originated at purchase there is flood coverage provided there as well. Does that help?"
