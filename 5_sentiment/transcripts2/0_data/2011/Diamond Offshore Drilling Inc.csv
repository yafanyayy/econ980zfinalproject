I want to comment this morning on several areas and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some details cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going forward. 
The results for the quarter, I think, reflect a couple of positives. Clearly everybody is focused on our tax rate declined due to some provisions which were included in the right at the end of the year tax agreement that was hammered out between the administration and Congress. And this favorably impacted the way Diamond Offshore was tax and so we had a catch-up adjustment to our tax returns to lower the effective tax rate that had been in place for the first three quarters of the year. But in addition to that, I think our revenues, we were pleased with where they were. We had less rigs actually on the high seas moving from location to location and although you can do your best to negotiate mobilization in dayrate or fixed rates of the FASB requires us to suspend recognition of any of that revenue and defer it into future, so we go to zero. So theoretically, if we had huge chunks of our fleet mobilizing, we will be reporting nothing.
So anyway, that wasn't taking place during the quarter and then we were pleased with we've had several initiatives in place to lower downtime due to equipment failures and there's always some risk of that in the business we are pleased with the progress we are making in that month after month. That showed up to a slight degree in the results for the quarter. And at the same time, our costs where they needed to be. We devote efforts certainly in all markets to cost control but as we had positioned rigs in the new markets over time we were able to get on top of some of that.
Secondly, talk about our construction program. We announced the commitment of our second option with Hyundai for construction of a 12,000-foot drill ship and indicated that this vessel and the previous vessel would be name Ocean BlackHawk and Ocean BlackHornet. Our thought process in both the option and the original commitment was based upon clear high-product prices that we see out there and our expectations that they would continue due to demand growth. And despite all the efforts out there, slow supply growth, augmented then by the low construction costs that we began seeing towards the end of last year and we're ready and have been doing the work so that we could go forward and make a selection. The one thing that we're missing right now is to have ready contracts when we bought -- what became the Valor those were great purchases because we knew the market was such that existing contracts we could bid for alternative contracts.
So although we don't have contracts, we've got high-product prices and low-construction costs and 70 star meatloaf would saying two out of three ain't bad, so we think that's great. And the other comment I would make is we were pleased with acquisitions such as the Courage and Valor but our assessment of the market out there was there were too many players and too few equipments that would come to market here in the short term and so that new construction was the appropriate place for us to continue to try to seek higher returns by controlling the amount of capital that we spend out there.
Third area I'd like to talk about for a moment is Egypt. Diamond Offshore has three rigs in Egypt the Ocean Endeavor, a large scale 10,000-foot semis drilling in the Mediterranean. We have two jackups the Ocean Spur, the Mediterranean and the Ocean Heritage and the gulf of. Combined, those vessels produce dayrates just a little bit under $350,000 a day. That's under 5% of the total dayrates that we're earning presently. So it's a small piece. First item was to make sure there our people were secure and we are successfully up to this point in time evacuated administrative people and dependents are either all out of the country or there may be one or two that are still in the Cairo airport but we're comfortable that we've secured that. 
Other than that, we still have operations folks there and we're continuing to work as directed. Some of the rigs may not have active activity going on at the moment but other rigs are continuing to make hole. We're dealing with crude change issues. It's obviously challenging for everybody, but we're continuing on.
We do have as in all contracts force majeure provisions in there. We do not, none of those are exercised to date but our biggest rig, the Ocean Endeavor would have as I say provision in there that upon force majeure that will continue on dayrate for 30 days before cancellation could go forward. But at present, as I said, we're continuing to work those issues.
And then finally, let me close out on the dividends. Dividends had been an important part of our method of returning value to shareholders. We've got a long history going back. Have paid out significant sums of money to shareholders. And that continues to be something that we value highly. As you know, we do not give forward guidance and we set most of the dividend in the form of a special dividend that we say, will be addressed and reassessed by the board at each particular step. However, with note that we have already made payments of $300 million for the down payments on the two vessels. We do not have payments to again until they are delivered in 2013. And we made the board assess the dividend for this quarter in light of knowing that have had those commitments and chose to continue our payment, we had $1 billion of cash as we went into the quarter. We've said strong $300 million, but we are not in a position at the moment where the construction program is something that we have to do at the cost of the dividends through this particular quarter.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary Krenek to give you some more cost guidance."
338612,117868641,98587,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through his operating results. Most of our costs for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year",1025,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through his operating results. Most of our costs for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year is to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter conference call of last year, we guided our rig operating expense cost to, we said it would be approximately $1.5 billion for 2010. And actual year-to-date numbers for 2010 came in at $1.4 billion. Favorable variance was a result of two things. First of all, we have four rigs, three floaters and one jackup that we made a marketing decision to cold stacked during 2010. And so those costs during the year were reduced to very small amounts while they were cold stacked but brought across down.
The second thing, as Larry talked about, when we mode rigs, not only do we defer revenues as he said, but we also quit recognizing expense. And we defer those expenses that we incur while those rigs are moving and amortize those costs over length of the working part of the contract in the accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of the moratorium and confidence of the endeavor, unexpectedly, left the Gulf of Mexico during the year and we reduced our costs. So the cost bringing -- taking that into account brought our costs down somewhat. These are all things that we have made known during our conference calls and our rigs status report. So if you made that adjustment to our original guidance, we were pretty much spot on with the guidance we gave for our contract drilling cost in 2010.
Looking forward to 2011, we again expect contract drilling costs to be around $1.5 billion. It's going to increase over 2010 this past year for a couple of reasons. First of all, we'll have a full years operating cost on the Courage and Valor, the two new rigs that we acquired, put to work during the year and incurred only a portion of our years cost in this past year. Second, the amortization of those mode costs that we had during 2010 when we suspended recognizing costs was not only for the Confidence and Endeavor but we also mode the America, the Baroness and the Scepter out of the Gulf of Mexico that we anticipate. So all five of those add to the amortized cost in 2011. 
And finally, the fact that those five rigs are working in international areas which are higher cost area than the Gulf of Mexico. All totaled -- will bring our costs up to about $1.5 billion.  
As is our custom, annually, we give everyone our expected cost for each of our rigs by class and location in the fourth quarter conference call so that it can aid you in estimating our future rig operating costs. At the same time, rather than me give those costs here, we listed them in our rig status report that we filed last night. We refer you to the documents you can see that. Again, to be perfectly clear, these costs represent contract drilling expenses only if they exclude reimbursable costs.
If you take those operating costs by day that we've listed, in addition to those costs, what we will occur is approximately $100 million of amortized mode costs. Those costs are going to be broken down to approximately $20 million in Q1, we go up to $40 million in Q2 and back down to $20 million again in Q3 and Q4. That's due to just how some contracts rollover and expire when we change the way we amortize these things due to some accounting rules.
We will also incur some $70 million to $80 million worth of survey costs during the year. That's going to be broken down between four jackups the Nugget, Heritage, the Summit, and Sovereign which will incur about $3 million to $5 million each; the Saratoga and the Princess, $5 million to $7 million each, the Clipper and America were in the shipyard during their surveys will incur $9 million to $12 million each and finally, the Whittington and the Epic $12 million to $15 million each. Again these are costs in excess of the normal daily operating costs that we've listed in our rig status report.
In order to get the associated down days and other down days with these rigs and also to be able to tell which quarter we expect at this time, those surveys occur, please look at that rig status report that we filed last night.
Looking at just the first quarter, some guidance their. If you take the net normal operating cost and the other guidance I just give you, we expect rig operating expense to come in at about $370 million to $380 million in Q1 in this coming year. Looking at some of the other line items, we believe G&A will be consistent year-over-year, $17  million to $18 million per quarter during 2011. Depreciation expense will increase slightly, primarily due to the Courage and the Valor being out there in the full year plus other CapEx that we've spent in the past couple of years. $103 million to $106 million is what we're estimating per quarter right now. 
Interest expense should be flat at $22 million per quarter or thereabouts. We are expecting our effective tax rate taking into account the extenders bill and also the geographic locations of where we're earning our moneys. I believe the rate will go down to 24% to 26%. And also I'd like to remind people now the extenders bill is in effect for all of 2011 but as of now, that bill is set to expire on December 31 of 2011.
And finally, capital expenditures. We're looking at maintenance capital of approximately $320 million for the coming year. And as Larry said, we spent slightly over $300 million on the down payment on the two new builds which will go into CapEx for 2011. 
And unless Larry has any other comments, we'll turn it over for questions. Okay. Thank you."

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions about future revenues and earnings, capital expenditures, industry conditions and competition, dates that drilling rigs will enter service, as well as managementâ€™s plans and objectives for the future. A discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

338612,117868641,98718,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going",1090,"Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going forward. 
The results for the quarter, I think, reflect a couple of positives. Clearly, everybody is focused on our tax rate decline due to some provisions which were included in the right at the end of the year tax agreement that was hammered out between the administration and Congress. And this favorably impacted the way Diamond Offshore was taxed, and so we had a catch-up adjustment to our tax rate to lower the effective tax rate that had been in place for the first three quarters of the year. 
But in addition to that, I think our revenues, we were pleased with where they were. We had less rigs, actually, on the high seas moving from location to location. And although you can do your best to negotiate a mobilization in the dayrate or fixed rates, the FASB requires us to suspend recognition of any of that revenue and defer it into future, so we go to zero. So I mean, theoretically, if we had huge chunks of our fleet mobilizing, then we would be reporting nothing.
But anyway, that wasn't taking place during the quarter, and then we were pleased with -- we've had several initiatives in place to lower the minimal downtime due to equipment failures. And there's always some risk of that in the business, but we're pleased with the progress we've been making on that, month after month. And I think that showed up, to a slight degree, in the results for the quarter. And at the same time, our costs, where they needed to be, we devote efforts certainly in all markets to cost control. But as we had positioned rig in the new markets over time, we were able to get on top of some of that.
Secondly, talk about our construction program. We announced the commitment of our second option with Hyundai for the construction of a 12,000-foot drillship, and indicated that this vessel and the previous vessel would be named Ocean BlackHawk and Ocean BlackHornet. Our thought process in both the option and the original commitment was based upon clear, high product prices that we see out there and our expectations that they would continue due to demand growth. And despite all the efforts out there, slow supply growth, augmented then by the low construction costs that we began seeing towards the end of last year, and we're ready and have been doing the work so that we could go forward and make a selection. 
The one thing that we're missing right now is to have ready contracts as when we bought  what became the Courage [Ocean Courage] and the Valor [Ocean Valor]. Those were great purchases because we knew the market was such that they have existing contracts that we could bid for alternative contracts. So although we don't have contracts, we've got high product prices and low construction costs. And as 70s star Meat Loaf would sing, ""Two out of three ain't bad."" So we think that's great. 
And the other comment I would make is we were pleased with acquisitions such as the Courage and Valor, but our assessment of the market out there was there were too many players and too few equipment that would come to market here in the short term and so that new construction was the appropriate place for us to continue to try to seek higher returns by controlling the amount of capital that we spend out there.
Third area I'd like to talk about for a moment is Egypt. Diamond Offshore has three rigs in Egypt: The Ocean Endeavor, a large-scale 10,000-foot semi that's drilling in the Mediterranean. We have two jackups, the Ocean Spur in the Mediterranean, and the Ocean Heritage in the Gulf of Suez. Combined, those vessels produce dayrates just a little bit under $350,000 a day. That's under 5% of the total dayrates that we're earning presently, so it's a small piece. First item was to make sure that our people were secure. And we have successfully, up to this point in time, evacuated. Administrative people and dependents are either all out of the country or there may be one or two that are still in the Cairo Airport [Cairo International Airport], but we're comfortable that we've secured that. 
Other than that, we still have operations folks there, and we're continuing to work as directed. Some of the rigs may not have active activity going on at the moment, but other rigs are continuing to make hole. We're dealing with crude change issues. It's obviously challenging for everybody, but we're continuing on. We do have, as in all contracts, force majeure provisions in there. We do not -- none of those are exercised to date, but our biggest rig, the Ocean Endeavor has a provision in there that upon force majeure, we will continue on dayrate for 30 days before cancellation could go forward. But at present, as I said, we're continuing to work those particular issues.
And then finally, let me close out on the dividends. Dividends have been an important part of our method of returning value to shareholders. We've got a long history, going back, have paid out significant sums of money to shareholders. And that continues to be something that we value highly. As you know, we do not give forward guidance, and we set most of the dividend in the form of a special dividend that we say will be addressed and reassessed by the board at each particular step. 
However, I would note that we have already made payments of $300 million for the down payments on the two vessels. We do not have payments due again until they're delivered in 2013. And we made the board assess the dividend for this quarter in light of knowing that have had those commitments and chose to continue our payment. We had $1 billion of cash as we went into the quarter. We've said strong there, $300 million, but we are not in a position at the moment where the construction program is something that we have to do at the cost of the dividends through this particular quarter.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary Krenek to give you some more cost guidance."

Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year is to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter conference call of last year, we guided our rig operating expense cost to -- we said it would be approximately $1.5 billion for 2010.

And so those costs during the year were reduced to very small amounts while they were cold-stacked, which brought the cost down.
The second thing, as Larry talked about, when we mobe [mobilize] rigs, not only do we defer revenues, as he said, but we also quit recognizing expense. And we defer those expenses that we incur while those rigs are mobe-ing and amortize those costs over length of the working part of the contract, as in the accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. So we had, because of the moratorium and confidence in the endeavor, unexpectedly, left the Gulf of Mexico during the year, and we reduced our costs. So the cost bringing -- taking that into account, brought our costs down somewhat. These are all things that we have made known during our conference calls and our rig status report. So if you made that adjustment to our original guidance, we were pretty much spot-on with the guidance we gave for our contract drilling cost in 2010.
Looking forward to 2011, we again expect contract drilling costs to be around $1.5 billion. It's going to increase over 2010 this past year for a couple of reasons. First of all, we'll have a full year's operating cost on the Courage and Valor, the two new rigs that we acquired and put to work during the year and incurred only a portion of our year's cost in this past year. Second, the amortization of those mobe costs that we had during 2010 when we suspended recognizing costs was not only for the Confidence [Ocean Confidence] and Endeavor [Ocean Endeavor] but we also mobe-ed the America [Ocean America], the Baroness [Ocean Baroness] and the Scepter [Ocean Scepter] out of the Gulf of Mexico that we anticipated. So all five of those add to the amortized cost in 2011. 
And finally, the fact that those five rigs are working in international areas which are higher cost area than the Gulf of Mexico, all totaled, will bring our costs up to about $1.5 billion.  
As is our custom, annually, we give everyone our expected cost for each of our rigs by class and location in the fourth quarter conference call, so that it can aid you in estimating our future rig operating costs. At the same time, rather than me giving those costs here, we listed them in our rig status report that we filed last night. We refer you to that document, so that you could see that. Again, to be perfectly clear, these costs represent contract drilling expenses only if they exclude reimbursable costs.
If you take those operating costs by day that we've listed, in addition to those costs, what we will incur is approximately $100 million of amortized mobe costs. Those costs are going to be broken down to approximately $20 million in Q1. We'd go up to $40 million in Q2 and back down to $20 million again in Q3 and Q4. That's due to just how some contracts roll over and expire when we change the way we amortize these things due to some accounting rules.
We will also incur some $70 million to $80 million worth of survey costs during the year. That's going to be broken down between four jackups: The Nugget [Ocean Nugget], the Heritage [Ocean Heritage], the Summit [Ocean Summit] and the Sovereign [Ocean Sovereign], which will incur about $3 million to $5 million each; the Saratoga [Ocean Saratoga] and the Princess [Ocean Princess], $5 million to $7 million each; the Clipper [Ocean Clipper] and America [Ocean America], when they're in the shipyard during their surveys, will incur $9 million to $12 million each; and finally, the Whittington [Ocean Whittington] and the Epoch [Ocean Epoch], $12 million to $15 million each. Again, these are costs in excess of the normal daily operating costs that we've listed on our rig status report. In order to get the associated down days and other down days with these rigs and also to be able to tell which quarter we expect at this time those surveys to occur, please look at that rig status report that we filed last night.
Looking at just the first quarter, some guidance there, if you take the net normal operating cost and the other guidance I just gave you, we expect rig operating expense to come in at about $370 million to $380 million in Q1 in this coming year. Looking at some of the other line items, we believe G&A will be consistent year-over-year, $17 million to $18 million per quarter during 2011. Depreciation expense will increase slightly, primarily due to the Courage and the Valor being out there in the full year, plus other CapEx that we've spent from the past couple of years. $103 million to $106 million is what we're estimating per quarter right now. 
Interest expense should be flat at $22 million per quarter or thereabouts. We're expecting our effective tax rate taking into account the Extenders Bill and also the geographic locations of where we're earning our moneys. I believe the rate will go down to 24% to 26%. And also, I'd like to remind people now, the Extenders Bill is in effect for all of 2011 but as of now, that bill is set to expire on December 31 of 2011.
And finally, capital expenditures. We're looking at maintenance capital of approximately $320 million for the coming year. And as Larry said, we spent slightly over $300 million on the down payment on the two new builds which will go into CapEx for 2011. 
And unless Larry has any other comments, we'll turn it over for questions. Okay? Thank you."

Before we begin our remarks, I should remind you that statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions about future revenues and earnings, capital expenditures, industry conditions and competition, dates that drilling rigs will enter service, as well as managementâ€™s plans and objectives for the future. A discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in the company's expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstance on which any forward-looking statement is based.
After we have discussed our results, we will have a question-and-answer session, during which we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can open the floor to as many people as possible.

338612,117868641,98719,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going",1090,"Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going forward. 
The results for the quarter, I think, reflect a couple of positives. Clearly, everybody is focused on our tax rate decline due to some provisions which were included in the right at the end of the year tax agreement that was hammered out between the administration and Congress. And this favorably impacted the way Diamond Offshore was taxed, and so we had a catch-up adjustment to our tax rate to lower the effective tax rate that had been in place for the first three quarters of the year. 
But in addition to that, I think our revenues, we were pleased with where they were. We had less rigs, actually, on the high seas moving from location to location. And although you can do your best to negotiate a mobilization in the dayrate or fixed rates, the FASB requires us to suspend recognition of any of that revenue and defer it into future, so we go to zero. So I mean, theoretically, if we had huge chunks of our fleet mobilizing, then we would be reporting nothing.
But anyway, that wasn't taking place during the quarter, and then we were pleased with -- we've had several initiatives in place to lower the minimal downtime due to equipment failures. And there's always some risk of that in the business, but we're pleased with the progress we've been making on that, month after month. And I think that showed up, to a slight degree, in the results for the quarter. And at the same time, our costs, where they needed to be, we devote efforts certainly in all markets to cost control. But as we had positioned rig in the new markets over time, we were able to get on top of some of that.
Secondly, talk about our construction program. We announced the commitment of our second option with Hyundai for the construction of a 12,000-foot drillship, and indicated that this vessel and the previous vessel would be named Ocean BlackHawk and Ocean BlackHornet. Our thought process in both the option and the original commitment was based upon clear, high product prices that we see out there and our expectations that they would continue due to demand growth. And despite all the efforts out there, slow supply growth, augmented then by the low construction costs that we began seeing towards the end of last year, and we're ready and have been doing the work so that we could go forward and make a selection. 
The one thing that we're missing right now is to have ready contracts as when we bought  what became the Courage [Ocean Courage] and the Valor [Ocean Valor]. Those were great purchases because we knew the market was such that they have existing contracts that we could bid for alternative contracts. So although we don't have contracts, we've got high product prices and low construction costs. And as 70s star Meat Loaf would sing, ""Two out of three ain't bad."" So we think that's great. 
And the other comment I would make is we were pleased with acquisitions such as the Courage and Valor, but our assessment of the market out there was there were too many players and too few equipment that would come to market here in the short term and so that new construction was the appropriate place for us to continue to try to seek higher returns by controlling the amount of capital that we spend out there.
Third area I'd like to talk about for a moment is Egypt. Diamond Offshore has three rigs in Egypt: The Ocean Endeavor, a large-scale 10,000-foot semi that's drilling in the Mediterranean. We have two jackups, the Ocean Spur in the Mediterranean, and the Ocean Heritage in the Gulf of Suez. Combined, those vessels produce dayrates just a little bit under $350,000 a day. That's under 5% of the total dayrates that we're earning presently, so it's a small piece. First item was to make sure that our people were secure. And we have successfully, up to this point in time, evacuated. Administrative people and dependents are either all out of the country or there may be one or two that are still in the Cairo Airport [Cairo International Airport], but we're comfortable that we've secured that. 
Other than that, we still have operations folks there, and we're continuing to work as directed. Some of the rigs may not have active activity going on at the moment, but other rigs are continuing to make hole. We're dealing with crude change issues. It's obviously challenging for everybody, but we're continuing on. We do have, as in all contracts, force majeure provisions in there. We do not -- none of those are exercised to date, but our biggest rig, the Ocean Endeavor has a provision in there that upon force majeure, we will continue on dayrate for 30 days before cancellation could go forward. But at present, as I said, we're continuing to work those particular issues.
And then finally, let me close out on the dividends. Dividends have been an important part of our method of returning value to shareholders. We've got a long history, going back, have paid out significant sums of money to shareholders. And that continues to be something that we value highly. As you know, we do not give forward guidance, and we set most of the dividend in the form of a special dividend that we say will be addressed and reassessed by the board at each particular step. 
However, I would note that we have already made payments of $300 million for the down payments on the two vessels. We do not have payments due again until they're delivered in 2013. And we made the board assess the dividend for this quarter in light of knowing that have had those commitments and chose to continue our payment. We had $1 billion of cash as we went into the quarter. We've said strong there, $300 million, but we are not in a position at the moment where the construction program is something that we have to do at the cost of the dividends through this particular quarter.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary Krenek to give you some more cost guidance."

As Larry said, he went through the operating results. Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year",1065,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through the operating results. Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year is to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter conference call of last year, we guided our rig operating expense cost to -- we said it would be approximately $1.5 billion for 2010. And actual year-to-date numbers for 2010 came in at $1.4 billion. Favorable variance was a result of two things. First of all, we have four rigs, three floaters and one jackup that we made a marketing decision to cold-stack  during 2010. And so those costs during the year were reduced to very small amounts while they were cold-stacked, which brought the cost down.
The second thing, as Larry talked about, when we mobe [mobilize] rigs, not only do we defer revenues, as he said, but we also quit recognizing expense. And we defer those expenses that we incur while those rigs are mobe-ing and amortize those costs over length of the working part of the contract, as in the accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. So we had, because of the moratorium and confidence in the endeavor, unexpectedly, left the Gulf of Mexico during the year, and we reduced our costs. So the cost bringing -- taking that into account, brought our costs down somewhat. These are all things that we have made known during our conference calls and our rig status report. So if you made that adjustment to our original guidance, we were pretty much spot-on with the guidance we gave for our contract drilling cost in 2010.
Looking forward to 2011, we again expect contract drilling costs to be around $1.5 billion. It's going to increase over 2010 this past year for a couple of reasons. First of all, we'll have a full year's operating cost on the Courage and Valor, the two new rigs that we acquired and put to work during the year and incurred only a portion of our year's cost in this past year. Second, the amortization of those mobe costs that we had during 2010 when we suspended recognizing costs was not only for the Confidence [Ocean Confidence] and Endeavor [Ocean Endeavor] but we also mobe-ed the America [Ocean America], the Baroness [Ocean Baroness] and the Scepter [Ocean Scepter] out of the Gulf of Mexico that we anticipated. So all five of those add to the amortized cost in 2011. 
And finally, the fact that those five rigs are working in international areas which are higher cost area than the Gulf of Mexico, all totaled, will bring our costs up to about $1.5 billion.  
As is our custom, annually, we give everyone our expected cost for each of our rigs by class and location in the fourth quarter conference call, so that it can aid you in estimating our future rig operating costs. At the same time, rather than me giving those costs here, we listed them in our rig status report that we filed last night. We refer you to that document, so that you could see that. Again, to be perfectly clear, these costs represent contract drilling expenses only if they exclude reimbursable costs.
If you take those operating costs by day that we've listed, in addition to those costs, what we will incur is approximately $100 million of amortized mobe costs. Those costs are going to be broken down to approximately $20 million in Q1. We'd go up to $40 million in Q2 and back down to $20 million again in Q3 and Q4. That's due to just how some contracts roll over and expire when we change the way we amortize these things due to some accounting rules.
We will also incur some $70 million to $80 million worth of survey costs during the year. That's going to be broken down between four jackups: The Nugget [Ocean Nugget], the Heritage [Ocean Heritage], the Summit [Ocean Summit] and the Sovereign [Ocean Sovereign], which will incur about $3 million to $5 million each; the Saratoga [Ocean Saratoga] and the Princess [Ocean Princess], $5 million to $7 million each; the Clipper [Ocean Clipper] and America [Ocean America], when they're in the shipyard during their surveys, will incur $9 million to $12 million each; and finally, the Whittington [Ocean Whittington] and the Epoch [Ocean Epoch], $12 million to $15 million each. Again, these are costs in excess of the normal daily operating costs that we've listed on our rig status report. In order to get the associated down days and other down days with these rigs and also to be able to tell which quarter we expect at this time those surveys to occur, please look at that rig status report that we filed last night.
Looking at just the first quarter, some guidance there, if you take the net normal operating cost and the other guidance I just gave you, we expect rig operating expense to come in at about $370 million to $380 million in Q1 in this coming year. Looking at some of the other line items, we believe G&A will be consistent year-over-year, $17 million to $18 million per quarter during 2011. Depreciation expense will increase slightly, primarily due to the Courage and the Valor being out there in the full year, plus other CapEx that we've spent from the past couple of years. $103 million to $106 million is what we're estimating per quarter right now. 
Interest expense should be flat at $22 million per quarter or thereabouts. We're expecting our effective tax rate taking into account the Extenders Bill and also the geographic locations of where we're earning our moneys. I believe the rate will go down to 24% to 26%. And also, I'd like to remind people now, the Extenders Bill is in effect for all of 2011 but as of now, that bill is set to expire on December 31 of 2011.
And finally, capital expenditures. We're looking at maintenance capital of approximately $320 million for the coming year. And as Larry said, we spent slightly over $300 million on the down payment on the two new builds which will go into CapEx for 2011. 
And unless Larry has any other comments, we'll turn it over for questions. Okay? Thank you."

Before we begin our remarks, I should remind you that statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions about future revenues and earnings, capital expenditures, industry conditions and competition, dates that drilling rigs will enter service, as well as managementâ€™s plans and objectives for the future. A discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in the company's expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstance on which any forward-looking statement is based.
After we have discussed our results, we will have a question-and-answer session, during which we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can open the floor to as many people as possible.

338612,117868641,98855,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going",1094,"Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going forward. 
The results for the quarter, I think, reflect a couple of positives. Clearly, everybodyâ€™s focused in on our tax rate decline due to some provisions which were included in the right at the end of the year tax agreement that was hammered out between the administration and Congress. And this favorably impacted the way Diamond Offshore was taxed, and so we had a catch-up adjustment to our tax rate to lower the effective tax rate that had been in place for the first three quarters of the year. 
But in addition to that, I think our revenues, we were pleased with where they were. We had less rigs, actually, on the high seas moving from location to location. And although you can do your best to negotiate a mobilization, either day rate or fixed rates, the FASB requires us to suspend recognition of any of that revenue and defer it into the future, so we go to zero. So I mean, theoretically, if we had huge chunks of our fleet mobilizing, then we would be reporting nothing.
But anyway, that wasn't taking place during the quarter, and then we were pleased with -- we've had several initiatives in place to lower the minimal downtime due to equipment failures. And there's always some risk of that in the business, but we're pleased with the progress we've been making on that, month after month. And I think that showed up, to a slight degree, in the results for the quarter. And at the same time, our costs, where they needed to be, we devote efforts certainly in all markets to cost control. But as we had positioned rigs in the new markets over time, we were able to get on top of some of that.
Secondly, talk about our construction program. We announced the commitment of our second option with Hyundai for the construction of a 12,000-foot drillship, and indicated that this vessel and the previous vessel would be named Ocean BlackHawk and Ocean BlackHornet. Our thought process in both the option and the original commitment was based upon clear, high product prices that we see out there and our expectations that they would continue due to demand growth. And despite all the efforts out there, slow supply growth, augmented then by the low construction costs that we began seeing towards the end of last year, and we're ready and have been doing the work so that we could go forward and make a selection. 
The one thing that we're missing right now is to have ready contracts as when we bought what became the Courage and the Valor. Those were great purchases because we knew the market was such that probably that they have existing contracts but that we could bid for alternative contracts. So although we don't have the contracts, we've got high product prices and low construction cost. And as 70s star Meat Loaf would sing, ""Two out of three ain't bad."" So we think that's great. 
And the other comment I would make is we were pleased with acquisitions such as the Courage and Valor, but our assessment of the market out there was there were too many players and too few equipment that would come to market here in the short term and so that new construction was the appropriate place for us to continue to try to seek high returns by controlling the amount of capital that we spend out there.
Third area I'd like to talk about for a moment is Egypt. Diamond Offshore has three rigs in Egypt: The Ocean Endeavor, a large-scale 10,000-foot semi that's drilling in the Mediterranean. We have two jackups, the Ocean Spur in the Mediterranean, and the Ocean Heritage in the Gulf of Suez. Combined, those vessels produce day rates just a little bit under $350,000 a day. That's under 5% of the total day rates that we're earning presently, so it's a small piece. First item was to make sure that our people were secure. And we have successfully, up to this point in time, evacuated. Administrative people and dependents are either all out of the country or there may be one or two that are still in the Cairo Airport, but we're comfortable that we've secured that. 
Other than that, we still have operations folks there, and we're continuing to work as directed. Some of the rigs may not have active activity going on at the moment, but other rigs are continuing to make hole. We're dealing with crude change issues. It's obviously challenging for everybody, but we're continuing on. We do have, as in all contracts, force majeure provisions in there. We do not -- none of those have been exercised to date, but our biggest rig, the Ocean Endeavor has a provision in there that upon force majeure, we would continue on day rate for 30 days before cancellation could go forward. But at present, as I said, we're continuing to work those particular issues.
And then finally, let me close out on the dividends. Dividends have been an important part of our method of returning value to shareholders. We've got a long history, going back, have paid out significant sums of money to shareholders. And that continues to be something that we value highly. As you know, we do not give forward guidance, and we set most of the dividend in the form of a special dividend that we say will be readdressed and reassessed by the board at each particular step. 
However, I would note that we have already made payments of $300 million for the down payments on the two vessels. We do not have payments due again until they're delivered in 2013. And we made the board assess the dividend for this quarter in light of knowing that we had those commitments and chose to continue our payment. We had $1 billion of cash as we went into the quarter. We've since drawn down $300 million of that, but we are not in a position at the moment where the construction program is something that we have to do at the cost of the dividends through this particular quarter.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary Krenek to give you some more cost guidance."
338612,117868641,98855,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through the operating results. Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year",1027,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through the operating results. Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year is to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter conference call of last year, we guided our rig operating expense cost to -- we said it would be approximately $1.5 billion for 2010. And actual year-to-date numbers for 2010 came in at $1.4 billion. Favorable variance was a result of two things. First of all, we have four rigs, three floaters and one jackup that we made a marketing decision to cold-stack during 2010. And so those costs during the year were reduced to very small amounts while they were cold-stacked, which brought the cost down.
The second thing, as Larry talked about, when we mobe [mobilize] rigs, not only do we defer revenue, as he said, but we also quit recognizing expense. And we defer those expenses that we incur while those rigs are mobe-ing and amortize those costs over the length of the working part of the contract, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. So we had, because of the moratorium, Ocean Endeavor, unexpectedly left the Gulf of Mexico during the year, and we reduced our costs. So the cost bring -- taking that into account, brought our costs down somewhat. These are all things that we have made known during our conference calls and our rig status reports. So if you made that adjustment to our original guidance, we were pretty much spot-on with the guidance we gave for our contract drilling cost in 2010.
Looking forward to 2011, we again expect contract drilling costs to be around $1.5 billion. It's going to increase over 2010 this past year for a couple of reasons. First of all, we'll have a full year's operating cost on the Courage and the Valor, the two new rigs that we acquired and put to work during the year and incurred only a portion of our year's cost in this past year. Second, the amortization of those mobe costs that we had during 2010 when we suspended recognizing costs was not only for the Confidence and Endeavor but we also mobe-ed the America, the Baroness and the Scepter out of the Gulf of Mexico that we had anticipated. So all five of those add to amortized cost in 2011. 
And finally, the fact that those five rigs are working in international areas which are a higher cost area than the Gulf of Mexico, all totaled, should bring our costs up to about $1.5 billion.  
As is our custom, annually, we give everyone our expected cost for each of our rigs by class and location in the fourth quarter conference call, so that it can aid you in estimating our future rig operating costs. To save time, rather than me give those costs here, weâ€™ve listed them in our rig status report that we filed last night. Iâ€™ll refer you to that document, so that you can see that. Again, to be perfectly clear, these costs represent contract drilling expenses only and we exclude reimbursable costs.
If you take those operating costs by day that we've listed, in addition to those costs, what we will incur is approximately $100 million of amortized mobe costs. Those costs are going to be broken down to approximately $20 million in Q1. We go up to $40 million in Q2 and back down to $20 million again in Q3 and Q4. That's due to just how some contracts roll over and expire and weâ€™ve changed the way we amortize these things due to some accounting rules.
We will also incur some $70 million to $80 million worth of survey costs during the year. That's going to be broken down between four jackups: The Nugget, Heritage, Summit and Sovereign, which will incur about $3 million to $5 million each; the Saratoga and the Princess, $5 million to $7 million each; the Clipper and America, when they're in the shipyard during their surveys, will incur $9 million to $12 million each; and finally, the Whittington and the Epoch, $12 million to $15 million each. Again, these are costs in excess of the normal daily operating costs that we've listed on our rig status report. In order to get the associated down days and other down days with these rigs and also to be able to tell which quarter we expect at this time those surveys to occur, please look at that rig status report that we filed last night.
Looking at just the first quarter, some guidance there, if you take the net normal operating cost and the other guidance I just gave you, we expect rig operating expense to come in at about $370 million to $380 million in Q1 in this coming year. Looking at some of the other line items, we believe G&A will be consistent year-over-year, $17 million to $18 million per quarter during 2011. Depreciation expense will increase slightly, primarily due to the Courage and the Valor being out there the full year, plus other CapEx that we've spent in the past couple of years. $103 million to $106 million is what we're estimating per quarter right now. 
Interest expense should be flat at $22 million per quarter or thereabouts. We're expecting our effective tax rate taking into account the Extenders Bill and also the geographic locations of where we're earning our moneys, believe the rate will go down to 24% to 26%. And also, I'd like to remind people now, the Extenders Bill is in effect for all of 2011 but as of now, that bill is set to expire on December 31 of 2011.
And finally, capital expenditures. We're looking at maintenance capital of approximately $320 million for the coming year. And as Larry said, we spent slightly over $300 million on the down payment on the two new builds which will go into CapEx for 2011. 
And unless Larry has any other comments, we'll turn it over for questions. Okay? Thank you."

I believe that the vibe coming out of the regulators is that for certain of the operations that were in progress at the day of the Macondo incidents, they would not have to apply for a new environmental permit. And so gathering around those particular rigs and operations, that would be everybody's thinking, that those would be the first rigs to go back to work.

Before we begin our remarks, I should remind you that statements made during this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, discussions about future revenues and earnings, capital expenditures, industry conditions and competition, dates that drilling rigs will enter service, as well as managementâ€™s plans and objectives for the future. A discussion of the risk factors that could impact these areas and the company's overall business and financial performance can be found in the company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Given these concerns, investors and analysts should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The company expressly disclaims any obligation to release publicly any updates to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in the company's expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstance on which any forward-looking statement is based.
After we have discussed our results, we will have a question-and-answer session, during which we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can open the floor to as many people as possible.

338612,117868641,99650,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going",1094,"Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going forward. 
The results for the quarter, I think, reflect a couple of positives. Clearly, everybodyâ€™s  focused in on our tax rate decline due to some provisions which were included in the right at the end of the year tax agreement that was hammered out between the administration and Congress. And this favorably impacted the way Diamond Offshore was taxed, and so we had a catch-up adjustment to our tax rate to lower the effective tax rate that had been in place for the first three quarters of the year. 
But in addition to that, I think our revenues, we were pleased with where they were. We had less rigs, actually, on the high seas moving from location to location. And although you can do your best to negotiate a mobilization, either day rate or fixed rates, the FASB requires us to suspend recognition of any of that revenue and defer it into the future, so we go to zero. So I mean, theoretically, if we had huge chunks of our fleet mobilizing, then we would be reporting nothing.
But anyway, that wasn't taking place during the quarter, and then we were pleased with -- we've had several initiatives in place to lower the minimal downtime due to equipment failures. And there's always some risk of that in the business, but we're pleased with the progress we've been making on that, month after month. And I think that showed up, to a slight degree, in the results for the quarter. And at the same time, our costs, where they needed to be, we devote efforts certainly in all markets to cost control. But as we had positioned rigs in the new markets over time, we were able to get on top of some of that.
Secondly, talk about our construction program. We announced the commitment of our second option with Hyundai for the construction of a 12,000-foot drillship, and indicated that this vessel and the previous vessel would be named Ocean BlackHawk and Ocean BlackHornet. Our thought process in both the option and the original commitment was based upon clear, high product prices that we see out there and our expectations that they would continue due to demand growth. And despite all the efforts out there, slow supply growth, augmented then by the low construction costs that we began seeing towards the end of last year, and we're ready and have been doing the work so that we could go forward and make a selection. 
The one thing that we're missing right now is to have ready contracts as when we bought  what became the Courage  and the Valor.  Those were great purchases because we knew the market was such that probably that they have existing contracts but that we could bid for alternative contracts. So although we don't have the contracts, we've got high product prices and low construction cost. And as 70s star Meat Loaf would sing, ""Two out of three ain't bad."" So we think that's great. 
And the other comment I would make is we were pleased with acquisitions such as the Courage and Valor, but our assessment of the market out there was there were too many players and too few equipment that would come to market here in the short term and so that new construction was the appropriate place for us to continue to try to seek high returns by controlling the amount of capital that we spend out there.
Third area I'd like to talk about for a moment is Egypt. Diamond Offshore has three rigs in Egypt: The Ocean Endeavor, a large-scale 10,000-foot semi that's drilling in the Mediterranean. We have two jackups, the Ocean Spur in the Mediterranean, and the Ocean Heritage in the Gulf of Suez. Combined, those vessels produce day rates just a little bit under $350,000 a day. That's under 5% of the total day rates that we're earning presently, so it's a small piece. First item was to make sure that our people were secure. And we have successfully, up to this point in time, evacuated. Administrative people and dependents are either all out of the country or there may be one or two that are still in the Cairo Airport,  but we're comfortable that we've secured that. 
Other than that, we still have operations folks there, and we're continuing to work as directed. Some of the rigs may not have active activity going on at the moment, but other rigs are continuing to make hole. We're dealing with crude change issues. It's obviously challenging for everybody, but we're continuing on. We do have, as in all contracts, force majeure provisions in there. We do not -- none of those have been exercised to date, but our biggest rig, the Ocean Endeavor has a provision in there that upon force majeure, we would continue on day rate for 30 days before cancellation could go forward. But at present, as I said, we're continuing to work those particular issues.
And then finally, let me close out on the dividends. Dividends have been an important part of our method of returning value to shareholders. We've got a long history, going back, have paid out significant sums of money to shareholders. And that continues to be something that we value highly. As you know, we do not give forward guidance, and we set most of the dividend in the form of a special dividend that we say will be readdressed and reassessed by the board at each particular step. 
However, I would note that we have already made payments of $300 million for the down payments on the two vessels. We do not have payments due again until they're delivered in 2013. And we made the board assess the dividend for this quarter in light of knowing that we had those commitments and chose to continue our payment. We had $1 billion of cash as we went into the quarter. We've since drawn down $300 million of that, but we are not in a position at the moment where the construction program is something that we have to do at the cost of the dividends through this particular quarter.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary Krenek to give you some more cost guidance."
338612,117868641,99650,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through the operating results. Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year",1027,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through the operating results. Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year is to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter conference call of last year, we guided our rig operating expense cost to -- we said it would be approximately $1.5 billion for 2010. And actual year-to-date numbers for 2010 came in at $1.4 billion. Favorable variance was a result of two things. First of all, we have four rigs, three floaters and one jackup that we made a marketing decision to cold-stack  during 2010. And so those costs during the year were reduced to very small amounts while they were cold-stacked, which brought the cost down.
The second thing, as Larry talked about, when we mobe [mobilize] rigs, not only do we defer revenue, as he said, but we also quit recognizing expense. And we defer those expenses that we incur while those rigs are mobe-ing and amortize those costs over the length of the working part of the contract,  in  accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. So we had, because of the moratorium, Ocean  Endeavor, unexpectedly left the Gulf of Mexico during the year, and we reduced our costs. So the cost bring -- taking that into account, brought our costs down somewhat. These are all things that we have made known during our conference calls and our rig status reports. So if you made that adjustment to our original guidance, we were pretty much spot-on with the guidance we gave for our contract drilling cost in 2010.
Looking forward to 2011, we again expect contract drilling costs to be around $1.5 billion. It's going to increase over 2010 this past year for a couple of reasons. First of all, we'll have a full year's operating cost on the Courage and the Valor, the two new rigs that we acquired and put to work during the year and incurred only a portion of our year's cost in this past year. Second, the amortization of those mobe costs that we had during 2010 when we suspended recognizing costs was not only for the Confidence  and Endeavor  but we also mobe-ed the America,  the Baroness  and the Scepter  out of the Gulf of Mexico that we had anticipated. So all five of those add to  amortized cost in 2011. 
And finally, the fact that those five rigs are working in international areas which are a higher cost area than the Gulf of Mexico, all totaled, should bring our costs up to about $1.5 billion.  
As is our custom, annually, we give everyone our expected cost for each of our rigs by class and location in the fourth quarter conference call, so that it can aid you in estimating our future rig operating costs. To save  time, rather than me give those costs here, weâ€™ve listed them in our rig status report that we filed last night. Iâ€™ll refer you to that document, so that you can see that. Again, to be perfectly clear, these costs represent contract drilling expenses only and we exclude reimbursable costs.
If you take those operating costs by day that we've listed, in addition to those costs, what we will incur is approximately $100 million of amortized mobe costs. Those costs are going to be broken down to approximately $20 million in Q1. We go up to $40 million in Q2 and back down to $20 million again in Q3 and Q4. That's due to just how some contracts roll over and expire and weâ€™ve changed the way we amortize these things due to some accounting rules.
We will also incur some $70 million to $80 million worth of survey costs during the year. That's going to be broken down between four jackups:  The Nugget, Heritage,  Summit  and Sovereign,  which will incur about $3 million to $5 million each; the Saratoga  and the Princess,  $5 million to $7 million each; the Clipper  and America,  when they're in the shipyard during their surveys, will incur $9 million to $12 million each; and finally, the Whittington  and the Epoch,  $12 million to $15 million each. Again, these are costs in excess of the normal daily operating costs that we've listed on our rig status report. In order to get the associated down days and other down days with these rigs and also to be able to tell which quarter we expect at this time those surveys to occur, please look at that rig status report that we filed last night.
Looking at just the first quarter, some guidance there, if you take the net normal operating cost and the other guidance I just gave you, we expect rig operating expense to come in at about $370 million to $380 million in Q1 in this coming year. Looking at some of the other line items, we believe G&A will be consistent year-over-year, $17 million to $18 million per quarter during 2011. Depreciation expense will increase slightly, primarily due to the Courage and the Valor being out there  the full year, plus other CapEx that we've spent in the past couple of years. $103 million to $106 million is what we're estimating per quarter right now. 
Interest expense should be flat at $22 million per quarter or thereabouts. We're expecting our effective tax rate taking into account the Extenders Bill and also the geographic locations of where we're earning our moneys,  believe the rate will go down to 24% to 26%. And also, I'd like to remind people now, the Extenders Bill is in effect for all of 2011 but as of now, that bill is set to expire on December 31 of 2011.
And finally, capital expenditures. We're looking at maintenance capital of approximately $320 million for the coming year. And as Larry said, we spent slightly over $300 million on the down payment on the two new builds which will go into CapEx for 2011. 
 
And unless Larry has any other comments, we'll turn it over for questions. Okay? Thank you."

And so once they get over that hurdle, then the next hurdle is the actual application for permits and how the environmental standards go through. I believe that the vibe coming out of the regulators is that for certain of the operations that were in progress at the day of the Macondo incidents, they would not have to apply for a new environmental permit. And so gathering around those particular rigs and operations, that would be everybody's thinking, that those would be the first rigs to go back to work.

We were very pleased with the operating results which we are able to this morning. A couple of comments around that. We had some of the lowest unanticipated equipment downtime that we recorded in many, many quarters fell from Q4 of '10 of 142 days to only 72 days in Q1 of '11. Now we worked very hard. We got lots of programs, even with time to do preventive maintenance such that we don't have this, but it is, we believe that that's related to that. But it is an event that we'll comment . We were very pleased with that. We also had a very low amount of shipyard and job preparation and mobe time, in the quarter, only 168 days which is down 100 days from Q4 '10 and significantly from Q3 of '10 where we were over 570 days in that nature.
So a more effective day rate utilization out there through a combination of preventive maintenance to prevent things from breaking. And a schedule where for this quarter and we'll talk about as we look to the next quarter, we actually have very few rig moves or contract preps or scheduled shipyard time, all of which benefits us greatly.
Now having said that, I would point out that we have 3 big rigs that are scheduled to return to work or begin recognizing higher revenue in the coming quarter. Let's start with the Ocean Monarch, which has been idle, really, since shortly after the events of a year ago. Today, we have an approximate 60 day job with marathon in the 290s where we will be working here in the Gulf of Mexico. The Ocean Victory has been recognizing a standby day rate, primarily, we do have some future commitments from its customer above $500,000 which we will begin, we believe recognizing some of that day rate in Q2. And in some far more opportunities for that rig to work for additional folks, not at the $500,000 rate, but significantly above what we've been enjoying on a standby rate.
And then the Ocean America which has a contract that last into next year with Woodside in Australia, has finished some shipyard modifications and special survey and has returned from Singapore and working still today. And that's in the low $400,000. So all of those things will be the positive that will come about as we go forward into Q2. 
Now looking down the road in Q3 and Q4, that's when we begin to have a number of rigs that are scheduled in the shipyard, so those there will be some negatives that will hit us in Q3, Q4. But again, we are certainly pleased with this $1.80 total earnings, included the recovery of about $0.06, I believe, related to collection of a bad debt. This was from the financial crisis where we continue to work for a company that went bankrupt. We will all start your future contract, what for that work period of time, that was a claim and a final disposition of assets came through collective that. So whether you want to look $1.80 or, I think, discounting a couple of other minor, nonrecurring items, we are down to $1.73.
So that lays the table as we go forward, we'll talk about the market and how we see that and prospects for our new drill ships through your &A. I will turn it over to Gary Krenek to make some additional comments."

As Larry pointed out, for the quarter, we made $251 million of bottom line net income or $1.80 a share based on revenues of $789 million. This compares to last quarter when we made $242 million in net income or EPS of $1.74 on $824 million.",892,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry pointed out, for the quarter, we made $251 million of bottom line net income or $1.80 a share based on revenues of $789 million. This compares to last quarter when we made $242 million in net income or EPS of $1.74 on $824 million. Getting right into some of the specific line items on the income statement. The balance sheet was pretty clean as normal, so there's really nothing to comment there. On the income statement, looking at contract drilling expenses, those came in at $362 million, which was below our bottom-line guidance. Our guidance last conference call was to come at $370 million to $380 million. The two reasons for coming in below that low end of the guidance. One was, we decided to coal stack the Ocean Epoch, on our rig that's located in Australia, Southeast Asia area. That rig was scheduled to come in to do a survey on it because of excess cost of what we were going to have to spending on that survey, we decided to coal stack that rig so that the fact of not having operating expenses for the second half of the quarter plus the survey costs lowered our contract drilling expenses somewhat. Also, our continuing efforts to control costs continued to pay off and bring us in at the low-end of our guidance.
Larry talked about bad debt expense. That was a negative $8.5 million as a line item. I won't talk any more about that. Depreciation came in slightly below our expectations of $101 million, we had guided to $103 million to $106 million per quarter for this year. Based on the information we have available now, we're expecting future quarters to come in between $101 million to $104 million per quarter. Q2 will be a little bit toward the high end of that guidance simply based on the number of days. We have one more day in Q2 than we did in Q1.
G&A was $18 million, within our guidance of $17 million to $18 million. And we expect that to continue on a go forward basis also.
Now looking at our tax expense line where we had the biggest variance to the guidance we gave in our last conference call, we have an effective tax rate of approximately 16% for the quarter. Contributing to this low rate was the reduction to deferred income tax expense related to undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. Due to a tax law change enacted late December of 2010 and in light of our new rigs being constructed, the company determined during the quarter that it would be more tax efficient to redeploy earnings of the foreign subs into new rig reconstruction rather than repay trading and earnings to the U.S. This resulted in approximately $15 million one-time reduction to our current quarter's tax expense.
This regarding this reduction from deferred tax, the annual effective tax rate would have been approximately 21%. Our original guidance last quarter was for a tax rate of between 24% and 26%. This reduction this quarter is due primarily to differences in the mix of our domestic and international pretax earnings, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions which we operate or expect to operate throughout 2011. Based on the current information now available, we are revising our estimate for our tax rate on a go forward basis to be somewhere between 21% and 25% to all 3 of the quarters remaining in 2011.
Looking forward to 2011 for the rest of the items, big one contract drilling expense, we gave out normal operating costs by rig price and location last quarter and those numbers remained consistent. If you calculate those numbers, you need to also add an additional $21 million worth of amortized MO be expense are pretty expense does not include amortized MOBs because that number can vary from quarter-to-quarter. So if you take the normal operating costs plus the $21 million amortized MOB, we expect the fee contract drilling expense of somewhere between $360 million and $375 million in this coming quarter. As Larry pointed out, Q2 will be a very low quarter as far as rigs going into the shipyard for either some type of equipment modification repair or repair or their five-year surveys. As for our rig status report that we released yesterday or this morning, we only have 21 days expecting Q2. Q3, we will be up to 366 down days, 4 rigs in the shipyard surveys and then we'll include 7 rigs, and at that point, we will incur additional costs for those rigs going into the shipyard. So Q2 will be, as I've said before, somewhere between $360 million to $375 million, so expect to see those costs to go up in Q3.
Again, G&A, $18 million to $18 million for the rest of the year. The effective tax rate, as I said, 21% to 24%. And finally, our CapEx guidance that we gave last quarter which was $320 million worth of CapEx, that is in addition to the down payments we made on the new builds that we did during the first quarter of slightly over $300 million. That guidance remains in place and we will continue to expect to see that for 2011.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry"

As I said, we're going to be under, below the average of these first two quarters. In the next two quarters, we will go up to the third and fourth, will be above the average number. Number one, costs normally tend to increase in the second half of the year. You place your budgets, you order equipment. prepare to do the work. in the first half, you do it in the second. so that normally drives costs up. But when all the downtime of the surveys being second half loaded this year, we'll get hit with that also. So the $1.5 billion is still our best guess."

And so that does come down to people we've recently given very large raises, we've established retention policies for critical skills. So to some degree, there will be people coming off of older rigs. The biggest thing, though, is we bought to attract new personal into the industry and provide training and retention opportunities for that. I think we are in a world right now where jobs are in high demand. These are very high-paying jobs. But we need to plan down the road. It's not something that we just want to add in the paper and then the skills set up appears. And so I believe that us and the various other drilling contractors are engaged in efforts to increase training and to source personnel from around the world. And that's one of the things that frustrates me so much about the slowdown, the moratorium, the lack of permits, the lack of clarity in the Gulf of Mexico, is that if I don't have any rigs in the Gulf of Mexico where I can train these people, I'm not going to hire untrained Americans and put them on an airplane and fly them to some other location. That's just does not make sense. So I would look in the absence of something stepping up that we will begin sourcing a number of our personnel from overseas. And so you're going to be taking these high paid American jobs and seeding them overseas. And as best I can tell, that does that having any impact, no one's really recognizing that in the government. And when we and others go down that path, it could be very difficult to reverse it. So that was my soapbox today."

We were very pleased with the operating results, which we are able to report this morning.

We were very pleased with the operating results, which we are able to report this morning. A couple of comments around that, we had some of the lowest unanticipated equipment downtime that we recorded in many, many quarters fell from Q4 of '10 of 142 days to only 72 days in Q1 of '11. 
Now we worked very hard. We've got lots of programs, even with time to do preventive maintenance such that we don't have this, but it is, we believe that that's related to that. But it is an event that will come and go. We were very pleased with that. We also had a very low amount of shipyard and job preparation and mobe time in the quarter, only 168 days which is down 100 days from Q4 '10 and significantly from Q3 of '10 where we were over 570 days in that nature.
So a more effective day rate utilization out there through the combination of preventive maintenance to prevent things from breaking, and a schedule where, for this quarter and we're going to talk a little about as we look to the next quarter, we actually have very few rig moves or contract preps or scheduled shipyard time, all of which benefits us greatly.
Now having said that, I would point out that we have 3 big rigs that are scheduled to return to work or begin recognizing higher revenue in the coming quarter. Let's start with the Ocean Monarch, which has been idle, really, since shortly after the events of a year ago. Today, we have an approximate 60-day job with marathon in the 290s, where we will be working here in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The Ocean Victory has been recognizing a standby day rate, primarily, we do have some future commitments from its customer above $500,000 which we will begin, we believe recognizing some of that day rate in Q2. And then some farm out opportunities for that rig to work for additional folks, not at the $500,000 rate, but significantly above what we've been enjoying on a standby rate.
And then the Ocean America, which has a contract that last into next year with Woodside in Australia, has finished some shipyard modifications and special survey and has returned from Singapore and working today. And that's in the low $400,000. So all of those things we'll be positive that will come about as we go forward into Q2. 
Now looking down the road in Q3 and Q4, that's when we begin to have a number of rigs that are scheduled in the shipyard, so there'll be some negatives that will hit us in Q3, Q4. But again, we're certainly pleased with this $1.80 total earnings, including the recovery of about $0.06, I believe, related to collection of a bad debt. This was from the financial crisis where we continue to work for a company that went bankrupt. We will all start of our future contract, but for that work period of time, that was a claim and a final disposition of assets came through and collected that. So whether you want to look at $1.80 or, I think, discounting a couple of other minor, non-recurring items, we are down to $1.73.
So that lays the table as we go forward, we'll talk about the market and how we see that and prospects for our new drill ships through your &A. I will turn it over to Gary Krenek to make some additional comments."

As Larry pointed out, for the quarter, we made $251 million of bottom line net income or $1.80 a share based on revenues of $789 million. This compares to last quarter when we made $242 million in net income or EPS of $1.74 on $824 million.",887,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry pointed out, for the quarter, we made $251 million of bottom line net income or $1.80 a share based on revenues of $789 million. This compares to last quarter when we made $242 million in net income or EPS of $1.74 on $824 million. 
Getting right into some of the specific line items on the income statement. The balance sheet was pretty clean as normal, so there's really nothing to comment there. On the income statement, looking at contract drilling expenses, those came in at $362 million, which was below our bottom-line guidance. Our guidance last conference call was to come at $370 million to $380 million. The two reasons for coming in below that low end of the guidance. One was, we decided to coal stack the Ocean Epoch on a rig that's located in Australia, Southeast Asia area. That rig was scheduled to come in to do a survey on it because of excess cost of what we were going to have to spend on that survey, we decided to coal stack that rig so the fact of not having operating expenses for the second half of the quarter, plus saving the survey costs lowered our contract drilling expenses somewhat. Also, our continuing efforts to control costs continue to pay off in bringing us in at the low end of our guidance.
Larry talked about bad debt expense. That was a negative $8.5 million as a line item. I won't talk any more about that. Depreciation came in slightly below our expectations of $101 million, we've guided to $103 million to $106 million per quarter for this year. Based on the information we have available now, we're expecting future quarters to come in between $101 million to $104 million per quarter. Q2 will be a little bit toward the high end of that guidance simply based on the number of days. We have one more day in Q2 than we did in Q1.
G&A was $18 million, within our guidance of $17 million to $18 million. And we expect that to continue on a go-forward basis also.
Now looking at our tax expense line where we had the biggest variance for the guidance we gave in our last conference call, we had an effective tax rate of approximately 16% for the quarter. Contributing to this low rate was the reduction to deferred income tax expense related to undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. Due to the tax law change enacted late December of 2010, and in light of our new rigs being constructed, the company determined during the quarter that it would be more tax efficient to redeploy earnings of the foreign subs into new rig reconstruction rather than repay trading and earnings to the U.S. This resulted in approximately $15 million one-time reduction to our current quarter's tax expense.
Disregarding this reduction from deferred tax, the annual effective tax rate would have been approximately 21%. Our original guidance last quarter was for a tax rate of between 24% and 26%. This reduction this quarter is due primarily to differences in the mix of our domestic and international pretax earnings, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions, which we operate or expect to operate throughout 2011. Based on the current information now available, we're revising our estimate for our tax rate on a go-forward basis to be somewhere between 21% and 25% for all 3 of the quarters remaining in 2011.
Looking forward to 2011 for the rest of the items, big one contract drilling expense, we gave out normal operating costs by rig price and location last quarter and those numbers remain consistent. If you calculate those numbers, you need to also add an additional $21 million worth of amortized mobe expense or per day cost in earnings, does not include amortized mobes because that number can vary from quarter-to-quarter. 
So if you take the normal operating costs plus the $21 million amortized mobe, we expect the fee contract drilling expense of somewhere between $360 million and $375 million in this coming quarter. As Larry pointed out, Q2 will be a very low quarter as far as rigs going into the shipyard for either some type of equipment modification repair or their five-year surveys. As for our rig status report that we released yesterday or this morning, we only have 21 days expecting Q2. Q3, we will be up to 366 down days, 4 rigs in the shipyard surveys that will include 7 rigs. And at that point, we will incur additional costs for those rigs going into the shipyard. So Q2 will be, as I've said before, somewhere between $360 million to $375 million. We expect to see those costs to go up in Q3.
Again, G&A, $17 million to $18 million for the rest of the year. The effective tax rate, as I said, 21% to 24%. And finally, our CapEx guidance that we gave last quarter which was $320 million worth of CapEx, that is in addition to the down payments we made on the new builds that we did during the first quarter of slightly over $300 million. That guidance remains in place and we will continue to expect to see that for 2011.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry"

There's a number of folks out there that are now competing and ultimately bought it with vessels. So that's hard to say. And then the acquisition 101 in this business is such a very little premium that you can pay because it's very little cost savings that have to be had back by combining 2 fleets together. So too me, it's just very opportunistic. Oftentimes, the combined entities are in a great shape, but if you go back and look one side or the other, the shareholders had to take some value reduction to get the transaction done, it seems to me."

As I address the events that occurred a year ago, I said the number one thing is the making sure that we got procedures and personnel in place that can continually apply prudent drilling operations to deliver safe and environmentally non-risky results. And so that does come down to people, we've recently given very large raises, we've established retention policies for critical skills. So to some degree, there will be people coming off of older rigs. The biggest thing, though, is we've got to attract new personnel into the industry and provide training and retention opportunities for that. I think we are in a world right now where jobs are in high demand. These are very high-paying jobs. But we need to plan down the road. It's not something that we just run an add in the paper and then the skills set up appears. And so I believe that us, and the various other drilling contractors, are engaged in efforts to increase training and to source personnel from around the world. And that's one of the things that frustrates me so much about the slowdown, the moratorium, the lack of permits, the lack of clarity in the Gulf of Mexico, is that if I don't have any rigs in the Gulf of Mexico where I can train these people, I'm not going to hire untrained Americans and put them on an airplane and fly them to some other location. That just does not make any sense. So I would look in the absence of something stepping up that we will begin sourcing a number of our personnel from overseas. And so you're going to be taking these high-paid American jobs and seeding them overseas. And as best I can tell, that definitely is not having any impact. No one's really recognizing that in the government. And when we and others go down that path, it could be very difficult to reverse it. So that was my soapbox today."

We were very pleased with the operating results, which we are able to report this morning. A couple of comments around that, we had some of the lowest unanticipated equipment downtime that we've recorded in many, many",605,"Thank you, and good morning, as well. We were very pleased with the operating results, which we are able to report this morning. A couple of comments around that, we had some of the lowest unanticipated equipment downtime that we've recorded in many, many quarters fell from Q4 of '10 of 142 days to only 72 days in Q1 of '11. 
Now we've worked very hard. We've got lots of programs dealing with responding [ph] to do preventive maintenance such that we don't have this, but it is -- we believe that that's related to that. But it is an event that will come and go. But we're very pleased with that. We also had a very low amount of shipyard and job preparation and mobe time in the quarter, only 168 days which is down 100 days from Q4 of '10 and significantly from Q3 of '10 where we were over 570 days in that nature. 
So a more effective day rate utilization out there through a combination of preventive maintenance to prevent things from breaking, and a schedule where, for this quarter and Gary will talk a little about as we look to the next quarter, we actually have very few rig moves or contract preps or scheduled shipyard time, all of which benefits us greatly. 
Now having said that, I would point out that we have 3 big rigs that are scheduled to return to work or begin recognizing higher revenue in the coming quarter. Let's start with the Ocean Monarch, which has been idle, really, since shortly after the events of a year ago. Today, we have an approximate 60 day job with Marathon in the 290s, where we'll be working here in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The Ocean Victory has been recognizing a standby day rate, primarily, we do have some future commitments from this customer above 500,000 which we will begin, we believe recognizing some of that day rate in Q2. And then there are some farm out opportunities for that rig to work for additional folks, not at the $500 rate, but significantly above what we've been enjoying on a standby rate. 
And then the Ocean America, which has a contract that lasts into next year with Woodside in Australia, has finished some shipyard modifications and special survey and has returned from Singapore and is working today. And that's in the low 400s. So all of those things well be positives that will come about as we go forward into Q2. 
Now looking down the road in Q3 and Q4, that's when we begin to have a number of rigs that are scheduled in the shipyard, so those will be some negatives that will hit us in Q3, Q4. But again, we're certainly pleased with this $1.80 total earnings, including the recovery of about $0.06, I believe, related to collection of a bad debt. This was from the financial crisis where we continued to work for a company that went bankrupt. We lost all of our future contract, but for that work period of time, that was a claim that we were able to file in court, and a final disposition of assets came through and we collected that. So whether you want to look at $1.80 or, I think, discounting a couple of other very minor, non recurring items, we are down to $1.73. 
So that lays the table as we go forward, we'll talk about the market and how we see that and prospects for our new drill ships through your Q&A. I'm going to turn it over to Gary Krenek to make some additional comments."

As Larry pointed out, for the quarter, we made $251 million of bottom line net income or $1.80 a share based on revenues of $789 million. This compares to last quarter when we made $242 million in net income or EPS of $1.74 on $824 million.",904,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry pointed out, for the quarter, we made $251 million of bottom line net income or $1.80 a share based on revenues of $789 million. This compares to last quarter when we made $242 million in net income or EPS of $1.74 on $824 million. 
Getting right into some of the specific line items on the income statement. The balance sheet was pretty clean as normal, so there's really nothing to comment there. On the income statement, looking at contract drilling expenses, those came in at $362 million, which was below our bottom line guidance. Our guidance last conference call was for it to come in at $370 million to $380 million. The two reasons for coming in below that low end of the guidance. One was, we decided to coal stack the Ocean Epoch on a rig that's located in Australia, Southeast Asia area. That rig was scheduled to come in to do a survey on it because of the excess cost of what we were going to have to spend on that survey, we decided to coal stack that rig so the fact of not having operating expenses for the second half of the quarter, plus saving the survey cost lowered our contract drilling expenses somewhat. Also, our continuing efforts to control cost continue to pay off in bring us in at the low end of our guidance. 
Larry talked about bad debt expense. That was a negative $8.5 million as a line item. I won't talk any more about that. Depreciation came in slightly below our expectations at $101 million. We had guided to $103 million to $106 million per quarter for this year. Based on the information we have available now, we're expecting future quarters to come in at between $101 million to $104 million per quarter. Q2 will be a little bit toward the high end of that guidance simply based on the number of days. We have one more day in Q2 than we did in Q1. 
G&A was $18 million, within our guidance of $17 million to $18 million. And we expect that to continue on a go forward basis also. 
Now looking at our tax expense line where we had the biggest variance for the guidance we gave in our last conference call, we had an effective tax rate of approximately 16% for the quarter. Contributing to this low rate was a reduction to deferred income tax expense related to undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. Due to the tax law change enacted late December of 2010, and in light of our new rigs being constructed, the company determined during the quarter that it would be more tax efficient to redeploy earnings of the foreign subs into new rig reconstruction rather than repatriating the earnings to the U.S. This resulted in an approximately $15 million one time reduction to our current quarter's tax expense. 
Disregarding this reduction to deferred tax, the annual effective tax rate would have been approximately 21%. Our original guidance last quarter was for a tax rate of between 24% and 26%. This reduction this quarter is due primarily to differences in the mix of our domestic and international pretax earnings, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions, which we operate or expect to operate throughout 2011. Based on the current information now available, we're revising our estimate for our tax rate on a go forward basis to be somewhere between 21% and 25% for all 3 of the quarters remaining in 2011. 
Looking forward to 2011 for the rest of our items, a big one, contract drilling expense. We gave out normal operating costs by rig type and rig location last quarter and those numbers remain consistent. If you calculate those numbers, you need to also add an additional $21 million worth of amortized mobe expense. Our per-day cost do not -- does not include amortized mobes because that number can vary from quarter to quarter. 
So if you take the normal operating costs plus the $21 million amortized mobe, we expect to see contract drilling expense of somewhere between $360 million and $375 million in this coming quarter. As Larry pointed out, Q2 will be a very low quarter as far as rigs going into the shipyard for either some type of equipment modification repair or their five year surveys. As per our rig status report that we released yesterday or this morning, we only have 21 days expected in Q2. Q3, we will be up to 366 down days for rigs in the shipyard surveys, and that will include 7 rigs. And at that point, we will incur additional cost for those rigs going into the shipyard. So Q2 will be, as I've said before, somewhere between $360 million to $375 million. We expect to see those costs to go up in Q3. 
Again, G&A, $17 million to $18 million for the rest of the year. The effective tax rate, as I said, 21% to 24%. And finally, our CapEx guidance that we gave last quarter which was $320 million worth of CapEx, that is in addition to the down payments we made on the new builds that we did during the first quarter of slightly over $300 million. That guidance remains in place and we will continue to expect to see that for 2011. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry"

Certainly, having brought up the one year anniversary, I can say the most significant things that we have done at Diamond Offshore is to ensure that our procedures and our personnel are in place and that we will continue to follow prudent drilling practices that have kept the industry safe and productive these many years, and I think that's what everybody needs to work on. We will meet the standards that our customers require of us.

I would say the biggest issue in the Gulf of Mexico is so many people are pursuing deeper water opportunities. So we just don't know yet who's going to operate in the mid water. But I would think that there's an opportunity there that if you have permitting return, you've already got infrastructure in the mid water, you've got very high product prices and you've got lower drilling costs to get these things hooked up and developed.

It's not something that we just run an ad in the paper and then the skill set up appears. And so I believe that us, and the various other drilling contractors, are engaged in efforts to increase training and to source personnel from around the world. And that's one of the things that just frustrates me so much about the slowdown, the moratorium, the lack of permits, the lack of clarity in the Gulf of Mexico, is that if I don't have any rigs in the Gulf of Mexico where I can train these people, I'm not going to hire untrained Americans and put them on an airplane and fly them to some other location. That just does not make any sense. So I would look in the absence of something stepping up that we will begin sourcing a number of our personnel from overseas. And so you're going to be taking these high paid American jobs and seeding them overseas. And as best I can tell, that definitely is not having any impact. No one's really recognizing that in the government. And when we and others go down that path, it's going to be very difficult to reverse it. So that was my soapbox today."

We were very pleased with the operating results, which we are able to report this morning.

We were very pleased with the operating results, which we are able to report this morning. A couple of comments around that, we had some of the lowest unanticipated equipment downtime that we've recorded in many, many quarters fell from Q4 of '10 of 142 days to only 72 days in Q1 of '11. 
Now we've worked very hard. We've got lots of programs dealing with responding [ph] to do preventive maintenance such that we don't have this, but it is -- we believe that that's related to that. But it is an event that will come and go. But we're very pleased with that. We also had a very low amount of shipyard and job preparation and mobe time in the quarter, only 168 days which is down 100 days from Q4 of '10 and significantly from Q3 of '10 where we were over 570 days in that nature. 
So a more effective day rate utilization out there through a combination of preventive maintenance to prevent things from breaking, and a schedule where, for this quarter and Gary will talk a little about as we look to the next quarter, we actually have very few rig moves or contract preps or scheduled shipyard time, all of which benefits us greatly. 
Now having said that, I would point out that we have 3 big rigs that are scheduled to return to work or begin recognizing higher revenue in the coming quarter. Let's start with the Ocean Monarch, which has been idle, really, since shortly after the events of a year ago. Today, we have an approximate 60 day job with Marathon in the 290s, where we'll be working here in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The Ocean Victory has been recognizing a standby day rate, primarily, we do have some future commitments from this customer above 500,000 which we will begin, we believe recognizing some of that day rate in Q2. And then there are some farm out opportunities for that rig to work for additional folks, not at the $500 rate, but significantly above what we've been enjoying on a standby rate. 
And then the Ocean America, which has a contract that lasts into next year with Woodside in Australia, has finished some shipyard modifications and special survey and has returned from Singapore and is working today. And that's in the low 400s. So all of those things well be positives that will come about as we go forward into Q2. 
Now looking down the road in Q3 and Q4, that's when we begin to have a number of rigs that are scheduled in the shipyard, so those will be some negatives that will hit us in Q3, Q4. But again, we're certainly pleased with this $1.80 total earnings, including the recovery of about $0.06, I believe, related to collection of a bad debt. This was from the financial crisis where we continued to work for a company that went bankrupt. We lost all of our future contract, but for that work period of time, that was a claim that we were able to file in court, and a final disposition of assets came through and we collected that. So whether you want to look at $1.80 or, I think, discounting a couple of other very minor, non recurring items, we are down to $1.73. 
So that lays the table as we go forward, we'll talk about the market and how we see that and prospects for our new drill ships through your Q&A. I'm going to turn it over to Gary Krenek to make some additional comments."

As Larry pointed out, for the quarter, we made $251 million of bottom line net income or $1.80 a share based on revenues of $789 million. This compares to last quarter when we made $242 million in net income or EPS of $1.74 on $824 million.",904,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry pointed out, for the quarter, we made $251 million of bottom line net income or $1.80 a share based on revenues of $789 million. This compares to last quarter when we made $242 million in net income or EPS of $1.74 on $824 million. 
Getting right into some of the specific line items on the income statement. The balance sheet was pretty clean as normal, so there's really nothing to comment there. On the income statement, looking at contract drilling expenses, those came in at $362 million, which was below our bottom line guidance. Our guidance last conference call was for it to come in at $370 million to $380 million. The two reasons for coming in below that low end of the guidance. One was, we decided to coal stack the Ocean Epoch on a rig that's located in Australia, Southeast Asia area. That rig was scheduled to come in to do a survey on it because of the excess cost of what we were going to have to spend on that survey, we decided to coal stack that rig so the fact of not having operating expenses for the second half of the quarter, plus saving the survey cost lowered our contract drilling expenses somewhat. Also, our continuing efforts to control cost continue to pay off in bring us in at the low end of our guidance. 
Larry talked about bad debt expense. That was a negative $8.5 million as a line item. I won't talk any more about that. Depreciation came in slightly below our expectations at $101 million. We had guided to $103 million to $106 million per quarter for this year. Based on the information we have available now, we're expecting future quarters to come in at between $101 million to $104 million per quarter. Q2 will be a little bit toward the high end of that guidance simply based on the number of days. We have one more day in Q2 than we did in Q1. 
G&A was $18 million, within our guidance of $17 million to $18 million. And we expect that to continue on a go forward basis also. 
Now looking at our tax expense line where we had the biggest variance for the guidance we gave in our last conference call, we had an effective tax rate of approximately 16% for the quarter. Contributing to this low rate was a reduction to deferred income tax expense related to undistributed earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. Due to the tax law change enacted late December of 2010, and in light of our new rigs being constructed, the company determined during the quarter that it would be more tax efficient to redeploy earnings of the foreign subs into new rig reconstruction rather than repatriating the earnings to the U.S. This resulted in an approximately $15 million one time reduction to our current quarter's tax expense. 
Disregarding this reduction to deferred tax, the annual effective tax rate would have been approximately 21%. Our original guidance last quarter was for a tax rate of between 24% and 26%. This reduction this quarter is due primarily to differences in the mix of our domestic and international pretax earnings, as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions, which we operate or expect to operate throughout 2011. Based on the current information now available, we're revising our estimate for our tax rate on a go forward basis to be somewhere between 21% and 25% for all 3 of the quarters remaining in 2011. 
Looking forward to 2011 for the rest of our items, a big one, contract drilling expense. We gave out normal operating costs by rig type and rig location last quarter and those numbers remain consistent. If you calculate those numbers, you need to also add an additional $21 million worth of amortized mobe expense. Our per-day cost do not -- does not include amortized mobes because that number can vary from quarter to quarter. 
So if you take the normal operating costs plus the $21 million amortized mobe, we expect to see contract drilling expense of somewhere between $360 million and $375 million in this coming quarter. As Larry pointed out, Q2 will be a very low quarter as far as rigs going into the shipyard for either some type of equipment modification repair or their five year surveys. As per our rig status report that we released yesterday or this morning, we only have 21 days expected in Q2. Q3, we will be up to 366 down days for rigs in the shipyard surveys, and that will include 7 rigs. And at that point, we will incur additional cost for those rigs going into the shipyard. So Q2 will be, as I've said before, somewhere between $360 million to $375 million. We expect to see those costs to go up in Q3. 
Again, G&A, $17 million to $18 million for the rest of the year. The effective tax rate, as I said, 21% to 24%. And finally, our CapEx guidance that we gave last quarter which was $320 million worth of CapEx, that is in addition to the down payments we made on the new builds that we did during the first quarter of slightly over $300 million. That guidance remains in place and we will continue to expect to see that for 2011. 
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry"

As I addressed the events that occurred a year ago, I said the number one thing is the making sure that we got procedures and personnel in place that can continually apply prudent drilling operations to deliver safe and environmentally non risky results. And so that does come down to people, we've recently given very large raises, we've established retention policies for critical skills. So to some degree, there will be people coming off of older rigs. The biggest thing, though, is we've got to attract new personnel into the industry and provide training and retention opportunities for that. I think we're in a world right now where jobs are in high demand. These are very high paying jobs. But we need to plan down the road. It's not something that we just run an ad in the paper and then the skill set up appears. And so I believe that us, and the various other drilling contractors, are engaged in efforts to increase training and to source personnel from around the world. And that's one of the things that just frustrates me so much about the slowdown, the moratorium, the lack of permits, the lack of clarity in the Gulf of Mexico, is that if I don't have any rigs in the Gulf of Mexico where I can train these people, I'm not going to hire untrained Americans and put them on an airplane and fly them to some other location. That just does not make any sense. So I would look in the absence of something stepping up that we will begin sourcing a number of our personnel from overseas. And so you're going to be taking these high paid American jobs and seeding them overseas. And as best I can tell, that definitely is not having any impact. No one's really recognizing that in the government. And when we and others go down that path, it's going to be very difficult to reverse it. So that was my soapbox today."

I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going",1093,"Thank you very much. I want to comment this morning on several areas, and then Gary Krenek, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow as we typically do at the beginning of the year with some detailed cost guidance and downtime guidance as we see it going forward. 
The results for the quarter, I think, reflect a couple of positives. Clearly, everybodyâ€™s focused in on our tax rate decline due to some provisions which were included in the right at the end of the year tax agreement that was hammered out between the administration and Congress. And this favorably impacted the way Diamond Offshore was taxed, and so we had a catch-up adjustment to our tax rate to lower the effective tax rate that had been in place for the first three quarters of the year. But in addition to that, I think our revenues, we were pleased with where they were. 
We had less rigs, actually, on the high seas moving from location to location. And although you can do your best to negotiate a mobilization, either day rate or fixed rates, the FASB requires us to suspend recognition of any of that revenue and defer it into the future, so we go to zero. So I mean, theoretically, if we had huge chunks of our fleet mobilizing, then we would be reporting nothing. But anyway, that wasn't taking place during the quarter, and then we were pleased with -- we've had several initiatives in place to lower the minimal downtime due to equipment failures. And there's always some risk of that in the business, but we're pleased with the progress we've been making on that, month after month. And I think that showed up, to a slight degree, in the results for the quarter. 
And at the same time, our costs, where they needed to be, we devote efforts certainly in all markets to cost control. But as we had positioned rigs into new markets over time, we were able to get on top of some of that. 
Secondly, talk about our construction program. We announced the commitment of our second option with Hyundai for the construction of a 12,000-foot drillship, and indicated that this vessel and the previous vessel would be named Ocean BlackHawk and Ocean BlackHornet. Our thought process in both the option and the original commitment was based upon clear, high product prices that we see out there and our expectations that they would continue due to demand growth. And despite all the efforts out there, slow supply growth, augmented then by the low construction costs that we began seeing towards the end of last year, and we're ready and have been doing the work so that we could go forward and make a selection. 
The one thing that we're missing right now is to have ready contracts as when we bought what became the Courage and the Valor. Those were great purchases because we knew the market was such that probably that they have existing contracts but that we could bid for alternative contracts. So although we don't have the contracts, we've got high product prices and low construction cost. And as 70s star Meat Loaf would sing, ""Two out of three ain't bad."" So we think that's great. 
And the other comment I would make is we were pleased with acquisitions such as the Courage and Valor, but our assessment of the market out there was there were too many players and too few equipment that would come to market here in the short term and so that new construction was the appropriate place for us to continue to try to seek high returns by controlling the amount of capital that we spend out there. Third area I'd like to talk about for a moment is Egypt. 
Diamond Offshore has three rigs in Egypt: The Ocean Endeavor, a large-scale 10,000-foot semi that's drilling in the Mediterranean. We have two jackups, the Ocean Spur in the Mediterranean, and the Ocean Heritage in the Gulf of Suez. Combined, those vessels produce day rates just a little bit under $350,000 a day. That's under 5% of the total day rates that we're earning presently, so it's a small piece. 
First item was to make sure that our people were secure. And we have successfully, up to this point in time, evacuated. Administrative people and dependents are either all out of the country or there may be one or two that are still in the Cairo Airport, but we're comfortable that we've secured that. Other than that, we still have operations folks there, and we're continuing to work as directed. Some of the rigs may not have active activity going on at the moment, but other rigs are continuing to make hole. We're dealing with crude change issues. It's obviously challenging for everybody, but we're continuing on. 
We do have, as in all contracts, force majeure provisions in there. We do not -- none of those have been exercised to date, but our biggest rig, the Ocean Endeavor has a provision in there that upon force majeure, we would continue on day rate for 30 days before cancellation could go forward. But at present, as I said, we're continuing to work those particular issues. 
And then finally, let me close out on the dividends. Dividends have been an important part of our method of returning value to shareholders. We've got a long history, going back, have paid out significant sums of money to shareholders. And that continues to be something that we value highly. As you know, we do not give forward guidance, and we set most of the dividend in the form of a special dividend that we say will be readdressed and reassessed by the board at each particular step. 
However, I would note that we have already made payments of $300 million for the down payments on the two vessels. We do not have payments due again until they're delivered in 2013. And we made the board assess the dividend for this quarter in light of knowing that we had those commitments and chose to continue our payment. 
We had $1 billion of cash as we went into the quarter. We've since drawn down $300 million of that, but we are not in a position at the moment where the construction program is something that we have to do at the cost of the dividends through this particular quarter. 
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Gary Krenek to give you some more cost guidance."
338612,117868641,120243,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2011",2011-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through the operating results. Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year",1027,"Thanks, Larry. As Larry said, he went through the operating results. Most of our cost for the fourth quarter came in within our guidance, except for tax rate, which he explained. One thing that I would like before going into talking about this coming year is to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter conference call of last year, we guided our rig operating expense cost to -- we said it would be approximately $1.5 billion for 2010. And actual year-to-date numbers for 2010 came in at $1.4 billion. 
Favorable variance was a result of two things. First of all, we had four rigs, three floaters and one jackup that we made a marketing decision to cold-stack during 2010. And so those costs during the year were reduced to very small amounts while they were cold-stacked, which brought the cost down.
 The second thing, as Larry talked about, when we mobe [mobilize] rigs, not only do we defer revenue, as he said, but we also quit recognizing expense. And we defer those expenses that we incur while those rigs are mobe-ing and amortize those costs over the length of the working part of the contract, in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. So we had, because of the moratorium, Ocean Endeavor, unexpectedly left the Gulf of Mexico during the year, and we reduced our costs. 
So the cost bring -- taking that into account, brought our costs down somewhat. These are all things that we have made known during our conference calls and our rig status reports. So if you made that adjustment to our original guidance, we were pretty much spot-on with the guidance we gave for our contract drilling cost in 2010. Looking forward to 2011, we again expect contract drilling costs to be around $1.5 billion. It's going to increase over 2010 this past year for a couple of reasons. First of all, we'll have a full year's operating cost on the Courage and the Valor, the two new rigs that we acquired and put to work during the year and incurred only a portion of our year's cost in this past year. 
Second, the amortization of those mobe costs that we had during 2010 when we suspended recognizing costs was not only for the Confidence and Endeavor but we also mobe-ed the America, the Baroness and the Scepter out of the Gulf of Mexico that we had anticipated. So all five of those add to amortized cost in 2011. And finally, the fact that those five rigs are working in international areas which are a higher cost area than the Gulf of Mexico, all totaled, should bring our costs up to about $1.5 billion. 
As is our custom, annually, we give everyone our expected cost for each of our rigs by class and location in the fourth quarter conference call, so that it can aid you in estimating our future rig operating costs. To save time, rather than me give those costs here, weâ€™ve listed them in our rig status report that we filed last night. Iâ€™ll refer you to that document, so that you can see that. Again, to be perfectly clear, these costs represent contract drilling expenses only and we exclude reimbursable costs. 
If you take those operating costs by day that we've listed, in addition to those costs, what we will incur is approximately $100 million of amortized mobe costs. Those costs are going to be broken down to approximately $20 million in Q1. We go up to $40 million in Q2 and back down to $20 million again in Q3 and Q4. That's due to just how some contracts roll over and expire and weâ€™ve changed the way we amortize these things due to some accounting rules. We will also incur some $70 million to $80 million worth of survey costs during the year. 
That's going to be broken down between four jackups: The Nugget, Heritage, Summit and Sovereign, which will incur about $3 million to $5 million each; the Saratoga and the Princess, $5 million to $7 million each; the Clipper and America, when they're in the shipyard during their surveys, will incur $9 million to $12 million each; and finally, the Whittington and the Epoch, $12 million to $15 million each. Again, these are costs in excess of the normal daily operating costs that we've listed on our rig status report. 
In order to get the associated down days and other down days with these rigs and also to be able to tell which quarter we expect at this time those surveys to occur, please look at that rig status report that we filed last night. 
Looking at just the first quarter, some guidance there, if you take the net normal operating cost and the other guidance I just gave you, we expect rig operating expense to come in at about $370 million to $380 million in Q1 in this coming year. Looking at some of the other line items, we believe G&A will be consistent year-over-year, $17 million to $18 million per quarter during 2011. Depreciation expense will increase slightly, primarily due to the Courage and the Valor being out there the full year, plus other CapEx that we've spent in the past couple of years. $103 million to $106 million is what we're estimating per quarter right now. 
Interest expense should be flat at $22 million per quarter or thereabouts. We're expecting our effective tax rate taking into account the extenders bill and also the geographic locations of where we're earning our moneys, believe the rate will go down to 24% to 26%. And also, I'd like to remind people now, the extenders bill is in effect for all of 2011 but as of now, that bill is set to expire on December 31 of 2011. 
And finally, capital expenditures. We're looking at maintenance capital of approximately $320 million for the coming year. And as Larry said, we've spent slightly over $300 million on the down payment on the two new builds which will go into CapEx for 2011. 
And unless Larry has any other comments, we'll turn it over for questions. Okay? Thank you."

I believe that the vibe coming out of the regulators is that for certain of the operations that were in progress at the date of the Macondo incident, they would not have to apply for a new environmental permit. And so gathering around those particular rigs and operations, that would be everybody's thinking, that those would be the first rigs to go back to work.

We're pleased with our results to date a $1.92, after that includes in it a $10 million write-off related to a deferred mobilization on the Ocean Monarch that was resolved with our customer at the point in time that we signed",1228,"Thank you, and good morning. We're pleased with our results to date a $1.92, after that includes in it a $10 million write-off related to a deferred mobilization on the Ocean Monarch that was resolved with our customer at the point in time that we signed the commitments on 2 of our new. So that was a $10 million write-off, about $24.05 of earnings is included in that number.
The positives for the quarter that we would focus on was we had almost all-time low amount of downtime within our fleet. There were  only 24 days everyone were one rig in the shipyard's in Brazil work will business so we base impact of.
And all likelihood, our schedule shows that there will be multiple rigs in Q3 down from planned maintenance. And on the other side, the thing that we do work to control, we had a near record low unanticipated equipment downtime of only 65 days here in this quarter. It was down from 72 in the quarter before, which I'm also pleased with. So we got a nice trend going in that direction, and that obviously is something that we can control and generate more the revenue and more to the bottom line.
Our costs were up sequentially quarter-over-quarter, I'm pleased with our efforts and where we're spending money. We did start at the beginning of the quarter an offshore rig, which is reflected in there. And we've also put in place a retention program for selected employees on selected rigs, the one that were under the most demand, the highest skilled rigs covering the newer rigs.
And so those costs are in there. We would expect those to come forward back, but again, we're pleased with that. 
The other big thing is the amount of backlog that we were able to add, and all of that sort of came together in almost a 10-day period. So we were really excited about that. But the disclosures on the press release cover $1 billion. There were minor other minor ordinary course of business adjustments that really put a number at $1.1 billion of additional backlog. We're burning. In the quarter, we burned right under $900 million of revenue, which in effect, is backlog being burned off. So we were able to certainly replace that, and that ignores the $1.8 billion of backlog that we added to the 2 new, and I'll come to that.
But in the details of the rigs that we added additional timeline, I think most significantly, was down in brazil with our customer, Petrobras, one or new builds, the Ocean Valor and initially signed a contract at 3 years with Petrobras at $450,000 a day. We had included at that point in time our revision that would allow them to extend that to 5 years in return for a $10,000 perspective decrease in the dayrate, and they elected to exercise that at Ocean Valor. We had a similar provision in the fleet generation, Ocean Baroness rig, which we located down there, we extended that for an additional 2 years for a similar rate reduction.
And I think that's significant and I think it points out the demand that Petrobras has in the near term. And of course ,these extensions really don't kick in for 2 years or so. So it covers some years that '13, '14, so it's not just near term, but in the medium-term, they've got lots of discoveries down there. They need these type of large rigs to develop those, so that's a net positive.
At the same time, we had an opportunity to take the Ocean Yorktown, an intermediate rig, and put it into a bid in Mexico. We really didn't have another rig in the immediate area that could fulfill that job. And because it would be Petrobras' mutual benefit to relay them some near-term commitments, they elected, we negotiated to free up the Ocean Yorktown and move up the Ocean Yorktown fine to another mid water rig, the Ocean Concord.
Also, in Brazil, our big customer, OGX, put when your extensions in their larger rigs  the Ocean Star and the Ocean Quest. So significant development in our biggest market. We continue to have 16 rigs operating in that market and with all kind of backlog. So we're pleased with that.
Also, in Mexico, we are seeing a movement off of, frankly, some low-level activity that we've seen for the past year or two. And we have 3, in addition to the Ocean Yorktown arriving, we've got 3 jack-up jobs there, a slight extension on one of the existing rigs, a longer-term extension in the Ocean Summit. And in then the Ocean Titan, which have been working in the Gulf of Mexico, and which frankly down to the permitting issues, we were able to get a 777-day job there at a little over $100,000 a day. That will have to do some modifications to the Ocean Titan to get it qualified to go down in Mexico the summit that have been there for some period of time.
But we think that will pay out very quickly.
Then on our fleet status report that we released, we also indicated smaller extensions, which didn't include on the press release, the Ocean Nomad, extended in the North Sea, put that rig to work through the winter. And the Ocean Valiant continued to tackle on time in West Africa. West Africa is certainly an exciting market for there. One of the big event of the horizon is the our Ocean Confidence cobalt for highly anticipated well down there. So we will be, obviously, getting any updates on what's happening there. But we're there participating, and we think there's a  lot of upside in West Africa.
To go back to what's probably old news but happened earlier in the quarter, where we took both of our first 2 drillships that we had ordered and signed a combined 10 years was over 5 years per vessel at rights that generated $1.8 billion of backlog, and I think everybody can do the math. So those are our nice rates. And that excludes, we don't know where the rates were are going and all likelihood that a population will be also rolled into the dayrate contractually and certainly, from the count standpoint that rig will work. 
And the final thing I would point would be a continuation of our dividend policy. As indicated in the press release, we renewed our special dividend at the same rate that's been established now, I believe, 4 quarters, combined with our regular dividend. The 2 dividends combined, looking back to 2006 and paid out just a hair under $29 a value to shareholders. And again, continues to reflect our belief that dividends are important component of returning value to shareholders. And I always tell investors that we need, that you can't just look at our share price compared to competition and how that may perform and also, that you need to keep in mind, depending on how long you held it, at least some portion, and hopefully, our long term shareholders are the portion of that dividend just under $29 of value that you perceive.
So that concludes my own the remarks. And I will now turn it over to Gary Krenek to go through more details of our financials."
338612,134739305,143808,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks. Gary. For the second quarter, the most of the line items on the income statement came within expectations of what we expected, what we had talked about in our previous conference call. The one line item Larry alluded to that was slightly bal",1000,"Okay. Thanks. Gary. For the second quarter, the most of the line items on the income statement came within expectations of what we expected, what we had talked about in our previous conference call. The one line item Larry alluded to that was slightly bald was our contract drilling expense. We guided to between $360 million to $375 million is what we said the last conference call, and we came in at $388 million.
Larry said the biggest component of that overrun was the $10 million worth of deferred mode and preparation cost on the Monarch that we took a noncash charge for in the second quarter because of early termination of the contract on that rig.
I remind everybody that when we do move the rigs, we differ any costs occurring when that happens and amortize it over the length of the contract. So that was $10 million charge. We also had some weakening of the U.S. dollar, slight weakening for some of our own hit positions and foreign denominator expenditures. That cost us somewhere between $5 million and $7 million on expected, and then slightly higher some of the increase that Larry talked about. So if you think all those into account and adjust our actual numbers, we actually come right in the middle of the guidance that we put out last quarter.
Other than that, pretty much where we had expected. Looking forward to next quarter and the rest of 2011, I think the biggest thing is, again, Larry talked about, it is the downtime on our rigs that we expect in the third and the fourth quarters. Again, start to report that we released this morning to get the details of that. But just briefly, we have 4 rigs that will be undergoing a 5-year survey in the third quarter. We have 3 rigs in the fourth quarter undergoing surveys. We have 3 rigs in Yorktown, Monarch and that will be moving from one major area of location to another in the third and fourth quarters. They were at downtime. And finally, the Ocean Clipper will be down for a few days in the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter for some contractual upgrades that we have agreed to do with Petrobras 1.5 years, 2 years ago, when we extended the contract. We had been waiting for delivery of equipment and also for convenient time for both us and Petrobras gas service, and that kind of coming up. And if everything goes according to plan, and we start we're supposed to the end of the third, will be back on contract by January 1, 2012.
So this downtime for our rigs, we had very good downtime in the first half of the year. Just so happens that most of it is going to be back-end loaded in the second half of the year. The costs of some on both the mobile revenue line and will also affect our expense lines.
Looking at contract drilling expense for the third quarter. Again, we'll incur our normal daily operating costs that we were told everyone earlier in the year. To that, we do need to add some $22 million worth of amortized loan costs that we refer in the quarter. The go for survey cost each of those rigs would be somewhere between $4 million and $8 million, each 2 jack-ups and 2 semi-submersibles. The U.S. dollar, we're expecting to remain consistent. So we had another $6 million, to $8 million or were not normal cost of that.
And finally, our major expense cost for our major projects will increase somewhere in the $7 million to $10 million range in Q3, and then following also in Q4. And as we said before, this is normal. When we do our budgets in the fall of any given year, it takes the first quarter and part of the second quarter for us to write our ASP, quarter over equipment late on delivery. All of that stuff comes in, and we actually spend the money and record it in the second half of the year.
So if we had up those daily regular daily costs and the additional items that I gave you, that should come up to a third quarter contract drilling expense of somewhere between $395 million to $410 million.
Again, I caution everybody that the contract drilling expense only that does not include reimbursable costs. We do not budget for reimbursable costs. If you look at that, the reimbursable costs are virtually offset, dollar for dollar, with reimbursable revenues. And the revenue guidance that we give on our rig status report excludes any type of reimbursable revenues.
So when you're looking at on a project our earnings in the future, you really need to net those 2 line out, which we do.
For the rest of the income statement line items, the guidance remains virtually the same as it had in the last quarter. G&A, we expect continue to EBITDA at $70 million to $80 million per quarter. Depreciation, $101 million to $104 million per quarter, will be slightly up in the third quarter simply because of 92 days the next quarter versus 91 days in Q2.
Expense remains at about $22 million per quarter. Our effective tax rate at 21% to 24%, which is the same as we had guided previously. And finally, maintenance capital remains at $320 million for this year.
Additionally, we had some $475 million of down payments we made already in the first half of the year on the 3 new build ships that we did. Just for accounting purposes, that $475 million is not considered capital expenditures this year, but rather are is recorded in the balance sheet at a loan term deposit on our new builds. That will be flipped around when we actually take delivery of the rigs and will come out in the deposit account into our fixed assets.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

But seeing some of them together but the general theme there of people looking forward and having to grab capacity. Mexico's got issues with the decline of production, everybody knows about. They've been going through a couple of years of bid processes, where they've not been getting the equipment that they need. So I would say there's that common theme, we're down in Brazil where huge, not decline, but huge anticipated upswings in available prospects to be developed. And it means that Petrobras needs to secure continued rigs to go down there, and this was, I think, a pretty good indication of that. And with Petrobras, they're looking by extending existing 2-year contract that we're not in the one year into in the case of new build valor. Then that shows some planning moreso than I think we were seeing now in Mexico. And then OGX, at the same time, as think it's more the same.

Among the catalysts is probably what you're saying, the sense from the operators that there's not going to be enough rigs to cover their needs certainly until some of the new builds arrive, and maybe not even then. Because a lot of the deepwater activity continues to generate demand from more rigs. You've got catalyst in Mexico's begins to take another primary in the jack-up stage. But still, that could contribute second rigs out of there. If Brazil moves, and then the Gulf of Mexico, if the permitting situation returns, that would be huge. The point I make again and again, which is not really relevant on this call, but that we, in this country, we get 9% unemployment and this industry has the ability to employ lots of people here in the United States without subsidy and paying among the highest blue-collar wages that are out there in the world.

We're pleased with our results today of $1.92. Well, half of that includes in it a $10 million write-off related to a deferred mobilization on the Ocean Monarch that was resolved with our customer at the point in time that we",1282,"Thank you, and good morning. We're pleased with our results today of $1.92. Well, half of that includes in it a $10 million write-off related to a deferred mobilization on the Ocean Monarch that was resolved with our customer at the point in time that we signed the commitments on 2 of our new drillships. So that was a $10 million write-off. About $24.05 of earnings is included in that number.
The positives for the quarter that we would focus on was we had almost all-time low amount of downtime within our fleet. There were only 24 days covering one rig where we had a rig in the shipyard. It's where the Ocean Yatzy in Brazil doing some plastering work. We assume the ordinary course of business with the multiple rigs with minimal days impact.
In all likelihood, our schedule shows that there will be multiple rigs in Q3, down for repair and maintenance. And on the other side, the thing that we do work to control, we had a near-record low unanticipated equipment downtime of only 65 days here in this quarter. It was down from 72 in the quarter before, which I'm also pleased with. So we got a nice trend going in that direction, and that obviously is something that we can control and generate more the revenue and have more to drop to the bottom line.
Our costs were up sequentially quarter-over-quarter. I'm pleased with our efforts and where we're spending money. We did start at the beginning of the quarter an offshore rig raise, which is reflected in there. And we've also put in place a retention program for selected employees on selected rigs. The one that were under the most demand, the highest skilled rigs covering the newer rigs.
And so those costs are in there. We would expect those to come forward back, but again, we're pleased with that. 
The other big thing is the amount of backlog that we were able to add, and all of that sort of came together in almost a 10-day period. So we were really excited about that. But the disclosures on the press release cover $1 billion. There were some other minor ordinary course of business adjustments that really put the number of $1.1 billion of additional backlog. We're burning. And in the quarter, we burned right under $900 million of revenue, which in effect, is backlog being burned off. So we were able to certainly replace that, and that ignores the $1.8 billion of backlog that added to the 2 new drillships, and I'll come to that.
But in the details of the rigs that we added additional time on, I think most significantly, it was down in Brazil with our customer, Petrobras, one or new builds, the Ocean Valor and initially signed the contract at 3 years with Petrobras at $450,000 a day. We had included at that point in time our revision that would allow them to extend that to 5 years in return for a $10,000 perspective decrease in the dayrate, and they elected to exercise that, covering the Ocean Valor. We had a similar provision in the fleet generation, Ocean Baroness rig, which we located down there, we'd extended that for an additional 2 years for a similar rate reduction.
And I think that's significant, and I think it points out the demand that Petrobras has in the near term. And of course, these extensions really don't kick in for 2 years or so. So it covers some years that '13, '14. So it's an obvious near team, but in an immediate term, they've got lots of discoveries down there. They need these type of large rigs to develop those, so that's a net positive.
At the same time, we had an opportunity to take the Ocean Yorktown, an intermediate rig, and put it into a bid in Mexico. We really didn't have another rig in the immediate area that could fulfill that job. And because it would be Petrobras' mutual benefit to relay them some near-term commitments, they elected, we negotiated to free up the Ocean Yorktown and move the Ocean Yorktown time to another mid-water rig, the Ocean Concord.
Also, in Brazil, our good customer, OGX, put when your extensions on their larger rigs, the Ocean Star and the Ocean Quest. So significant development in our biggest market. We continue to have 16 rigs operating in that market and with all kind of backlog. So we're pleased with that.
Also, in Mexico, we are seeing a movement off of, frankly, some low-level activity that we've seen for the past year or 2. And we have 3, in addition to the Ocean Yorktown arriving, we've got 3 jack-up jobs there. A slight extension on one of the existing rigs, a longer-term extension in the Ocean Summit. And then the Ocean Titan, which have been working in the Gulf of Mexico, and which frankly down to the permitting issues, we were able to get a 777-day job there at a little over $100,000 a day. That will have to do some modifications to the Ocean Titan to get it qualified to go down in Mexico, that the Summit will not going to have been there for some period of time. But we think that will pay out very quickly.
Then on our fleet status report that we released, we also indicated smaller extensions, which we didn't include on the press release. The Ocean Nomad, extended in the North Sea, puts that rig to work through the winter. And the Ocean Valiant continued to tackle on time in West Africa. West Africa is certainly an exciting market for there. One of the big events on the horizon is that our Ocean Confidence in moving on location for Cobalt for a highly anticipated well down there. So we will be, obviously, getting any updates on what's happening there. But we're there participating and we certainly think there's a lot of upside in West Africa.
To go back to what's probably old news, what happened earlier in the quarter where we took both of our first 2 drillships that we had ordered and signed a combined 10 years, worth of work 5 years per vessel at rights that generated $1.8 billion of backlog, and I think everybody can do the math. So those are our nice rates. And that excludes mobilization. We don't know where the rigs were -- are going and all likelihood that mobilization will be also rolled into the dayrate contractually, and certainly from accounting standpoint, that's the way that our rig will work. 
And the final thing I would point out would be the continuation of our dividend policy. As indicated in the press release, we renewed our special dividend at the same rate it's been established now. I believe, for 4 quarters, combined with our regular dividend. The 2 dividends combined, looking back to 2006 have paid out just a hair under $29 value to shareholders. And again, continues to reflect our belief that dividends are an important component of returning value to shareholders. And I always tell investors that we need -- that you can't just look at our share price compared with the competition and how that may perform but also that you need to keep in mind, depending on how long you've held it. So at least some portion, and hopefully, for long-term shareholders, all of the portion of that dividend just under $29 of value that you perceive.
So that concludes my opening remarks. And I will now turn it over to Gary Krenek to go through a little bit more on the details of our financials."
338612,134739305,144047,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Larry. For the second quarter, the most of the line items on the income statement came within expectations of what we expected, what we had talked about in our previous conference call. The one line item Larry already alluded to that was sli",1041,"Okay. Thanks, Larry. For the second quarter, the most of the line items on the income statement came within expectations of what we expected, what we had talked about in our previous conference call. The one line item Larry already alluded to that was slightly bold was our contract drilling expense. We guided to between $360 million to $375 million, it's what we said in the last conference call, and we came in at $388 million.
As Larry said, the biggest component of that overrun was the $10 million worth of deferred mobe and preparation cost on the Monarch that we took in a noncash charge for in the second quarter because of early termination of the contract on that rig.
I remind everybody that when we do -- when we mobe rigs, we differ any costs occurring when that happens and amortize it over the length of the contract. So was the $10 million charge. We also had some weakening of the U.S. dollar, slight weakening for some of our own hedged positions and foreign denominated expenditures. That costs us somewhere between $5 million and $7 million on expected, and then slightly higher because some of the labor increased, as Larry talked about. So if you take all of those into account and adjust our actual numbers, we actually come right in the middle of the guidance that we had put out last quarter.
Other than that, it's -- everything came in pretty much what we had expected. Looking forward to next quarter and the rest of 2011, I think the biggest thing is, again, Larry talked about, it is the downtime on our rigs that we expect in the third and the fourth quarters. Again, you can look at our rigs status report that we released this morning to get the details of that. But just briefly, we have 4 rigs that will be undergoing a 5-year survey in the third quarter. We have 3 rigs in the fourth quarter undergoing surveys. We have 3 rigs, the Yorktown, Monarch and Titan that will be mobing from one major area of location to another some third and fourth quarters. They will have downtime. And finally, the Ocean Clipper will be down for a few days in the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter for some contractual upgrades that we have agreed to do with Petrobras, 1.5 years, 2 years ago, when we extended the Clipper contract. We had been waiting for delivery of equipment and also for convenient time for both us and Petrobras that will take that we've got it serviced, and that time is now coming up. If everything goes according to plan and we start and we're supposed to at the end of the third quarter, we will be back on contract by January 1, 2012.
So this downtime for our rigs, we had very good downtime in the first half of the year. It just so happened that most of it is going to be back-end loaded in the second half of the year. The costs of some on both the revenue line and will also affect our expense lines.
Looking at contract drilling expense for the third quarter. Again, we'll incur our daily normal -- normal daily operating costs that we were told everyone earlier in the year. To that, we need to add some $22 million worth of amortized mobe costs that we will forward in the quarter. For 4 survey costs, each of those rigs will be somewhere between $4 million and $8 million each. We have 2 jack-ups and 2 semi-submersibles. The U.S. dollar, we're expecting to remain consistent. So we can add another $6 million to $8 million to our normal cost of that.
And finally, on major expense cost, for our major projects. It will increase somewhere in the $7 million to $10 million range in Q3, and then following also in Q4. And as we've said before, this is normal. When we do our budgets in the fall of any given year, it takes the first quarter and part of the second quarter for us to write our AFP, order our equipment, right on delivery. All of that stuff comes in, and we actually spend the money and record it in the second half of the year.
So if you add up those daily -- regular daily costs and the additional items that I gave you, that should come up to a third quarter contract drilling expense of somewhere between $395 million to $410 million.
Again, I caution everybody that the contract drilling expense only. That does not include reimbursable costs. We do not budget for reimbursable costs. If you look at that, the reimbursable costs are virtually offset, dollars-for-dollar, with reimbursable revenues. And the revenue guidance that we give on our rig status report excludes any type of reimbursable revenues.
So when you're looking at on a project -- our earnings in the future, you really need to net those 2 lines out, which we do.
For the rest of the income statement line items, the guidance remains virtually the same as it had in the last quarter. G&A, we expect it to continue to be at $17 million to $18 million per quarter. Depreciation, $101 million to $104 million per quarter. It will be slightly up in the third quarter simply because there's 92 days the next quarter versus 91 days in Q2.
Interest expense remains at about $22 million per quarter. Our effective tax rate at 21% to 24%, which is the same as we had guided up previously. And finally, maintenance capital remains at $320 million for this year.
Additionally, we had some $475 million of down payments we've made already in the first half of the year, on the 3 new build drillships that we did. Just for accounting purposes, that $475 million is not considered capital expenditures this year, but rather are -- is recorded in the balance sheet as a long-term deposit on our new builds. That will be flipped around when we actually take delivery of the rigs and will come out of the deposit account into our fixed assets.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

Either offsetting that tax increase, has got to be the positive spread on grant over WTI, where we get interest and people that talk about wanting to drill.

Beyond that, it really gets into production and dates that they have leases and things that aren't always clear to us, and they change a little bit. Permitting in the Gulf of Mexico, I think, has picked up. We've seen more permits being issued. They're primarily seen to be issued toward the deeper end of the spectrum rather than the mid-water. But the mid-water fleet has shown reduced now. Then you've got, really our Ocean Saratoga, which are coming up to a survey. And you got our Ocean Victory, which will service that. And that's it. Everything else is a deepwater market. So it's not taking place in a world where there's still the same number of rigs that you can measure things.

Mexico's got issues with decline of production, everybody knows about that. They've been going through a couple of years of bid processes, where they've not been getting the equipment that they need.

And it means that Petrobras needs to secure continued rigs to go down there, and this was, I think, a pretty good indication of that. And with Petrobras, they're looking by extending existing 2-year contracts that we're not even one year into, in the case of new build Valor. That really -- that shows some advanced planning more so than I think we were seeing now in Mexico. And then OGX, at the same time, as I think it's more the same.

So I think in general, the theme is that though the story happened here in Brazil and Mexico, there's still everyone, still positioning themselves, and we're seeing an increase there."

Among the catalysts is probably what you're saying, the sense from the operators that there's not going to be enough rigs to cover their needs certainly until some of the new builds arrive, and maybe not even then. Because a lot of the deepwater activity continues to generate demand from more rigs. You've got catalyst and Mexico's begins to take I know they're primarily in the jack-up stage. But still, that could contribute second rigs out of there. If Brazil moves, and then the Gulf of Mexico, if the permitting situation returns, that would be huge. The point I make again and again, which is not really relevant on this call, but that we, in this country, we got 9% unemployment and this industry has the ability to employ lots of people here in the United States without subsidy and paying among the highest blue-collar wages that are out there in the world. Our average rate in the Gulf of Mexico back when we had a number of rigs working out there is above $80,000 a day for a job where you have 6 months old. So maybe somebody will finally decide that, that's some positive step that they can take. So lots of positive catalyst that could come about."

We're pleased with our results today of $1.92.

We're pleased with our results today of $1.92. Point out that, that includes in it a $10 million write-off related to a deferred mobilization on the Ocean Monarch that was resolved with our customer at the point in time that we signed the commitments on 2 of our new drillships. So that was a $10 million write-off. About between $0.04 and $0.05 of earnings is included in that number.
The positives for the quarter that we would focus on was we had almost all-time low amounts of downtime within our fleet. There were only 24 days covering one rig where we had a rig in the shipyard. It's with the Ocean Yatzy in Brazil doing some thruster work, whereas in the ordinary course of business there will be multiple rigs with many more days.
In fact, in all likelihood, our schedule shows that there will be multiple rigs in Q3 down for planned maintenance. And on the other side, the thing that we do work to control, we had a near-record low unanticipated equipment downtime of only 65 days here in this quarter. It was down from 72 in the quarter before, which I'm also pleased with. So we got a nice trend going in that direction, and that obviously is something that we can control and generate more the revenue and have more of it drop to the bottom line. 
Although costs were up sequentially quarter-over-quarter, I'm pleased with our efforts and where we're spending money. We did start at the beginning of the quarter an offshore rig raise, which is reflected in there. And we've also put in place a retention program for selected employees on selected rigs, the ones that are under the most demand, the highly skilled rigs covering the newer rigs.
And so those costs are in there. We would expect those to come forward back [ph], but again, we're pleased with that. 
The other big thing is the amount of backlog that we were able to add, and all of that sort of came together in almost a 10-day period. So we were really excited about that. But the disclosures on the press release cover $1 billion. There were some other minor ordinary course of business adjustments that really put the number of $1.1 billion of additional backlog. We're burning. And in the quarter, we burned right under $900 million of revenue, which in effect, is backlog being burned off. So we were able to certainly replace that, and that ignores the $1.8 billion of backlog that we added through the 2 new drillships, and I'll come to that.
But in the details of the rigs that we added additional time on, I think most significantly, it was down in Brazil with our customer, Petrobras, one of our new builds, the Ocean Valor had initially signed the contract at 3 years with Petrobras at $450,000 a day. We had included at that point in time our provision that would allow them to extend that to 5 years in return for a $10,000 prospective decrease in the day rate, and they elected to exercise that, covering the Ocean Valor. We had a similar provision in the fifth generation, Ocean Baroness rig, which we located down there, where they extended that for an additional 2 years for a similar rate reduction.
And I think that's significant, and I think it points out the demand that Petrobras has in the near term. And of course, these extensions really don't kick in for 2 years or so. So it covers some years that -- '13, '14. So it's not just near team, but intermediate term. They've got lots of discoveries down there. They need these type of large rigs to develop those, so that's a net positive.
At the same time, we had an opportunity to take the Ocean Yorktown, an intermediate rig, and put it into a bid in Mexico. We really didn't have another rig in the immediate area that could fulfill that job. And because it would be to Petrobras' mutual benefit to relieve them of some near-term commitments, they elected, we negotiated to free up the Ocean Yorktown and move the Ocean Yorktown time to another mid-water rig, the Ocean Concord.
Also, in Brazil, our good customer, OGX, put one-year extensions on their larger rigs, the Ocean Star and the Ocean Quest. So significant developments in our biggest market. We continue to have 16 rigs operating in that market and with all kind of backlog. So we're pleased with that.
Also, in Mexico, we are seeing a movement off of, frankly, some low-level activity that we've seen for the past year or 2. And we have 3, in addition to the Ocean Yorktown arriving, we've got 3 jack-up jobs there. A slight extension on one of the existing rigs, a longer-term extension on the Ocean Summit. And then the Ocean Titan, which has been working in the Gulf of Mexico, and was frankly down due to permitting issues, we were able to get a 777-day job there at a little over $100,000 a day. Now weâ€™ll have to do some modifications to the Ocean Titan to get it qualified to go down in Mexico. The Summit is now going to have been there for some period of time. But we think that will pay out very quickly.
Then on our fleet status report that we released, we also indicated smaller extensions, which we didn't include on the press release. The Ocean Nomad, extended in the North Sea, puts that rig to work through the winter. And the Ocean Valiant continued to tack on time in West Africa. West Africa is certainly an exciting market for there. One of the big events on the horizon is that our Ocean Confidence in moving on location for Cobalt for a highly anticipated well down there. So we will be, obviously, giving any updates on what's happening there. But we're there participating, and we certainly think there's a lot of upside in West Africa.
To go back to what's probably old news, what happened earlier in the quarter where we took both of our first 2 drillships that we had ordered and signed a combined 10 years worth of work, 5 years per vessel at rate that generated $1.8 billion of backlog, and I think everybody can do the math, can see that those are nice rates. And that excludes mobilization. We don't know where the rigs were -- are going. In all likelihood that mobilization will be also rolled into the dayrate contractually, and certainly from an accounting standpoint, that's the way that our rig would work. 
And the final thing I would point out would be the continuation of our dividend policy. As indicated in the press release, we renewed our special dividend at the same rate that's been established now, I believe, for 4 quarters, combined with our regular dividend. The 2 dividends combined, looking back to 2006 have paid out just a hair under $29 in value to shareholders and, again, continues to reflect our belief that dividends are an important component of returning value to shareholders. And I always tell investors that we meet that you can't just look at our share price compared with the competition and how that may perform but also that you need to keep in mind, depending on how long you've held it. So at least some portion, and hopefully, for long-term shareholders, all of the portion of that dividend just under $29 of value that you receive.
So that concludes my opening remarks. And I will now turn it over to Gary Krenek to go through a little bit more of the details of our financials."
338612,134739305,144151,"Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 21, 2011",2011-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Larry. For the second quarter, the most of the line items on the income statement came within expectations of what we expected, what we had talked about in our previous conference call. The one line item Larry already alluded to that was sli",1044,"Okay. Thanks, Larry. For the second quarter, the most of the line items on the income statement came within expectations of what we expected, what we had talked about in our previous conference call. The one line item Larry already alluded to that was slightly above was our contract drilling expense. We had guided to between $360 million to $375 million, is what we said in the last conference call, and we came in at $388 million.
As Larry said, the biggest component of that overrun was the $10 million worth of deferred mobe and preparation cost on the Monarch that we took in a noncash charge for in the second quarter because of early termination of the contract on that rig.
I remind everybody that when we do -- when we mobe rigs, we defer any costs occurring when that happens and amortize it over the length of the contract. So that was a $10 million charge. We also had some weakening of the U.S. dollar, slight weakening for some of our unhedged positions and foreign denominated expenditures. That cost us somewhere between $5 million and $7 million on expected, and then slightly higher because some of the labor increased, as Larry talked about. So if you take all of those into account and adjust our actual numbers, we actually come right in the middle of the guidance that we had put out last quarter.
Other than that, thatâ€™s it. Everything came in pretty much what we had expected. Looking forward to next quarter and the rest of 2011, I think the biggest thing is, again, Larry talked about it, is the downtime on our rigs that we expect in the third and the fourth quarters. Again, you can look at our rigs status report that we released this morning to get the details of that. But just briefly, we have 4 rigs that will be undergoing a 5-year survey in the third quarter. We have 3 rigs in the fourth quarter undergoing surveys. We have 3 rigs, the Yorktown, Monarch and Titan that will be mobing from one major area of location to another during the third and fourth quarters. They will have downtime. And finally, the Ocean Clipper will be down for a few days in the third quarter and the entire fourth quarter for some contractual upgrades that we had agreed to do with Petrobras, 1.5 years, 2 years ago, when we extended the Clipper contract. We had been waiting for delivery of equipment and also for a convenient time for both us and Petrobras that will take that rig out of service, and that time is now coming up. If everything goes according to plan and we start when we're supposed to at the end of the third quarter, we will be back on contract by January 1, 2012.
So this downtime for our rigs, we had very good downtime in the first half of the year. It just so happened that most of it is going to be back-end loaded in the second half of the year with costs to some on both the revenue line and will also affect our expense lines.
Looking at contract drilling expense for the third quarter. Again, we'll incur our daily normal -- normal daily operating costs that we foretold everyone earlier in the year. To that, you need to add some $22 million worth of amortized mobe costs that weâ€™ll record  in the quarter. The 4 survey costs, each of those rigs will be somewhere between $4 million and $8 million each. We have 2 jack-ups and 2 semi-submersibles. The U.S. dollar we're expecting to remain consistent. So you need to add another $6 million to $8 million to our normal cost to that.
And finally, our major expense cost for our major projects. It will increase somewhere in the $7 million to $10 million range in Q3, and then following it also in Q4. And as we've said before, this is normal. When we do our budgets in the fall of any given year, it takes the first quarter and part of the second quarter for us to write our AFEs, order our equipment, wait on delivery. All of that stuff comes in, and we actually spend the money and record it in the second half of the year.
So if you add up those daily -- regular daily costs and the additional items that I gave you, that should come up to a third quarter contract drilling expense of somewhere between $395 million to $410 million.
Again, I caution everybody thatâ€™s the contract drilling expense only. That does not include reimbursable costs. We do not budget for reimbursable costs. If you look at that, the reimbursable costs are virtually offset, dollar-for-dollar, with reimbursable revenues. And the revenue guidance that we give on our rig status report excludes any type of reimbursable revenues.
So when you're looking at -- trying to project our earnings in the future, you really need to net those 2 lines out, which we do.
For the rest of the income statement line items, the guidance remains virtually the same as it had in the last quarter. G&A, we expect it to continue to be at $17 million to $18 million per quarter. Depreciation, $101 million to $104 million per quarter. It will be slightly up in the third quarter simply because there's 92 days the next quarter versus 91 days in Q2.
Interest expense remains at about $22 million per quarter. Our effective tax rate at 21% to 24%, which is the same as we had guided up previously. And finally, maintenance capital remains at $320 million for this year.
Additionally, we had some $475 million of down payments we'd made already in the first half of the year on the 3 new build drillships that we did. Just for accounting purposes, that $475 million is not considered capital expenditures this year, but rather are -- is recorded in the balance sheet as a long-term deposit on our new builds. That will be flipped around when we actually take delivery of the rigs and will come out of the deposit account into our fixed assets.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

Offsetting that tax increase has got to be the positive spread on grant over WTI, where we get interest and people that talk about wanting to drill, they don't really always share all their thoughts and processes. But I think our sense is that the oil price balances out those taxes in some instances. Beyond that, it really gets into production and dates that they had leases and things that aren't always clear to us, and they change a little bit. Permitting in the Gulf of Mexico, I think, has picked up. We've seen more permits being issued. They primarily seem to be issued toward the deeper end of the spectrum rather than the mid-water. But the mid-water fleet is so reduced now. I mean you've got, really, our Ocean Saratoga, which are coming up to a survey. And you got our Ocean Victory, which will service that. And that's it. Everything else is a deepwater market. So it's not taking place in a world where there's still the same number of rigs so that you can measure things. Certainly, I think when we talk to customers in those markets, they seem to be very optimistic that things are picking up. I don't know.

But it seemed to sort of come together but there was a general theme there of people looking forward and having to grab capacity. Mexico's got issues with declining production, everybody knows about that. They've been going through a couple of years of bid processes, where they've not been getting the equipment that they need. So I would say there's that common theme with down in Brazil where huge, not decline, but huge anticipated upswings in available prospects to be developed. And it means that Petrobras needs to secure continued rigs to go down there, and this was, I think, a pretty good indication of that. And with Petrobras, they're looking by extending existing 2-year contracts that we're not even one year into, in the case of new build Valor. That really -- that shows some advanced planning more so than I think we were seeing down in Mexico. And then OGX, at the same time, I think it's more of the same. OGX is a little bit looking -- dealing with stuff a little bit closer to what's going on just because of the size of their company versus Petrobras. But so I think all those common themes come together. But we didn't finish it saying, ""Oh, boy, wait for the next 20 days."""

But I mean, there's a natural trend in the business that rigs return to work for a little bit more term that leads to opportunities to raise rates. And then, as you say, then there's a catalyst that will some time occur and make things really explode. Among the catalyst is probably what you're saying, the sense from the operators that there's not going to be enough rigs to cover their needs certainly until some of the new builds arrive, and maybe not even then because a lot of the deepwater activity continues to generate demand from more rigs. You've got catalyst and Mexico's begins to take, and I know they're primarily in the jack-up stage. But still, that could contribute, sucking rigs out of there. If Brazil moves, and then the Gulf of Mexico, if the permitting situation returns, that would be huge. The point I make again and again, which is not really relevant on this call, but that we, in this country, weâ€™ve got 9% unemployment and this industry has the ability to employ lots of people here in the United States without subsidy and paying among the highest blue-collar wages that are out there in the world. Our average rate in the Gulf of Mexico back when we had a number of rigs working out there is above $80,000 a day for a job where you have 6 months off. So maybe somebody will finally decide that, that's some positive step that they can take. So lots of positive catalysts that could come about."

Welcome also to our third quarter conference call. I'd like to talk just a little bit about the contracts that we signed in the quarter.

I'd like to talk just a little bit about the contracts that we signed in the quarter. They have been disclosed all along as we report our contract back up every 2 weeks, but it's appropriate than to look back upon them. And I think we summarize them in the press release that we added 14 new contracts with 18 rig years and $1.3 billion of revenue backlog. And I think most, really, if we look at them by market, I think Mexico is significant for us. We signed 4 contracts in this period, running up here to just a few days into October.
The Summit, which is already been down there, achieved a 2.7 year extension at a nice rate. Then we brought 2 rigs out of Brazil, the Yorktown and the Scepter, Yorktown will be going down there and a semi for 2.5 years rate in 180s. And then the Scepter, a newly constructed Jackup, which had been working in Brazil. We had some permit issues down there. And so we arranged to be released. We'll come out here and work this end up to the market, hopefully, get everything straight now down in Brazil.
And then these 2 rigs were also joined by the Ocean Titan, a 350-foot unit that have been working in the Gulf of Mexico, which obtained 2.1 years of backlog. So Mexico has been building for some time with bidding contracts out, but actual activity has been down, but ongoing depletion of their fields and the needs to get some work done had continued to push them in this direction. And so it's been very visual for diamond and I believe some our competitors, as well, but a number of and that's an important market.
In the North Sea, we signed our 2 floaters that we have in there, the Ocean Nomad and the Ocean Princess, to contracts that take us through the winter. The Nomad is working for BG and the Ocean Princess signed a 600-day approximate contract with Inquest, which will start shortly. Then in Brazil, most of our backlog came from extensions to existing contracts, Petrobras took the Ocean Valor and Ocean Baroness contracts, which had been 3-year contracts, and they had an option to extend them to 5 years, and it took advantage of that. So that added quite a bit of backlog. And then also, our other good customer down there, OGX, put one-year extensions in each of the quest and star.
So those 4 markets or 3 markets, Brazil, North Sea and Mexico, have been very strong for us. That really releases our Gulf of Mexico fleet now to just 3 active rights, 2 floaters and 1 Jackup. We have one floater that down just coming out of the shipyards 2 rigs working today.
The permit situation is certainly improving. And we see some optimism out there in some of the big contracts that have been signed. However, on the coal phase, when we deal with customers on the day-to-day basis, we still deal with many people that don't know the permit situation that are waiting on permits. It's not at a smooth flow situation, which we really need to encourage ongoing work to stop. So hopefully, we'll continue that progress in there. But at the end of the day, we just don't have left in that market. The Ocean Victory is a rig that we have that's 5,000 capable rig that's drilling in the 3,000-foot level. And really, there's very, very few rigs left there in that category.
I think we're talking, we've done our Ocean Saratoga there as well. And I believe has one unit. And then other than that, most of the rigs there are either jack-ups or Ultra deep water units.
So we see some opportunities there because there's just lack of competition to work that market, but still impacted by the permits. And net-net, at the end of the day, our U.S. payroll has declined from pre-macondo talk today by some 600 positions for us alone. I'm sure that has knocked on, another has knocked on among our suppliers and whatnot and the same thing is true for many of our competitors.
And that's just unfortunate. However, our rigs are located overseas and continue to have nice jobs to work on.
So moving forward, we are comfortable that we've been doing a very good job of managing cost, revenue efficiency in terms of the amount of unplanned downtime or Clement breaks ticked up this quarter from this absolute record results in the previous 3 quarters that we're still well below what we would normally budget to happen. We've had some surveys start this quarter, and we'll acquire a few more in Q4, which Gary will go into in some greater detail as he give some guidance on that. But that's my general opening statement. And I'll certainly return, and we've got the marketing guys return to some of your questions in greater detail. But Gary, why don't you go ahead and take the, your portion."

For the quarter just ended, we made net income of $256 million, or EPS of $1.85 on revenues of $862 million. That compares to last quarter, where we made $1.92 of earnings on revenues of $870 million. So we had a slight decline from Q2 to Q",879,"Thanks, Larry. For the quarter just ended, we made net income of $256 million, or EPS of $1.85 on revenues of $862 million. That compares to last quarter, where we made $1.92 of earnings on revenues of $870 million. So we had a slight decline from Q2 to Q3, only slight despite the fact that our planned rig, excuse me, rig downtime increased from 24 days in Q2 to 304 days in Q3. But we're very pleased with the results that came in for Q3.
Going into some of the results, individual line items in Q3, looking at the expenses, big one contract drilling expense. We guided in our last conference call to between $395 million, $410 million and actuals came in at $391 million. Our beat was even a little bit better than that, considering the fact that we expensed the York Times mold that Larry talked about from Brazil back to the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter, cost us about $9.5 million that we had not anticipated. So if you take that into consideration, we were down about $15 million below our expectations.
A couple of reasons for that. One, our survey costs on the 4 rigs that we had in the shipyard in Q3 came out better than expected. And then, as Larry said, just continued cost controls out there in the fleet. Q2, we are normal operating costs. We're actually a little bit higher than what we expected. Again, we're happy to report Q3, that came back down and came in lower than what we expected. 
Another line item that had a difference was interest expense. We expected approximately $22 million worth of interest expense and recorded $16 million. The difference there is capitalized interest. We did not believe that we would capitalize interest on our new build drillships in 2011. That would begin the first part of next year. However, there were some milestones reached in the shipyard, which caused us to begin capitalizing that interest a little bit earlier than what we expected. I would tell everybody that the final date of delivery of those rigs still remains the same for the first 2 rigs, which is mid '13 and end of '13, but it did change a little bit an accounting of what's going out there in the shipyard.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, for the first 9 months of 2011, we had 495 days of planned downtime for surveys and shipyard work and mold, et cetera. As you can see, by looking at our rig status report that we've released earlier this morning, we're anticipating 550 days in Q4. So we're going from 495 the first 9 months to 550. Just a result of the timing of surveys, et cetera, we have 5 yards,  5 rigs in the shipyard for survey in the fourth quarter and another 4 rigs, I believe, will be moving, preparing for contracts or undergoing acceptance testing. So those days do go up dramatically, and this will affect both our revenue and cost lines in Q4.
Down to some of the specifics. For the fourth quarter, Contract Drilling expenses, again, as always, we released our normal daily operating costs earlier in the year. You need to start with that as your base number. In addition to those costs, the 5 rigs in the shipyard undergoing surveys will incur costs between $4 million and $10 million each, and this will add another $22 million to $28 million to our costs.
We have amortized mold costs, those up slightly in Q4 to $27 million. We also will expense the Scepter that Larry talked about will be coming from Brazil back to the Gulf of Mexico to undergo some contract prep work. We will expense that mode with $8 million to $10 million additional cost in Q4.
And then, finally, our major expense projects historically are higher the second half of the year, particularly Q4, as we wrap up this year's projects. And so we're expecting to see an increase of $5 million to $10 million in that, for that reason.
Also, from when we originally did our daily costs, labor costs have gone up slightly here as the years gone on, and that'll add another $4 million to $6 million. Anyway, you add all of those things up, we believe contract drilling expenses for Q4 will come in the $410 million to $420 million range.
And again, I caution everybody to remember, that's for Contract Drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs will be in addition to this amount. And, of course, the reimbursable costs always offset almost dollar-by-dollar by reimbursable revenues.
Just a few other housekeeping notes. G&A, we believe, will continue to be $17 million to $18 million per quarter. Depreciation expense guidance stay the same as before, $101 million to $104 million for Q4. Interest expense, we should capitalize about $7 million in Q4, which will give us a net interest expense of $15 million.
And our tax rate, we believe, will stay consistent from prior guidance and be in the 21% to 24% range. And finally, maintenance capital also remains the same, the guidance remain the same at the $300 million for the year 2011.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

I'd like to talk just a little bit about the contracts that we've signed in the quarter. They have been disclosed all along as we report our contract backlog every 2 weeks, but it's appropriate time to look back upon them. And I think we summarized them in the press release that we added 14 new contracts with 18 rig years and $1.3 billion of revenue backlog. And I think those, really, if we look at them by market, I think Mexico is significant for us. We signed 4 contracts in this period, running up here to just a few days into October.
The Summit, which is already been down there achieved a 2.7 year extension at a nice rate. And then we brought 2 rigs out of Brazil, the Yorktown and the Scepter. Yorktown will be going down there. Yorktown's a semi for 2.5 years rate in the 180s. And then the Scepter, a newly constructed jack-up, which had been working in Brazil. We had some permit issues down there, and so we arranged to be released. We'll come up here and work this end of the market, hopefully, while they get everything straightened out down in Brazil.
And then these 2 rigs were also joined by the Ocean Titan, a 350-foot unit that they have been working in the Gulf of Mexico, which obtained 2.1 years of backlog. So Mexico has been building for some time with bidding contracts out, but actual activity has been down. But the ongoing depletion of their fields and the needs to get some work done have continued to push them in this direction. And so it's been very beneficial for Diamond and I believe some our competitors as well have put a number and expect that, that's an important market.
In the North Sea, we signed our 2 floaters that we have in there, the Ocean Nomad and the Ocean Princess, to contracts that take us through the winter. The Nomad is working for BG, and the Ocean Princess signed a 600-day approximate contract with Enquest which will start shortly. Then in Brazil, most of our backlog came from extensions to existing contracts, Petrobras took the Ocean Valor and Ocean Baroness contracts, which had been 3-year contracts and they had an option to extend them to 5 years and they took advantage of that. So that added quite a bit of backlog. And then also our other good customer down there, OGX, put one year extensions in each of the Quest and Star.
So those 4 markets or 3 markets, Brazil, North Sea and Mexico, have been very strong for us. That really releases our Gulf of Mexico fleet now to just 3 active rigs, 2 floaters and 1 jack-up. We have one floater that's down just coming out of the shipyards, so we only have 2 rigs working today.
The permit situation is certainly improving, and we see some optimism out there in some of the big contracts that have been signed. However, on the coal phase, when we deal with customers on a day-to-day basis, we still deal with many people that don't know the permit situation that are waiting on permits. It's not at a smooth flow situation, which we really need to encourage ongoing work. It sort of started to stop. So hopefully, we'll continue to make progress in there. But at the end of the day, we just don't have that many rigs left in that market. The Ocean Victory is a rig that we have that's a 5,000-foot capable rig that's drilling in the 3,000-foot level. And really there's very, very few rigs left there in that category.
I think we're talking. We've done our Ocean Saratoga there as well, and I believe Noble has one unit. And then other than that, most of the rigs there are either jack-ups or ultra-deepwater units.
So we see some opportunities there because there's just lack of competition to work that market, but still impacted by the permits. And net-net, at the end of the day, our U.S. payroll has declined from pre-Macondo till today by some 600 positions for us alone. I'm sure that has knocked on -- another has knocked on among our suppliers and whatnot, and the same thing is true for many of our competitors.
And that's just unfortunate. However, our rigs have relocated overseas and continue to have nice jobs to work on.
So moving forward, we are comfortable that we've been doing a very good job of managing cost, revenue efficiency in terms of the amount of unplanned downtime or equivalent breaks ticked up this quarter from just absolute record results in the previous 2 quarters, but we're still well below what we would normally budget to happen. We've had some surveys start this quarter and we'll acquire a few more in Q4, which Gary will go into -- in some greater detail as he give some guidance on that. But that's my general opening statement. And I'll certainly return, and we've got the marketing guys return to some of your questions in greater detail. But Gary, why don't you go ahead and take the -- your portion."

For the quarter just ended, we made net income of $256 million or EPS of $1.85 on revenues of $862 million. That compares to last quarter, where we made $1.92 of earnings on revenues of $870 million. So we had a slight decline in the",893,"Okay. Thanks, Larry. For the quarter just ended, we made net income of $256 million or EPS of $1.85 on revenues of $862 million. That compares to last quarter, where we made $1.92 of earnings on revenues of $870 million. So we had a slight decline in the third -- from Q2 to Q3, only slight despite the fact that our planned rig, excuse me, rig downtime increased from 24 days in Q2 to 304 days in Q3. But we're very pleased with the results that came in for Q3.
Going into some of the results in individual line items in Q3. Looking at the expenses and the big one contract drilling expense, we guided in our last conference call to between $395 million to $410 million and actuals came in at $391 million. Our beat was even a little bit better than that, considering the fact that we expensed the Yorktown's mobe that Larry talked about from Brazil back to the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter, cost us about $9.5 million that we had not anticipated. So if you take that into consideration, we were down about $15 million below our expectations.
A couple of reasons for that. One, our survey costs on the 4 rigs that we had in the shipyard in Q3 came out better than expected. And then, as Larry said, just continued cost controls out there in the fleet. Q2, we are normal operating costs. We're actually a little bit higher than what we expected. Again, we're happy to report Q3, that came back down and came in lower than what we expected. 
Another line item that had a difference was interest expense. We expected approximately $22 million worth of interest expense and recorded $16 million. The difference there is capitalized interest. We did not believe that we would capitalize interest on our newbuild drillships in 2011. That would begin the first part of next year. However, there were some milestones reached in the shipyard, which caused us to begin capitalizing net interest a little bit earlier than what we expected. I would tell everybody that the final date of delivery of those rigs still remains the same for the first 2 rigs, which is mid '13 and end of '13, but it did change a little bit an accounting of what's going out there in the shipyard.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, for the first 9 months of 2011, we had 495 days of planned downtime for surveys and shipyard work and mobe, et cetera. As you can see, by looking at our rig status report that we've released early this morning, we're anticipating 550 days in Q4. So we're going from 495 the first 9 months to 550. Just a result of the timing of surveys, et cetera, we have 5 yards -- 5 rigs in the shipyard for survey in the fourth quarter and another 4 rigs that we'll either be mobing, preparing for contracts or undergoing acceptance testing. So those days do go up dramatically, and this will affect both our revenue and cost lines in Q4.
Down to some of the specifics. For the fourth quarter contract drilling expenses, again, as always, we release our normal daily operating costs earlier in the year. You need to start with that as your base number. In addition to those costs, the 5 rigs in the shipyard undergoing surveys will incur costs between $4 million and $10 million each, and this will add another $22 million to $28 million to our costs.
We have amortized mobe costs, goes up slightly in Q4 to $27 million. We also will expense the Scepter that Larry talked about. We'll be coming from Brazil back to the Gulf of Mexico to undergo some contract prep work. We will expense that mobe, which will be $8 million to $10 million additional cost in Q4.
And then finally, our major expense projects historically are higher the second half of the year, particularly Q4, as we wrap up this year's projects. And so we're expecting to see an increase of $5 million to $10 million in that -- for that reason.
Also, from when we originally did our daily cost, labor costs have gone up slightly here as the years gone on, and that'll add another $4 million to $6 million. Then when you add all of those things up, we believe contract drilling expenses for Q4 will come in the $410 million to $420 million range.
And again, I caution everybody to remember that's for contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs will be in addition to this amount. And of course, the reimbursable costs always offset almost dollar for dollar by reimbursable revenues.
Just a few other housekeeping notes. G&A, we believe will continue to be $17 million to $18 million per quarter. Depreciation expense guidance stays the same as before, $101 million to $104 million for Q4. Interest expense, we should capitalize about $7 million in Q4, which will give us a net interest expense of $15 million.
And our tax rate, we believe, will stay consistent from prior guidance and be in the 21% to 24% range. And finally, maintenance capital also remains the same, the guidance remain the same at the $300 million for the year 2011.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

Now I don't see many of those things lined up today. And I see a lot of well-capitalized people that would buy rigs. We certainly saw Transocean expose quite a bit of money, when Aker was recently sold. So I don't know that, that has appeal to us. The new construction market has had attractive prices.

I'd like to talk just a little bit about the contracts that we've signed in the quarter. They have been disclosed all along as we report our contract backlog every 2 weeks, but it's",889,"Thank you, Darren, and welcome also to our third quarter conference call. I'd like to talk just a little bit about the contracts that we've signed in the quarter. They have been disclosed all along as we report our contract backlog every 2 weeks, but it's an appropriate time to look back upon them. And I think we summarized them in the press release,  that we added 14 new contracts with 18 rig years and $1.3 billion of revenue backlog. And I think those -- really, if we look at them by market, I think Mexico is significant for us. We signed 4 contracts in this period, running up here to just a few days into October.
The Summit, which had already been down there, achieved a 2.7 year extension at a nice rate. And then we brought 2 rigs out of Brazil, the Yorktown and the Scepter. Yorktown will be going down there. Yorktown's a semi for 2.5 years, rate in the 180s. And then the Scepter, a newly constructed jack-up which had been working in Brazil. We had some permit issues down there, and so we arranged to be released. We'll come up here and work this end of the market, hopefully, while they get everything straightened out down in Brazil. And then these 2 rigs were also joined by the Ocean Titan, a 350-foot unit that had been working in the Gulf of Mexico, which obtained 2.1 years of backlog.
So Mexico has been building for some time with bidding contracts out, and -- but actual activity has been down. But the ongoing depletion of their fields and the needs to get some work done have continued to push them in this direction. And so it's been very beneficial for Diamond and I believe some our competitors as well have put a number of expected work, and that's an important market.
In the North Sea, we signed our 2 floaters that we have in there, the Ocean Nomad and the Ocean Princess, to contracts that take us through the winter. The Nomad is working for BG, and the Ocean Princess signed a 600-day approximate contract with Enquest which will start shortly. Then in Brazil, most of our backlog came from extensions to existing contracts. Petrobras took the Ocean Valor and the Ocean Baroness contracts, which had been 3-year contracts and they had an option to extend them to 5 years, and they took advantage of that. So that added quite a bit of backlog. And then also our other good customer down there, OGX, put one year extensions on each of the Quest and Star.
So those 4 markets -- or 3 markets, Brazil, North Sea and Mexico, have been very strong for us. That really reduces our Gulf of Mexico fleet now to just 3 active rigs: 2 floaters and 1 jack-up. We have 1 floater that's down just coming out of the shipyards, so we only have 2 rigs working today.
The permit situation is certainly improving, and we see some optimism out there in some of the big contracts that have been signed. However, on the coal face, when we deal with customers on a day-to-day basis, we still deal with many people that don't know the permit situation that are waiting on permits. It's not at a smooth flow situation, which we really need to encourage ongoing work. It's sort of start and stop. So hopefully, we'll continue to make progress in there.
But at the end of the day, we just don't have that many rigs left in that market. The Ocean Victory is a rig that we have that's a 5,000-foot capable rig that's drilling in the 3,000-foot level. And really there's very, very few rigs left there in that category. I think we're talking -- we've done our Ocean Saratoga there as well, and I believe Noble has one unit. And then other than that, most of the rigs there are either jack-ups or they're ultra-deepwater units.
So we see some opportunities there because there's just lack of competition to work that market, but it's still impacted by the permits. And net-net, at the end of the day, our U.S. payroll has declined from pre-Macondo until today by some 600 positions for us alone. I'm sure that has knock on -- I know that has knock on among our suppliers and whatnot, and the same thing is true for many of our competitors. And that's just unfortunate. However, our rigs have relocated overseas and continue to have nice jobs to work on.
So moving forward, we are comfortable that we've been doing a very good job of managing cost, revenue efficiency in terms of the amount of unplanned downtime or equipment breaks ticked up this quarter from just absolute record results in the previous 2 quarters, but it was still well below what we would normally budget to happen. We've had some surveys start this quarter and we have quite a few more in Q4, which Gary will go into in some greater detail as he gives some guidance on that.
But that's my general opening statement. And I'll certainly return, and we've got the marketing guys return to some of your questions in greater detail. But Gary, why don't you go ahead and take the -- your portion."

For the quarter just ended, we made net income of $256 million or EPS of $1.85 on revenues of $862 million. That compares to last quarter, where we made $1.92 of earnings on revenues of $870 million. So we had a slight decline in the",905,"Okay. Thanks, Larry. For the quarter just ended, we made net income of $256 million or EPS of $1.85 on revenues of $862 million. That compares to last quarter, where we made $1.92 of earnings on revenues of $870 million. So we had a slight decline in the third -- from Q2 to Q3, only slight despite the fact that our planned rig, excuse me, rig downtime increased from 24 days in Q2 to 304 days in Q3. So we're very pleased with the results that came in for Q3.
Going into some of the results in individual line items in Q3. Looking at the expenses, the big one contract drilling expense, we guided in our last conference call to between $395 million to $410 million and actuals came in at $391 million. Our beat was even a little bit better than that, considering the fact that we expensed the Yorktown's mobe that Larry talked about from Brazil back to the Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter, cost us about $9.5 million that we had not anticipated. So if you take that into consideration, we were down about $15 million below our expectations.
A couple of reasons for that. One, our survey costs on the 4 rigs that we had in the shipyard in Q3 came out better than expected. And then, as Larry said, just continued cost controls out there in the fleet. Q2, we are normal operating costs. We're actually a little bit higher than what we expected. Again, we're happy to report Q3, that came back down and came in lower than what we expected. 
Another line item that had a difference was interest expense. We had expected approximately $22 million worth of interest expense and recorded $16 million. The difference there is capitalized interest. We did not believe that we would capitalize interest on our newbuild drillships in 2011, that, that would begin in the first part of next year. However, there were some milestones reached in the shipyard which caused us to begin capitalizing net interest a little bit earlier than what we expected. I would tell everybody that the final date of delivery of those rigs still remains the same for the first 2 rigs, which is mid '13 and end of '13, but it did change a little bit of the accounting of what's going out there in the shipyard.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, for the first 9 months of 2011, we had 495 days of planned downtime for surveys and shipyard work and mobe, et cetera. As you can see by looking at our rig status report that we've released early this morning, we're anticipating 550 days in Q4. So we're going from 495 the first 9 months to 550, just a result of the timing of surveys, et cetera. We have 5 yards -- 5 rigs in the shipyard for survey in the fourth quarter and another 4 rigs that will either be mobing, preparing for contracts or undergoing acceptance testing. So those days do go up dramatically, and this will affect both our revenue and cost lines in Q4.
Getting down to some of the specifics. For the fourth quarter, contract drilling expenses -- again, as always, we release our normal daily operating costs earlier in the year. You need to start with that as your base number. In addition to those costs, we will -- the 5 rigs in the shipyard undergoing surveys will incur costs between $4 million and $10 million each, and this will add another $22 million to $28 million to our costs.
We have amortized mobe costs, goes up slightly in Q4 to $27 million. We also will expense the Scepter that Larry talked about. We'll be coming from Brazil back to the Gulf of Mexico to undergo some contract prep work. We will expense that mobe, which will be $8 million to $10 million additional cost in Q4.
And then finally, our major expense projects historically are higher the second half of the year, particularly Q4, as we wrap up this year's projects. And so we're expecting to see an increase of $5 million to $10 million in that -- for that reason.
Also, from when we originally did our daily cost, labor costs have gone up slightly here as the year has gone on, and that'll add another $4 million to $6 million. Then when you add all of those things up, we believe contract drilling expenses for Q4 will come in, in the $410 million to $420 million range.
And again, I caution everybody to remember that's for contract drilling expenses only. Reimbursable costs will be in addition to this amount. And of course, the reimbursable costs are always offset almost dollar for dollar by reimbursable revenues.
Just a few other housekeeping notes. G&A, we believe, will continue to be $17 million to $18 million per quarter. Depreciation expense guidance stays the same as before, $101 million to $104 million for Q4. Interest expense, we should capitalize about $7 million in Q4, which will give us a net interest expense of $15 million.
And our tax rate, we believe, will stay consistent from prior guidance and be in the 21% to 24% range. And finally, maintenance capital also remains the same -- the guidance remains the same at the $300 million for the year 2011.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Larry."

So I don't see many of those things lined up today. And I see a lot of well-capitalized people that would buy rigs. We certainly saw Transocean expose quite a bit of money when Aker was recently sold. So I don't know that, that has appeal to us. The new construction market has had attractive prices, and so we moved on that and have 3.
