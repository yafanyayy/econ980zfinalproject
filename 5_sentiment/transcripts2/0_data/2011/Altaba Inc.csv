We just completed a very encouraging quarter and year for Yahoo! We made substantial strides to improve profitability. In Q10, we doubled our operating income, doubled our operating margin, doubled EPS and doubled return on invested capital. We did this while investing aggressively in our major products and the technology to drive our strategy to turn Yahoo! around. And in the process, create value for our shareholders.
The central focus of our plan is simple: Increase profitability and grow revenue. To increase profitability, we have to be focused and efficient. To grow revenue, we have to deliver engaging products for users and advertisers. And to achieve our profitability and revenue goals, we have to execute across the board. What we've done during the past two years is all directed at these key drivers of success. We've made major strides, reinventing our technology platforms so we can innovate and introduce new products and features more quickly than ever before. We've reorganized the company to improve its efficiency and to operate costs effectively. We brought in some terrific new senior talents. The key to all of this is to deliver great content. That content takes a lot of forms, news, sports, finance, e-mail, Search, Entertainment and of course relevant ads. It's worth more than 630 million people come to us for every month and it's what we're best at. It's our place in the online ecosystem, it's who we are. We focus on the aggregation, curation and creation of content and we do it really, really well. Our direction and innovations are built around our vision of personalized content for each and every user.
Already, these investments are starting to pay off. our U.S. today module click through rate is up 36% year-over-year and we now serve 13 million variations everyday. And engagement among early adopters of our new Mail Beta is more than 50% higher than our legacy Mail products. Our plan is that these new products and technologies will ensure a bright and sustainable future for Yahoo! as a premier digital media company. Now let's turn to 2010 for more detail.
As I noted earlier, we made substantial progress on profitability in 2010 and the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, our Q4 operating margin ex-TAC were some 13% last year to 21% this year. And our operating income increased to $258 million, up from $159 million. That's about consensus and above the midpoint of our outlook. Revenue ex-TAC also came in ahead of both outlook and consensus, it was down versus Q4 '09, just as we told you it would be due to the beginning of the Rebbe share with Microsoft and because of the various businesses we exited that do not fit with our content focus. In fact, without these items, our revenue ex-TAC would have been up 2% and GAAP revenue would have been up 3% for the quarter. Remember, as we discussed last quarter, this is all part of our plan to turn Yahoo! around. We've been working hard to make the company more efficient, expand margins and increase profitability.
But revenue's a bit different. it's tied to our products and innovation and while it takes longer for the full impact to kick in, our strong performance in display is a positive indicator of the topline growth we expect to see in the future, displayed with a bright spot for us this past year and quarter. Q4 grew 16%. 27% sequentially and 2010 grew 17% over 2009 all in ex-TAC basis. In fact, we believe our growth in Display significantly outpaced the market according to numbers from an interactive advertising Bureau.
As for Search, the revenue ex-TAC in Q4 was down 18% compared to last year and for the full year, decreased by 10%. Taking out Search Alliance rev share and Paid Inclusion, we were down 6% for the quarter and 2% for the year. Of course, Search is a very important area of focus for us, but whenever you make big changes as we're doing with our Search Alliance, it take sometime for the marketplace adjust. But we're confident that the alliance will be able to show positive growth in Search by the end of the year.
2011 will be the final year of major competitive revenue headwinds, including divested business lines, outsourcing and, of course, our rev share with Microsoft. So to say it in another way, 2012 will have cleaner apples-to-apples comparisons. We also believe the investments we'll making in new technologies and products for users and advertisers will add to our growth. But before I provide more color on this, I'd; like to turn it over to Tim to talk about the financials in more detail."
91800,117863421,95088,"Yahoo! Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carole. Good afternoon. Today, we'll address fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, the first quarter 2011 guidance and also provide some color regarding expectations for 2011 in total. Highlights of our fourth quarter performance include $1,2",2011,"Thanks, Carole. Good afternoon. Today, we'll address fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, the first quarter 2011 guidance and also provide some color regarding expectations for 2011 in total. Highlights of our fourth quarter performance include $1,205,000,000 ex-TAC revenue, $30 million above midpoint of guidance. 16% year-over-year growth in ex-TAC Display revenue; $220 million operating income, including a $38 million restructuring charge related to the actions we announced in December.; operating income improved 85% versus fourth quarter 2009, and 62% excluding restructuring charges from both years. In short, we were really pleased with the fourth quarter.
Before diving into more detail, however, let me take a moment to highlight some major accomplishments for full year 2010. Operating income doubled versus 2009 to $773 million. Operating margins doubled to 16.8% on an ex-TAC basis. EPS doubled even excluding onetime gains from both years. In the metric that best captures so much of our hard work, return on invested capital more than doubled, improving by nearly 2.5x to 13%.
During 2010, we also repositioned our cost structure for future growth and profitability, and it's now 22% below 2008 levels. That's a reduction of $1.1 billion.
We repurchased nearly 120 million shares at an average of 414.68 per share. And finally, we acquired four companies and divested two others as we continue to realign our product, business and technology portfolios.
We have much more to do, especially on the topline, but we're proud of these exceptional 2010 financial results.
Now let's turn back to fourth quarter. revenue in the three new reporting categories you see in our press release: Display, Search and other. As I discuss these categories, please note that we've combined O&O and Affiliate revenue within Display and Search. Beginning with Display, ex-TAC revenue exceeded expectations with 16% year-over-year growth and 27% sequential growth. Once again, Americas and Asia pack grew strong double digits and EMEA grew mid single digits. Both premium and non premium revenue improved strong double digits versus prior year primarily driven by impression growth.
As expected, Search revenue declined 18% on an ex-TAC basis versus 2009, but this included nearly $32 million of Search Alliance revenue share. Excluding revenue share in our Paid Inclusion ad product which was discontinued January 1, 2010, the comparison to prior year was down about 6%. Volume grew in the low single digits in each of our regions, but this was more than offset by anticipated softness in click yield due to our platform transition in the U.S. Rounding out the top line, other revenue, which includes these with leads, ended fourth quarter down 15% versus prior year. Back in July, we had guided that second half 2010 would be down 15% to 20% compared to 2009 so both 3Q and 4Q have been at the low end of the range.
Fees revenue for 4Q did benefit from a one-time boost of $6 million related to successfully concluded patent litigation.
Turning now to the bigger picture, back in October, I have described the cosmetic accounting change to our revenue presentation that's required as we transition our paid Search platform. Let me remind you how this works.
The traffic acquisition costs, which we call TACOM a represent a portion of our GAAP revenue that we share with third parties. The majority of our TAC has historically gone to partners that serve our Search results on their sites. While we were previously required to record TAC as part of our GAAP revenue, it was just offset in cost of revenue since it belonged to our partners and not us. In 4Q, and going forward for all transition markets, TAC is no longer recorded in either line. We are simply booking revenue on a net basis in one clean step.
Once again, however, I'd like to emphasize that this accounting change has no impact at all on operating income or EPS. In the fourth quarter, this newly required accounting lowered GAAP revenue by $173 million. Therefore, GAAP revenue on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Search Alliance impacts, would have been flat versus the prior year. If we also look through our other transitional items such as the shutdown of Paid Inclusion and the HotJobs and Zimbra divestitures, GAAP revenue would have been up roughly 3% year-over-year.
Moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter total expenses less TAC were down 14% versus prior year to $985 million. For full year 2010, ex-TAC expense was $3,816,000,000, which is a full 11% or $480 million lower than 2009. We continued to proactively reposition our cost structure to drive both top line innovation and margin expansion simultaneously.
Including the income statement discussion, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was just 8%, falling well below guidance as a result of both discrete items and operational favorability. For the year, our rate dropped to 21% from 38% in 2009. While the low 20% range is not sustainable at this time, we continue to make substantial progress in lowering our annual structural rate, which we now expect to be in the low 30% range. This has been and will continue to be a focus area for us. The team did a perfect job in 2010 and their hard work is really beginning to pay off.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended 2010 at roughly $3.6 billion despite share repurchases of nearly $1.8 billion this year. Cash flow from operating activities was $403 million for the quarter, up 15% versus prior year and $1,240,000,000 for the year, down 5%. The full year results were most significantly impacted by our transition to paying cash taxes as our NOLs are now largely utilized. In 2010, we paid roughly $120 million more in taxes than in 2009.
Capital expenditures were $247 million for the fourth quarter and $714 million for the full year. Our CapEx reflects two dynamics at year-end. First, we are able to take advantage of opportunities to accelerate 2011 spending at advantageous prices. Second, we continue to build out our newer data centers to improve our underlying cost structure.
Finally, as of December 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was roughly $10.4 billion or approximately $7.93 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Ali Baba group's privately held businesses, most notably and alley pay.
Turning to 2011. For first quarter, we expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the $1,020,000,000 to $1,080,000,000 range. This outlook reflects roughly $60 million of year-over-year headwinds comprised of $36 million in Search Alliance revenue share, plus nearly $25 million related to step downs in broadband deferred revenue amortization in certain fee rates in addition to the impact of divested business lines. This definition of revenue headwinds is consistent with our Investor Day presentation last May and notably, it excludes underlying operational dynamics.
We believe the sequential trends for two of our three revenue categories, Display and Other, are in line with expected seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, however, Display revenue growth of 5% to 10% looks less robust than recent trends as a result of a tough one-time comparison versus first quarter 2010.
Last year, we benefited from transitioning our large automotive customers from cash basis accounting to accrual accounting as they emerged from the difficulties of the recession. Excluding that prior-year adjustment, Display revenue would be growing 10% to 15% year-over-year in 1Q.
The most meaningful revenue discussion, however, centers on Search. Obviously, given the U.S. platform transition in 4Q, there's a comparability issue versus 2010. That's the $36 million I mentioned a few moments ago. However, there's also a marketplace issue that needs to be addressed.
First, for our Owned and Operated properties, despite being encouraged by the RPS trend line, we're still not where we need to be. Optimizing the combined marketplace to maximize quick yield and price per click, will continue to be a critical focus for the entire first half of this year. Secondly, our Affiliate marketplace is farther behind than O&O. That, coupled with the transition of our Korean Affiliate, Neighbor, to its own Search technology, drives our expectation that revenue ex-TAC in our Affiliate business will be down approximately $35 million year-over-year. Since that's operational in nature, it's additive to the $60 million headwind I spoke of earlier.
We are confident that the marketplace improvements for O&O, RPS and affiliates will be realized toward midyear 2011. There's no bigger focus for the alliance. On a more immediately positive note, we are already encouraged by Search volume trends and by the innovations we'll be rolling out this year. Transitioning to ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $890 million to $920 million for first quarter. The midpoint of that range is down 4% year-over-year despite a one-time expense benefit of $43 million we recognized in first quarter 2010 related to Search Alliance reimbursements for costs incurred in 2009.
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $145 million. While down compared to 2010, it's flat excluding the one-time $43 million prior year benefit I spoke about a moment ago.
Although we'll continue to provide guidance quarter-by-quarter, given our expectation of improving Search revenue in second half, it makes sense to properly set expectations for the full year.
Once again, consistent with Investor Day, the full year impact of our 2011 revenue headwinds is expected to be approximately $220 million. Most notably, we expect roughly $170 million in Search Alliance revenue share or $140 million more year-over-year as we transitioned Search in most major markets around the globe. Rounding out the $220 million, as I noted earlier, our items related to broadband amortization, fee rates and divested business lines. While the few headwinds there into 2012 as well, topline comparisons become much clearer after this year took. In fact, we expect year-over-year net revenue growth in the second half of 2011 as headwinds lessen, RPS improves and Display strength continues.
With regard to cost structure, we expect 2011 ex-TAC expense to be roughly flat year-over-year despite wage inflation, volume-related cost pressures and continued investment in our growth programs as we've proactively drive efficiencies and better align our spending to high return activities.
In terms of operating income, margin expansion will continue to be a key priority. Since we've transitioned to ex-TAC as our revenue measurement, it makes sense to similarly recast our margin goal on the basis of ex-TAC revenue. As a result, we are now targeting operating margins or operating income as a percentage of our ex-TAC revenue to expand from 17% today to 30% or greater by 2013. Capital expenditures for 2011 should fall to the $550 million to $600 million range despite aggressive investments to create a more efficient data center footprint.
Finally, our effective tax rate should be in the 30% to 35% range on a structural basis. We will, however, continue to take advantage of one-time improvements to that baseline where we can.
Before turning the call back to Carol, I'd like to offer a last word on 2010. While there are still much to do, we're executing well against our plan in a wide variety areas and we're gaining momentum. Our product team has done a terrific job defining its strategy and progressing toward our goal of personalized content for each and every user. We've buildt and ar erolling out new platforms and processes across the company to make Yahoo! faster and more flexible, innovative and efficient.
We continued to lead in Display advertising with substantial year-over-year growth that is ahead of the market. We're making significant strides on margin expansion, tax structure and capital structure. We're driving accountability throughout every organization in ensuring we have the right people doing the right things in the right locations all across the world.
Finally, we have a unified purpose. We're a premier digital media company focused on extending our competitive advantage, increasingly personalized world-class content. Carol?"

I'd now like to spend some time on several areas that are top of mind with many of you. First, let me discuss the latest on our Search Alliance. While we had a year of steady accomplishments and have a great deal more of work ahead. We successfully completed the North American paid Search transition on schedule in Q4 before the holiday shopping period and our systems remained stable. Our thousands and thousands of advertisers were able to execute their add campaigns, reach their audiences and generate conversion. Publishers, including Yahoo! and our Affiliate partners, had more bumps as they learn to operate in the new unified marketplace. As we enter 2011, the marketplace is not producing the click yield that RPS we had hoped and expected continued focus over the next two quarters to get to the financial model we established for the alliance.
Yahoo! and Microsoft continue to work very well together. We're aligned on a goal to achieve the skill benefit of the unified marketplace and we remain confident in the value of the alliance and its financial benefits. There is a lot of work ahead especially for Microsoft as they invest Relations their marketplace science team and technology.
We picked the right partner and we know they're focused and committed to our joint success. The major markets we expect algo to be transitioned by midyear and paid by the end of the year. We'll start to pay transition in Europe midyear and with Asia to follow in Q4. Algo moving on, the to talk about our leadership position in Display. Advertisers continue to come to Yahoo! due to our unique brand of science, art and scale, and that we lead the Web in Display advertising. We bring in more revenue in Display than anyone else ever growing strong.

Reaching the right person to the right ad at the right time is marketing one-to-one. We know that, of course that we also know that online, not all impressions are created equal, not all minutes are time center created equal and not all ads are created equal.
Next up, I want to address our interest in Ali Baba and Yahoo! Japan. Alibaba to some of our put a few quite simply, our approximately 40% stake has been and continues to be a great investment and we believe it has a bright future could Ali Baba .com is growing quickly as it's how bow which is not one of the biggest online commerce marketplace with an estimated 75% share of the market. With e-commerce excluding in the largest country in the world, if you our investment in Ali Baba will grow in value and will continued to greatly benefit our investors over time.
As for Yahoo! Japan, our goal is to work with our partners in Japan to unlock the value of our investment for shareholders and attack efficiently.
There's one more thing I want to talk about before I discuss our product highlights for the quarter and that's people. We've made some great new hires, attracting new exceptional talent to the leadership ranks of Yahoo!. We've got Ross Levinsohn running the Americas region, Wayne Powers runnng U.S. sales, anteroom lettuce our new CIO and make meeting are needed network just to name a few. These new people, we will come some changes as they reorganize and build out their team. Just as we made some changes in our product last month today we're making modest changes to the other organizations within Yahoo!, reducing about 1% of the job of the company.
Stim outlined for you detailed our investor day last May, these actions or landed necessary to eliminate duplication and redirect investments to our core products and strategy. And it's a redirect investments, I mean that are roadmap includes hiring additional Yahoo! to develop new product and experiences for users and advertisers this year in support of our strategy.
Now I'd like to walk you through some of the Q4 highlights. Asia continues to outperform. Display in the region grew 35% ex-TAC for 2010. Yahoo! Taiwan and Yahoo! the number one in audience with more than 94% each in all major categories including Search, Mail, News, Finance and so on.
We've also executed a turnaround with a median. The region had its largest ever Q4 with Display 6% growth next Act, the U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Spain hit an all-time high an audience reach of 49%. This is a very big improvement over what we've seen over the last few years.
Our Americas content properties continued to do well. Yahoo! Finance kept up its amazing run as number one for its category for 36 straight months with a 44% share of audience. Yahoo! Sports had spent 33 straight months at the top. And then Yahoo! News, visitors or now spending an average of 2.5 billion minutes on this site per month, up 22% from Q4 of '09. This was driven by regrade midterm election coverage and the five new blogs introduced last year that generated $108 million page views in November alone. In Search, with Microsoft powering our back in, we continued to innovate around the Search experience and for us, that means focusing on giving our users answers, not just links. We launched new features products and experiences. Now users increasingly get what they want right at the top of the results page rebuilds issues quick adds for users can add movies to the Netflix or watching it instantly, make reservations via open table, buy movie or concert tickets and more. And we have agreements with partners to generate new revenue streams beyond just adds and clicks.
On the communications front, we launched a new Yahoo! Messenger data that allows people to play and share popular games from Zynga Zynga of social status and view comment on and like updates from Yahoo! Pulse, Flickr, Facebook and Twitter.
We also launched the new Mail beta, users can e-mail, IM, text, see and update status on social networks, share photos intuitively and much more. As I mentioned before, engagement among early adopters of our new Mail beta is more than 50% higher than our legacy Mail products. The mobile really focusing on releasing apps in HTML5 browser-based experiences that reach our users no matter what device or operating system they're on. we know that people assess Yahoo! in the range of devices that's what you'll see us continue to unveil a slew of apps for IOS, and furthermore. So Mail and Messenger to finance and Flickr it has been successful pursuit of those of our apps downloaded. We've seen some big jumps in engagement for the released of these apps. isn't going for more than 40% of our Fantasy Football users access the product via mobile device during the regular football season. press release.
Popular products in mobile form including market , our new finance out for the iPad is to get the app store within next few weeks.
Our connected severe products are generating a lot of momentum and interest. it's latest got rave reviews at CBS earlier this month. Today, there are 6 million TVs that are connected to the platform. That adds up to more than 100 models from partners like Samsung, Sony, LG, Toshiba and Video. And lastly, we launched six new original branded Entertainment video programs in the quarter. These new programs carry with them a great roster of TVs and sponsors including Kellogg's, Lexus, Buick, Dodge, Toyota and Chevy. These new shows are having an impact. The latest comScore numbers show our original programming attracted 21 million unique users and we spent 60 million minutes with us. For all of our video, we averaged 640 million streams. That's up 43% from the year before.
As we bring this call to a close, I want to reiterate that our plan to turn Yahoo! around centers on two things: Increasing profitability and growing revenue. Everything we're doing from new products and ad format to our Search Alliance is designed to drive us towards these goals. During last quarter and last year, we made steady progress and gained important momentum on both. For the year, operating profit, margins, EPS and return on invested capital all doubled. For the quarter, revenue came in ahead of our outlook midpoint and consensus. Display grew 16%. We completed the important North America Search transition on schedule and our constant properties continued their massive leads.
Looking ahead, 2011 will be another important year for us. We'll complete the majority of our technology platform investments that will add to our growth strategy as a premier digital media company and we'll continue to work with the alliance to improve the Search marketplace which will begin to show on our results for the second half of 2011. As the year unfolds, I look forward to updating you on our progress and how it will translate into value for our shareholders. With that in mind, please save May 25 for our annual Investor Day.

And as you saw, we bought 120 million shares at $14.68. That feels great. We're going to continue to reset ourselves and where we should be fighting and where we should be going forward. Again, we're going to begin disciplined and we're going to be absolutely disciplined about that. On Cap, yes, CapEx was a little bit high in the fourth quarter. It actually exceeded for the year by little bit, the top end of my range from this time last year but we did that pretty purposely in terms of really accelerating a lot of what was going on in 2011. 2011 now is $550 million to $600 million. I think if I recall for Investor Day last May, talk about how the fact that yes, Microsoft will be coming down, investments in our new data centers, like the one in Buffalo, which came online pretty much in September of this year, a build out of our Nebraska data center, those are events that will take CapEx up a little bit in the interim and then by 2013 or so, we should be settling down, I think, probably in the $500 million range so that's how it goes. Comes up a little bit, than itself down. We'll become more efficient and that is we go through."

So last year, excluding that $43 million one-time benefit our operations on a GAAP basis was 9.1% and it did indeed rising to 12.2% this quarter. On that ex-TAC basis, that 12.2% is 13.8% so you'd expected to be higher. You're dividing $145 million operating income on a lower revenue number, 1050 is the midpoint of our ex-TAC range. That is certainly lower than where we expect it to be as we progress through the year. We give us remember too, this quarter bears the full breadth of $36 million of the revenue share for the Search Alliance. So starting off with costs down 4%, but bearing the brunt of let's face it what will be in terms of headwinds, the toughest quarter we had this year is the reason only roughly 14% and not a bigger margin expansion for the year. Although, getting to my point out is at least one point on a GAAP basis of a few points expansion versus first quarter last year if you exclude that $43 million one-time item from last year."

We've got another probably volume pressure on us just as data proliferates and the need to run more and more through our data centers causes increases that we, that's probably $35 million to $40 million.

We just completed a very encouraging quarter and year for Yahoo! We made substantial strides to improve profitability. In Q10 (sic) [Q4 '10], we doubled our operating income, doubled our operating margin, doubled EPS and doubled return on invested capital. We did this while investing aggressively in our major products and the technology to drive our strategy to turn Yahoo! around. And in the process, create value for our shareholders.
The central focus of our plan is simple: increase profitability and grow revenue. To increase profitability, we have to be focused and efficient. To grow revenue, we have to deliver engaging products for users and advertisers. And to achieve our profitability and revenue goals, we have to execute across-the-board. What we've done during the past two years is all directed at these key drivers of success. We've made major strides reinventing our technology platforms so we can innovate and introduce new products and features more quickly than ever before. We've reorganized the company to improve its efficiency and to operate costs effectively. We've brought in some terrific new senior talents. The key to all of this is to deliver great content. That content takes a lot of forms, news, sports, finance, e-mail, search, entertainment and of course, relevant ads. It's what more than 630 million people come to us for every month, and it's what we're best at. It's our place in the online ecosystem, it's who we are. We focus on the aggregation, curation and creation of content, and we do it really, really well. Our direction and innovations are built around our vision of personalized content for each and every user.
Already, these investments are starting to pay off. our U.S. Today module click-through rate is up 36% year-over-year, and we now serve 13 million variations everyday. And engagement among early adopters of our new Mail Beta is more than 50% higher than our legacy Mail products. Our plan is that these new products and technologies will ensure a bright and sustainable future for Yahoo! as a premier digital media company. Now let's turn to 2010 for more detail.
As I noted earlier, we made substantial progress on profitability in 2010 and the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, our Q4 operating margin ex-TAC went from 13% last year to 21% this year. And our operating income increased to $258 million, up from $159 million. That's above consensus and above the midpoint of our outlook. Revenue ex-TAC also came in ahead of both outlook and consensus. It was down versus Q4 '09, just as we told you it would be due to the beginning of the rev [revenue] share with Microsoft and because of the various businesses we exited that did not fit with our content focus. In fact, without these items, our revenue ex-TAC would have been up 2% and GAAP revenue would have been up 3% for the quarter. Remember, as we discussed last quarter, this is all part of our plan to turn Yahoo! around. We've been working hard to make the company more efficient, expand margins and increase profitability.
But revenue's a bit different, it's tied to our products and innovation. And while it takes longer for the full impact to kick in, our strong performance in Display is a positive indicator of the top line growth we expect to see in the future. Display was a bright spot for us this past year and quarter. Q4 grew 16%, 27% sequentially, and 2010 grew 17% over 2009, all on an ex-TAC basis. In fact, we believe our growth in Display significantly outpaced the market according to numbers from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.
As for Search, the revenue ex-TAC in Q4 was down 18% compared to last year and for the full year, decreased by 10%. Taking out Search Alliance rev share and Paid Inclusion, we were down 6% for the quarter and 2% for the year. Of course, Search is a very important area of focus for us. But whenever you make big changes as we're doing with our Search Alliance, it takes some time for the marketplace adjust. But we're confident that the Alliance will be able to show a positive growth in Search by the end of the year.
2011 will be the final year of major competitive revenue headwinds, including divested business lines, outsourcing and of course, our rev share with Microsoft. So to say it in another way, 2012 will have cleaner apples-to-apples comparisons. We also believe the investments we're making in new technologies and products for users and advertisers will add to our growth. But before I provide more color on this, I'd like to turn it over to Tim to talk about the financials in more detail."
91800,117863421,95264,"Yahoo! Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Today, we'll address fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, first quarter 2011 guidance and also provide some color regarding expectations for 2011 in total. Highlights of our fourth quarter performance include: $1,205,0",2006,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Today, we'll address fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, first quarter 2011 guidance and also provide some color regarding expectations for 2011 in total. Highlights of our fourth quarter performance include: $1,205,000,000 ex-TAC revenue, $30 million above midpoint of guidance; 16% year-over-year growth in ex-TAC Display revenue; $220 million operating income, including a $38 million restructuring charge related to the actions we announced in December; operating income improved 85% versus fourth quarter 2009; and 62% excluding restructuring charges from both years. In short, we were really pleased with the fourth quarter.
Before diving into more detail, however, let me take a moment to highlight some major accomplishments for full year 2010. Operating income doubled versus 2009 to $773 million. Operating margins doubled to 16.8% on an ex-TAC basis. EPS doubled, even excluding one-time gains from both years. In the metric that best captures so much of our hard work, return on invested capital more than doubled, improving by nearly 2.5x to 13%.
During 2010, we also repositioned our cost structure for future growth and profitability, and it's now 22% below 2008 levels. That's a reduction of $1.1 billion.
We repurchased nearly 120 million shares at an average of $14.68 per share. And finally, we acquired four companies and divested two others as we continue to realign our product, business and technology portfolios.
We have much more to do, especially on the top line, but we're proud of these exceptional 2010 financial results.
Now let's turn back to fourth quarter, and review revenue in the three new reporting categories you see in our press release: Display, Search and Other. As I discuss these categories, please note that we've combined O&O and Affiliate revenue within Display and Search. Beginning with Display, ex-TAC revenue exceeded expectations with 16% year-over-year growth and 27% sequential growth. Once again, Americas and Asia-Pac grew strong double-digits and EMEA grew mid-single-digits. Both premium and non-premium revenue improved strong double-digits versus prior year, primarily driven by impression growth.
As expected, Search revenue declined 18% on an ex-TAC basis versus 2009, but this included nearly $32 million of Search Alliance revenue share. Excluding revenue share in our Paid Inclusion ad product, which was discontinued January 1, 2010, the comparison to prior year was down about 6%. The volume grew in the low single-digits in each of our regions, but this was more than offset by anticipated softness in click yield due to our platform transition in the U.S. Rounding out the top line, Other revenue, which includes fees with season leads, ended fourth quarter down 15% versus prior year. Back in July, we had guided that second half 2010 would be down 15% to 20% compared to 2009. So both 3Q and 4Q have been at the low end of the range. Fees revenue for 4Q did benefit from a one-time boost of $6 million related to successfully concluded patent litigation.
Panning out to the bigger picture, back in October, I have described the cosmetic accounting change to our revenue presentation that's required as we transition our paid Search platform. Let me remind you how this works.
The traffic acquisition costs, which we call TAC, represent the portion of our GAAP revenue that we share with third parties. The majority of our TAC has historically gone to partners that serve our Search results on their sites. While we were previously required to record TAC as part of our GAAP revenue, it was just offset in cost of revenue since it belonged to our partners and not us. In 4Q and going forward for all transitioned markets, TAC is no longer recorded in either line. We are simply booking revenue on a net basis in one clean step.
Once again, however, I'd like to emphasize that this accounting change has no impact at all on operating income or EPS. In the fourth quarter, this newly required accounting lowered GAAP revenue by $173 million. Therefore, GAAP revenue on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Search Alliance impacts, would have been flat versus the prior year. If we also look through our other transitional items, such as the shutdown of Paid Inclusion and the HotJobs and Zimbra divestitures, GAAP revenue would have been up roughly 3% year-over-year.
Moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter total expenses less TAC were down 14% versus prior year to $985 million. For full year 2010, ex-TAC expense was $3,816,000,000, which is a full 11% or $480 million lower than 2009. We continue to proactively reposition our cost structure to drive both top line innovation and margin expansion simultaneously.
Including the income statement discussion, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was just 8%, falling well below guidance as a result of both discrete items and operational favorability. For the year, our rate dropped to 21% from 38% in 2009. While the low 20% range is not sustainable at this time, we continue to make substantial progress in lowering our annual structural rate, which we now expect to be in the low 30% range. This has been and will continue to be a focus area for us. The team did a perfect job in 2010 and their hard work is really beginning to pay off.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended 2010 at roughly $3.6 billion, despite share repurchases of nearly $1.8 billion this year. Cash flow from operating activities was $403 million for the quarter, up 15% versus prior year and $1,240,000,000 for the year, down 5%. The full year results were most significantly impacted by our transition to paying cash taxes as our NOLs are now largely utilized. In 2010, we paid roughly $120 million more in taxes than in 2009.
Capital expenditures were $247 million for the fourth quarter and $714 million for the full year. Our CapEx reflects two dynamics at year-end. First, we are able to take advantage of opportunities to accelerate 2011 spending at advantageous prices. Second, we continue to build out our newer data centers to improve our underlying cost structure.
Finally, as of December 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was roughly $10.4 billion, or approximately $7.93 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses, most notably Taobao and Alipay.
Turning to 2011. For first quarter, we expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the $1,020,000,000 to $1,080,000,000 range. This outlook reflects roughly $60 million of year-over-year headwinds, comprised of $36 million in Search Alliance revenue share, plus nearly $25 million related to stepdowns in broadband deferred revenue amortization in certain fee rates in addition to the impact of divested business lines. This definition of revenue headwinds is consistent with our Investor Day presentation last May and notably, it excludes underlying operational dynamics.
We believe the sequential trends for two of our three revenue categories, Display and Other, are in line with expected seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, however, Display revenue growth of 5% to 10% looks less robust than recent trends as a result of a tough one-time comparison versus first quarter 2010.
Last year, we benefited from transitioning our large automotive customers from cash basis accounting to accrual accounting as they emerged from the difficulties of the recession. Excluding that prior year adjustment, Display revenue would be growing 10% to 15% year-over-year in 1Q.
The most meaningful revenue discussion, however, centers on Search. Obviously, given the U.S. platform transition in 4Q, there's a comparability issue versus 2010. That's the $36 million I mentioned a few moments ago. However, there's also a marketplace issue that needs to be addressed.
First, for our Owned and Operated properties, despite being encouraged by the RPS trend line, were still not where we need to be. Optimizing the combined marketplace to maximize click yield and price per click, will continue to be a critical focus for the entire first half of this year. Secondly, our Affiliate marketplace is farther behind than O&O. That, coupled with the transition of our Korean Affiliate, Naver, to its own search technology, drives our expectation that revenue ex-TAC in our Affiliate business will be down approximately $35 million year-over-year. Since that's operational in nature, it's additive to the $60 million headwind I spoke of earlier.
We're confident that the marketplace improvements for O&O, RPS and Affiliates will be realized toward mid-year 2011. There's no bigger focus for the Alliance. On a more immediately positive note, we are already encouraged by Search volume trends and by the innovations we'll be rolling out this year. Transitioning to ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $890 million to $920 million for first quarter. The midpoint of that range is down 4% year-over-year despite a one-time expense benefit of $43 million we recognized in first quarter 2010 related to Search Alliance reimbursements for costs incurred in 2009.
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $145 million. While down compared to 2010, it's flat excluding the one-time $43 million prior year benefit I spoke about a moment ago.
Although we'll continue to provide guidance quarter-by-quarter, given our expectation of improving Search revenue in second half, it makes sense to properly set expectations for the full year.
Once again, consistent with Investor Day, the full year impact of our 2011 revenue headwinds is expected to be approximately $220 million. Most notably, we expect roughly $170 million in Search Alliance revenue share or $140 million more year-over-year as we transition Search in most major markets around the globe. Rounding out the $220 million, as I noted earlier, are items related to broadband amortization, fee rates and divested business lines. While a few headwinds were loaded into 2012 as well, top line comparisons become much clearer after this year. In fact, we expect year-over-year net revenue growth in the second half of 2011 as headwinds lessen, RPS improves and Display strength continues.
With regard to cost structure, we expect 2011 ex-TAC expense to be roughly flat year-over-year despite wage inflation, volume-related cost pressures and continued investment in our growth programs, as we proactively drive efficiencies and better align our spending to high-return activities.
In terms of operating income, margin expansion will continue to be a key priority. Since we've transitioned to ex-TAC as our revenue measurement, it makes sense to similarly recast our margin goal on the basis of ex-TAC revenue. As a result, we are now targeting operating margins, or operating income as a percentage of our ex-TAC revenue, to expand from 17% today to 30% or greater by 2013. Capital expenditures for 2011 should fall to the $550 million to $600 million range despite aggressive investments to create a more efficient data center footprint.
Finally, our effective tax rate should be in the 30% to 35% range on a structural basis. We will, however, continue to take advantage of one-time improvements to that baseline where we can.
Before turning the call back to Carol, I'd like to offer a last word on 2010. While there are still much to do, we're executing well against our plan in a wide variety of areas and we're gaining momentum. Our product team has done a terrific job defining its strategy and progressing toward our goal of personalized content for each and every user. We've built and are rolling out new platforms and processes across the company to make Yahoo! faster and more flexible, innovative and efficient.
We continue to lead in Display advertising with substantial year-over-year growth that is ahead of the market. We're making significant strides on margin expansion, tax structure and capital structure. We're driving accountability throughout every organization and ensuring we have the right people doing the right things in the right locations all across the world.
Finally, we have a unified purpose. We're a premier digital media company focused on extending our competitive advantage, increasingly personalized world-class content. Carol?"

I'd now like to spend some time on several areas that are top of mind with many of you. First, let me discuss the latest on our Search Alliance. While we had a year of steady accomplishments and have a great deal more of work ahead, we successfully completed the North American paid Search transition on schedule in Q4 before the holiday shopping period and our systems remained stable. Our thousands and thousands of advertisers were able to execute their ad campaigns, reach their audiences and generate conversion. Publishers, including Yahoo! and our Affiliate partners, had more bumps than expected as they learned to operate in the new unified marketplace. As we enter 2011, the marketplace is not producing the click yield and RPS we had hoped, and it's going to take continued focus over the next two quarters to get to the financial model we established for the Alliance.
Yahoo! and Microsoft continue to work very well together. We're aligned in our goal to achieve the scale benefit of the unified marketplace, and we remain confident in the value of the Alliance and its financial benefits. There is a lot of work ahead, especially for Microsoft, as they invest in their marketplace science team and technology.
We picked the right partner, and we know they're focused and committed to our joint success. For major markets we expect algo [algorithm] to be transitioned by mid-year and paid by the end of the year. We'll start the paid transition in Europe mid-year and with Asia to follow in Q4. Moving on, I'd like to talk about our leadership position in Display. Advertisers continue to come to Yahoo! due to our unique brand of science, art and scale. And that we lead the Web in display advertising. We bring in more revenue in display than anyone else, and we're growing strong.
Who did Wal-Mart choose as their largest partner when they were looking to engage with women online? Where did Macy's go when they wanted to take their bread-and-butter placements, circulars and fashion books into the online arena? What company did Toyota turn to when they wanted an out-of-box solution to launch the new Avalon? That's right, they all came to Yahoo! These big brands and their agencies know and value the same things that we do, quality content and context matters. Creativity matters. Insight into audience behavior matters. Brand trust and privacy matters. Innovative new ad formats, like our login page and new mobile screen takeover and video ads matters. And more importantly, these are the big brands and agencies that account for a big chunk of the market. They are the ones who are driving share shift from offline to online.
Reaching the right person with the right ad at the right time is Marketing 101. We know that, of course, but we also know that online, not all impressions are created equal, not all minutes are time spent [ph] are created equal and not all ads are created equal.
Next up, I want to address our interest in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan. For Alibaba, I think that's in front of our point of view quite simply, our approximately 40% stake has been and continues to be a great investment, and we believe it has a bright future. Alibaba.com is growing quickly as is Taobao, which is now China's biggest online commerce marketplace with an estimated 75% share of the market. With e-commerce exploding in the largest country in the world, we feel our investment in Alibaba will grow in value and continue to greatly benefit our investors over time. As for Yahoo! Japan, our goal is to work with our partners in Japan to unlock the value of our investment for shareholders and attack efficiently.
There's one more thing I want to talk about before I discuss our product highlights from the quarter, and that's people. We've made some great new hires, attracting some really exceptional talent to the leadership ranks of Yahoo! We've got Ross Levinsohn running the Americas region, Wayne Powers running U.S. sales, Randy Roumillat [ph] as our new CIO and Mickie Rosen leading our media network, just to name a few. With these new people will come some changes as they reorganize and build out their team. Just as we made some changes in our product org last month, today we're making modest changes to the other organizations within Yahoo!, reducing about 1% of the jobs of the company.
As Tim outlined for you in detail at our Investor Day last May, these actions planned and necessary to eliminate duplication and redirect investments to our core products and strategies. When I say redirect investments, I mean that our roadmap includes hiring additional Yahoo!s to develop new products and experiences for users and advertisers this year in support of our strategy.
Now I'd like to walk you through some of the Q4 highlights. Asia continues to outperform. Display in the region grew 35% ex-TAC for 2010. Meanwhile, both Yahoo! Taiwan and Yahoo! Hong Kong are number one in audience with more than 94% reach in all major categories including Search, Mail, News, Finance and so on.
We've also executed a turnaround with EMEA. The region had its largest ever Q4 with its Display growth of 6% ex-TAC. The U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Spain hit an all-time high in audience reach of 49%. This is a very big improvement over what we've seen the last few years.
Our Americas content properties continued to do well. Yahoo! Finance kept up its amazing run as number one in its category for 36 straight months with a 44% share of audience. Yahoo! Sports has spent 33 straight months at the top. And then Yahoo! News, visitors are now spending an average of 2.5 billion minutes on this site per month, up 22% from Q4 of '09. This was driven by our great mid-term election coverage and the five new blogs we introduced last year that generated 108 million page views in November alone. In Search, with Microsoft powering our back end, we continued to innovate around the Search experience. And for us, that means focusing on giving our users answers, not just links. We launched new [ph] features, products and experiences. Now users increasingly get what they want right at the top of the results page. We also introduced QuickApps, where users can add a movie to their Netflix queue or watch it instantly, make reservations via OpenTable, buy movie or concert tickets and more. And we have agreements with partners to generate new revenue streams beyond just ads and clicks.
On the communications front, we launched a new Yahoo! Messenger Beta that allows people to play and share popular games from Zynga, share their social status and view, comment on and like updates from Yahoo! Pulse, Flickr, Facebook and Twitter.
We also launched the new Mail Beta, users can e-mail, IM, text, see and update status on social networks, share photos intuitively and much more. As I mentioned before, engagement among early adopters of our new Mail beta is more than 50% higher than our legacy Mail products. The mobile, we're really focusing on releasing apps in HTML-5 browser-based experiences that reach our users no matter what device or operating system they're on. We know that people assess Yahoo! on a range of devices. That's why you'll see us continue to unveil a slew of apps for iOS, Android and more. From Mail and Messenger to Finance and Flickr, it's been a successful approach as we've had millions of our apps downloaded. We've seen some big jumps in engagement as we released of these apps. Case in point, more than 40% of our Fantasy Football users access the product via mobile device during the regular football season. Look for us to release more of our popular products in mobile form, including MARKETDASH, our new Finance app for the iPad, that should hit the App Store within the next few weeks.
Our Connected TV product is generating a lot of momentum and interest. Its latest iteration got rave reviews at CES earlier this month. To date, there are 6 million TVs with our Connected TV platform. That adds up to more than 100 models from partners like Samsung, Sony, LG, Toshiba and Vizio. And lastly, we launched six new original, branded Entertainment video programs in the quarter. These new programs carry with them a great roster of CPG and auto sponsors, including Kellogg's, Lexus, Buick, Dodge, Toyota and Chevy. These new shows are having an impact. The latest comScore numbers show our original programming attracted 21 million unique users a month, who spent 60 million minutes with us. For all of our video, we averaged 640 million streams. That's up 43% from the year before.
As we bring this call to a close, I want to reiterate that our plan to turn Yahoo! around centers on two things: increasing profitability and growing revenue. Everything we're doing, from new products and ad formats to our Search Alliance, is designed to drive us towards these goals. During last quarter and last year, we made steady progress and gained important momentum on both. For the year, operating profit, margins, EPS and return on invested capital all doubled. For the quarter, revenue came in ahead of our outlook midpoint and consensus. Display grew 16%. We completed the important North America Search transition on schedule and our content properties continued their massive leads.
Looking ahead, 2011 will be another important year for us, where we'll complete the majority of our technology platform investments that will add to our growth strategy as a premier digital media company. And we'll continue to work with the Alliance to improve the Search marketplace, which will begin to show on our results for the second half of 2011. As the year unfolds, I look forward to updating you on our progress and how it will translate into value for our shareholders. With that in mind, please save May 25 for our annual Investor Day.
Now let's open it up to questions. Operator?"

And secondly, CapEx, I think was $247 million, which in my math, around 20% of your revenue ex-TAC.

I guess, the best way can explain this is, we're not hell-bent on spending a certain amount. There's no fear of our authorization expiring. So we're just -- we're going to be disciplined about this, and we view it as more of a marathon rather than a sprint. And we want to make sure that, like we did in 2010, doubling down where we think were just an exceptionally good buy, we'll do that. And as you saw, we bought 120 million shares at $14.68. That feels great. We're going to continue to reset ourselves and where we should be buying and where we should be going forward. But again, we're going to begin disciplined, and we're going to be absolutely disciplined about that. On CapEx, yes, CapEx was a little bit high in the fourth quarter. It actually exceeded for the year by a little bit, the top end of my range from this time last year. But we did that pretty purposely in terms of really accelerating a lot of what was going on in 2011. 2011 now, it's $550 million to $600 million. I think if I recall correctly, the Investor Day last May, I talked about how the fact that yes, Microsoft will be coming down, investments in our new data centers, like the one in Buffalo, which came online pretty much in September of this year, a buildout of our Nebraska data center. Those are events that will take CapEx up a little bit in the interim. And then by 2013 or so, we should be settling down, I think, probably in the $500 million range. So that's how it goes, it bumps up a little bit, and then feathers itself down. But we'll become more efficient on that as we go through."

So they're working on that. We're actually transferring some employees with expertise in that area. Also, it's about ad matching technology. It's just a bunch of -- I don't want to say little things because they all add up to really big things, and all of that is happening as Microsoft does their measured releases over the next two quarters.

But let me give it to you both ways to make sure that we're as transparent as we possibly can be on this. So last year, excluding that $43 million one-time benefit, our operation margins on a GAAP basis was 9.1%, and it is indeed rising to 12.2% this quarter. On that ex-TAC basis, that 12.2% is 13.8%, so you'd expect it to be higher. You're dividing $145 million operating income on a lower revenue number, $1.050 billion is the midpoint of our ex-TAC range. That is certainly lower than where we expect to be as we progress through the year. But you've got to remember, too, this quarter bears the full brunt of $36 million of the revenue share for the Search Alliance. So starting off with costs down 4%, but bearing the brunt of -- let's face it, what will be in terms of headwinds, the toughest quarter we had this year is the reason why it's only roughly 14% and not a bigger margin expansion for the year. Although, again, I point out that it's at least one point and on GAAP basis, up to a few points of expansion versus first quarter last year, if you exclude that $43 million one-time item from last year."

So most of the cost gets out next year, actually, but you do see some benefit in the second half. I mean, when we talk about keeping a year flat with, by my account about $130 million worth of just normal operating headwinds between wage inflation, $50 million, $55 million. We've got another probably volume pressure on us just as data proliferates and the need to run more and more through our data centers causes increases, where that's probably $35 million to $40 million. We have obviously the headwind, the $43 million one-time benefit we had last year. So I could go on and on. I guess, there's probably up $15 million, $20 million of FX actually that's embedded in our outlook.

Just to give you an update on the platforms, by the end of 2011, we will have moved 135 old platforms to our new Lego platforms, and that's in science, entertainment, news, sports, et cetera, and added 50 new products to market. All of these products will be more flexible, they'll have a consistent publisher tool, they'll be able to use our content agility from a cloud, and they'll be able to be content-optimized and for the first time, SCR-optimized.

We will also, by the end of the year because of the new Lego building block sort of rectangles as I call it, we're going to go from about 20 languages to about 47, which allows us to get in many, many new markets that we haven't been in. And new markets means new users and more minutes and all that kind of stuff. The point is, by the end of the year, it's called faster, moving much faster, innovating faster, but we're investing to do this.

Also, the loss, as I said in my script of the Naver Affiliate in Korea, which takes away about $12 million. This quarter is further impacted by feeling the burden of the marketplace tuning for the Search Alliance. We talked in the third quarter in the setup for the fourth quarter, that as we moved algo and paid, that we were seeing a little bit less revenue to the tune of about $30 million per quarter, and it was going to take some time to recover that revenue as we optimize the whole marketplace. Well, you're see that not only in O&O -- maybe it's starting to get a little bit better in O&O, but feeling that the biggest brunt of it in our Affiliates. I said in my script, the Affiliates will be down about $35 million year-over-year. Now $12 million of that is Naver. And really, the remainder of that is predominantly coming out of a run rate of last year, one. And two, probably, $15 million of true market plays impact as we fully transition here to the new platform. So that's how I'd reconcile that."

I think the most important thing that the Facebooks, Yahoo!s and Googles can  do is to get them online, then we can argue about who gets what. But the idea is to get them online and feel very comfortable. We see them feeling a lot more comfortably because of video and being able to paint their story. We see them being a lot more comfortable because of the large formats, so they can actually put their products in context and feel much more creative. So there's room for everybody here because we're serving different parts of the Internet value chain.

We just completed a very encouraging quarter and year for Yahoo! We made substantial strides to improve profitability. In Q10 (sic) [Q4 '10], we doubled our operating income, doubled our operating margin, doubled EPS and doubled return on invested capital. We did this while investing aggressively in our major products and the technology to drive our strategy to turn Yahoo! around. And in the process, create value for our shareholders.
The central focus of our plan is simple: increase profitability and grow revenue. To increase profitability, we have to be focused and efficient. To grow revenue, we have to deliver engaging products for users and advertisers. And to achieve our profitability and revenue goals, we have to execute across-the-board. What we've done during the past two years is all directed at these key drivers of success. We've made major strides reinventing our technology platforms so we can innovate and introduce new products and features more quickly than ever before. We've reorganized the company to improve its efficiency and to operate costs effectively. We've brought in some terrific new senior talents. The key to all of this is to deliver great content. That content takes a lot of forms, news, sports, finance, e-mail, search, entertainment and of course, relevant ads. It's what more than 630 million people come to us for every month, and it's what we're best at. It's our place in the online ecosystem, it's who we are. We focus on the aggregation, curation and creation of content, and we do it really, really well. Our direction and innovations are built around our vision of personalized content for each and every user.
Already, these investments are starting to pay off. Our U.S. Today module click-through rate is up 36% year-over-year, and we now serve 13 million variations every day. And engagement among early adopters of our new Mail Beta is more than 50% higher than our legacy Mail products. Our plan is that these new products and technologies will ensure a bright and sustainable future for Yahoo! as a premier digital media company. Now let's turn to 2010 for more detail.
As I noted earlier, we made substantial progress on profitability in 2010 and the quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, our Q4 operating margin ex-TAC went from 13% last year to 21% this year. And our operating income increased to $258 million, up from $159 million. That's above consensus and above the midpoint of our outlook. Revenue ex-TAC also came in ahead of both outlook and consensus. It was down versus Q4 '09, just as we told you it would be due to the beginning of the rev [revenue] share with Microsoft and because of the various businesses we exited that did not fit with our content focus. In fact, without these items, our revenue ex-TAC would have been up 2% and GAAP revenue would have been up 3% for the quarter. Remember, as we discussed last quarter, this is all part of our plan to turn Yahoo! around. We've been working hard to make the company more efficient, expand margins and increase profitability.
But revenue's a bit different, it's tied to our products and innovation. And while it takes longer for the full impact to kick in, our strong performance in Display is a positive indicator of the top line growth we expect to see in the future. Display was a bright spot for us this past year and quarter. Q4 grew 16%, 27% sequentially, and 2010 grew 17% over 2009, all on an ex-TAC basis. In fact, we believe our growth in Display significantly outpaced the market according to numbers from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.
As for Search, the revenue ex-TAC in Q4 was down 18% compared to last year and for the full year, decreased by 10%. Taking out Search Alliance rev share and Paid Inclusion, we were down 6% for the quarter and 2% for the year. Of course, Search is a very important area of focus for us. But whenever you make big changes as we're doing with our Search Alliance, it takes some time for the marketplace adjust. But we're confident that the Alliance will be able to show a positive growth in Search by the end of the year.
2011 will be the final year of major competitive revenue headwinds, including divested business lines, outsourcing and of course, our rev share with Microsoft. So to say it in another way, 2012 will have cleaner apples-to-apples comparisons. We also believe the investments we're making in new technologies and products for users and advertisers will add to our growth. But before I provide more color on this, I'd like to turn it over to Tim to talk about the financials in more detail."
91800,117863421,95284,"Yahoo! Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2011",2011-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Today, we'll address fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, first quarter 2011 guidance and also provide some color regarding expectations for 2011 in total. Highlights of our fourth quarter performance include: $1,205,0",2006,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Today, we'll address fourth quarter and full year 2010 results, first quarter 2011 guidance and also provide some color regarding expectations for 2011 in total. Highlights of our fourth quarter performance include: $1,205,000,000 ex-TAC revenue, $30 million above midpoint of guidance; 16% year-over-year growth in ex-TAC Display revenue; $220 million operating income, including a $38 million restructuring charge related to the actions we announced in December; operating income improved 85% versus fourth quarter 2009; and 62% excluding restructuring charges from both years. In short, we were really pleased with the fourth quarter.
Before diving into more detail, however, let me take a moment to highlight some major accomplishments for full year 2010. Operating income doubled versus 2009 to $773 million. Operating margins doubled to 16.8% on an ex-TAC basis. EPS doubled, even excluding one-time gains from both years. In the metric that best captures so much of our hard work, return on invested capital more than doubled, improving by nearly 2.5x to 13%.
During 2010, we also repositioned our cost structure for future growth and profitability, and it's now 22% below 2008 levels. That's a reduction of $1.1 billion.
We repurchased nearly 120 million shares at an average of $14.68 per share. And finally, we acquired four companies and divested two others as we continue to realign our product, business and technology portfolios.
We have much more to do, especially on the top line, but we're proud of these exceptional 2010 financial results.
Now let's turn back to fourth quarter, and review revenue in the three new reporting categories you see in our press release: Display, Search and Other. As I discuss these categories, please note that we've combined O&O and Affiliate revenue within Display and Search. Beginning with Display, ex-TAC revenue exceeded expectations with 16% year-over-year growth and 27% sequential growth. Once again, Americas and Asia-Pac grew strong double-digits and EMEA grew mid-single-digits. Both premium and non-premium revenue improved strong double-digits versus prior year, primarily driven by impression growth.
As expected, Search revenue declined 18% on an ex-TAC basis versus 2009, but this included nearly $32 million of Search Alliance revenue share. Excluding revenue share in our Paid Inclusion ad product, which was discontinued January 1, 2010, the comparison to prior year was down about 6%. The volume grew in the low single-digits in each of our regions, but this was more than offset by anticipated softness in click yield due to our platform transition in the U.S. Rounding out the top line, Other revenue, which includes fees with season leads, ended fourth quarter down 15% versus prior year. Back in July, we had guided that second half 2010 would be down 15% to 20% compared to 2009. So both 3Q and 4Q have been at the low end of the range. Fees revenue for 4Q did benefit from a one-time boost of $6 million related to successfully concluded patent litigation.
Panning out to the bigger picture, back in October, I had described the cosmetic accounting change to our revenue presentation that's required as we transition our paid Search platform. Let me remind you how this works.
The traffic acquisition costs, which we call TAC, represent the portion of our GAAP revenue that we share with third parties. The majority of our TAC has historically gone to partners that serve our Search results on their sites. While we were previously required to record TAC as part of our GAAP revenue, it was just offset in cost of revenue since it belonged to our partners and not us. In 4Q and going forward for all transitioned markets, TAC is no longer recorded in either line. We are simply booking revenue on a net basis in one clean step.
Once again, however, I'd like to emphasize that this accounting change has no impact at all on operating income or EPS. In the fourth quarter, this newly required accounting lowered GAAP revenue by $173 million. Therefore, GAAP revenue on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding Search Alliance impacts, would have been flat versus the prior year. If we also look through our other transitional items, such as the shutdown of Paid Inclusion and the HotJobs and Zimbra divestitures, GAAP revenue would have been up roughly 3% year-over-year.
Moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter total expenses less TAC were down 14% versus prior year to $985 million. For full year 2010, ex-TAC expense was $3,816,000,000, which is a full 11% or $480 million lower than 2009. We continue to proactively reposition our cost structure to drive both top line innovation and margin expansion simultaneously.
Concluding the income statement discussion, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was just 8%, falling well below guidance as a result of both discrete items and operational favorability. For the year, our rate dropped to 21% from 38% in 2009. While the low 20% range is not sustainable at this time, we continue to make substantial progress in lowering our annual structural rate, which we now expect to be in the low 30% range. This has been and will continue to be a focus area for us. The team did a terrific job in 2010 and their hard work is really beginning to pay off.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended 2010 at roughly $3.6 billion, despite share repurchases of nearly $1.8 billion this year. Cash flow from operating activities was $403 million for the quarter, up 15% versus prior year and $1,240,000,000 for the year, down 5%. The full year results were most significantly impacted by our transition to paying cash taxes as our NOLs are now largely utilized. In 2010, we paid roughly $120 million more in taxes than in 2009.
Capital expenditures were $247 million for the fourth quarter and $714 million for the full year. Our CapEx reflects two dynamics at year-end. First, we are able to take advantage of opportunities to accelerate 2011 spending at advantageous prices. Second, we continue to build out our newer data centers to improve our underlying cost structure.
Finally, as of December 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was roughly $10.4 billion, or approximately $7.93 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba Group's privately held businesses, most notably Taobao and Alipay.
Turning to 2011. For first quarter, we expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the $1,020,000,000 to $1,080,000,000 range. This outlook reflects roughly $60 million of year-over-year headwinds, comprised of $36 million in Search Alliance revenue share, plus nearly $25 million related to step-downs in broadband deferred revenue amortization in certain fee rates in addition to the impact of divested business lines. This definition of revenue headwinds is consistent with our Investor Day presentation last May and notably, it excludes underlying operational dynamics.
We believe the sequential trends for two of our three revenue categories, Display and Other, are in line with expected seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, however, Display revenue growth of 5% to 10% looks less robust than recent trends as a result of a tough one-time comparison versus first quarter 2010.
Last year, we benefited from transitioning our large automotive customers from cash basis accounting to accrual accounting as they emerged from the difficulties of the recession. Excluding that prior year adjustment, Display revenue would be growing 10% to 15% year-over-year in 1Q.
The most meaningful revenue discussion, however, centers on Search. Obviously, given the U.S. platform transition in 4Q, there's a comparability issue versus 2010. That's the $36 million I mentioned a few moments ago. However, there's also a marketplace issue that needs to be addressed.
First, for our Owned and Operated properties, despite being encouraged by the RPS trend line, were still not where we need to be. Optimizing the combined marketplace to maximize click yield and price per click, will continue to be a critical focus for the entire first half of this year. Secondly, our Affiliate marketplace is farther behind than O&O. That, coupled with the transition of our Korean Affiliate, Naver, to its own search technology, drives our expectation that revenue ex-TAC in our Affiliate business will be down approximately $35 million year-over-year. Since that's operational in nature, it's additive to the $60 million headwind I spoke of earlier.
We're confident that the marketplace improvements for O&O, RPS and Affiliates will be realized toward mid-year 2011. There's no bigger focus for the Alliance. On a more immediately positive note, we are already encouraged by Search volume trends and by the innovations we'll be rolling out this year. Transitioning to ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $890 million to $920 million for first quarter. The midpoint of that range is down 4% year-over-year despite a one-time expense benefit of $43 million we recognized in first quarter 2010 related to Search Alliance reimbursements for costs incurred in 2009.
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $145 million. While down compared to 2010, it's flat excluding the one-time $43 million prior year benefit I spoke about a moment ago.
Although we'll continue to provide guidance quarter-by-quarter, given our expectation of improving Search revenue in second half, it makes sense to properly set expectations for the full year.
Once again, consistent with Investor Day, the full year impact of our 2011 revenue headwinds is expected to be approximately $220 million. Most notably, we expect roughly $170 million in Search Alliance revenue share or $140 million more year-over-year as we transition Search in most major markets around the globe. Rounding out the $220 million, as I noted earlier, are items related to broadband amortization, fee rates and divested business lines. While a few headwinds were loaded into 2012 as well, top line comparisons become much clearer after this year. In fact, we expect year-over-year net revenue growth in the second half of 2011 as headwinds lessen, RPS improves and Display strength continues.
With regard to cost structure, we expect 2011 ex-TAC expense to be roughly flat year-over-year despite wage inflation, volume-related cost pressures and continued investment in our growth programs, as we proactively drive efficiencies and better align our spending to high-return activities.
In terms of operating income, margin expansion will continue to be a key priority. Since we've transitioned to ex-TAC as our revenue measurement, it makes sense to similarly recast our margin goal on the basis of ex-TAC revenue. As a result, we are now targeting operating margins, or operating income as a percentage of our ex-TAC revenue, to expand from 17% today to 30% or greater by 2013. Capital expenditures for 2011 should fall to the $550 million to $600 million range despite aggressive investments to create a more efficient data center footprint.
Finally, our effective tax rate should be in the 30% to 35% range on a structural basis. We will, however, continue to take advantage of one-time improvements to that baseline where we can.
Before turning the call back to Carol, I'd like to offer a last word on 2010. While there are still much to do, we're executing well against our plan in a wide variety of areas and we're gaining momentum. Our product team has done a terrific job defining its strategy and progressing toward our goal of personalized content for each and every user. We've built and are rolling out new platforms and processes across the company to make Yahoo! faster and more flexible, innovative and efficient.
We continue to lead in Display advertising with substantial year-over-year growth that is ahead of the market. We're making significant strides on margin expansion, tax structure and capital structure. We're driving accountability throughout every organization and ensuring we have the right people doing the right things in the right locations all across the world.
Finally, we have a unified purpose. We're a premier digital media company focused on extending our competitive advantage, increasingly personalized world-class content. Carol?"

I'd now like to spend some time on several areas that are top of mind with many of you. First, let me discuss the latest on our Search Alliance. While we had a year of steady accomplishments and have a great deal more of work ahead, we successfully completed the North American paid Search transition on schedule in Q4 before the holiday shopping period and our systems remained stable. Our thousands and thousands of advertisers were able to execute their ad campaigns, reach their audiences and generate conversion. Publishers, including Yahoo! and our Affiliate partners, have had bumps unexpected as they learned to operate in the new unified marketplace. As we enter 2011, the marketplace is not producing the click yield and RPS we had hoped, and it's going to take continued focus over the next two quarters to get to the financial model we established for the Alliance.
Yahoo! and Microsoft continue to work very well together. We're aligned in our goal to achieve the scale benefit of the unified marketplace, and we remain confident in the value of the Alliance and its financial benefits. There is a lot of work ahead, especially for Microsoft, as they invest in their marketplace science team and technology.
We picked the right partner, and we know they're focused and committed to our joint success. For major markets we expect algo [algorithm] to be transitioned by mid-year and paid by the end of the year. We'll start the paid transition in Europe mid-year and with Asia to follow in Q4. Moving on, I'd like to talk about our leadership position in Display. Advertisers continue to come to Yahoo! due to our unique blend of science, art and scale. And that we lead the Web in display advertising. We bring in more revenue in display than anyone else, and we're growing strong.
Who did Wal-Mart choose as their largest partner when they were looking to engage with women online? Where did Macy's go when they wanted to take their bread-and-butter placements, circulars and fashion books into the online arena? What company did Toyota turn to when they wanted an out-of-box solution to launch the new Avalon? That's right, they all came to Yahoo! These big brands and their agencies know and value the same things that we do, quality content and context matters. Creativity matters. Insight into audience behavior matters. Brand trust and privacy matters. Innovative new ad formats, like our login page and new mobile screen takeover and video ads matter. And more importantly, these are the big brands and agencies that account for a big chunk of the market. They are the ones who are driving share shift from offline to online.
Reaching the right person with the right ad at the right time is Marketing 101. We know that, of course, but we also know that online, not all impressions are created equal, not all minutes or time spent are created equal and not all ads are created equal.
Next up, I want to address our interest in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan. For Alibaba, I think that's in front of our point of view quite simply, our approximately 40% stake has been and continues to be a great investment, and we believe it has a bright future. Alibaba.com is growing quickly as is Taobao, which is now China's biggest online commerce marketplace with an estimated 75% share of the market. With e-commerce exploding in the largest country in the world, we feel our investment in Alibaba will grow in value and continue to greatly benefit our investors over time. As for Yahoo! Japan, our goal is to work with our partners in Japan to unlock the value of our investment for shareholders and attack efficiently.
There's one more thing I want to talk about before I discuss our product highlights from the quarter, and that's people. We've made some great new hires, attracting some really exceptional talent to the leadership ranks of Yahoo! We've got Ross Levinsohn running the Americas region, Wayne Powers running U.S. sales, Randy Roumillat [ph] as our new CIO and Mickie Rosen leading our media network, just to name a few. With these new people will come some changes as they reorganize and build out their team. Just as we made some changes in our product org last month, today we're making modest changes to the other organizations within Yahoo!, reducing about 1% of the jobs of the company.
As Tim outlined for you in detail at our Investor Day last May, these actions are planned and necessary to eliminate duplication and redirect investments to our core products and strategies. When I say redirect investments, I mean that our roadmap includes hiring additional Yahoo!s to develop new products and experiences for users and advertisers this year in support of our strategy.
Now I'd like to walk you through some of the Q4 highlights. Asia continues to outperform. Display in the region grew 35% ex-TAC for 2010. Meanwhile, both Yahoo! Taiwan and Yahoo! Hong Kong are number one in audience with more than 94% reach in all major categories including Search, Mail, News, Finance and so on.
We've also executed a turnaround with EMEA. The region had its largest ever Q4 with its Display growth of 6% ex-TAC. The U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Spain hit an all-time high in audience reach of 49%. This is a very big improvement over what we've seen the last few years.
Our Americas content properties continued to do well. Yahoo! Finance kept up its amazing run as number one in its category for 36 straight months with a 44% share of audience. Yahoo! Sports has spent 33 straight months at the top. And then Yahoo! News, visitors are now spending an average of 2.5 billion minutes on this site per month, up 22% from Q4 of '09. This was driven by our great mid-term election coverage and the five new blogs we introduced last year that generated 108 million page views in November alone. In Search, with Microsoft powering our back end, we continued to innovate around the Search experience. And for us, that means focusing on giving our users answers, not just links. We launched new [ph] features, products and experiences. Now users increasingly get what they want right at the top of the results page. We also introduced QuickApps, where users can add a movie to their Netflix queue or watch it instantly, make reservations via OpenTable, buy movie or concert tickets and more. And we have agreements with partners to generate new revenue streams beyond just ads and clicks.
On the communications front, we launched a new Yahoo! Messenger Beta that allows people to play and share popular games from Zynga, share their social status and view, comment on and like updates from Yahoo! Pulse, Flickr, Facebook and Twitter.
We also launched the new Mail Beta, users can e-mail, IM, text, see and update status on social networks, share photos intuitively and much more. As I mentioned before, engagement among early adopters of our new Mail beta is more than 50% higher than our legacy Mail products. In Mobile, we're really focusing on releasing apps in HTML-5 browser-based experiences that reach our users no matter what device or operating system they're on. We know that people assess Yahoo! on a range of devices. That's why you'll see us continue to unveil a slew of apps for iOS, Android and more. From Mail and Messenger to Finance and Flickr, it's been a successful approach as we've had millions of our apps downloaded. We've seen some big jumps in engagement as we released of these apps. Case in point, more than 40% of our Fantasy Football users access the product via mobile device during the regular football season. Look for us to release more of our popular products in mobile form, including MARKETDASH, our new Finance app for the iPad, that should hit the App Store within the next few weeks.
Our Connected TV product is generating a lot of momentum and interest. Its latest iteration got rave reviews at CES earlier this month. To date, there are 6 million TVs with our Connected TV platform. That adds up to more than 100 models from partners like Samsung, Sony, LG, Toshiba and Vizio. And lastly, we launched six new original, branded Entertainment video programs in the quarter. These new programs carry with them a great roster of CPG and auto sponsors, including Kellogg's, Lexus, Buick, Dodge, Toyota and Chevy. These new shows are having an impact. The latest comScore numbers show our original programming attracted 21 million unique users a month, who spent 60 million minutes with us. For all of our video, we averaged 640 million streams. That's up 43% from the year before.
As we bring this call to a close, I want to reiterate that our plan to turn Yahoo! around centers on two things: increasing profitability and growing revenue. Everything we're doing, from new products and ad formats to our Search Alliance, is designed to drive us towards these goals. During last quarter and last year, we made steady progress and gained important momentum on both. For the year, operating profit, margins, EPS and return on invested capital all doubled. For the quarter, revenue came in ahead of our outlook midpoint and consensus. Display grew 16%. We completed the important North America Search transition on schedule and our content properties continued their massive leads.
Looking ahead, 2011 will be another important year for us, where we'll complete the majority of our technology platform investments that will add to our growth strategy as a premier digital media company. And we'll continue to work with the Alliance to improve the Search marketplace, which will begin to show on our results for the second half of 2011. As the year unfolds, I look forward to updating you on our progress and how it will translate into value for our shareholders. With that in mind, please save May 25 for our annual Investor Day.

I guess, the best way can express this is, we're not hell-bent on spending a certain amount. There's no fear of our authorization expiring. So we're just -- we're going to be disciplined about this, and we view it as more of a marathon rather than a sprint. And we want to make sure that, like we did in 2010, doubling down where we think were just an exceptionally good buy, we'll do that. And as you saw, we bought 120 million shares at $14.68. That feels great. We're going to continue to reset ourselves and where we should be buying and where we should be going forward. But again, we're going to begin disciplined, and we're going to be absolutely disciplined about that. On CapEx, yes, CapEx was a little bit high in the fourth quarter. It actually exceeded for the year by a little bit, the top end of my range from this time last year. But we did that pretty purposely in terms of really accelerating a lot of what was going on in 2011. 2011 now, it's $550 million to $600 million. I think if I recall correctly, the Investor Day last May, I talked about how the fact that yes, Microsoft will be coming down, investments in our new data centers, like the one in Buffalo, which came online pretty much in September of this year, a build out of our Nebraska data center. Those are events that will take CapEx up a little bit in the interim. And then by 2013 or so, we should be settling down, I think, probably in the $500 million range. So that's how it goes, it bumps up a little bit, and then feathers itself down. But we'll become more efficient on that as we go through."

That is certainly lower than where we expect to be as we progress through the year.

So starting off with costs down 4%, but bearing the brunt of -- let's face it, what will be in terms of headwinds, the toughest quarter we had this year is the reason why it's only roughly 14% and not a bigger margin expansion for the year.

Just to give you an update on the platforms, by the end of 2011, we will have moved 135 old platforms to our new Lego platforms, and that's in science, entertainment, news, sports, et cetera, and added 50 new products to market. All of these products will be more flexible, they'll have a consistent publisher tool, they'll be able to use our content agility from a cloud, and they'll be able to be content-optimized and for the first time, SCR-optimized. As I've told you before, we don't have SCR optimization at any of our sites, which is patently ridiculous. So not to mention, by the way, right now, we have three huge Mail platforms, our new one, of course, and the two legacy. By the end of the year, we will have one worldwide legacy platform. We will also, by the end of the year because of the new Lego building block sort of rectangles as I call it, we're going to go from about 20 languages to about 47, which allows us to get in many, many new markets that we haven't been in. And new markets means new users and more minutes and all that kind of stuff. The point is, by the end of the year, it's called faster, moving much faster, innovating faster, but we're investing to do this. So we actually believe being able to do all of these things and make these big transitions that holding costs flat is really important. But we are not cutting costs to grow the company. We are investing to grow the company."

Again, I want to make sure we're as clear and transparent about this as possible and again emphasize that if you go back to the Investor Day presentation, it's the exact, same definition I used back then, The Search Alliance, I expect to be, as I said in the script, about $140 million. The broadband roll off portion for this year, the amortization, the step-down in amortization of broadband fees that were booked as cash a few years ago will be about $20 million. The combination of HotJobs and Zimbra will be about $35 million, call it. And the step-down in the percentage of Search fee that we get from Y!J will be about $25 million. So $140 million, plus $20 million, plus $35 million, plus $25 million gets you about $220 million. Those are the headwinds that I spoke about in the script. And I said there's about $60 million worth of that, that is impacting first quarter, aside from our Affiliate business and how it's reacting to the transition to Search Alliance."

Also, the loss, as I said in my script of the Naver Affiliate in Korea, which takes away about $12 million. This quarter is further impacted by feeling the burden of the marketplace tuning for the Search Alliance. We talked in the third quarter in the setup for the fourth quarter, that as we moved algo and paid, that we were seeing a little bit less revenue to the tune of about $30 million per quarter, and it was going to take some time to recover that revenue as we optimize the whole marketplace. Well, you're seeing that not only in O&O -- maybe it's starting to get a little bit better in O&O, but feeling that the biggest brunt of it in our Affiliates. I said in my script, the Affiliates will be down about $35 million year-over-year. Now $12 million of that is Naver. And really, the remainder of that is predominantly coming out of a run rate of last year, one.

I think the most important thing that the Facebooks, Yahoo!s and Googles can  do is to get them online, then we can argue about who gets what. But the idea is to get them online and feel very comfortable. We see them feeling a lot more comfortably because of video and being able to paint their story.

On today's call, we'll discuss Q1 progress and financial results, update you on the Search Alliance with Microsoft, share our financial highlights and outlook, and of course, take your questions. First, I w",2117,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. On today's call, we'll discuss Q1 progress and financial results, update you on the Search Alliance with Microsoft, share our financial highlights and outlook, and of course, take your questions. First, I want to update you all on how we're executing our strategic plan for returning Yahoo! to sustainable revenue and profit growth. We have a lot of proof points this quarter that highlights very tangible progress. Let's take a hard look at some of the key facts.
Display revenue is growing in the midteens on an underlying basis. After a couple of years of overhauling listings and fees, other revenues primed to come back into positive territory by year-end. We're now shipping the new major tech platforms we've been working on in the past two years and engagement is growing. Yahoo!'s global users were up 13% in Q1, page views on our media properties were up 8% and minutes on those properties were up 17%. The operating momentum we've been building continues as we modernize our technology platform, driving engagements through enriched content, introducing well-received new products and leveraging innovations in digital advertising to boost display revenue growth. Overall, our turnaround is proceeding on schedule and we are very confident Yahoo! is heading in the right direction.
With all that said, the Search marketplace is encountering some issues related to Microsoft adCenter technology. There is a clear plan to address that and I'll touch on that more in a moment.
On the financials, we beat the midpoint of our guidance on the top and the bottom where our GAAP revenue was down over 20%, this is not the story. Without the funky comparisons because of the Search Alliance and other non-comparable items, our revenue ex-TAC would have been flat. Remember that GAAP revenue reflects the impact of divestitures, fee step downs and the to biggie, the required accounting change related to the Search Alliance and of course, the Microsoft WebShare.
As you know, the required change in accounting from the Search Alliance hits our GAAP revenue especially hard, but, and this is very important, the accounting change has no impact on the bottom line.
To put it simply until all markets are transitioned, revenue ex-TAC will give you the clearest picture of our real business dynamics. In January, we explained that 2011 would be a year of major comparable revenue headwinds because of the items I mentioned a moment ago. And we said that comparisons will get cleaner going forward. That has not changed.
So let's move on and speak to three key elements of our strategy to extend Yahoo!'s lead as a premier digital media company. First, modernizing our technology. Second, driving engagement; and third, innovating in digital advertising. So first on technology, we said two years ago that we had to modernize the technology platform that powers our site. Our content was not interactive, it was in silos and we were managing hundreds of sites running on Display cold basis. We've been talking about these investments every quarter and the pay off is starting to become apparent. We now have 34 sites across the Americas, EMEA and APAC, live on a new global content platform. The pace of our rollout is accelerating with 31 of those sites coming online in just the last 3 months. And this year, we are on target to meet our goal of getting 135 total sites, that's 85 existing and 50 brand new sites on to our more modern flexible platforms. By year-end, we'll have Entertainment, lifestyle, News and other sites rolled out in new markets and new languages, some in places where Yahoo! has little or no presence before, that means more users, greater engagement and more ad inventory.
These platforms bring other great benefits as well, speed to deploying new sites and features, efficiency for our editors to manage more content and most important personalization. The platforms will enable tools like content optimization and Search engine optimization to deliver on our vision of deeply personalized content for each user on every site. We expect that to drive engagement up.
Beyond the technology advances, we're doing even more to improve the user experience on our sites. We are driving engagement within increasingly personalized and richer content delivered to any device. Let me give you 2 great examples this quarter.
Namely the blockbuster events of the Super Bowl and the Oscars. Yahoo!  Always sees big traffic around major events, that's nothing new. What's new this year are the technology advances and editorial focus that allowed us to program these big events in ways that drove even more engagement. For example, using our content optimization engine, we showed different Super Bowl packages to many different audience segments during and after the game. Hard-core football fans got on the field news, others users got roundups of the and still others saw broader interest story. This simple, personalized programming drove more than 37 million clicks, double last year's numbers. That's huge.
At the Academy Awards, we did even more. We leveraged new ways of promoting the events across the Yahoo! network through the Homepage, Search, Mail and media properties. We developed custom videos focusing on buzzworthy topics. And for the first time in our Entertainment sites, Yahoo! broke realtime stories during the show that generated huge clicks.
My favorite part of our Oscar programming with the 2 new social Games, winner take and red carpet rack that allowed users to select the winners. And whopping 49% of the users who visited these pages interacted with the Games and many shared their pics with friends. All of this created fantastic results. We generated 1.2 billion page views around the Oscars, a 23% jump over last year. Those are impressive numbers, but even more so, in a year when TV ratings for the awards fell yet again.
But I want to be very clear. Our focus is not just these major temple events, our goal is to add more original voice and video to complement the scale of these mega-events and keep existing and new users coming back for more of what they find interesting everyday.
Like we do with our news blogs. Two years ago, there were no blogs anywhere on Yahoo! News. Now blogs like the upshot, Weekend Edition and others are huge hits. In Q1 alone, our U.S. News blogs did more than 400 million page views. That's up more than 50% in three months. Three months ago, we were less than 200 million. We are up 50% in three months. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we intend to bring original voice to our media properties. This is just one example of how it really works.
And the engagement data is encouraging. According to comScore, minutes on our global media sites were up 17% year-over-year in Q1. Meanwhile, our internal data shows page views on our global media sites up 8%. No let's talk about monetization. Of course, the best way to drive revenue is to deepen user engagement, so we have more ads to sell and we are doing just that. The new features on our Display ad platforms also drove our Q1 results. For example, new features and apps continued to improve the efficiency and yield of trafficking and managing premium Display campaign. And we've made huge improvements in our ad inventory prediction tools in both apps and light media, increasing the accuracy of forecasts and campaign delivery. These improvements translate directly into higher ROI for our advertisers.
We're also selling ad packages and solutions that make use of the whole Yahoo! network. I'll talk about the Oscars content earlier. On the ad side, we worked closely with Chrysler on our unique sponsorship of our awards coverage this year, including the Oscars, the Grammys and the Globe's. This broad and deep campaign called the road to the award shows, leveraged rich original voice, social content and ads across the network. And it generated huge results for Chrysler. We deliver 1.6 billion ad impressions and saw a big uptick in related car shopping activities on Yahoo!. The pull through on the social element was especially cool. Chrysler tripled the number of likes on its fan page.
No one else can deliver what Yahoo! did. Sponsorships like these are extremely successful because Yahoo! is taking ad solution selling to the new level, finding the specific audiences our advertisers seek wherever they are on Yahoo!, on and off. All these examples of advances in technology, programming and ad products are indicative of the exhilarating pace of innovation at Yahoo!.
I've a lot more at like to share, but I know you want to get to the numbers, so let's do that first. To put it simply, we delivered in Q1, beating the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Our Display business was strong everywhere and we expect Display revenue ex-TAC to grow in the midteens in Q2. We are growing ad supply and accelerating the pace of new ad products and it's clear that our new ad platforms are letting us monetize better. For Search, Q1 was a mixed bag. Let's focus first on the performance for the Search Alliance.
The good news is that many of our most important advertisers are realizing a much higher ROI on their campaign in the combined marketplace. We see major financial, auto, retail and customers spending multiples of what they spent with Yahoo! and Microsoft previously because returns have been great.
And some recent third-party reports have reinforced why we did the alliance in the first place. Advertisers CTA and ROI and Yahoo! has improved dramatically. This is good news for advertisers as they seek an alternative for their online search marketing spend.
On the downside, however, at the center is not yet producing the RPS we hoped for and are confident as possible. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI, but technical limitations in the current adCenter platform mean the click volumes just isn't there yet. We had expected RPS to be neutral by midyear, it's now evident that it will take Microsoft longer to achieve that goal. We expect that to happen by year-end. In the meantime, the RPS guaranty helps to protect our revenue and our view of the long-term potential of the marketplace remains unchanged.
We are working very close with Microsoft on this. They understand the issues and they're hard at work on systems architecture, science models and better features and functions in adCenter. They have an aggressive roadmap to bring those to the marketplace.
As Microsoft focuses on RPS improvement in the U.S., we're holding off on transitioning more page search markets this year. We'll transition the remaining page search markets once we believe the changes are in place to yield the right results for our advertisers. We are almost ready to begin the rest of the elbow transition.
In the meantime, Yahoo! is focusing on our we can do in Search to create better and better user experiences, and help our advertisers and publishers optimize their results. On the users side, our growing list of new Search experiences and our focus on providing users answers, not links is helping us grow U.S. Search volume. This quarter, we launched Search Direct which provides answers directly in the Search assist tray realtime as you type. We are making incredibly easy for the user to scan, comprehend and quickly access the top results, without even having to navigate to a Search result page.
For Search advertisers, Yahoo! account management teams are expanding the work we are doing alongside many of our largest customers to help advertisers get the most out of their Search spend. They are hungry for clicks and conversion, so we're helping them implement better optimization techniques as advertisers see higher ROI from these efforts, this is also helping to grow their Search budgets with us. We have specific plans in place to scale those solutions to more advertisers in the coming months.
Finally, we're also working with our publisher partners to help them optimize their sites and realized more of the volume they are seeking. So obviously, there's a lot going on in Search.
No let's come back to the quarter. As I said, revenue beat the midpoint of our guidance. On the profitability said, we are balancing investments and content in technology with increased efficiency. As we roll out new sites and get existing sites on to the new platforms, we are seeing the efficiency gains and faster rollout pace we knew was possible. And we're delivering on the bottom line at the same time. So let me turn it over to Tim to give you more details. Tim?"

Let's begin with our first quarter narrative and then progress to second quarter guidance. Highlights of our first quarter performance include $1,064,000,000 ex-TAC revenue, $14 million above guidance midpoint; 10% year-over-year ex-TAC Display revenue growth at the high end of our guidance range. As I highlighted in January, our reported Display growth rate this quarter is muted by the first quarter 2010 benefit of transitioning our automotive customers back to accrual accounting. Excluding that adjustment from prior year, our Display business grew nearly 17% year-over-year. Returning to our highlights, our $190 million operating income was above the high-end of our guidance range and 1% ahead of last year, but up 31% year-over-year, excluding the $43 million one-time Search Alliance reimbursement catch-up in the first quarter 2010.
Ex-TAC operating margins were 18%, which represents year-over-year expansion of 5 points, excluding last year's Search Alliance one-timer. And finally, we generated $0.17 earnings per diluted share, including a $0.02 noncash impairment charge I'll explain more fully in a few moments. Excluding the impairment charge from current year and the nonrecurring Search Alliance in Zimbra items from prior year, EPS was up 23%.
Now let's break down our revenue performance in the 3 reporting categories you see in our press release.: Display, Search and other.
As I mentioned a few moments ago, Display revenue performed at the high-end of our guidance range for the first quarter, growing 10% year-over-year on an ex-TAC basis. Both our premium and nonpremium segments contributed with strong impression growth on relatively flat yield. From a geographic perspective, all three regions exceeded our expectations this quarter. We have good Display momentum around the globe.
Turning to Search. We ended first quarter down 19% year-over-year on an ex-TAC basis. The underlying dynamics of the decline were consistent with the guidance, 8 points related to Search Alliance WebShare and the remainder primarily driven by affiliates. More on that in a minute. First, let's dive into core Owned and Operated Search.
Although 0 and 0 RPS underperformed our original expectations, we were protected financially by the RPS guaranty for Yahoo! properties. With the guarantee, O and O RPS was flat globally versus last year. The guarantee extends for the next 4 quarters as well so we're comfortable with the financial floor we've established while Microsoft implements operational improvements in the joint marketplace. o and o cleary volume was also flat globally but the U.S. registered 6% year-over-year growth exceeding expectations. Although, we are still in the early stages of our answers not links strategy, innovations like the contextual Search initiatives, wow modules and QuickApps we launched late last year are tangible positive drivers of our improving volume performance.
Finally, with respect to Search, ex-TAC Affiliate revenue was in line with expectations for first quarter, but down 23% year-over-year as anticipated due to the loss of neighboring Korea and the impact of the Search Alliance's transition on the U.S. workplace.
Rounding up the top line for first quarter. Other revenue declined 10% as we've deliberately overhauled this category with divestitures and new partnerships. We believe our fees, listings and led businesses are now positioned for future growth and profitability.
Moving down the income statement. First quarter ex-TAC expense landed at $875 million, $30 million below guidance midpoint and 7% lower than prior year. The underrun versus guidance was primarily driven by hiring efficiencies and favorable stock-based compensation timing. We continued to focus on improving efficiency across the company to enable investment for revenue growth and margin expansion. Below operating income, our earnings and equity interests included a noncash impairment charge required under U.S. GAAP of $26 million or $0.02 EPS related to an investment held by Yahoo! Japan was fair value was determined to be less than its carrying value. Including the income statement discussion, our first quarter effective tax rate was 27%, slightly better than forecast as a result of timing. We continued to expect a structural rate in the low 30% range.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the first quarter at roughly $3.5 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $208 million for the quarter, up 45% from prior year. During 1Q, we repurchased a total of 8.4 million shares for $137 million or $16.35 per share. Capital expenditures were $168 million for first quarter, including approximately $60 million in construction of newer, more efficient data centers both in the U.S. and abroad. Data center construction should peak in second quarter, and therefore, we expect second half of 2011 CapEx to be lower than first half. Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Ali Baba.com was roughly $9.9 billion or a little less than $7.50 per share.
These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Ali Baba's privately held businesses.
Turning to second quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,075,000,000 to $1,125,000,000. Display revenue should accelerate versus first quarter while our Search and other segments should be flattish sequentially. Compared to prior year, this outlook includes roughly $35 million of Search Alliance revenue share and another $20 million related to broadband amortization and fee rates step down, as well as the HotJobs divestiture. Excluding these headwinds, as defined at last MACE Investor Day and our January 2011 earnings call, our ex-TAC revenue guidance midpoint would be up roughly 2% year-over-year. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $915 million to $935 million for second quarter, although 3% lower than prior year, ex-TAC expenses are growing sequentially as the result of annual wage increases, seasonal marketing spend and stock-based compensation timing. At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $175 million. Finally, our effective tax rate should be in the 30% to 33% range.
We'll provide a deeper dive on revenue, cost, margins and our balance sheet at our Investor Day next month. But for now, I'll turn the call back over to Carol."

I've already highlighted some of our great work in Q1, but let me hit a few more highlights. Yahoo!'s reach is huge and our user base continues to grow. ComScore now accounts 680 million users of Yahoo! branded properties around the world. We ranked number one in 8 categories worldwide and in the top 3 a cross 22 categories. Engagement on our media and Search properties is growing. No one else on the web and that kind of scale or reach when it comes to digital media.
In Q1, all 3 of our regions exceeded our expectations. APAC continued its audience leadership and exceptional growth. Even with leading audience range in most major records APAC markets, our user growth there continues to outpace the market and despite the loss of Naver, revenue ex-TAC in APAC grew 11% year-over-year, driven by great performance in premium ad sales. In EMEA, we're experiencing a real turnaround. Q1 represented EMEA's best growth quarter in recent memory, with revenue ex-TAC up 9% year-over-year. Display grew 16% over last year while audience reach in the 5 largest EU markets grew to an all-time high. Meanwhile, Maktoob continues to be a big win for Yahoo! in the Middle East. In fact, the new Yahoo! Maktoob front page has become the fifth-largest Yahoo! Homepage in the world. So we feel good about each of our regions. Engagement in our media properties is up, extending our lead as a premier digital media company and we're complement our entire network of media properties with great features and distribution through the four ohs: Video, mobile, social and local. Let me take hit each of these briefly. Our first, video. Video is seeing tremendous growth. Our media properties have invented and implemented a lot more video content which encourages user engagement and our original video products continued to draw a big crowd. With audience up 80% year-over-year and time spent has more than doubled. After just 4 quarters, our news trivia program, who knew, is the one online show with more than 5 million visitors spending 8 million minutes. And our biggest show in primetime in no time surpassed 500 million total streams in Q1, making it the most watched online show ever.
We continue to add new originals, too. We're now poducing more than 20 original video programs. Each of which is sponsored by a major advertisers. In fact, Yahoo! has 9 of the top 10 original video programs on the Web. So that's video, what about mobile? Apps and HTML5 experiences major focus for us this year. at mobile world Congress in February , we previewed live spend, an innovative publishing platform concept design for tablets. Publishers and advertisers alike were really loud and have expressed great interest in live stand which we plan to bring to market late this year. And we've introduced several other great new experiences on phones and tablets. My favorite is MARKETDASH, our newly designed app for Finance. Our Finance app for IOS has been known for a while, but I love the new iPad version, the data, content, elegant format and speed make MARKETDASH far better than anything else that's out there.
In social, we are deeply integrating social experiences across many Yahoo! sites, utilizing our own social technology, as well as leveraging our relationship with Facebook. Along with the Oscar win for Yahoo! and Chrysler, we got similar great results with our March madness coverage. Our attorney pickup game set records for registrations and helped to double sponsorship revenue. And finally, we are ramping up quickly in local. Our hyper local flip of the Yahoo! front Page is now live in 300 neighborhoods around the U.S., 10x what we had in Q4 and we're continuing to add more every day.
There are other main great points of progress in Q1, but I know you have questions, so I'm going to wrap up. As you come away from today, I hope you have a clear sense of our progress. We focused on extending our lead as a premier digital media company through great content experiences and the advanced platforms that help us rapidly create and monetize them. We continued to make headway on our plan to increase profitability and grow revenue. We are executing and innovating faster. We are implementing modern technology and expanding our media footprint. We are growing engagement and monetizing it. We continue to lead and to differentiate in Display and we're confident in the Search Alliance and the plan to increase RPS.
We'll talk to you all about this and more at our upcoming Investor Day, May 25th at the Fairmont in San Jose. We hope you can all come. Now let's open the call to questions. Operator?"

We are doing really well off a small number. But app format. We're working with the IAB to make sure we had new mobile ad format, industries interested in.

So when we went to Chrysler and pitched this road to the awards, they want a social component and they you're not going to run a big branding campaign necessarily on a social only company but the fact of the matter is they were thrilled that we tripled likes on their fan page because they were drawn into the story of Chrysler on Yahoo!, that told their friends. And so receiving more and more of this kind of things. They've got 1.6 billion ad impressions. That's what they're really looking for and they're looking for this viral event of also taking it out to people social graphs."

On today's call, we'll discuss Q1 progress and financial results, update you on the Search Alliance with Microsoft, share our financial highlights and outlook, and of course, take your questions. First, I want to update you all on how we're executing our strategic plan for returning Yahoo! to sustainable revenue and profit growth. We have a lot of proof points this quarter that highlights very tangible progress. 
Just take a hard look at some of the key stats.  Display revenue is growing in the mid-teens on an underlying basis. After a couple of years of overhauling listings and fees, other revenue is primed to come back into positive territory by year end. We're now shipping the new major tech platforms we've been working on in the past two years and engagement is growing. Yahoo!'s global users were up 13% in Q1, page views on our media properties were up 8% and minutes on those properties were up 17%. The operating momentum we've been building continues as we modernize our technology platform, driving engagements through enriched content, introducing well-received new products and leveraging innovations in digital advertising to boost display revenue growth. Overall, our turnaround is proceeding on schedule, and we are very confident Yahoo! is heading in the right direction.
With all that said, the Search marketplace is encountering some issues related to Microsoft adCenter technology. There is a clear plan to address that, and I'll touch on that more in a moment.
On the financials, we beat the midpoint of our guidance on the top and the bottom. While our GAAP revenue was down over 20%, this is not the story. Without the funky comparisons because of the Search Alliance and other non-comparable items, our revenue ex-TAC would have been flat. Remember that GAAP revenue reflects the impact of divestitures, fee step downs and the two biggies, the required accounting change related to the Search Alliance and of course, the Microsoft WebShare.
As you know, the required change in accounting from the Search Alliance hits our GAAP revenue especially hard, but, and this is very important, the accounting change has no impact on the bottom line.  To put it simply until all markets are transitioned, revenue ex-TAC will give you the clearest picture of our real business dynamics. In January, we explained that 2011 would be a year of major comparable revenue headwinds because of the items I mentioned a moment ago. And we said that comparisons will get cleaner going forward. That has not changed.
So let's move on and speak to three key elements of our strategy to extend Yahoo!'s lead as a premier digital media company: First, modernizing our technology; second, driving engagement; and third, innovating in digital advertising. So first on technology, we said two years ago that we had to modernize the technology platform that powers our site. Our content was not interactive, it was in silos and we were managing hundreds of sites running on this fare code basis. We've been talking about these investments every quarter, and the pay off is starting to become apparent. We now have 34 sites across the Americas, EMEA and APAC, live on a new global content platform. The pace of our rollout is accelerating with 31 of those sites coming online in just the last 3 months. And this year, we're on target to meet our goal of getting 135 total sites. That's 85 existing and 50 brand new sites on to our more modern, flexible platforms. By year end, we'll have Entertainment, Lifestyle, News and other sites rolled out in new markets and new languages, some in places where Yahoo! had little or no presence before. That means more users, greater engagement and more ad inventory.
These platforms bring other great benefits as well, speed to deploying new sites and features, efficiency for our editors to manage more content, and most important, personalization. The platforms will enable tools like content optimization and search engine optimization to deliver on our vision of deeply personalized content for each user on every site. We expect that to drive engagement up.
Beyond the technology advances, we're doing even more to improve the user experience on our sites. We're driving engagement within increasingly personalized and richer content delivered to any device. Let me give you two great examples this quarter.  Namely the blockbuster events of the Super Bowl and the Oscars. Yahoo!  Always sees big traffic around major events, that's nothing new. What's new this year are the technology advances and editorial focus that allowed us to program these big events in ways that drove even more engagement. For example, using our content optimization engine, we showed different Super Bowl packages to many different audience segments during and after the game. Hardcore football fans got on the field news, other users got roundups of the buddiest [ph] (34:28) and still others saw broader interest stories. This simple, personalized programming drove more than 37 million clicks, double last year's numbers. That's huge.
At the Academy Awards, we did even more. We leveraged new ways of promoting the events across the Yahoo! network through the Homepage, Search, Mail and media properties. We developed custom videos focusing on buzz-worthy topics. And for the first time in our Entertainment sites, Yahoo! broke realtime stories during the show that generated huge clicks.
My favorite part of our Oscar programming were the two new social games, Winner Pick 'Em and Red Carpet Bracket that allowed users to select the winners. A whopping 49% of users who visited these pages interacted with the Game and many shared their picks with friends. All of this created fantastic results. We generated 1.2 billion page views around the Oscars, a 23% jump over last year. Those are impressive numbers, but even more so in a year when TV ratings for the awards fell yet again.
But I want to be very clear. Our focus is not just these major temporal events, our goal is to add more original voice and video to complement the scale of these mega-events and keep existing and new users coming back for more of what they find interesting everyday.
Like we do with our news blogs. Two years ago, there were no blogs anywhere on Yahoo! News. Now blogs like The Upshot, Weekend Edition and others are huge hits. In Q1 alone, our U.S. News blogs did more than 400 million page views. That's up more than 50% in three months. Three months ago, we were less than 200 million. We are up 50% in three months. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we intend to bring original voice to our media properties. This is just one example of how it really works.  And the engagement data is encouraging. According to comScore, minutes on our global media sites were up 17% year-over-year in Q1. Meanwhile, our internal data shows page views on our global media sites up 8%. 
Now let's talk about monetization. Of course, the best way to drive revenue is to deepen user engagement, so we have more ads to sell and we are doing just that. The new features on our Display ad platforms also drove our Q1 results. For example, new features and apps continue to improve the efficiency and yield of trafficking and managing premium Display campaigns. And we've made huge improvements in our ad inventory prediction tools in both apps and light media, increasing the accuracy of forecasts and campaign delivery. These improvements translate directly into higher ROI for our advertisers.
We're also selling ad packages and solutions that make use of the whole Yahoo! network. I talked about the Oscars content earlier. On the ad side, we worked closely with Chrysler on a unique sponsorship of our awards coverage this year, including the Oscars, the Grammys and the Globes. This broad and deep campaign called The Road to the Award Shows, leveraged rich original voice, social content and ads across the network. And it generated huge results for Chrysler. We deliver 1.6 billion ad impressions and saw a big uptick in related car shopping activities on Yahoo!. The pull through on the social element was especially cool. Chrysler tripled the number of Likes on its fan page.
No one else can deliver what Yahoo! did. Sponsorships like these are extremely successful because Yahoo! is taking ad solution selling to the new levels, finding the specific audiences our advertisers seek wherever they are on Yahoo!, on and off. All these examples of advances in technology, programming and ad products are indicative of the accelerating pace of innovation at Yahoo!.
I've a lot more I'd like to share, but I know you want to get to the numbers, so let's do that first. To put it simply, we delivered in Q1, beating the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Our Display business was strong everywhere, and we expect Display revenue ex-TAC to grow in the mid-teens in Q2. We are growing ad supply and accelerating the pace of new ad products and it's clear that our new ad platforms are letting us monetize better. For Search, Q1 was a mixed bag. Let's focus first on the performance for the Search Alliance.
The good news is that many of our most important advertisers are realizing much higher ROI on their campaign in the combined marketplace. We see major financial, auto, retail and temporal customers spending multiples of what they spent with Yahoo! and Microsoft previously because returns have been great.  And some recent third-party reports have reinforced why we did the alliance in the first place. Advertisers' CPA and ROI in Yahoo! has improved dramatically. This is good news for advertisers as they seek an alternative for their online search marketing spend.
On the downside, however, adCenter isn't yet producing the RPS we hoped for and are confident as possible. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI, but technical limitations in the current adCenter platform mean the click volumes just isn't there yet. We had expected RPS to be neutral by midyear, it's now evident that it will take Microsoft longer to achieve that goal. We expect that to happen by year end. In the meantime, the RPS guarantee helps to protect our revenue and our view of the long-term potential of the marketplace remains unchanged.
We're working very close with Microsoft on this. They understand the issues and they're hard at work on systems architecture, science models and better features and functions in adCenter. They have an aggressive roadmap to bring those to the marketplace.
As Microsoft focuses on RPS improvement in the U.S., we're holding off on transitioning more paid search markets this year. We'll transition the remaining paid search markets once we believe the changes are in place to yield the right results for our advertisers. We are almost ready to begin the rest of the elbow transitions.
In the meantime, Yahoo! is focusing on our We Can Do in Search to create better and better user experiences and help our advertisers and publishers optimize their results. On the users side, our growing list of new Search experiences and our focus on providing users answers, not links, is helping us grow U.S. Search volume. This quarter, we launched Search Direct, which provides answers directly in the Search assist tray realtime as you type. We're making it incredibly easy for a user to scan, comprehend and quickly access the top results, without even having to navigate to a Search result page.
For Search advertisers, Yahoo! account management teams are expanding the work we're doing alongside many of our largest customers to help advertisers get the most out of their Search spend. They are hungry for clicks and conversion, so we're helping them implement better optimization techniques as advertisers see higher ROI from these efforts, this is also helping to grow their Search budgets with us. We have specific plans in place to scale those solutions to more advertisers in the coming months.
Finally, we're also working with our publisher partners to help them optimize their sites and realize more of the volume they are seeking. So obviously, there's a lot going on in Search.
Now let's come back to the quarter. As I said, revenue beat the midpoint of our guidance. On the profitability side, we're balancing investments and content in technology with increased efficiency. As we roll out new sites and get existing sites on to the new platforms, we're seeing the efficiency gains and faster rollout pace we knew was possible. And we're delivering on the bottom line at the same time. So let me turn it over to Tim to give you more details. Tim?"

Highlights of our first quarter performance include $1,064,000,000 ex-TAC revenue, $14 million above guidance midpoint; 10% year-over-year ex-TAC Display revenue growth at the high end of our guidance range. As I highlighted in January, our reported Display growth rate this quarter is muted by the first quarter 2010 benefit of transitioning our automotive customers back to accrual accounting. Excluding that adjustment from prior year, our Display business grew nearly 17% year-over-year. 
Returning to our highlights, our $190 million operating income was above the high end of our guidance range and 1% ahead of last year, but up 31% year-over-year, excluding the $43 million one-time Search Alliance reimbursement catch-up in the first quarter 2010.  Ex-TAC operating margins were 18%, which represents year-over-year expansion of 5 points, excluding last year's Search Alliance one-timer. And finally, we generated $0.17 earnings per diluted share, including a $0.02 noncash impairment charge I'll explain more fully in a few moments. Excluding the impairment charge from current year and the nonrecurring Search Alliance in Zimbra items from prior year, EPS was up 23%.
Now let's break down our revenue performance in the 3 reporting categories you see in our press release.: Display, Search and other.
As I mentioned a few moments ago, Display revenue performed at the high end of our guidance range for the first quarter, growing 10% year-over-year on an ex-TAC basis. Both our premium and non-premium segments contributed with strong impression growth on relatively flat yield. From a geographic perspective, all three regions exceeded our expectations this quarter. We have good Display momentum around the globe.
Turning to Search. We ended first quarter down 19% year-over-year on an ex-TAC basis. The underlying dynamics of the decline were consistent with guidance, 8 points related to Search Alliance WebShare and the remainder primarily driven by affiliates. More on that in a minute. 
First, let's dive into core Owned and Operated Search.  Although O and O RPS underperformed our original expectations, we were protected financially by the RPS guarantee for Yahoo! Properties. With the guarantee, O and O RPS was flat globally versus last year. The guarantee extends for the next 4 quarters as well so we're comfortable with the financial floor we've established while Microsoft implements operational improvements in the joint marketplace. O and O query volume was also flat globally, but the U.S. registered 6% year-over-year growth exceeding expectations. Although we're still in the early stages of our answers, not links strategy, innovations like the contextual Search initiatives, Wow modules and QuickApps we launched late last year are tangible positive drivers of our improving volume performance.  Finally, with respect to Search, ex-TAC Affiliate revenue was in line with expectations for first quarter, but down 23% year-over-year as anticipated due to the loss of Naver in Korea and the impact of the Search Alliance transition on the U.S. marketplace.
Rounding out the top line for first quarter, other revenue declined 10% as we've deliberately overhauled this category with divestitures and new partnerships. We believe our Fees, Listings and Leads businesses are now positioned for future growth and profitability.
Moving down the income statement. First quarter ex-TAC expense landed at $875 million, $30 million below guidance midpoint and 7% lower than prior year. The underrun versus guidance was primarily driven by hiring efficiencies and favorable stock-based compensation timing. We continued to focus on improving efficiency across the company to enable investment for revenue growth and margin expansion. Below operating income, our earnings and equity interests included a noncash impairment charge required under U.S. GAAP of $26 million or $0.02 EPS related to an investment held by Yahoo! Japan was fair value was determined to be less than its carrying value. Including the income statement discussion, our first quarter effective tax rate was 27%, slightly better than forecast as a result of timing. We continued to expect a structural rate in the low 30% range.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the first quarter at roughly $3.5 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $208 million for the quarter, up 45% from prior year. During 1Q, we repurchased a total of 8.4 million shares for $137 million or $16.35 per share. Capital expenditures were $168 million for first quarter, including approximately $60 million in construction of newer, more efficient data centers both in the U.S. and abroad. Data center construction should peak in second quarter, and therefore, we expect second half of 2011 CapEx to be lower than first half. Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was roughly $9.9 billion or a little less than $7.50 per share.  These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba's privately held businesses.
Turning to second quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,075,000,000 to $1,125,000,000. Display revenue should accelerate versus first quarter while our Search and other segments should be flattish sequentially. Compared to prior year, this outlook includes roughly $35 million of Search Alliance revenue share and another $20 million related to broadband amortization and fee rates step down, as well as the HotJobs divestiture. Excluding these headwinds, as defined at last May's Investor Day and our January 2011 earnings call, our ex-TAC revenue guidance midpoint would be up roughly 2% year-over-year. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $915 million to $935 million for second quarter. Although 3% lower than prior year, ex-TAC expenses are growing sequentially as a result of annual wage increases, seasonal marketing spend and stock-based compensation timing. At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $175 million. Finally, our effective tax rate should be in the 30% to 33% range.
We'll provide a deeper dive on revenue, cost, margins and our balance sheet at our Investor Day next month. But for now, I'll turn the call back over to Carol."

Yahoo!'s reach is huge and our user base continues to grow. comScore now accounts 680 million users of Yahoo! branded properties around the world. We",796,"Thanks, Tim. I've already highlighted some of our great work in Q1, but let me hit a few more highlights. Yahoo!'s reach is huge and our user base continues to grow. comScore now accounts 680 million users of Yahoo! branded properties around the world. We ranked number one in 8 categories worldwide and in the top 3 across 22 categories. Engagement on our Media and Search properties is growing. No one else on the web has that kind of scale or reach when it comes to digital media.
In Q1, all 3 of our regions exceeded our expectations. APAC continued its audience leadership and exceptional growth. Even with leading audience reach in most major APAC markets, our user growth there continues to outpace the market and despite the loss of Naver, revenue ex-TAC in APAC grew 11% year-over-year, driven by great performance in premium ad sales. In EMEA, we're experiencing a real turnaround. Q1 represented EMEA's best growth quarter in recent memory, with revenue ex-TAC up 9% year-over-year. Display grew 16% over last year while audience reach in the 5 largest EU markets grew to an all-time high. Meanwhile, Maktoob continues to be a big win for Yahoo! in the Middle East. In fact, the new Yahoo! Maktoob front page has become the fifth largest Yahoo! homepage in the world. So we feel good about each of our regions. Engagement in our media properties is up, extending our lead as a premier digital media company, and they're complementing our entire network of media properties with great features and distribution through the four Ohs : Video, mobile, social and local. Let me take hit each of these briefly. Our first, video. Video is seeing tremendous growth. Our media properties have ventured and implemented a lot more video content which encourages user engagement and our original video products continue to draw a big crowd. With audience up 80% year-over-year and time spent has more than doubled. After just 4 quarters, our news trivia program, Who Knew, is the one online show with more than 5 million visitors spending 8 million minutes. And our biggest show, Primetime in No Time, surpassed 500 million total streams in Q1, making it the most watched online show ever.
We continue to add new originals, too. We're now producing more than 20 original video programs, each of which is sponsored by major advertisers. In fact, Yahoo! has 9 of the top 10 original video programs on the Web. So that's video. What about mobile? Apps and HTML5 experiences for phone and tablets are a major focus for us this year. At the Mobile World Congress in February , we previewed Livestand, an innovative publishing platform concept design for tablets. Publishers and advertisers alike were really wowed and have expressed great interest in Livestand which we plan to bring to market late this year. And we've introduced several other great new experiences on phones and tablets. My favorite is MARKETDASH, our newly designed app for Finance. Our Finance app for iOS has been known for a while, but I love the new iPad version, the data, content, elegant format and speed make MARKETDASH far better than anything else that's out there.
In social, we are deeply integrating social experiences across many Yahoo! sites, utilizing our own social technology, as well as leveraging our relationship with Facebook. Along with the Oscar win for Yahoo! and Chrysler, we got similar great results with our March Madness coverage. Our Tourney [Tournament] Pick 'Em game set records for registrations and helped to double sponsorship revenue. And finally, we are ramping up quickly in local. Our hyper local flip of a Yahoo! front Page is now live in 300 neighborhoods around the U.S., ten times what we had in Q4 and we're continuing to add more every day.
There are other main great points of progress in Q1, but I know you have questions so I'm going to wrap up. As you come away from today, I hope you have a clear sense of our progress. We focused on extending our lead as a premier digital media company through great content experiences and the advanced platforms that help us rapidly create and monetize them. We continue to make headway on our plan to increase profitability and grow revenue. We are executing and innovating faster. We are implementing modern technology and expanding our media footprint. We are growing engagement and monetizing it. We continue to lead and to differentiate in Display and we're confident in the Search Alliance and the plan to increase RPS.
We'll talk to you all about this and more at our upcoming Investor Day, May 25th at the Fairmont in San Jose. We hope you can all come. Now let's open the call to questions. Operator?"

This is, as you all know, this a new disclosure for us. We've gone to the trouble of breaking things into the pieces that we believe most represent how you should be looking at the business and that most tangibly relate to our engagement efforts on the one hand and certainly, our Display growth as a related piece of that. That said, if you look at things, communications, the communities, I'd say is a little bit more than half of the page views. The caution there that I wanted to make sure you're aware of is and we've talked about this before, there's no real way to measure access to the communications and communities properties from mobile. So that's a whole big segment that's kind of gone uncounted here and makes it -- while we work through that issue, as an industry, makes it a number that maybe isn't quite as indicative as you'd want it to be. But I would say, again, that section is a little bit more than half and the vast majority of the rest of the media properties."

It was amazing to see the list of the advertisers that the group sold last week. I mean, seriously, it was roofing contractors, everything that you expect in a local marketplace. We can maybe focus a little bit more on that for you in May. When you ask about Facebook, yes. You know, what's interesting is  I think there's a little confusion among the analysts that companies want to social ad therefore, they're going to run over and they can only place a social ad in Facebook because they are the social company. When in fact, what companies are looking for is a place to do a great brand story, but they want to make sure it has a social component because these days, you're smart if you do that. So when we went to Chrysler and pitched this Road to the Awards, they wanted a social component and they -- you're not going to run a big branding campaign necessarily on a social-only company. But the fact of the matter is they were thrilled that we tripled Likes on their fan page because they were drawn into the story of Chrysler on Yahoo!, but told their friends.

First, I w",2117,"Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. On today's call, we'll discuss Q1 progress and financial results, update you on the Search Alliance with Microsoft, share our financial highlights and outlook, and of course, take your questions. First, I want to update you all on how we're executing our strategic plan for returning Yahoo! to sustainable revenue and profit growth. We have a lot of proof points this quarter that highlights very tangible progress. 
Just take a hard look at some of the key stats.  Display revenue is growing in the mid-teens on an underlying basis. After a couple of years of overhauling listings and fees, other revenue is primed to come back into positive territory by year end. We're now shipping the new major tech platforms we've been working on in the past two years and engagement is growing. Yahoo!'s global users were up 13% in Q1, page views on our media properties were up 8% and minutes on those properties were up 17%. The operating momentum we've been building continues as we modernize our technology platform, driving engagements through enriched content, introducing well-received new products and leveraging innovations in digital advertising to boost display revenue growth. Overall, our turnaround is proceeding on schedule, and we are very confident Yahoo! is heading in the right direction.
With all that said, the Search marketplace is encountering some issues related to Microsoft adCenter technology. There is a clear plan to address that, and I'll touch on that more in a moment.
On the financials, we beat the midpoint of our guidance on the top and the bottom. While our GAAP revenue was down over 20%, this is not the story. Without the funky comparisons because of the Search Alliance and other non-comparable items, our revenue ex-TAC would have been flat. Remember that GAAP revenue reflects the impact of divestitures, fee step downs and the two biggies, the required accounting change related to the Search Alliance and of course, the Microsoft rev share.
As you know, the required change in accounting from the Search Alliance hits our GAAP revenue especially hard, but, and this is very important, the accounting change has no impact on the bottom line.  To put it simply until all markets are transitioned, revenue ex-TAC will give you the clearest picture of our real business dynamics. In January, we explained that 2011 would be a year of major comparable revenue headwinds because of the items I mentioned a moment ago. And we said that comparisons will get cleaner going forward. That has not changed.
So let's move on and speak to three key elements of our strategy to extend Yahoo!'s lead as a premier digital media company: First, modernizing our technology; second, driving engagement; and third, innovating in digital advertising. So first on technology, we said two years ago that we had to modernize the technology platform that powers our site. Our content was not interactive, it was in silos and we were managing hundreds of sites running on this fare code basis. We've been talking about these investments every quarter, and the payoff is starting to become apparent. We now have 34 sites across the Americas, EMEA and APAC, live on a new global content platform. The pace of our rollout is accelerating with 31 of those sites coming online in just the last 3 months. And this year, we're on target to meet our goal of getting 135 total sites. That's 85 existing and 50 brand new sites on to our more modern, flexible platforms. By year end, we'll have Entertainment, Lifestyle News and other sites rolled out in new markets and new languages, some in places where Yahoo! had little or no presence before. That means more users, greater engagement and more ad inventory.
These platforms bring other great benefits as well, speed to deploying new sites and features, efficiency for our editors to manage more content, and most important, personalization. The platforms will enable tools like content optimization and search engine optimization to deliver on our vision of deeply personalized content for each user on every site. We expect that to drive engagement up.
Beyond the technology advances, we're doing even more to improve the user experience on our sites. We're driving engagement within increasingly personalized and richer content delivered to any device. Let me give you two great examples this quarter.  Namely the blockbuster events of the Super Bowl and the Oscars. Yahoo! always sees big traffic around major events, that's nothing new. What's new this year are the technology advances and editorial focus that allowed us to program these big events in ways that drove even more engagement. For example, using our content optimization engine, we showed different Super Bowl packages to many different audience segments during and after the game. Hardcore football fans got on the field news, other users got roundups of the buzziest ads and still others saw broader interest stories. This simple, personalized programming drove more than 37 million clicks, double last year's numbers. That's huge.
For the Academy Awards, we did even more. We leveraged new ways of promoting the events across the Yahoo! network through the Homepage, Search, Mail and media properties. We developed custom videos focusing on buzz-worthy topics. And for the first time in our Entertainment sites, Yahoo! broke realtime stories during a show that generated huge clicks.
My favorite part of our Oscar programming were the two new social games, Winner Pick 'Em and Red Carpet Bracket that allowed users to select the winners. A whopping 49% of users who visited these pages interacted with the Game and many shared their picks with friends. All of this created fantastic results. We generated 1.2 billion page views around the Oscars, a 23% jump over last year. Those are impressive numbers, but even more so in a year when TV ratings for the awards fell yet again.
But I want to be very clear. Our focus is not just these major temporal events, our goal is to add more original voice and video to complement the scale of these mega-events and keep existing and new users coming back for more of what they find interesting every day.
Like we do with our news blogs. Two years ago, there were no blogs anywhere on Yahoo! News. Now blogs like The Upshot, Weekend Edition and others are huge hits. In Q1 alone, our U.S. News blogs did more than 400 million page views. That's up more than 50% in three months. Three months ago, we were less than 200 million. We are up 50% in three months. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we intend to bring original voice to our media properties. This is just one example of how it really works.
And the engagement data is encouraging. According to comScore, minutes on our global media sites were up 17% year-over-year in Q1. Meanwhile, our internal data shows page views on our global media sites up 8%. Now let's talk about monetization. Of course, the best way to drive revenue is to deepen user engagement, so we have more ads to sell and we are doing just that. The new features on our Display ad platforms also drove our Q1 results. For example, new features in apps continue to improve the efficiency and yield of trafficking and managing premium Display campaign. And we've made huge improvements in our ad inventory prediction tools in both apps and light media, increasing the accuracy of forecasts and campaign delivery. These improvements translate directly into higher ROI for our advertisers.
We're also selling ad packages and solutions that make use of the whole Yahoo! network. I talked about the Oscars content earlier. On the ad side, we worked closely with Chrysler on our unique sponsorship of our awards coverage this year, including the Oscars, the Grammys and the Globe's. This broad and deep campaign called the road to the award shows, leveraged rich original voice, social content and ads across the network. And it generated huge results for Chrysler. We delivered 1.6 billion ad impressions and saw a big uptick in related car shopping activities on Yahoo!. The pull through on the social element was especially cool. Chrysler tripled the number of likes on its fan page.
No one else can deliver what Yahoo! did. Sponsorships like these are extremely successful because Yahoo! is taking ad solution selling to the new level, finding the specific audiences our advertisers seek wherever they are on Yahoo!, on and off. All these examples of advances in technology, programming and ad products are indicative of the exhilarating pace of innovation at Yahoo!.
I've a lot more I’d like to share, but I know you want to get to the numbers, so let's do that first. To put it simply, we delivered in Q1, beating the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Our Display business was strong everywhere and we expect Display revenue ex-TAC to grow in the midteens in Q2. We are growing ad supply and accelerating the pace of new ad products and it's clear that our new ad platforms are letting us monetize better. For Search, Q1 was a mixed bag. Let's focus first on the performance for the Search Alliance.
The good news is that many of our most important advertisers are realizing a much higher ROI on their campaign in the combined marketplace. We see major financial, auto, retail and customers spending multiples of what they spent with Yahoo! and Microsoft previously because returns have been great.
And some recent third-party reports have reinforced why we did the alliance in the first place. Advertisers CTA and ROI and Yahoo! has improved dramatically. This is good news for advertisers as they seek an alternative for their online search marketing spend.
On the downside, however, adCenter isn’t  yet producing the RPS we hoped for and are confident as possible. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI, but technical limitations in the current adCenter platform mean the click volumes just isn't there yet. We had expected RPS to be neutral by midyear, it's now evident that it will take Microsoft longer to achieve that goal. We expect that to happen by year-end. In the meantime, the RPS guaranty helps protect our revenue and our view of the long-term potential of the marketplace remains unchanged.
We are working very close with Microsoft on this. They understand the issues and they're hard at work on systems architecture, science models and better features and functions in adCenter. They have an aggressive roadmap to bring those to the marketplace.
As Microsoft focuses on RPS improvement in the U.S., we're holding off on transitioning more page search markets this year. We'll transition the remaining page search markets once we believe the changes are in place to yield the right results for our advertisers. We are almost ready to begin the rest of the elbow transition.
In the meantime, Yahoo! is focusing on our we can do in Search to create better and better user experiences, and help our advertisers and publishers optimize their results. On the user’s side, our growing list of new Search experiences and our focus on providing users answers, not links is helping us grow U.S. Search volume. This quarter, we launched Search Direct which provides answers directly in the Search assist tray realtime as you type. We are making it incredibly easy for the user to scan, comprehend and quickly access the top results, without even having to navigate to a Search result page.
For Search advertisers, Yahoo! account management teams are expanding the work we are doing alongside many of our largest customers to help advertisers get the most out of their Search spend. They are hungry for clicks and conversion, so we're helping them implement better optimization techniques as advertisers see higher ROI from these efforts, this is also helping to grow their Search budgets with us. We have specific plans in place to scale those solutions to more advertisers in the coming months.
Finally, we're also working with our publisher partners to help them optimize their sites and realize more of the volume they are seeking. So obviously, there's a lot going on in Search.
Now let's come back to the quarter. As I said, revenue beat the midpoint of our guidance. On the profitability side, we are balancing investments and content in technology with increased efficiency. As we roll out new sites and get existing sites onto the new platforms, we’re seeing the efficiency gains and faster rollout pace we knew was possible. And we're delivering on the bottom line at the same time. So let me turn it over to Tim to give you more details. Tim?"

Let's begin with our first quarter narrative and then progress to second quarter guidance. Highlights of our first quarter performance include $1,064,000,000 ex-TAC revenue, $14 million above guidance midpoint; 10% year-over-year ex-TAC Display revenue growth at the high end of our guidance range. As I highlighted in January, our reported Display growth rate this quarter is muted by the first quarter 2010 benefit of transitioning our automotive customers back to accrual accounting. Excluding that adjustment from prior year, our Display business grew nearly 17% year-over-year. Returning to our highlights, our $190 million operating income was above the high-end of our guidance range and 1% ahead of last year, but up 31% year-over-year, excluding the $43 million one-time Search Alliance reimbursement catch-up in first quarter 2010.
Ex-TAC operating margins were 18%, which represents year-over-year expansion of 5 points, excluding last year's Search Alliance one-timer. And finally, we generated $0.17 earnings per diluted share, including a $0.02 noncash impairment charge I'll explain more fully in a few moments. Excluding the impairment charge from current year and the nonrecurring Search Alliance in Zimbra items from prior year, EPS was up 23%.
Now let's break down our revenue performance in the 3 reporting categories you see in our press release: Display, Search and other.
As I mentioned a few moments ago, Display revenue performed at the high-end of our guidance range for the first quarter, growing 10% year-over-year on an ex-TAC basis. Both our premium and nonpremium segments contributed with strong impression growth on relatively flat yield. From a geographic perspective, all three regions exceeded our expectations this quarter. We have good Display momentum around the globe.
Turning to Search. We ended first quarter down 19% year-over-year on an ex-TAC basis. The underlying dynamics of the decline were consistent with guidance, 8 points related to Search Alliance WebShare and the remainder primarily driven by affiliates. More on that in a minute. First, let's dive into core Owned and Operated Search.
Although O&O RPS underperformed our original expectations, we were protected financially by the RPS guarantee for Yahoo! properties. With the guarantee, O&O RPS was flat globally versus last year. The guarantee extends for the next 4 quarters as well so we're comfortable with the financial floor we've established while Microsoft implements operational improvements in the joint marketplace. O&O Cleary volume was also flat globally but the U.S. registered 6% year-over-year growth exceeding expectations. Although, we are still in the early stages of our answers not links strategy, innovations like the contextual Search initiatives, wow modules and QuickApps we launched late last year are tangible positive drivers of our improving volume performance.
Finally, with respect to Search, ex-TAC Affiliate revenue was in line with expectations for first quarter, but down 23% year-over-year as anticipated due to the loss of neighboring Korea and the impact of the Search Alliance transition on the U.S. marketplace.
Rounding out the top line for first quarter. Other revenue declined 10% as we've deliberately overhauled this category with divestitures and new partnerships. We believe our fees, listings and leads businesses are now positioned for future growth and profitability.
Moving down the income statement. First quarter ex-TAC expense landed at $875 million, $30 million below guidance midpoint and 7% lower than prior year. The under-run versus guidance was primarily driven by hiring efficiencies and favorable stock-based compensation timing. We continued to focus on improving efficiency across the company to enable investment for revenue growth and margin expansion. Below operating income, our earnings and equity interests included a noncash impairment charge required under U.S. GAAP of $26 million or $0.02 EPS related to an investment held by Yahoo! Japan who’s fair value was determined to be less than its carrying value. Including the income statement discussion, our first quarter effective tax rate was 27%, slightly better than forecast as a result of timing. We continue to expect a structural rate in the low 30% range.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended first quarter at roughly $3.5 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $208 million for the quarter, up 45% from prior year. During 1Q, we repurchased a total of 8.4 million shares for $137 million or $16.35 per share. Capital expenditures were $168 million for first quarter, including approximately $60 million in construction of newer, more efficient data centers both in the U.S. and abroad. Data center construction should peak in second quarter, and therefore, we expect second half 2011 CapEx to be lower than first half. Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Ali Baba.com was roughly $9.9 billion or a little less than $7.50 per share.
These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Ali Baba's privately held businesses.
Turning to second quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,075,000,000 to $1,125,000,000. Display revenue should accelerate versus first quarter while our Search and other segments should be flattish sequentially. Compared to prior year, this outlook includes roughly $35 million of Search Alliance revenue share and another $20 million related to broadband amortization and fee rates step down, as well as the HotJobs divestiture. Excluding these headwinds, as defined at last MACE Investor Day and our January 2011 earnings call, our ex-TAC revenue guidance midpoint would be up roughly 2% year-over-year. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $915 million to $935 million for second quarter, although 3% lower than prior year, ex-TAC expenses are growing sequentially as the result of annual wage increases, seasonal marketing spend and stock-based compensation timing. At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $175 million. Finally, our effective tax rate should be in the 30% to 33% range.
We'll provide a deeper dive on revenue, cost, margins and our balance sheet at our Investor Day next month. But for now, I'll turn the call back over to Carol."

I've already highlighted some of our great work in Q1, but let me hit a few more highlights. Yahoo!'s reach is huge and our user base continues to grow. ComScore now accounts 680 million users of Yahoo! branded properties around the world. We ranked number one in 8 categories worldwide and in the top 3 a cross 22 categories. Engagement on our media and Search properties is growing. No one else on the web has that kind of scale or reach when it comes to digital media.
In Q1, all 3 of our regions exceeded our expectations. APAC continued its audience leadership and exceptional growth. Even with leading audience reach in most major records APAC markets, our user growth there continues to outpace the market and despite the loss of Naver, revenue ex-TAC in APAC grew 11% year-over-year, driven by great performance in premium ad sales. In EMEA, we're experiencing a real turnaround. Q1 represented EMEA's best growth quarter in recent memory, with revenue ex-TAC up 9% year-over-year. Display grew 16% over last year while audience reach in the 5 largest EU markets grew to an all-time high. Meanwhile, Maktoob continues to be a big win for Yahoo! in the Middle East. In fact, the new Yahoo! Maktoob front page has become the fifth-largest Yahoo! Homepage in the world. So we feel good about each of our regions. Engagement in our media properties is up, extending our lead as a premier digital media company and we're complementing our entire network of media properties with great features and distribution through the four O’s: Video, mobile, social and local. Let me take hit each of these briefly. First, video. Video is seeing tremendous growth. Our media properties have invented and implemented a lot more video content which encourages user engagement and our original video products continue to draw a big crowd. With audience up 80% year-over-year and time spent has more than doubled. After just 4 quarters, our news trivia program, who knew, is the number one online show with more than 5 million visitors spending 8 million minutes. And our biggest show, Primetime in No Time, surpassed 500 million total streams in Q1, making it the most watched online show ever.
We continue to add new originals, too. We're now producing more than 20 original video programs, each of which is sponsored by major advertisers. In fact, Yahoo! has 9 of the top 10 original video programs on the Web. So that's video. What about mobile? Apps and HTML5 experiences for phone and tablets are a major focus for us this year. At Mobile World Congress in February , we previewed Livestand, an innovative new publishing platform concept designed for tablets. Publishers and advertisers alike were really wowed and have expressed great interest in Livestand which we plan to bring to market late this year. And we've introduced several other great new experiences on phones and tablets. My favorite is MARKETDASH, our newly designed app for Finance. Our Finance app for iOS has been around for a while, but I love the new iPad version, the data, content, elegant format and speed make MARKETDASH far better than anything else that's out there.
In social, we are deeply integrating social experiences across many Yahoo! sites, utilizing our own social technology, as well as leveraging our relationship with Facebook. Along with the Oscar win for Yahoo! and Chrysler, we got similar great results with our March Madness coverage. Our Tourney [Tournament] Pick 'Em game set records for registrations and helped to double sponsorship revenue. And finally, we’re ramping up quickly in local. Our hyper local flip of a Yahoo! front page is now live in 300 neighborhoods around the U.S., ten times what we had in Q4 and we're continuing to add more every day.
There are other main great points of progress in Q1, but I know you have questions so I'm going to wrap up. As you come away from today, I hope you have a clear sense of our progress. We focused on extending our lead as a premier digital media company through great content experiences and the advanced platforms that help us rapidly create and monetize them. We continue to make headway on our plan to increase profitability and grow revenue. We’re executing and innovating faster. We’re implementing modern technology and expanding our media footprint. We’re growing engagement and monetizing it. We continue to lead and to differentiate in Display and we're confident in the Search Alliance and the plan to increase RPS.
We'll talk to you all about this and more at our upcoming Investor Day, May 25th at the Fairmont in San Jose. We hope you can all come. Now let's open the call to questions. Operator?"

But UGC [user-generated content] is that one area that I can unilaterally say, except to the point -- Okay, I will say this, except to the point that some UGC become so interesting that it appears on our front page because it's like the talking twins or something, that was a cute one.

What we focused on is it's twice as fast. It is literally twice as fast. It has great features. The way photos work, the way you bring in your social graph. So the general G&A or general whatever in May, we're working hard on not just saying, ""Oh, Mail is going mobile,"" we're working on a great Mail product. As far as the rest of the products are going, again, you guys really go up and look at MARKETDASH, but we're aiming for very modern new app-based HTML-5-based products. Think of the tablet as a reference port and then down and up from the there. So that the PC will get a modern look eventually. As far as ad platforms, it's still new. We are doing really well off a small number, but ad format. We're working with the IEB to make sure we have new mobile ad format the industries interested in. But there's not enough monetization there now to break it out."

In fact, one of their releases, which one was it?

It was amazing to see the list of the advertisers that the group sold last week. I mean, seriously, it was roofing contractors, everything that you expect in a local marketplace. We can maybe focus a little bit more on that for you in May. When you ask about Facebook, yes. You know, what's interesting is I think there's a little confusion among the analysts that companies want to social ad therefore, they're going to run over and they can only place a social ad in Facebook because they are the social company. When in fact, what companies are looking for is a place to do a great brand story, but they want to make sure it has a social component because these days, you're smart if you do that. So when we went to Chrysler and pitched this Road to the Awards, they wanted a social component and they -- you're not going to run a big branding campaign necessarily on a social-only company. But the fact of the matter is they were thrilled that we tripled Likes on their fan page because they were drawn into the story of Chrysler on Yahoo!, but told their friends. And so we’re seeing more and more of this kind of thing. They've got 1.6 billion ad impressions. That's what they're really looking for and they're looking for this viral event of also taking it out to people's social graphs."

On today's call, we'll discuss Q1 progress and financial results, update you on the Search Alliance with Microsoft, share our financial highlights and outlook, and of course, take your questions. First, I want to update you all on how we're executing our strategic plan for returning Yahoo! to sustainable revenue and profit growth. We have a lot of proof points this quarter that highlights very tangible progress. 
Just take a hard look at some of the key stats.  Display revenue is growing in the mid-teens on an underlying basis. After a couple of years of overhauling listings and fees, other revenue is primed to come back into positive territory by year end. We're now shipping the new major tech platforms we've been working on in the past two years and engagement is growing. Yahoo!'s global users were up 13% in Q1, page views on our media properties were up 8% and minutes on those properties were up 17%. The operating momentum we've been building continues as we modernize our technology platform, driving engagements through enriched content, introducing well-received new products and leveraging innovations in digital advertising to boost display revenue growth. Overall, our turnaround is proceeding on schedule, and we are very confident Yahoo! is heading in the right direction.
With all that said, the Search marketplace is encountering some issues related to Microsoft adCenter technology. There is a clear plan to address that, and I'll touch on that more in a moment.
On the financials, we beat the midpoint of our guidance on the top and the bottom. While our GAAP revenue was down over 20%, this is not the story. Without the funky comparisons because of the Search Alliance and other non-comparable items, our revenue ex-TAC would have been flat. Remember that GAAP revenue reflects the impact of divestitures, fee step downs and the two biggies, the required accounting change related to the Search Alliance and of course, the Microsoft rev share.
 
As you know, the required change in accounting from the Search Alliance hits our GAAP revenue especially hard, but, and this is very important, the accounting change has no impact on the bottom line.  To put it simply until all markets are transitioned, revenue ex-TAC will give you the clearest picture of our real business dynamics. In January, we explained that 2011 would be a year of major comparable revenue headwinds because of the items I mentioned a moment ago. And we said that comparisons will get cleaner going forward. That has not changed.
So let's move on and speak to three key elements of our strategy to extend Yahoo!'s lead as a premier digital media company: First, modernizing our technology; second, driving engagement; and third, innovating in digital advertising. So first on technology, we said two years ago that we had to modernize the technology platform that powers our site. Our content was not interactive, it was in silos and we were managing hundreds of sites running on this fare code basis. We've been talking about these investments every quarter, and the payoff  is starting to become apparent. We now have 34 sites across the Americas, EMEA and APAC, live on a new global content platform. The pace of our rollout is accelerating with 31 of those sites coming online in just the last 3 months. And this year, we're on target to meet our goal of getting 135 total sites. That's 85 existing and 50 brand new sites on to our more modern, flexible platforms. By year end, we'll have Entertainment, Lifestyle News and other sites rolled out in new markets and new languages, some in places where Yahoo! had little or no presence before. That means more users, greater engagement and more ad inventory.
These platforms bring other great benefits as well, speed to deploying new sites and features, efficiency for our editors to manage more content, and most important, personalization. The platforms will enable tools like content optimization and search engine optimization to deliver on our vision of deeply personalized content for each user on every site. We expect that to drive engagement up.
Beyond the technology advances, we're doing even more to improve the user experience on our sites. We're driving engagement within increasingly personalized and richer content delivered to any device. Let me give you two great examples this quarter.  Namely the blockbuster events of the Super Bowl and the Oscars. Yahoo!  always sees big traffic around major events, that's nothing new. What's new this year are the technology advances and editorial focus that allowed us to program these big events in ways that drove even more engagement. For example, using our content optimization engine, we showed different Super Bowl packages to many different audience segments during and after the game. Hardcore football fans got on the field news, other users got roundups of the buzziest ads  and still others saw broader interest stories. This simple, personalized programming drove more than 37 million clicks, double last year's numbers. That's huge.
 For the Academy Awards, we did even more. We leveraged new ways of promoting the events across the Yahoo! network through the Homepage, Search, Mail and media properties. We developed custom videos focusing on buzz-worthy topics. And for the first time in our Entertainment sites, Yahoo! broke realtime stories during a show that generated huge clicks.
My favorite part of our Oscar programming were the two new social games, Winner Pick 'Em and Red Carpet Bracket that allowed users to select the winners. A whopping 49% of users who visited these pages interacted with the Game and many shared their picks with friends. All of this created fantastic results. We generated 1.2 billion page views around the Oscars, a 23% jump over last year. Those are impressive numbers, but even more so in a year when TV ratings for the awards fell yet again.
But I want to be very clear. Our focus is not just these major temporal events, our goal is to add more original voice and video to complement the scale of these mega-events and keep existing and new users coming back for more of what they find interesting every day.
 
Like we do with our news blogs. Two years ago, there were no blogs anywhere on Yahoo! News. Now blogs like The Upshot, Weekend Edition and others are huge hits. In Q1 alone, our U.S. News blogs did more than 400 million page views. That's up more than 50% in three months. Three months ago, we were less than 200 million. We are up 50% in three months. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we intend to bring original voice to our media properties. This is just one example of how it really works.
 And the engagement data is encouraging. According to comScore, minutes on our global media sites were up 17% year-over-year in Q1. Meanwhile, our internal data shows page views on our global media sites up 8%.  Now let's talk about monetization. Of course, the best way to drive revenue is to deepen user engagement, so we have more ads to sell and we are doing just that. The new features on our Display ad platforms also drove our Q1 results. For example, new features in apps continue to improve the efficiency and yield of trafficking and managing premium Display campaign. And we've made huge improvements in our ad inventory prediction tools in both apps and light media, increasing the accuracy of forecasts and campaign delivery. These improvements translate directly into higher ROI for our advertisers.
We're also selling ad packages and solutions that make use of the whole Yahoo! network. I talked about the Oscars content earlier. On the ad side, we worked closely with Chrysler on our unique sponsorship of our awards coverage this year, including the Oscars, the Grammys and the Globe's. This broad and deep campaign called the road to the award shows, leveraged rich original voice, social content and ads across the network. And it generated huge results for Chrysler. We delivered 1.6 billion ad impressions and saw a big uptick in related car shopping activities on Yahoo!. The pull through on the social element was especially cool. Chrysler tripled the number of likes on its fan page.
No one else can deliver what Yahoo! did. Sponsorships like these are extremely successful because Yahoo! is taking ad solution selling to the new level, finding the specific audiences our advertisers seek wherever they are on Yahoo!, on and off. All these examples of advances in technology, programming and ad products are indicative of the exhilarating pace of innovation at Yahoo!.
I've a lot more I’d like to share, but I know you want to get to the numbers, so let's do that first. To put it simply, we delivered in Q1, beating the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Our Display business was strong everywhere and we expect Display revenue ex-TAC to grow in the midteens in Q2. We are growing ad supply and accelerating the pace of new ad products and it's clear that our new ad platforms are letting us monetize better. For Search, Q1 was a mixed bag. Let's focus first on the performance for the Search Alliance.
The good news is that many of our most important advertisers are realizing a much higher ROI on their campaign in the combined marketplace. We see major financial, auto, retail and  customers spending multiples of what they spent with Yahoo! and Microsoft previously because returns have been great.
 And some recent third-party reports have reinforced why we did the alliance in the first place. Advertisers CTA and ROI and Yahoo! has improved dramatically. This is good news for advertisers as they seek an alternative for their online search marketing spend.
On the downside, however, adCenter isn’t  yet producing the RPS we hoped for and are confident as possible. Advertisers are seeing strong ROI, but technical limitations in the current adCenter platform mean the click volumes just isn't there yet. We had expected RPS to be neutral by midyear, it's now evident that it will take Microsoft longer to achieve that goal. We expect that to happen by year-end.  In the meantime, the RPS guaranty helps  protect our revenue and our view of the long-term potential of the marketplace remains unchanged.
 We are working very close with Microsoft on this. They understand the issues and they're hard at work on systems architecture, science models and better features and functions in adCenter. They have an aggressive roadmap to bring those to the marketplace.
 
 As Microsoft focuses on RPS improvement in the U.S., we're holding off on transitioning more paid search markets this year. We'll transition the remaining paid search markets once we believe the changes are in place to yield the right results for our advertisers. We are almost ready to begin the rest of the elbow transition.
 
In the meantime, Yahoo! is focusing on our we can do in Search to create better and better user experiences, and help our advertisers and publishers optimize their results. On the user’s side, our growing list of new Search experiences and our focus on providing users answers, not links is helping us grow U.S. Search volume. This quarter, we launched Search Direct which provides answers directly in the Search assist tray realtime as you type. We are making it incredibly easy for the user to scan, comprehend and quickly access the top results, without even having to navigate to a Search result page.
For Search advertisers, Yahoo! account management teams are expanding the work we are doing alongside many of our largest customers to help advertisers get the most out of their Search spend. They are hungry for clicks and conversion, so we're helping them implement better optimization techniques as advertisers see higher ROI from these efforts, this is also helping to grow their Search budgets with us. We have specific plans in place to scale those solutions to more advertisers in the coming months.
Finally, we're also working with our publisher partners to help them optimize their sites and realize more of the volume they are seeking. So obviously, there's a lot going on in Search.
Now let's come back to the quarter. As I said, revenue beat the midpoint of our guidance. On the profitability side, we are balancing investments and content in technology with increased efficiency. As we roll out new sites and get existing sites onto  the new platforms, we’re seeing the efficiency gains and faster rollout pace we knew was possible. And we're delivering on the bottom line at the same time. So let me turn it over to Tim to give you more details. Tim?"

As I highlighted in January, our reported Display growth rate this quarter is muted by the first quarter 2010 benefit of transitioning our automotive customers back to accrual accounting. Excluding that adjustment from prior year, our Display business grew nearly 17% year-over-year.  Returning to our highlights, our $190 million operating income was above the high-end  of our guidance range and 1% ahead of last year, but up 31% year-over-year, excluding the $43 million one-time Search Alliance reimbursement catch-up in  first quarter 2010.
 Ex-TAC operating margins were 18%, which represents year-over-year expansion of 5 points, excluding last year's Search Alliance one-timer. And finally, we generated $0.17 earnings per diluted share, including a $0.02 noncash impairment charge I'll explain more fully in a few moments. Excluding the impairment charge from current year and the nonrecurring Search Alliance in Zimbra items from prior year, EPS was up 23%.
Now let's break down our revenue performance in the 3 reporting categories you see in our press release: Display, Search and other.
As I mentioned a few moments ago, Display revenue performed at the high-end  of our guidance range for the first quarter, growing 10% year-over-year on an ex-TAC basis. Both our premium and nonpremium segments contributed with strong impression growth on relatively flat yield. From a geographic perspective, all three regions exceeded our expectations this quarter. We have good Display momentum around the globe.
Turning to Search. We ended first quarter down 19% year-over-year on an ex-TAC basis. The underlying dynamics of the decline were consistent with guidance, 8 points related to Search Alliance WebShare and the remainder primarily driven by affiliates. More on that in a minute.  First, let's dive into core Owned and Operated Search.
 Although O&O  RPS underperformed our original expectations, we were protected financially by the RPS guarantee for Yahoo! properties. With the guarantee, O&O  RPS was flat globally versus last year. The guarantee extends for the next 4 quarters as well so we're comfortable with the financial floor we've established while Microsoft implements operational improvements in the joint marketplace. O&O Cleary  volume was also flat globally but the U.S. registered 6% year-over-year growth exceeding expectations. Although, we are still in the early stages of our answers not links strategy, innovations like the contextual Search initiatives, wow modules and QuickApps we launched late last year are tangible positive drivers of our improving volume performance.
 
 Finally, with respect to Search, ex-TAC Affiliate revenue was in line with expectations for first quarter, but down 23% year-over-year as anticipated due to the loss of neighboring  Korea and the impact of the Search Alliance transition on the U.S. marketplace.
Rounding out the top line for first quarter. Other revenue declined 10% as we've deliberately overhauled this category with divestitures and new partnerships. We believe our fees, listings and leads businesses are now positioned for future growth and profitability.
Moving down the income statement. First quarter ex-TAC expense landed at $875 million, $30 million below guidance midpoint and 7% lower than prior year. The under-run versus guidance was primarily driven by hiring efficiencies and favorable stock-based compensation timing. We continued to focus on improving efficiency across the company to enable investment for revenue growth and margin expansion. Below operating income, our earnings and equity interests included a noncash impairment charge required under U.S. GAAP of $26 million or $0.02 EPS related to an investment held by Yahoo! Japan whose fair value was determined to be less than its carrying value. Including the income statement discussion, our first quarter effective tax rate was 27%, slightly better than forecast as a result of timing. We continue to expect a structural rate in the low 30% range.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended  first quarter at roughly $3.5 billion. Cash flow from operating activities was $208 million for the quarter, up 45% from prior year. During 1Q, we repurchased a total of 8.4 million shares for $137 million or $16.35 per share. Capital expenditures were $168 million for first quarter, including approximately $60 million in construction of newer, more efficient data centers both in the U.S. and abroad. Data center construction should peak in second quarter, and therefore, we expect second half  2011 CapEx to be lower than first half. Finally, as of March 31, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Ali Baba.com was roughly $9.9 billion or a little less than $7.50 per share.
 These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Ali Baba's privately held businesses.
Turning to second quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,075,000,000 to $1,125,000,000. Display revenue should accelerate versus first quarter while our Search and other segments should be flattish sequentially. Compared to prior year, this outlook includes roughly $35 million of Search Alliance revenue share and another $20 million related to broadband amortization and fee rates step down, as well as the HotJobs divestiture. Excluding these headwinds, as defined at last MACE Investor Day and our January 2011 earnings call, our ex-TAC revenue guidance midpoint would be up roughly 2% year-over-year. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $915 million to $935 million for second quarter, although 3% lower than prior year, ex-TAC expenses are growing sequentially as the result of annual wage increases, seasonal marketing spend and stock-based compensation timing. At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $175 million. Finally, our effective tax rate should be in the 30% to 33% range.
We'll provide a deeper dive on revenue, cost, margins and our balance sheet at our Investor Day next month. But for now, I'll turn the call back over to Carol."

I've already highlighted some of our great work in Q1, but let me hit a few more highlights. Yahoo!'s reach is huge and our user base continues to grow. ComScore now accounts 680 million users of Yahoo! branded properties around the world. We ranked number one in 8 categories worldwide and in the top 3 a cross 22 categories. Engagement on our media and Search properties is growing. No one else on the web has that kind of scale or reach when it comes to digital media.
In Q1, all 3 of our regions exceeded our expectations. APAC continued its audience leadership and exceptional growth. Even with leading audience reach in most major records APAC markets, our user growth there continues to outpace the market and despite the loss of Naver, revenue ex-TAC in APAC grew 11% year-over-year, driven by great performance in premium ad sales. In EMEA, we're experiencing a real turnaround. Q1 represented EMEA's best growth quarter in recent memory, with revenue ex-TAC up 9% year-over-year. Display grew 16% over last year while audience reach in the 5 largest EU markets grew to an all-time high. Meanwhile, Maktoob continues to be a big win for Yahoo! in the Middle East. In fact, the new Yahoo! Maktoob front page has become the fifth-largest  Yahoo! Homepage in the world. So we feel good about each of our regions. Engagement in our media properties is up, extending our lead as a premier digital media company and we're complementing our entire network of media properties with great features and distribution through the four O’s:  Video, mobile, social and local. Let me take hit each of these briefly.  First, video. Video is seeing tremendous growth. Our media properties have invented and implemented a lot more video content which encourages user engagement and our original video products continue to draw a big crowd. With audience up 80% year-over-year and time spent has more than doubled. After just 4 quarters, our news trivia program, who knew, is the number one online show with more than 5 million visitors spending 8 million minutes. And our biggest show, Primetime in No Time, surpassed 500 million total streams in Q1, making it the most watched online show ever.
We continue to add new originals, too. We're now producing more than 20 original video programs, each of which is sponsored by major advertisers. In fact, Yahoo! has 9 of the top 10 original video programs on the Web. So that's video. What about mobile? Apps and HTML5 experiences for phone and tablets are a major focus for us this year. At  Mobile World Congress in February , we previewed Livestand, an innovative new publishing platform concept designed for tablets. Publishers and advertisers alike were really wowed and have expressed great interest in Livestand which we plan to bring to market late this year. And we've introduced several other great new experiences on phones and tablets. My favorite is MARKETDASH, our newly designed app for Finance. Our Finance app for iOS has been around for a while, but I love the new iPad version, the data, content, elegant format and speed make MARKETDASH far better than anything else that's out there.
In social, we are deeply integrating social experiences across many Yahoo! sites, utilizing our own social technology, as well as leveraging our relationship with Facebook. Along with the Oscar win for Yahoo! and Chrysler, we got similar great results with our March Madness coverage. Our Tourney [Tournament] Pick 'Em game set records for registrations and helped to double sponsorship revenue. And finally, we’re  ramping up quickly in local. Our hyper local flip of a Yahoo! front page is now live in 300 neighborhoods around the U.S., ten times what we had in Q4 and we're continuing to add more every day.
There are other main great points of progress in Q1, but I know you have questions so I'm going to wrap up. As you come away from today, I hope you have a clear sense of our progress. We focused on extending our lead as a premier digital media company through great content experiences and the advanced platforms that help us rapidly create and monetize them. We continue to make headway on our plan to increase profitability and grow revenue. We’re  executing and innovating faster. We’re  implementing modern technology and expanding our media footprint. We’re  growing engagement and monetizing it. We continue to lead and to differentiate in Display and we're confident in the Search Alliance and the plan to increase RPS.
We'll talk to you all about this and more at our upcoming Investor Day, May 25th at the Fairmont in San Jose. We hope you can all come. Now let's open the call to questions. Operator?"

I think the area that we wouldn't stand out is the fact that we could have some longer format videos, similar to partnerships, et cetera. But UGC [user-generated content] is that one area that I can unilaterally say, except to the point -- Okay, I will say this, except to the point that some UGC become so interesting that it appears on our front page because it's like the talking twins or something, that was a cute one. Then, of course, it will show up there because that's what everybody wants to see that day and be cool about around the watercooler. But there's huge advertiser interest in being connected with video snacks that users come to see every day in and out. Users love it. In fact, probably our biggest problem would be right now, as we know it, is it's pretty hard to find on our sites. And one of the things, as simple as it sounds, we're doing is just having our video be much more discoverable, and so therefore, the fan base can follow it much easier and develop new fans for the snacks."

This is, as you all know, this a new disclosure for us. We've gone to the trouble of breaking things into the pieces that we believe most represent how you should be looking at the business and that most tangibly relate to our engagement efforts on the one hand and certainly, our Display growth as a related piece of that. That said, if you look at things, communications, the communities, I'd say is a little bit more than half of the page views. The caution there that I wanted to make sure you're aware of is, and we've talked about this before, there's no real way to measure access to the communications and communities properties from mobile. So that's a whole big segment that's kind of gone uncounted here and makes it -- while we work through that issue, as an industry, makes it a number that maybe isn't quite as indicative as you'd want it to be. But I would say, again, that section is a little bit more than half and the vast majority of the rest of the media properties."

We were able to bring up a special site in Canada, the editors by themselves got huge engagements. In fact, freaky huge engagements.

It was amazing to see the list of the advertisers that the group sold last week. I mean, seriously, it was roofing contractors, everything that you expect in a local marketplace. We can maybe focus a little bit more on that for you in May. When you ask about Facebook, yes. You know, what's interesting is  I think there's a little confusion among the analysts that companies want to social ad therefore, they're going to run over and they can only place a social ad in Facebook because they are the social company. When in fact, what companies are looking for is a place to do a great brand story, but they want to make sure it has a social component because these days, you're smart if you do that. So when we went to Chrysler and pitched this Road to the Awards, they wanted a social component and they -- you're not going to run a big branding campaign necessarily on a social-only company. But the fact of the matter is they were thrilled that we tripled Likes on their fan page because they were drawn into the story of Chrysler on Yahoo!, but told their friends.

Our results in Q2 were a mix of good, encouraging, and at the same time, unsatisfactory. First was good. Expenses were well managed, profits were up and we bought back a lot of stock. We're making clear measurable progress in Search and we have continued to accelerate the launch of site and our new publishing platform. But we know 2 issues are top of mind for you after seeing today's announcement, we are we with Alipay and what happened to Display this quarter. So I'm going to just focus those upfront. Tim will then talk more about the results and I'll finish with an update on our Search Alliance and new publishing platform progress.
With regard to Alipay, we've been working on this negotiation continuously, in fact, daily. We're moving our direction that's consistent with what we told you at our May 25 Investor Day. We told you then the the parties have been working with 2 agreed-upon principles in mind. One, ensuring that intra-company relationship between Alipay and Taobao is structured to preserve the value between Taobao, and therefore, Alibaba Group. And 2, ensuring that Alibaba Group is a appropriately compensated for the value of Alipay.
We have made substantial progress on the definitive agreements. But until every word is finalized and every document is signed, we are simply not done. We'll continue to work in earnest on the definitive agreements in a manner that best serves the interest of our shareholders.
Now let's turn to what's unsatisfactory. Our overall ex-TAC revenue was at the low end of our guidance range. That was entirely due to U.S. Display, which should not perform the way we expected. Overall, Display revenue ex-TAC was up 5%. Display in EMEA was up 27%. And in APAC, it was up 20%. However, the Americas region was flat, with U.S. Display down unexpectedly. Obviously, I'm not happy about our U.S. Display performance.
Let me tell you what happened, why it happened and what we are going to do to fix the problem and reaccelerate Display growth. In the first half of Q2, Display revenue in the U.S. was pretty much consistent with our expectations. But as the quarter progress, we saw increasing softness, especially in June. Let me be clear what this was not. This was not about new competitive development. It was not about the economy, although the economy didn't help as we saw a softness in the CBG, auto and retail categories. Finally, it was not about engagement, which grew nicely in Q2 as you can see from the engagement metrics on our IR site. Rather, the root cause is the comprehensive changes we discussed with you at our Investor Day, changes to our U.S. sales leadership, which led to changes to our sales or structure, and then to changes in our salesforce. In May, we made a decision to reorganize the U.S. field organization and to move aggressively to position ourselves from our rapid Display growth in the future.
However, the combined short-term results with significant turnover in our field sales rank. That is the actual scene on the Street. Turnover accelerated as all these changes affected the sales organization. As with any reordered, we initiated some of the departures and some people chose to leave on their own. Frankly, however, we underestimated how much the changes would increase turnover, and hence, our ability to close premium Class 1 sales in the back half of Q2.
That in a nutshell is what happened and what drove it. Now what's the bigger picture? What did we see that led us even though, we were generating double-digit Display growth to make these major changes in our sales operations? As we said in Investor Day, we've been focused on taking our sales organization and client relationships to new levels. Over the past 8 months, we've gotten new Americas sales leadership from Ross Levinsohn, who you met at Investor Day; to Wayne Powers who joined us from Time Warner; and Mark Ellis, who joined more recently from AOL. They did exactly what you would expect good sales leader to do. They got close to the customer and closer to sales people in the field. They have been out on many, many client pitches which drove home to them the opportunity to reorient our relationship with advertisers and substantially change the way we sell.
With our massive user base, to Ross it was easy to fall back on pitching Yahoo!'s huge reach and scale. But selling on region scale alone leaves meaningful revenue opportunities on the table. We need a sales organization that can customize solutions and creative executions because this is what distinguishes Yahoo! from our competitors in Display. We think of it this way, the most differentiated way to say Display advertising and the way we want to sell is customize audience space and solution oriented across multiple devices. The fact is, that while the industry sells is evolving and we must evolve too. So where are we now?
First, we believe the field salesforce is moving in the right direction. We've hired a lot of new people and we see sales leaders and teams that believe in the opportunity and the changes we are making. Field sales is staff backup to where they were 6 months ago. However, many of these town execs are new to the roles and it will take time for them to get up to speed on their new books of business.
Second, we are investing in the growth of our overall U.S. salesforce and sales development teams. We will hire more sales people than we had before. We are increasing our coverage ratios for clients and agencies and growing categories like video and mobile. We're also investing in better tools and training. We're organizing our teams with a deeper industry focus. We are packaging our offerings differently and we are continuing to work on making ourselves easier to do business with.
Perhaps the most important signal we see is that this new approach to sales is beginning to prove itself. Where our new management and salespeople are making calls and deliver solutions oriented pitches, we are getting the orders. These changes are part of the evolution of our turnaround efforts. First, we had to get the strategy right and clearly define our vision as Yahoo! as the premier digital Media company. Next, we have to focus and get the scalable technology platforms in place, and then begin launching new, more dynamic sites. And now we are intensely focused on monetizing these sites with the right solutions for advertisers.
We believe the changes we are making will bear fruit later this year and into 2012. In the meantime, we expect it will take some time to ramp our new sales team and scale our training and packaging effort. And that's reflected in our Q3 guidance that has revenue flat with Q2. That also means we'll be below our 13% to 16% long-term Display growth target this year, but we are committed to getting back into that range next year.
Now let's get to the good news of the quarter. Search was better than we expected. Microsoft are helping to close the RPS gap and our innovative work with new front end user experiences are contributing to our Search results as well. I want to give you more color on this, but before I do, let me turn it over to Tim to review the quarter."
91800,137042524,142861,"Yahoo! Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Let's move right into a discussion of second quarter revenue dynamics before proceeding to the rest of our 2Q results and 3Q guidance. Display revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $467 million on an ex-TAC basis, coming in roug",1165,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Let's move right into a discussion of second quarter revenue dynamics before proceeding to the rest of our 2Q results and 3Q guidance. Display revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $467 million on an ex-TAC basis, coming in roughly $30 million below our expectations. As you heard earlier, both EMEA and APAC performed as expected with 20% or better Display growth versus last year. So I'll focus my comments on the shortfall in the Americas region and specifically in the U.S.
As Carol described, our U.S. sales force is under transition and we simply didn't have appropriate coverage to close 2Q as we'd originally planned. Our sell-through rate this quarter was the most tangible expression of that fact. By and large, ad supply wasn't an issue. That is, engagement on our major Media properties was essentially where we expected it to be. So we had add inventory available to sell at premium rates. However, without our sales force operating at full capacity, many of the ad units we would typically sell on a guaranteed or premium basis will instead run through the exchange as nonpremium inventory at far lower prices.
Our Homepage was a clear example of this dynamic. Due to the salesforce transition and turnover, we sold significantly fewer days as guaranteed placements in second quarter 2011 than we did in the prior year. Many of our Media properties experienced similar dynamics. Another way of viewing this same issue is by industry category. Lower revenue in 3 specific ad categories, consumer packaged goods, Autos and retail, accounted for 2/3 of the shortfall in U.S. Display revenue. Typically, we would have been able to sell some of that inventory intended for those customers to other premium advertisers as guaranteed placements. Although nonguaranteed upside provided a small offset, the revenue mix effect was very unfavorable.
Turning now to Search. Second quarter ex-TAC revenue landed at $371 million, roughly $15 million ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by O&O. Owned and Operated revenue was down 10% versus last year, including the Search Alliance revenue share, but up slightly without the revenue share. We continued to benefit from the Microsoft RPS guarantee in second quarter.
For affiliates, ex-TAC Search revenue was down 27% year-over-year as the result of the marketplace transition challenges I described on our April earnings call. However, we did see some Affiliate stabilization this quarter, which contributed to ex-TAC Search revenue exceeding our expectations.
With respect to operational Search metrics, our worldwide O&O query volume was down mid single digits versus last year and worldwide RPS was up mid-single digits. In the U.S. marketplace where we fully transitioned to Microsoft systems, query volume in RPS were both roughly flat, including the guarantee. However, operational RPS in the U.S. did show meaningful improvements sequentially as Carol will describe more in a few minutes.
Rounding out the top line, our other revenue category was $239 million ex-TAC for second quarter and performed in line with expectations. Although down 3% year-over-year, the category grew slightly, excluding the HotJobs divestiture.
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter ex-TAC expense landed at $885 million, $40 million below guidance midpoint and 7% lower than prior year. The underrun versus guidance was spread across the number of line items, led by workforce. There were, however, roughly $10 million in nonrecurring items that benefited second quarter results.
In terms of our primary profitability metrics, operating income of $191 million was up 9% versus prior year and exceeded our guidance midpoint by $16 million despite the revenue shortfall. Ex-TAC operating margins were roughly 18%, an expansion of 2 points versus second quarter 2010. And finally, EPS improved 18% year-over-year to $0.18 per diluted share.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at just under $3.3 billion. Cash flow from operating activities or CFOA were $331 million for the quarter and roughly $540 million year-to-date. First half '11 CFOA rose 10% versus first half 2010. During second quarter, we repurchased a total of 30 million shares for $472 million or an average of $15.63 per share. We had $1.6 billion remaining under our current authorization as of June 30.
Capital expenditures were $172 million for second quarter, including approximately $30 million in construction of more efficient data centers both in the U.S. and abroad. CapEx was slightly lower in the quarter than what we had previously communicated to you, as approximately $20 million of data center spending shifted from 2Q to 3Q. We continued to expect second half 2011 CapEx to be lower than first half.
Finally, as of June 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Ali Baba.com was roughly $9.1 billion or just over $7 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Ali Baba's privately held businesses.
Turning to third quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,050,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. Given the salesforce dynamics Carol and I described earlier, we expect Display revenue growth will again be in the mid-single-digit range year-over-year, while our Search and other segments should be down slightly on a sequential basis, in line with seasonality. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $915 million to $935 million for third quarter, down approximately 1% year-over-year, but up $40 million sequentially at the midpoint of the range. While disproportionate to our sequential revenue growth, $20 million of the increase represents key investments in our salesforce, content and products. The remaining $20 million sequential uptick breaks down roughly into 2 separate $10 million increments. The first relates to the one-time items I referenced a few minutes ago that won't repeat in 3Q. The second is related to our Search Alliance transition costs. We've now essentially used up the $150 million transition allowance from Microsoft, so the ongoing transition work will be reflected in our cost structure. Going forward, we plan to manage the transition cost within the parameters of our profitability goals.
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $150 million. While the short-term step backward in ex-TAC operating margin rate compared to second quarter, we believe the investments we are making in 3Q will enable us to deliver improved margin rates for fourth quarter and beyond.
Before closing, I'd also like to provide a quick update on our efforts to unlock the value of our investment in Yahoo! Japan. Over the last 6 months, we've explored a few different paths to achieve that objective, some have that ended and some have continued to evolve. Many of the structures we are pursuing are unique, so it's expected that some were proved unviable. Our focus is to find the right solution and that effort remains a top priority of ours. With that, I'll turn the call back to Carol."

As a reminder, we partnered with Microsoft in Search to improve our search performance, expand margins and focus our effort on what's most important to Yahoo!. We are behind in the RPS benefits from the combined marketplace, but our revenue is protected by the Microsoft RPS guarantee. Advertisers like the ROI of the new alliance. We've seen real improvements in algo Search quality and we began to stem the declines in Search marketshare. We are innovating on the front end of Search. And last, but not least, our operating income is benefiting by at least $15 million a quarter through this partnership. So what about RPS? As we discussed last quarter, RPS is below the expectations we have for the alliance due to technical limitations in Microsoft adCenter platform. The alliance has worked aggressively to implement a plan to address these issues. Working together, Microsoft and Yahoo! have uncovered and addressed several platform gaps and inefficiencies in the adCenter marketplace. With a lot of collaborative work and planning, Microsoft systematically launched many new capabilities throughout Q2, including improvements to campaign budgeting features and click prediction models.
These launches are improving the monetization of paid Search results and lifting RPS on both Yahoo! O&O and Affiliate sites. By the end of Q2, we've closed approximately 1/5 of the RPS GAAP that we measured in April, before the new platform initiatives were launched. Let's be clear about what that means. That does not mean that RPS was up 20%. It means that 1/5 of the RPS GAAP that existed in April has already been closed.
We are really pleased with our improvement. Additional initiatives to improve the adCenter platform have been identified and then are scheduled to launch throughout the year. And we believe we are on track to achieve RPS parity by the end of the year. Volume remains healthy in the combined marketplace and we continued to see solid ROI for advertisers and their Search campaign.
As we said before, the low CPA and high ROI we are generating is great news for advertisers. Let me also touch briefly on where we stand with future plans. The transition to our Algo Search to Microsoft systems is complete in 5 countries, including the U.S. and we plan to move the rest of the world markets this year. We plan to complete that transition of paid Search in India by the end of this year as well. And we hope to make significant progress on moving global paid Search in 2012. We will solidify our transition schedule as we see continued improvement in RPS and adCenter's global readiness.
We usually share other product updates and progress with you on these calls, but we did a lot of that on our Investor Day, so I won't go through all of them again today. However, I do want to share one important update on the progress of site launches on Yahoo!'s new publishing platform. Two years ago, if you remember, we started on a major project to build more flexible, scalable content platforms to manage our sites. We started launching on a new technology late last year and now have 67 sites operating on our new publishing platforms. In June alone, we brought up close to 20 entertainment and lifestyle sites.
This new technology allows flashier, more flexible site design, deeper personalization with our core personalization engine, better photo, blog and social integration, Search engine optimization, a single worldwide editorial toolset and a lot more. And we are on track to have 135 sites up on the platform by year-end.
Near the end of the quarter, we completed one of the most important transition, Yahoo! News in the U.S. This was a significant milestone as U.S. News is by far the largest, most complex site to launch on a new platform.
In conclusion, we made substantial progress transforming Yahoo! as we discussed with you on our Investor Day, but we'd like to be farther down the road than we are. As we look ahead, we know what we need to focus on, transforming Display, increasing Search RPS, launching sites on our new publishing platform and improving our capital structure. In addition, we're also very focused on preserving and unlocking the value of our Asian assets.
We believe we are on track to achieve our goal of revenue growth in 2012. Now let's get to your questions. Operator?"

So as Carol said in her script, we closed about 1/5 of the gap, we continued to see the trajectory improve, anticipate that that will continue to be the case with the new rollouts that Microsoft will do on adCenter throughout this year. We continue with our front end user experience to be able to optimize RPS also and some of the things that we can do just on the Search results page.

But fourth quarter, you get the disproportionate effect the other way. It's a great seasonal quarter on revenue. We will be investing in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter to make sure we take advantage of that, but revenues and margins are typically strong. So we would expect it bounce back significantly from 3Q to 4Q as we typically get. Looking into 2012, really, no news here any different than what I talked about on at Investor Day on May 25, which is, we will continue to endeavor to expand our margins.

I would say there's no category that you take off the table. I talked about a few different things at Investor Day, a traditional spin. We could do a cash sale if we have the right Use of Proceeds, but don't like use the proceeds being buyback. We talked about traditional stand, we talked about a tractor and some other tax efficient structures. So there's none of those 4 categories that you take off the table. What I'd say is some of the unique and creative structures we found after fully vetting them are not going to work, but some others are ongoing. So we'll just keep working that. On the categories, it was in my script where talked about 2/3, it wasn't about pricing. It caused a yield issue as you mixed from guaranteed to nonguaranteed. But it was a revenue. We had a revenue shortfall in certain CPG, auto and retail customers. And as I said, typically, you'd be able to take that inventory and sell it to other premium advertisers that want guaranteed placements without the salesforce capacity to do that, it therefore, fell into, so to speak, the exchange and when it runs through the exchange, it runs through at lower prices, that inventory. Again, not the same customers, different customers and different kinds of ads and lower pricing. And 3Q factor of the NFL, I'm a big NFL fan, I just hope they play. But no, we haven't gone and tried to factor in big macro or even slightly macro factors like that into the forecast. But what we've looked is our momentum across the board, where we are in bringing our salesforce up to speed. We look at seasonality, we look at pipelines and we factor that all in to this guidance."

We have essentially in the first half of this year almost totally rebuild our U.S. Media team, from the editorial staff to a better SCO, a better, more video programming. Of course, we have some big events in the quarter but as an example for instance, we really went after looking at, say, News and we're really working on what the Yahoo! Voice should be, how much original programming, meaning, breaking news and that sort of thing. And to give you an idea, in each month of Q2, News averaged 2.9 billion minutes a month, which is up 23% from Q2 of last year. And that's the kind of information with and I hope you guys have gone up to see News, it's nowhere near what it's eventually going to be. But it's a new look, it's exciting, much more creative, much more photo, slide shows and that sort of thing. We're going to focus, as we said at the Investor Day, in ANCHORS and tent poles, which means big events that we know how to sell and package ahead of time, and we know how to do network wide programming to enhance people's excitement and interest in it. Also, with the new platforms, the publishing platforms, we can actually do the kind of personalization on these types that we've only been able to do here before on the front page and one module in News. So we're very excited about that technology. Now your second question, yes, communications, products that are down for a couple reasons. One is, IMAP and what's happening with cell phones and how all of this is accounted. So we're really paying attention at this. Now a couple of good things. Our new News platform which has gone to general availability is progressing quite nicely -- I mean Mail, I said News. But we have new News too but in e-mail. People are spending more time on it because it's a much more interesting experience. It's 2x faster, it's much less spamming, if you'll say, easier-to-use, photos, all that sort of thing. So we're both trying to entice people to come in and spent time. And we're also looking at how to better monetize that experience. But yes, it's not a notice that people are changing the way they communicate. So we've got to change with that, and also, the kind of products and services that are modern and interesting to users."

That is the same way if you look at what's happening, especially with the top 3 in the Display side of the business. It's not just against some customers want to go it down a very social experience. If you think of Yahoo!, you're still thinking of 9 number 1 properties in the U.S., 9 number 1 properties worldwide, top 3 in 23 categories, we have a very different proposition for the advertisers. And with the increased video, both for the users Entertainment, but also for the advertisers to tell their story much like it's a commercial, I mean I don't know how much time they are spending up there, but it's much more of a commercial experience now and users are watching those. And because it's not than on concept to them and it's not an odd concept to the advertisers.

Our results in Q2 were a mix of good, encouraging, and at the same time, unsatisfactory. First was good. Expenses were well managed, profits were up and we bought back a lot of stock. We're making clear measurable progress in Search, and we have continued to accelerate the launch of sites on our new publishing platform. But we know 2 issues are top of mind for you after seeing today's announcement: where are we with Alipay and what happened to Display this quarter. 
So I'm going to address both of those upfront. Tim will then talk more about the results, and I'll finish with an update on our Search Alliance and new publishing platform progress.
With regard to Alipay, we've been working on this negotiation continuously, in fact, daily. We're moving our direction that's consistent with what we told you at our May 25 Investor Day. We told you then that the parties have been working with 2 agreed-upon principles in mind. One, ensuring that intra-company relationship between Alipay and Taobao is structured to preserve the value within Taobao and therefore, Alibaba Group. And two, ensuring that Alibaba Group is appropriately compensated for the value of Alipay.
We have made substantial progress on the definitive agreements. But until every word is finalized and every document is signed, we're simply not done. We'll continue to work in earnest on the definitive agreements in a manner that best serves the interest of our shareholders.
Now let's turn to what's unsatisfactory. Our overall ex-TAC revenue was at the low end of our guidance range. That was entirely due to U.S. Display, which did not perform the way we expected. Overall, Display revenue ex-TAC was up 5%. Display in EMEA was up 27%, and in APAC, it was up 20%. However, the Americas region was flat, with U.S. Display down unexpectedly. Obviously, I'm not happy about our U.S. Display performance. Let me tell you what happened, why it happened and what we're going to do to fix the problem and reaccelerate Display growth. 
In the first half of Q2, Display revenue in the U.S. was pretty much consistent with our expectations. But as the quarter progress, we saw increasing softness, especially in June. Let me be clear what this was not. Business was not about new competitive developments. It was not about the economy, although the economy didn't help as we saw softness in the CPG, auto and retail categories. 
Finally, it was not about engagement, which grew nicely in Q2 as you can see from the engagement metrics on our IR site. Rather, the root cause is the comprehensive changes we discussed with you at our Investor Day, changes to our U.S. sales leadership, which led to changes to our sales org structure, and then to changes in our sales force. In May, we made a decision to reorganize the U.S. field organization and to move aggressively to position ourselves from our rapid Display growth in the future.
However, the combined short-term results was significant turnover in our field sales rank. That is the actual feet on the street. Turnover accelerated as all these changes affected the sales organization. As with any reorg, we initiated some of the departures and some people chose to leave on their own. Frankly, however, we underestimated how much the changes would increase turnover, and hence, our ability to close the premium Class I sales in the back half of Q2.
That, in a nutshell, is what happened and what drove it. Now what's the bigger picture? What did we see that led us, even though we were generating double-digit Display growth, to make these major changes in our sales operations? 
As we said in Investor Day, we've been focused on taking our sales organization and client relationships to new levels. Over the past 8 months, we brought in new Americas sales leadership, from Ross Levinsohn, who you met at Investor Day; to Wayne Powers, who joined us from Time Warner; and Mark Ellis, who joined more recently from AOL. They did exactly what you would expect good sales leaders to do. They got close to the customer and closer to sales people in the field. They have been out on many, many client pitches, which drove home to them the opportunity to reorient our relationship with advertisers and substantially change the way we sell.
With our massive user base, too often it was easy to fall back on pitching Yahoo!'s huge reach and scale. But selling on reach and scale alone leaves meaningful revenue opportunities on the table. We need a sales organization that can customize solutions and creative executions because this is what distinguishes Yahoo! from our competitors in Display. 
We think of it this way. The most differentiated way to sell Display advertising and the way we want to sell is customize audience space and solution oriented across multiple devices. The fact is the way that industry sells is evolving, and we must evolve too. So where are we now?
First, we believe the field sales force is moving in the right direction. We've hired a lot of new people, and we see sales leaders and teams that believe in the opportunity and the changes we're making. Field sales is staff backup to where they were 6 months ago. However, many of the current execs are new to the roles, and it will take time for them to get up to speed on their new books of business.
Second, we're investing in the growth of our overall U.S. sales force and sales development teams. We will hire more salespeople than we had before. We're increasing our coverage ratios for clients and agencies and growing categories like video and mobile. 
We're also investing in better tools and training. We're organizing our teams with a deeper industry focus. We're packaging our offerings differently, and we're continuing to work on making ourselves easier to do business with.
Perhaps the most important signal we see is that this new approach to sales is beginning to prove itself. Where our new management and salespeople are making calls and deliver solutions-oriented pitches, we are getting new orders. These changes are part of the evolution of our turnaround efforts. First, we had to get the strategy right and clearly define our vision as Yahoo! as the premier digital media company. Next, we have to focus and get the scalable technology platforms in place, and then begin launching new, more dynamic sites. And now we're intensely focused on monetizing those sites with the right solutions for advertisers.
We believe the changes we're making will bear fruit later this year and into 2012. In the meantime, we expect it will take some time to ramp our new sales team and scale our training and packaging efforts. And that's reflected in our Q3 guidance that has revenue flat with Q2. That also means we'll be below our 13% to 16% long-term Display growth target this year, but we are committed to getting back into that range next year.
Now let's get to the good news of the quarter. Search was better than we expected. Microsoft adCenter launches are helping to close the RPS gap, and our innovative work with new front-end user experiences are contributing to our Search results as well. I want to give you more color on this, but before I do, let me turn it over to Tim to review the quarter."
91800,137042524,142982,"Yahoo! Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Let's move right into a discussion of second quarter revenue dynamics before proceeding to the rest of our 2Q results and 3Q guidance. Display revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $467 million on an ex-TAC basis, coming in ro",1167,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Let's move right into a discussion of second quarter revenue dynamics before proceeding to the rest of our 2Q results and 3Q guidance. 
Display revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $467 million on an ex-TAC basis, coming in roughly $30 million below our expectations. As you heard earlier, both EMEA and APAC performed as expected with 20% or better Display growth versus last year. So I'll focus my comments on the shortfall in the Americas region and specifically in the U.S.
As Carol described, our U.S. sales force is under transition, and we simply didn't have appropriate coverage to close 2Q as we'd originally planned. Our sell-through rate this quarter was the most tangible expression of that fact. By and large, ad supply wasn't an issue. That is, engagement on our major media properties was essentially where we expected it to be. So we had ad inventory available to sell at premium rates. However, without our sales force operating at full capacity, many of the ad units we would typically sell on a guaranteed or premium basis were instead run through exchange as nonpremium inventory at far lower prices.
Our Homepage was a clear example of this dynamic. Due to the sales force transition and turnover, we sold significantly fewer days as guaranteed placements in second quarter 2011 than we did in the prior year. Many of our media properties experienced similar dynamics. 
Another way of viewing the same issue is by industry category. Lower revenue in 3 specific ad categories, consumer packaged goods, autos and retail, accounted for 2/3 of the shortfall in U.S. Display revenue. Typically, we would have been able to sell some of that inventory intended for those customers to other premium advertisers as guaranteed placements. Although non-guaranteed upside provided a small offset, the revenue mix effect was very unfavorable.
Turning now to Search. Second quarter ex-TAC revenue landed at $371 million, roughly $15 million ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by O&O. Owned and Operated revenue was down 10% versus last year, including the Search Alliance revenue share, but up slightly without the revenue share. We continued to benefit from the Microsoft RPS guarantee in the second quarter.
For affiliates, ex-TAC Search revenue was down 27% year-over-year as a result of the marketplace transition challenges I described on our April earnings call. However, we did see some Affiliate stabilization this quarter, which contributed to ex-TAC Search revenue exceeding our expectations.
With respect to operational Search metrics, our worldwide O&O query volume was down mid single digits versus last year, and worldwide RPS was up mid single digits. In the U.S. marketplace where we fully transitioned to Microsoft systems, query volume in RPS were both roughly flat, including the guarantee. However, operational RPS in the U.S. did show meaningful improvements sequentially as Carol will describe more in a few minutes.
Rounding out the top line, our other revenue category was $239 million ex-TAC for second quarter and performed in line with expectations. Although down 3% year-over-year, the category grew slightly, excluding the HotJobs divestiture.
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter ex-TAC expense landed at $885 million, $40 million below guidance midpoint and 7% lower than prior year. The underrun versus guidance was spread across a number of line items led by workforce. There were, however, roughly $10 million in nonrecurring items that benefited second quarter results.
In terms of our primary profitability metrics, operating income of $191 million was up 9% versus prior year and exceeded our guidance midpoint by $16 million despite the revenue shortfall. Ex-TAC operating margins were roughly 18%, an expansion of 2 points versus second quarter 2010. And finally, EPS improved 18% year-over-year to $0.18 per diluted share.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at just under $3.3 billion. Cash flow from operating activities, or CFOA, was $331 million for the quarter and roughly $540 million year-to-date. First half 2011 CFOA rose 10% versus first half 2010. During the second quarter, we repurchased a total of 30 million shares for $472 million or an average of $15.63 per share. We had $1.6 billion remaining under our current authorization as of June 30.
Capital expenditures were $172 million for second quarter, including approximately $30 million in construction of more efficient data centers both in the U.S. and abroad. CapEx was slightly lower in the quarter than what we had previously communicated to you as approximately $20 million of data center spending shifted from 2Q to 3Q. We continue to expect second half 2011 CapEx to be lower than first half.
Finally, as of June 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was roughly $9.1 billion or just over $7 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba's privately held businesses.
Turning to third quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,050,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. Given the sales force dynamics Carol and I described earlier, we expect Display revenue growth will again be in the mid single-digit range year-over-year, while our Search and other segments should be down slightly on a sequential basis in line with seasonality. 
For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $915 million to $935 million for third quarter, down approximately 1% year-over-year, but up $40 million sequentially at the midpoint of the range. While disproportionate to our sequential revenue growth, $20 million of the increase represents key investments in our sales force, content and products. The remaining $20 million sequential uptick breaks down roughly into 2 separate $10 million increments. The first relates to the one-time items I referenced a few minutes ago that won't repeat in 3Q. The second is related to our Search Alliance transition costs. We've now essentially used up the $150 million transition allowance from Microsoft, so the ongoing transition work will be reflected in our cost structure. Going forward, we plan to manage that transition cost within the parameters of our profitability goals.
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $150 million. While the short term step backward in ex-TAC operating margin rate compared to second quarter, we believe the investments we're making in 3Q will enable us to deliver improved margin rates for fourth quarter and beyond.
Before closing, I'd also like to provide a quick update on our efforts to unlock the value of our investment in Yahoo! Japan. Over the last 6 months, we've explored few different paths to achieve that objective, some have dead ended and some have continued to evolve. Many of the structures we're pursuing are unique, so it's expected that some will proved unviable. Our focus is to find the right solution and that effort remains a top priority of ours. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Carol."

I know this is an area you are all watching closely. As a reminder, we partnered with Microsoft in Search to improve our search performance, expand margins and focus our effort on what's most important to Yahoo!. We're behind in the RP",743,"Now back to Search. I know this is an area you are all watching closely. As a reminder, we partnered with Microsoft in Search to improve our search performance, expand margins and focus our effort on what's most important to Yahoo!. We're behind in the RPS benefits from the combined marketplace, but our revenue is protected by the Microsoft RPS guarantee. 
Advertisers like the ROI of the new alliance. We've seen real improvements in algo Search quality, and we began to stem the declines in Search market share. We're innovating on the front end of Search. And last but not least, our operating income is benefiting by at least $50 million a quarter through this partnership. 
So what about RPS? As we discussed last quarter, RPS is below the expectations we have for the alliance due to technical limitations in Microsoft's adCenter platform. The alliance has worked aggressively to implement a plan to address these issues. Working together, Microsoft and Yahoo! have uncovered and addressed several platform gaps and inefficiencies in the adCenter marketplace. With a lot of collaborative work and planning, Microsoft systematically launched many new capabilities throughout Q2, including improvements to campaign budgeting features and click prediction models.
These launches are improving the monetization of paid search results and lifting RPS on both Yahoo! O&O and Affiliate sites. By the end of Q2, we've closed approximately 1/5 of the RPS gap that we measured in April before the new platform initiatives were launched. Let's be clear about what that means. That does not mean that RPS was up 20%. It means that 1/5 of the RPS gap that existed in April has already been closed.
We're really pleased with our improvement. Additional initiatives to improve the adCenter platform have been identified, and hence, are scheduled to launch throughout the year. And we believe we're on track to achieve RPS parity by the end of the year. Volume remains healthy in the combined marketplace, and we continue to see solid ROI for advertisers and their search campaign. As we said before, the low CPA and high ROI we're generating is great news for advertisers. 
Let me also touch briefly on where we stand with future plans. The transition to our algo Search to Microsoft system is complete in 5 countries, including the U.S., and we plan to move the rest of the world markets this year. We plan to complete that transition of paid Search in India by the end of this year as well, and we hope to make significant progress on moving global paid Search in 2012. We will solidify our transition schedule as we see continued improvements in RPS and adCenter's global readiness.
We usually share other product updates and progress with you on these calls, but we did a lot of that on our Investor Day, so I won't go through all of them again today. However, I do want to share one important update on the progress of site launches on Yahoo!'s new publishing platform. 
Two years ago, if you remember, we started on a major project to build more flexible, scalable content platforms to manage our sites. We started launching on the new technology late last year and now have 67 sites operating on our new publishing platforms. In June alone, we brought up close to 20 entertainment and lifestyle sites.
This new technology allows fresher, more flexible site design, deeper personalization with our core personalization engine, better photo, blog and social integration, search engine optimization, a single worldwide editorial toolset and a lot more. And we're on track to have 135 sites up on the platform by year end.
Near the end of the quarter, we completed one of the most important transition, Yahoo! News in the U.S. This was a significant milestone as U.S. News is by far the largest, most complex site to launch on the new platform.
In conclusion, we made substantial progress transforming Yahoo! as we discussed with you on our Investor Day, but we'd like to be farther down the road than we are. As we look ahead, we know what we need to focus on: transforming Display, increasing Search RPS, launching sites on our new publishing platform and improving our capital structure. In addition, we're also very focused on preserving and unlocking the value of our Asian assets. We believe we're on track to achieve our goal of revenue growth in 2012.

In fact, they don't look overly aggressive, and I'm not trying to sneak a comment in here. They just look like it's something we can do. And our scientists and technical people are working closely with them and believe it as well. Now by the way, that doesn't make me happy because the alliance predicted we'd be plus 6% to 8% by now, which is where we'd like to be. So just struggling back to get to parity kind of chews me out.

And as I said, typically, you'd be able to take that inventory and sell it to other premium advertisers that want guaranteed placements. Without the sales force capacity to do that, it therefore fell into, so to speak, the exchange. And when it runs through the exchange, it runs through at lower prices, that inventory.

We have, essentially in the first half of this year, almost totally rebuild our U.S. media team, from the editorial staff to better SEO, better -- more video programming. Of course, we have some big events in the quarter. But as an example, for instance, we really went after looking at, say, News and we're really working on what the Yahoo! Voice should be, how much original programming, meaning, breaking news and that sort of thing. And to give you an idea, in each month of Q2, News averaged 2.9 billion minutes a month, which is up 23% from Q2 of last year. And that's the kind of information with and I hope you guys have gone up to see News. It's nowhere near where it's eventually going to be. But it's a new look, it's exciting, much more creative, much more photo, slide shows and that sort of things. We're going to focus, as we said at the Investor Day, in anchors and tent poles, which means big events that we know how to sell and package ahead of time and we know how to do network-wide programming to enhance people's excitement and interest in it. Also, with the new platforms, the publishing platforms, we can actually do the kind of personalization on these types that we've only been able to do here before on the front page and in one module in News. So we're very excited about that technology. Now your second question. Yes, communications products are down for a couple of reasons. One is IMAP and what's happening with cell phones and how all of this is accounted. So we're really paying attention to this. Now a couple of good things. Our new News platform, which has gone to general availability, is progressing quite nicely -- I mean, Mail. I'm sorry, I said News. Well, we have new News too, but in Mail. People are spending more time on it because it's a much more interesting experience. It's 2x faster; it's much less spamming, if you'll say; easier-to-use; photos, all that sort of thing. So we're both trying to entice people to come and spend time. And we're also looking at how to better monetize that experience. But yes, it's not unnoticed that people are changing the way they communicate. So we've got to change with that and also the kind of products and services that are modern and interesting to users."

That is the same way if you look at what's happening especially with the top 3 in the Display side of the business. It's not just -- again, some customers want to go down a very social experience. If you think of Yahoo!, you're still thinking of 9 #1 properties in the U.S., 9 #1 properties worldwide, top 3 in 23 categories. We have a very different proposition for the advertisers. And with increased video, both for the users' entertainment but also for the advertisers to tell their story much like it's a commercial, I mean, I don't know how much time we're spending up there. But it's much more of a commercial experience now, and users are watching those because it's not an odd concept to them and it's not an odd concept to the advertisers.

Our results in Q2 were a mix of good, encouraging, and at the same time, unsatisfactory. First was good. Expenses were well managed, profits were up and we bought back a lot of stock. We're making clear measurable progress in Search, and we have continued to accelerate the launch of sites on our new publishing platform. But we know 2 issues are top of mind for you after seeing today's announcement: where are we with Alipay and what happened to Display this quarter? So I'm going to address both of those upfront. Tim will then talk more about the results, and I'll finish with an update on our Search Alliance and new publishing platform progress.
With regard to Alipay, we've been working on this negotiation continuously, in fact, daily. We're moving in a direction that's consistent with what we told you at our May 25 Investor Day. We told you then that the parties have been working with 2 agreed-upon principles in mind. One, ensuring that intra-company relationship between Alipay and Taobao is structured to preserve the value within Taobao and, therefore, Alibaba Group. And two, ensuring that Alibaba Group is appropriately compensated for the value of Alipay.
We have made substantial progress on the definitive agreements. But until every word is finalized and every document is signed, we're simply not done. We'll continue to work in earnest on the definitive agreements in a manner that best serves the interest of our shareholders.
Now let's turn to what's unsatisfactory. Our overall ex-TAC revenue was at the low end of our guidance range. That was entirely due to U.S. Display, which did not perform the way we expected. Overall, Display revenue ex-TAC was up 5%. Display in EMEA was up 27%. And in APAC, it was up 20%. However, the Americas region was flat, with U.S. Display down unexpectedly. Obviously, I'm not happy about our U.S. Display performance. Let me tell you what happened, why it happened, and what we're going to do to fix the problem and reaccelerate Display growth. 
In the first half of Q2, Display revenue in the U.S. was pretty much consistent with our expectations. But as the quarter progressed, we saw increasing softness, especially in June. Let me be clear what this was not. Business was not about new competitive developments. It was not about the economy, although the economy didn't help as we saw softness in the CPG, auto and retail categories. 
Finally, it was not about engagement, which grew nicely in Q2 as you can see from the engagement metrics on our IR site. Rather, the root cause is the comprehensive changes we discussed with you at our Investor Day, changes to our U.S. sales leadership, which led to changes to our sales org structure, and then to changes in our sales force. In May, we made a decision to reorganize the U.S. field organization and to move aggressively to position ourselves from our rapid Display growth in the future.
However, the combined short-term results was significant turnover in our field sales rank. That is the actual feet on the street. Turnover accelerated as all these changes affected the sales organization. As with any reorg, we initiated some of the departures and some people chose to leave on their own. Frankly, however, we underestimated how much the changes would increase turnover, and hence, our ability to close premium Class I sales in the back half of Q2.
That, in a nutshell, is what happened and what drove it. Now what's the bigger picture? What did we see that led us, even though we were generating double-digit Display growth, to make these major changes in our sales operations? 
As we said in Investor Day, we've been focused on taking our sales organization and client relationships to new levels. Over the past 8 months, we brought in new Americas sales leadership, from Ross Levinsohn, who you met at Investor Day; to Wayne Powers, who joined us from Time Warner; and Mark Ellis, who joined more recently from AOL. They did exactly what you would expect good sales leaders to do. They got close to the customer and closer to salespeople in the field. They have been out on many, many client pitches, which drove home to them the opportunity to reorient our relationship with advertisers and substantially change the way we sell.
With our massive user base, too often it was easy to fall back on pitching Yahoo!'s huge reach and scale. But selling on reach and scale alone leaves meaningful revenue opportunities on the table. We need a sales organization that can craft customized solutions and creative executions because this is what distinguishes Yahoo! from our competitors in Display. 
We think of it this way. The most differentiated way to sell Display advertising and the way we want to sell is customize audience-based and solution-oriented across multiple devices. The fact is the way that industry sells is evolving, and we must evolve too. 
So where are we now? First, we believe the field sales force is moving in the right direction. We've hired a lot of new people, and we see sales leaders and teams that believe in the opportunity and the changes we're making. Field sales is staffed back up to where they were 6 months ago. However, many of the account execs are new to the roles, and it will take time for them to get up to speed on their new books of business.
Second, we're investing in the growth of our overall U.S. sales force and sales development teams. We will hire more salespeople than we had before. We're increasing our coverage ratios for clients and agencies, and growing categories like video and mobile. 
We're also investing in better tools and training. We're organizing our teams with a deeper industry focus. We're packaging our offerings differently, and we're continuing to work on making ourselves easier to do business with.
Perhaps the most important signal we see is that this new approach to sales is beginning to prove itself. Where our new management and salespeople are making calls and deliver solutions-oriented pitches, we are getting the orders. These changes are part of the evolution of our turnaround efforts. First, we had to get the strategy right and clearly define our vision as Yahoo!, as the premier digital media company. Next, we had to focus and get the scalable technology platforms in place, and then begin launching new, more dynamic sites. And now we're intensely focused on monetizing those sites with the right solutions for advertisers.
We believe the changes we're making will bear fruit later this year and into 2012. In the meantime, we expect it will take some time to ramp our new sales team and scale our training and packaging efforts. And that's reflected in our Q3 guidance that has revenue flat with Q2. That also means we'll be below our 13% to 16% long-term Display growth target this year, but we are committed to getting back into that range next year.
Now let's get to the good news of the quarter. Search was better than we expected. Microsoft adCenter launches are helping to close the RPS gap, and all our innovative work with new front-end user experiences are contributing to our Search results as well. I want to give you more color on this, but before I do, let me turn it over to Tim to review the quarter."
91800,137042524,143026,"Yahoo! Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Let's move right into a discussion of second quarter revenue dynamics before proceeding to the rest of our 2Q results and 3Q guidance. Display revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $467 million on an ex-TAC basis, coming in ro",1168,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Let's move right into a discussion of second quarter revenue dynamics before proceeding to the rest of our 2Q results and 3Q guidance. 
Display revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $467 million on an ex-TAC basis, coming in roughly $30 million below our expectations. As you heard earlier, both EMEA and APAC performed as expected with 20% or better Display growth versus last year. So I'll focus my comments on the shortfall in the Americas region and, specifically, in the U.S.
As Carol described, our U.S. sales force is under transition, and we simply didn't have appropriate coverage to close 2Q as we'd originally planned. Our sell-through rate this quarter was the most tangible expression of that fact. By and large, ad supply wasn't an issue. That is, engagement on our major media properties was essentially where we expected it to be. So we had ad inventory available to sell at premium rates. However, without our sales force operating at full capacity, many of the ad units we would typically sell on a guaranteed or premium basis were, instead, run through the exchange as nonpremium inventory at far lower prices.
Our Homepage was a clear example of this dynamic. Due to the sales force transition and turnover, we sold significantly fewer days as guaranteed placements in second quarter 2011 than we did in the prior year. Many of our media properties experienced similar dynamics. 
Another way of viewing the same issue is by industry category. Lower revenue in 3 specific ad categories, consumer packaged goods, autos and retail, accounted for 2/3 of the shortfall in U.S. Display revenue. Typically, we would have been able to sell some of that inventory intended for those customers to other premium advertisers at guaranteed placements. Although non-guaranteed upside provided a small offset, the revenue mix effect was very unfavorable.
Turning now to Search. Second quarter ex-TAC revenue landed at $371 million, roughly $15 million ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by O&O. Owned and Operated revenue was down 10% versus last year, including the Search Alliance revenue share, but up slightly without the revenue share. We continued to benefit from the Microsoft RPS guarantee in the second quarter.
For affiliates, ex-TAC Search revenue was down 27% year-over-year as a result of the marketplace transition challenges I described on our April earnings call. However, we did see some Affiliate stabilization this quarter, which contributed to ex-TAC Search revenue exceeding our expectations.
With respect to operational Search metrics, our worldwide O&O query volume was down mid single digits versus last year, and worldwide RPS was up mid single digits. In the U.S. marketplace where we fully transitioned to Microsoft systems, query volume in RPS were both roughly flat, including the guarantee. However, operational RPS in the U.S. did show meaningful improvements sequentially, as Carol will describe more in a few minutes.
Rounding out the top line, our other revenue category was $239 million ex-TAC for second quarter and performed in line with expectations. Although down 3% year-over-year, the category grew slightly, excluding the HotJobs divestiture.
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter ex-TAC expense landed at $885 million, $40 million below guidance midpoint and 7% lower than prior year. The underrun versus guidance was spread across a number of line items led by workforce. There were, however, roughly $10 million in nonrecurring items that benefited second quarter results.
In terms of our primary profitability metrics, operating income of $191 million was up 9% versus prior year and exceeded our guidance midpoint by $16 million despite the revenue shortfall. Ex-TAC operating margins were roughly 18%, an expansion of 2 points versus second quarter 2010. And finally, EPS improved 18% year-over-year to $0.18 per diluted share.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at just under $3.3 billion. Cash flow from operating activities, or CFOA, was $331 million for the quarter and roughly $540 million year-to-date. First half 2011 CFOA rose 10% versus first half 2010. During the second quarter, we repurchased a total of 30 million shares for $472 million or an average of $15.63 per share. We had $1.6 billion remaining under our current authorization as of June 30.
Capital expenditures were $172 million for second quarter, including approximately $30 million in construction of more efficient data centers both in the U.S. and abroad. CapEx was slightly lower in the quarter than what we had previously communicated to you as approximately $20 million of data center spending shifted from 2Q to 3Q. We continue to expect second half 2011 CapEx to be lower than first half.
Finally, as of June 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was roughly $9.1 billion or just over $7 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba's privately held businesses.
Turning to third quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,050,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. Given the sales force dynamics Carol and I described earlier, we expect Display revenue growth will again be in the mid single-digit range year-over-year, while our Search and other segments should be down slightly on a sequential basis in line with seasonality. 
For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $915 million to $935 million for third quarter, down approximately 1% year-over-year, but up $40 million sequentially at the midpoint of the range. While disproportionate to our sequential revenue growth, $20 million of the increase represents key investments in our sales force, content and products. 
The remaining $20 million sequential uptick breaks down roughly into 2 separate $10 million increments. The first relates to the one-time items I referenced a few minutes ago that won't repeat in 3Q. The second is related to our Search Alliance transition costs. We've now, essentially, used up the $150 million transition allowance from Microsoft, so the ongoing transition work will be reflected in our cost structure. Going forward, we plan to manage that transition cost within the parameters of our profitability goals.
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $150 million. While the short term step backward in ex-TAC operating margin rate compared to second quarter, we believe the investments we're making in 3Q will enable us to deliver improved margin rates for fourth quarter and beyond.
Before closing, I'd also like to provide a quick update on our efforts to unlock the value of our investment in Yahoo! Japan. Over the last 6 months, we've explored a few different paths to achieve that objective, some have dead-ended and some have continued to evolve. Many of the structures we're pursuing are unique, so it's expected that some will prove unviable. Our focus is to find the right solution and that effort remains a top priority of ours. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Carol."

I know this is an area you are all watching closely. As a reminder, we partnered with Microsoft in Search to improve our search performance, expand margins and focus our effort on what's most important to Yahoo!.

As a reminder, we partnered with Microsoft in Search to improve our search performance, expand margins and focus our effort on what's most important to Yahoo!. We're behind in the RPS benefits from the combined marketplace, but our revenue is protected by the Microsoft RPS guarantee. 
Advertisers like the ROI of the new alliance. We've seen real improvements in algo Search quality, and we began to stem the declines in Search market share. We're innovating on the front end of Search. And last but not least, our operating income is benefiting by at least $50 million a quarter through this partnership. 
So what about RPS? As we discussed last quarter, RPS is below the expectations we have for the alliance due to technical limitations in Microsoft's adCenter platform. The alliance has worked aggressively to implement a plan to address these issues. Working together, Microsoft and Yahoo! have uncovered and addressed several platform gaps and inefficiencies in the adCenter marketplace. With a lot of collaborative work and planning, Microsoft systematically launched many new capabilities throughout Q2, including improvements to campaign budgeting features and click prediction models.
These launches are improving the monetization of paid search results and lifting RPS on both Yahoo! O&O and Affiliate sites. By the end of Q2, we've closed approximately 1/5 of the RPS gap that we measured in April before the new platform initiatives were launched. Let's be clear about what that means. That does not mean that RPS was up 20%. It means that 1/5 of the RPS gap that existed in April has already been closed.
We're really pleased with our improvement. Additional initiatives to improve the adCenter platform have been identified, and hence, are scheduled to launch throughout the year. And we believe we're on track to achieve RPS parity by the end of the year. Volume remains healthy in the combined marketplace, and we continue to see solid ROI for advertisers and their search campaign. As we said before, the low CPA and high ROI we're generating is great news for advertisers. 
Let me also touch briefly on where we stand with future plans. The transition to our algo Search to Microsoft system is complete in 5 countries, including the U.S., and we plan to move the rest of the world markets this year. We plan to complete that transition of paid Search in India by the end of this year as well, and we hope to make significant progress on moving global paid Search in 2012. We will solidify our transition schedule as we see continued improvements in RPS and adCenter's global readiness.
We usually share other product updates and progress with you on these calls, but we did a lot of that on our Investor Day, so I won't go through all of them again today. However, I do want to share one important update on the progress of site launches on Yahoo!'s new publishing platform. 
Two years ago, if you remember, we started on a major project to build more flexible, scalable content platforms to manage our sites. We started launching on the new technology late last year and now have 67 sites operating on our new publishing platforms. In June alone, we brought up close to 20 entertainment and lifestyle sites.
This new technology allows fresher, more flexible site design, deeper personalization with our core personalization engine, better photo, blog and social integration, search engine optimization, a single worldwide editorial tool set and a lot more. And we're on track to have 135 sites up on the platform by year end.
Near the end of the quarter, we completed one of the most important transitions, Yahoo! News in the U.S. This was a significant milestone as U.S. News is by far the largest, most complex site to launch on the new platform.
In conclusion, we made substantial progress transforming Yahoo! as we discussed with you on our Investor Day, but we'd like to be farther down the road than we are. As we look ahead, we know what we need to focus on: transforming Display, increasing Search RPS, launching sites on our new publishing platform and improving our capital structure. In addition, we're also very focused on preserving and unlocking the value of our Asian assets. We believe we're on track to achieve our goal of revenue growth in 2012.

And that's a sales force, that's definitely a sales force. And it's a sales force that is selling more than, ""Gee. We're big."" It's really selling what the audiences are, what the different packaging solutions could be, and so it's different advertising when it runs through an exchange."

In fact, they don't look overly aggressive, and I'm not trying to sneak a comment in here. They just look like it's something we can do. And our scientists and technical people are working closely with them and believe it as well. Now by the way, that doesn't make me happy because the alliance predicted we'd be plus 6% to 8% by now, which is where we'd like to be. So just struggling back to get to parity kind of chews me out.

But fourth quarter, you get the disproportionate effect the other way. It's a great seasonal quarter on revenue. We will be investing in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter to make sure we take advantage of that, but revenues and margins are typically strong. So we would expect it bounce back significantly from 3Q to 4Q as we typically get. Looking into 2012, really, no news here any different than what I talked about at Investor Day on May 25, which is we will continue to endeavor to expand our margins.

Let me handle the last one first because that's the one I remember first. I would say there's no category that you take off the table. I talked about a few different things at Investor Day, a traditional spin. I mean, we could do a cash sale if we have the right Use of Proceeds, but don't like the Use of Proceeds being buyback. We talked about traditional spend, we talked about a tracker, and some other tax efficient structures. So there's none of those 4 categories that you take off the table. What I'd say is some of the more unique and creative structures we found after fully vetting them aren't going to work, but some others are ongoing. So we'll just keep working that. On the categories, it was in my script where I talked about 2/3, and it wasn't about pricing. It caused a yield issue as you mixed from guaranteed to non-guaranteed. But it was a revenue. We had a revenue shortfall in certain CPG, auto and retail customers. And as I said, typically, you'd be able to take that inventory and sell it to other premium advertisers that want guaranteed placements. Without the sales force capacity to do that, it therefore fell into, so to speak, the exchange. And when it runs through the exchange, it runs through at lower prices, that inventory. Again, not the same customers, different customers, different kinds of ads and lower pricing. And 3Q factor of the NFL, I'm a big NFL fan, I just hope they play. But no, we haven't gone and tried to factor in big macro or even slightly macro factors like that into the forecast. But what we've looked at is our momentum across the board, where we are in bringing our sales force up to speed. We look at seasonality, we look at pipelines, and we factor it all into this guidance."

We have, essentially in the first half of this year, almost totally rebuilt our U.S. media team, from the editorial staff to better SEO, better -- more video programming. Of course, we have some big events in the quarter. But as an example, for instance, we really went after looking at, say, News, and we're really working on what the Yahoo! Voice should be, how much original programming, meaning breaking news and that sort of thing. And to give you an idea, in each month of Q2, News averaged 2.9 billion minutes a month, which is up 23% from Q2 of last year. And that's the kind of information with -- and I hope you guys have gone up to see News, it's nowhere near where it's eventually going to be. But it's a new look, it's exciting, much more creative, much more photo, slide shows and that sort of thing.

Also, with the new platforms, the publishing platforms, we can actually do the kind of personalization on these sites that we've only been able to do heretofore on the front page and one module in News. So we're very excited about that technology. Now your second question. Yes, communications products are down for a couple of reasons. One is IMAP and what's happening with cell phones and how all of this is counted. So we're really paying attention to this. Now a couple of good things. Our new News platform, which has gone to general availability, is progressing quite nicely -- I mean mail, I'm sorry, I said News. Well, we have new News, too, but in Mail. People are spending more time on it because it's a much more interesting experience. It's 2x faster; it's much less spamming, if you'll say; easier-to-use; photos, all that sort of thing. So we're both trying to entice people to come and spend time. And we're also looking at how to better monetize that experience.

I'm curious, how do you kind of differentiate yourself and your messaging vis-à-vis some of these newer players, or these folks that are selling a unique property in the marketplace, and how do you differentiate from a selling standpoint? I guess that dovetails back into kind of getting pricing back if you're selling through non-guaranteed going to guaranteed. How do you get the advertisers and the agencies back into a guaranteed format in light of kind of a lot of different alternatives in the marketplace today from a Display standpoint?"

I mean, if you look at the TV market, offline market, there's cable, there's major channels, there's specialty channels. Same thing with print. And all the sites have a different purpose, or all of the end points have a different purpose. That is the same way if you look at what's happening, especially, with the top 3 in the Display side of the business. It's not just -- again, some customers want to go down a very social experience. If you think of Yahoo!, you're still thinking of 9 #1 properties in the U.S., 9 #1 properties worldwide, top 3 in 23 categories. We have a very different proposition for the advertisers. And with increased video, both for the users' entertainment but also for the advertisers to tell their story much like it's a commercial. I mean, I don't know how much time we're spending up there, but it's much more of a commercial experience now. And users are watching those because it's not an odd concept to them and it's not an odd concept to the advertisers. So there is a definite place for what Yahoo! does, not only with -- in this case, I would sort of follow myself back on scale, but it is on being able to use our science to do a really good job with our data and other data to find the right -- put the right ad in the right context."

Our results in Q2 were a mix of good, encouraging, and at the same time, unsatisfactory. First was good. Expenses were well managed, profits were up and we bought back a lot of stock. We're making clear measurable progress in Search, and we have continued to accelerate the launch of sites on our new publishing platform. But we know 2 issues are top of mind for you after seeing today's announcement: where are we with Alipay and what happened to Display this quarter? So I'm going to address both of those upfront. Tim will then talk more about the results, and I'll finish with an update on our Search Alliance and new publishing platform progress.
With regard to Alipay, we've been working on this negotiation continuously, in fact, daily. We're moving in a direction that's consistent with what we told you at our May 25 Investor Day. We told you then that the parties have been working with 2 agreed-upon principles in mind. One, ensuring that intra-company relationship between Alipay and Taobao is structured to preserve the value within Taobao and, therefore, Alibaba Group. And two, ensuring that Alibaba Group is appropriately compensated for the value of Alipay.
We have made substantial progress on the definitive agreements. But until every word is finalized and every document is signed, we're simply not done. We'll continue to work in earnest on the definitive agreements in a manner that best serves the interest of our shareholders.
Now let's turn to what's unsatisfactory. Our overall ex-TAC revenue was at the low end of our guidance range. That was entirely due to U.S. Display, which did not perform the way we expected. Overall, Display revenue ex-TAC was up 5%. Display in EMEA was up 27%. And in APAC, it was up 20%. However, the Americas region was flat, with U.S. Display down unexpectedly. Obviously, I'm not happy about our U.S. Display performance. Let me tell you what happened, why it happened, and what we're going to do to fix the problem and reaccelerate Display growth. 
In the first half of Q2, Display revenue in the U.S. was pretty much consistent with our expectations. But as the quarter progressed, we saw increasing softness, especially in June. Let me be clear what this was not. Business was not about new competitive developments. It was not about the economy, although the economy didn't help as we saw softness in the CPG, auto and retail categories. 
Finally, it was not about engagement, which grew nicely in Q2 as you can see from the engagement metrics on our IR site. Rather, the root cause is the comprehensive changes we discussed with you at our Investor Day, changes to our U.S. sales leadership, which led to changes to our sales org structure, and then to changes in our sales force. In May, we made a decision to reorganize the U.S. field organization and to move aggressively to position ourselves from our rapid Display growth in the future.
However, the combined short-term results was significant turnover in our field sales rank. That is the actual feet on the street. Turnover accelerated as all these changes affected the sales organization. As with any reorg, we initiated some of the departures and some people chose to leave on their own. Frankly, however, we underestimated how much the changes would increase turnover, and hence, our ability to close premium Class I sales in the back half of Q2.
That, in a nutshell, is what happened and what drove it. Now what's the bigger picture? What did we see that led us, even though we were generating double-digit Display growth, to make these major changes in our sales operations? 
As we said in Investor Day, we've been focused on taking our sales organization and client relationships to new levels. Over the past 8 months, we brought in new Americas sales leadership, from Ross Levinsohn, who you met at Investor Day; to Wayne Powers, who joined us from Time Warner; and Mark Ellis, who joined more recently from AOL. They did exactly what you would expect good sales leaders to do. They got close to the customer and closer to salespeople in the field. They have been out on many, many client pitches, which drove home to them the opportunity to reorient our relationship with advertisers and substantially change the way we sell.
With our massive user base, too often it was easy to fall back on pitching Yahoo!'s huge reach and scale. But selling on reach and scale alone leaves meaningful revenue opportunities on the table. We need a sales organization that can craft customized solutions and creative executions because this is what distinguishes Yahoo! from our competitors in Display. 
We think of it this way. The most differentiated way to sell Display advertising and the way we want to sell is customize audience-based and solution-oriented across multiple devices. The fact is the way that industry sells is evolving, and we must evolve too. 
So where are we now? First, we believe the field sales force is moving in the right direction. We've hired a lot of new people, and we see sales leaders and teams that believe in the opportunity and the changes we're making. Field sales is staffed back up to where they were 6 months ago. However, many of the account execs are new to the roles, and it will take time for them to get up to speed on their new books of business.
Second, we're investing in the growth of our overall U.S. sales force and sales development teams. We will hire more salespeople than we had before. We're increasing our coverage ratios for clients and agencies, and growing categories like video and mobile. 
We're also investing in better tools and training. We're organizing our teams with a deeper industry focus. We're packaging our offerings differently, and we're continuing to work on making ourselves easier to do business with.
Perhaps the most important signal we see is that this new approach to sales is beginning to prove itself. Where our new management and salespeople are making calls and deliver solutions-oriented pitches, we are getting the orders. These changes are part of the evolution of our turnaround efforts. First, we had to get the strategy right and clearly define our vision as Yahoo!, as the premier digital media company. Next, we had to focus and get the scalable technology platforms in place, and then begin launching new, more dynamic sites. And now we're intensely focused on monetizing those sites with the right solutions for advertisers.
We believe the changes we're making will bear fruit later this year and into 2012. In the meantime, we expect it will take some time to ramp our new sales team and scale our training and packaging efforts. And that's reflected in our Q3 guidance that has revenue flat with Q2. That also means we'll be below our 13% to 16% long-term Display growth target this year, but we are committed to getting back into that range next year.
Now let's get to the good news of the quarter. Search was better than we expected. Microsoft adCenter launches are helping to close the RPS gap, and all our innovative work with new front-end user experiences are contributing to our Search results as well. I want to give you more color on this, but before I do, let me turn it over to Tim to review the quarter."
91800,137042524,143181,"Yahoo! Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2011",2011-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Altaba Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Let's move right into a discussion of second quarter revenue dynamics before proceeding to the rest of our 2Q results and 3Q guidance. Display revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $467 million on an ex-TAC basis, coming in ro",1168,"Thanks, Carol. Good afternoon. Let's move right into a discussion of second quarter revenue dynamics before proceeding to the rest of our 2Q results and 3Q guidance. 
Display revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $467 million on an ex-TAC basis, coming in roughly $30 million below our expectations. As you heard earlier, both EMEA and APAC performed as expected with 20% or better Display growth versus last year. So I'll focus my comments on the shortfall in the Americas region and, specifically, in the U.S.
As Carol described, our U.S. sales force is under transition, and we simply didn't have appropriate coverage to close 2Q as we'd originally planned. Our sell-through rate this quarter was the most tangible expression of that fact. By and large, ad supply wasn't an issue. That is, engagement on our major media properties was essentially where we expected it to be. So we had ad inventory available to sell at premium rates. However, without our sales force operating at full capacity, many of the ad units we would typically sell on a guaranteed or premium basis were, instead, run through the exchange as nonpremium inventory at far lower prices.
Our Homepage was a clear example of this dynamic. Due to the sales force transition and turnover, we sold significantly fewer days as guaranteed placements in second quarter 2011 than we did in the prior year. Many of our media properties experienced similar dynamics. 
Another way of viewing the same issue is by industry category. Lower revenue in 3 specific ad categories, consumer packaged goods, autos and retail, accounted for 2/3 of the shortfall in U.S. Display revenue. Typically, we would have been able to sell some of that inventory intended for those customers to other premium advertisers at guaranteed placements. Although non-guaranteed upside provided a small offset, the revenue mix effect was very unfavorable.
Turning now to Search. Second quarter ex-TAC revenue landed at $371 million, roughly $15 million ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by O&O. Owned and Operated revenue was down 10% versus last year, including the Search Alliance revenue share, but up slightly without the revenue share. We continued to benefit from the Microsoft RPS guarantee in the second quarter.
For affiliates, ex-TAC Search revenue was down 27% year-over-year as a result of the marketplace transition challenges I described on our April earnings call. However, we did see some Affiliate stabilization this quarter, which contributed to ex-TAC Search revenue exceeding our expectations.
With respect to operational Search metrics, our worldwide O&O query volume was down mid single digits versus last year, and worldwide RPS was up mid single digits. In the U.S. marketplace where we fully transitioned to Microsoft systems, query volume in RPS were both roughly flat, including the guarantee. However, operational RPS in the U.S. did show meaningful improvements sequentially, as Carol will describe more in a few minutes.
Rounding out the top line, our other revenue category was $239 million ex-TAC for second quarter and performed in line with expectations. Although down 3% year-over-year, the category grew slightly, excluding the HotJobs divestiture.
Moving down the income statement. Second quarter ex-TAC expense landed at $885 million, $40 million below guidance midpoint and 7% lower than prior year. The underrun versus guidance was spread across a number of line items led by workforce. There were, however, roughly $10 million in nonrecurring items that benefited second quarter results.
In terms of our primary profitability metrics, operating income of $191 million was up 9% versus prior year and exceeded our guidance midpoint by $16 million despite the revenue shortfall. Ex-TAC operating margins were roughly 18%, an expansion of 2 points versus second quarter 2010. And finally, EPS improved 18% year-over-year to $0.18 per diluted share.
Now let's take a few moments to review our key balance sheet metrics. Cash and marketable debt securities ended the quarter at just under $3.3 billion. Cash flow from operating activities, or CFOA, was $331 million for the quarter and roughly $540 million year-to-date. First half 2011 CFOA rose 10% versus first half 2010. During the second quarter, we repurchased a total of 30 million shares for $472 million or an average of $15.63 per share. We had $1.6 billion remaining under our current authorization as of June 30.
Capital expenditures were $172 million for second quarter, including approximately $30 million in construction of more efficient data centers both in the U.S. and abroad. CapEx was slightly lower in the quarter than what we had previously communicated to you as approximately $20 million of data center spending shifted from 2Q to 3Q. We continue to expect second half 2011 CapEx to be lower than first half.
Finally, as of June 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan and our 29% indirect stake in Alibaba.com was roughly $9.1 billion or just over $7 per share. These figures are based on public market quotes and do not include estimates of the value of Alibaba's privately held businesses.
Turning to third quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,050,000,000 to $1,100,000,000. Given the sales force dynamics Carol and I described earlier, we expect Display revenue growth will again be in the mid single-digit range year-over-year, while our Search and other segments should be down slightly on a sequential basis in line with seasonality. 
For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $915 million to $935 million for third quarter, down approximately 1% year-over-year, but up $40 million sequentially at the midpoint of the range. While disproportionate to our sequential revenue growth, $20 million of the increase represents key investments in our sales force, content and products. 
The remaining $20 million sequential uptick breaks down roughly into 2 separate $10 million increments. The first relates to the one-time items I referenced a few minutes ago that won't repeat in 3Q. The second is related to our Search Alliance transition costs. We've now, essentially, used up the $150 million transition allowance from Microsoft, so the ongoing transition work will be reflected in our cost structure. Going forward, we plan to manage that transition cost within the parameters of our profitability goals.
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for operating income is $150 million. While the short term step backward in ex-TAC operating margin rate compared to second quarter, we believe the investments we're making in 3Q will enable us to deliver improved margin rates for fourth quarter and beyond.
Before closing, I'd also like to provide a quick update on our efforts to unlock the value of our investment in Yahoo! Japan. Over the last 6 months, we've explored a few different paths to achieve that objective, some have dead-ended and some have continued to evolve. Many of the structures we're pursuing are unique, so it's expected that some will prove unviable. Our focus is to find the right solution and that effort remains a top priority of ours. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Carol."

I know this is an area you are all watching closely. As a reminder, we partnered with Microsoft in Search to improve our search performance, expand margins and focus our effort on what's most important to Yahoo!. We're behind in the RP",744,"Now back to Search. I know this is an area you are all watching closely. As a reminder, we partnered with Microsoft in Search to improve our search performance, expand margins and focus our effort on what's most important to Yahoo!. We're behind in the RPS benefits from the combined marketplace, but our revenue is protected by the Microsoft RPS guarantee. 
Advertisers like the ROI of the new alliance. We've seen real improvements in algo Search quality, and we began to stem the declines in Search market share. We're innovating on the front end of Search. And last but not least, our operating income is benefiting by at least $50 million a quarter through this partnership. 
So what about RPS? As we discussed last quarter, RPS is below the expectations we have for the alliance due to technical limitations in Microsoft's adCenter platform. The alliance has worked aggressively to implement a plan to address these issues. Working together, Microsoft and Yahoo! have uncovered and addressed several platform gaps and inefficiencies in the adCenter marketplace. With a lot of collaborative work and planning, Microsoft systematically launched many new capabilities throughout Q2, including improvements to campaign budgeting features and click prediction models.
These launches are improving the monetization of paid search results and lifting RPS on both Yahoo! O&O and Affiliate sites. By the end of Q2, we've closed approximately 1/5 of the RPS gap that we measured in April before the new platform initiatives were launched. Let's be clear about what that means. That does not mean that RPS was up 20%. It means that 1/5 of the RPS gap that existed in April has already been closed.
We're really pleased with our improvement. Additional initiatives to improve the adCenter platform have been identified, and hence, are scheduled to launch throughout the year. And we believe we're on track to achieve RPS parity by the end of the year. Volume remains healthy in the combined marketplace, and we continue to see solid ROI for advertisers and their search campaign. As we said before, the low CPA and high ROI we're generating is great news for advertisers. 
Let me also touch briefly on where we stand with future plans. The transition to our algo Search to Microsoft system is complete in 5 countries, including the U.S., and we plan to move the rest of the world markets this year. We plan to complete that transition of paid Search in India by the end of this year as well, and we hope to make significant progress on moving global paid Search in 2012. We will solidify our transition schedule as we see continued improvements in RPS and adCenter's global readiness.
We usually share other product updates and progress with you on these calls, but we did a lot of that on our Investor Day, so I won't go through all of them again today. However, I do want to share one important update on the progress of site launches on Yahoo!'s new publishing platform. 
Two years ago, if you remember, we started on a major project to build more flexible, scalable content platforms to manage our sites. We started launching on the new technology late last year and now have 67 sites operating on our new publishing platforms. In June alone, we brought up close to 20 entertainment and lifestyle sites.
This new technology allows fresher, more flexible site design, deeper personalization with our core personalization engine, better photo, blog and social integration, search engine optimization, a single worldwide editorial tool set and a lot more. And we're on track to have 135 sites up on the platform by year end.
Near the end of the quarter, we completed one of the most important transitions, Yahoo! News in the U.S. This was a significant milestone as U.S. News is by far the largest, most complex site to launch on the new platform.
In conclusion, we made substantial progress transforming Yahoo! as we discussed with you on our Investor Day, but we'd like to be farther down the road than we are. As we look ahead, we know what we need to focus on: transforming Display, increasing Search RPS, launching sites on our new publishing platform and improving our capital structure. In addition, we're also very focused on preserving and unlocking the value of our Asian assets. We believe we're on track to achieve our goal of revenue growth in 2012.

And our scientists and technical people are working closely with them and believe it as well. Now by the way, that doesn't make me happy because the alliance predicted we'd be plus 6% to 8% by now, which is where we'd like to be. So just struggling back to get to parity kind of chews me out.

And as I said in the script, when Wayne, and Mark and Chris, our new sales leaders go in, the advertisers are actually very, if you will, I don't want to say the word grateful, but we're talking about Yahoo! much differently than the fact that it's big because, guess what, our competition is big too. This is about how we can work with them to creatively tell who they are to the people they want to reach."

Let me handle the last one first because that's the one I remember first. I would say there's no category that you take off the table. I talked about a few different things at Investor Day, a traditional spin. I mean, we could do a cash sale if we have the right Use of Proceeds, but don't like the Use of Proceeds being buyback. We talked about traditional spend, we talked about a tracker, and some other tax efficient structures. So there's none of those 4 categories that you take off the table. What I'd say is some of the more unique and creative structures we found after fully vetting them aren't going to work, but some others are ongoing. So we'll just keep working that. On the categories, it was in my script where I talked about 2/3, and it wasn't about pricing. It caused a yield issue as you mixed from guaranteed to non-guaranteed. But it was a revenue. We had a revenue shortfall in certain CPG, auto and retail customers. And as I said, typically, you'd be able to take that inventory and sell it to other premium advertisers that want guaranteed placements. Without the sales force capacity to do that, it therefore fell into, so to speak, the exchange. And when it runs through the exchange, it runs through at lower prices, that inventory. Again, not the same customers, different customers, different kinds of ads and lower pricing. And 3Q factor of the NFL, I'm a big NFL fan, I just hope they play. But no, we haven't gone and tried to factor in big macro or even slightly macro factors like that into the forecast. But what we've looked at is our momentum across the board, where we are in bringing our sales force up to speed. We look at seasonality, we look at pipelines, and we factor it all into this guidance."

We have, essentially in the first half of this year, almost totally rebuilt our U.S. media team, from the editorial staff to better SEO, better -- more video programming. Of course, we have some big events in the quarter. But as an example, for instance, we really went after looking at, say, News, and we're really working on what the Yahoo! Voice should be, how much original programming, meaning breaking news and that sort of thing. And to give you an idea, in each month of Q2, News averaged 2.9 billion minutes a month, which is up 23% from Q2 of last year. And that's the kind of information with -- and I hope you guys have gone up to see News, it's nowhere near where it's eventually going to be. But it's a new look, it's exciting, much more creative, much more photo, slide shows and that sort of thing. We're going to focus, as we said at the Investor Day, in anchors and tent poles, which means big events that we know how to sell and package ahead of time, and we know how to do network-wide programming to enhance people's excitement and interest in it. Also, with the new platforms, the publishing platforms, we can actually do the kind of personalization on these sites that we've only been able to do heretofore on the front page and one module in News. So we're very excited about that technology. Now your second question. Yes, communications products are down for a couple of reasons. One is IMAP and what's happening with cell phones and how all of this is counted. So we're really paying attention to this. Now a couple of good things. Our new News platform, which has gone to general availability, is progressing quite nicely -- I mean mail, I'm sorry, I said News. Well, we have new News, too, but in Mail. People are spending more time on it because it's a much more interesting experience. It's 2x faster; it's much less spamming, if you'll say; easier-to-use; photos, all that sort of thing. So we're both trying to entice people to come and spend time. And we're also looking at how to better monetize that experience. But yes, it's not unnoticed that people are changing the way they communicate. So we've got to change with that, and also the kind of products and services that are modern and interesting to users."

Good afternoon, and thanks, for joining our discussion for the third quarter 2011 financial results. We are pleased that revenue, operating income and EPS were all above consensus estimates this quarter and look forward to discussing the details of our performance with you. In addition to these financial results, the key operating take away, our -underscore is that we remain focused on executing against our key strategies to build best in class technology, deepen the quality and personalization of our content, and grow monetization. Before I get into the details of our results, let me reiterate what the Board has said about its comprehensive strategic review process. The board is actively looking at the full range of options available to return the company to a path of robust growth and industry-leading innovation. The objective is to deliver on our company's potential and to create value for our employees, advertisers, users and our shareholders. The Board also has said that when it has something to announce, it will do so. That will take time. It will not be today and not on this call. For the rest of my comments, we'll focus on third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. 
Let's begin with an overview of third quarter. On the top line, our 3Q ex-TAC revenue of $1,072,000,000 was fractionally below the midpoint of our guidance range. Our operating income of $177 million was above the high end of our range and ex-TAC operating margins were higher than we expected and roughly flat with last year's third quarter at 17%. Earnings per share were $0.23. Adjusted EPS were $0.21, which is up 32% versus 3Q a year ago. This excludes a $25 million one-time gain in 3Q '11 related to our ownership in Alibaba Group, and also a $186 million gain on the sale of HotJobs from the prior year. We are also very pleased to have repurchased 44 million shares for $593 million during the quarter. 
Diving into revenue in more detail, worldwide ex-TAC Display revenue was flat year-over-year at $449 million, below our expectations from modest growth. Premium Display revenue grew versus prior year, helped by Page view growth of 9% on our media properties. By contrast, nonpremium Display revenue declined due to lower impressions in yield. As in 2Q, Display revenue in EMEA and AIPAC performed well, growing nearly 30% versus 2010. In Americas, we're seeing some positive momentum and some headwinds. On the plus side, our media properties are seeing growth in sell through rates, solid impressions and revenue for premium or guaranteed placements. However, declines in nonguaranteed placements across Mail and other high sites contributed to an overall Display revenue decline in the Americas region. We told you last quarter that we're restructuring the U.S. sales force and I'm happy to report that we're seeing signs of progress. Our headcount is has stabilized, we continued to hire aggressively in sales and we have great additional talent in the pipeline. As you all know, it takes time to reestablish and refine account coverage and budgets are both well ahead of time, so our efforts are all work in progress. But sales productivity is ramping up. We see it in the sequential improvements in premium revenue, sellthrough and solid impressions that I just mentioned, as well as in key areas like our Homepage, where we sold more premium placements in 3Q than we did in 2Q. We expect to see increased efficiency in expanding growth opportunities as the new team gets fully ramped up and sells over multiple quarters. Along those lines, we continued to be encouraging signs within content. During the quarter, we run major campaigns for many of leading brands, including PNG, Visa, Dodge, Toyota, Jaguar, AT&T, Bank of America, Levi's and Paramount Pictures, as well as all of the major TV networks who promoted their new fall TV lineups. But it's clear there are still work to do. Continuing to expand sales force capacity and sellthrough over multiple quarters will enable our premium strategy to fully take hold. On the nonpremium side, we are taking actions to improve both our overall supply and ad serving as well as our yield, including marketplace demand, sellthrough and technology capabilities. Important, however, to put these combined efforts into the larger context of improvements in technology and content that will drive engagement and, therefore, position us for future Display revenue growth. With that in mind, I'll quickly run through several key areas of progress for you. First, technology. We brought up 28 sites on the new Yahoo! Publishing platform since the end of last quarter, bringing the total to 95. And we also launched Yahoo! News activity, a new way for users to discover content on Yahoo! News by seeing what their Facebook friends are reading. Second, content, several examples here, we've recently introduced a broad strategic alliance with ABC News, underscoring our commitment to premium content. And 911 remembered, our 911 anniversary site, generated more than 300 million page views and more than 250 million photo views. We are also securing exclusive content such as the online interview with President Obama 2 weeks ago and the Clinton foundation concert, which we broadcast live on Yahoo! this last weekend. Lastly, I'd like to emphasize an important progress in video. We just launched our new video destination, Yahoo! Screen, along with our slate of 8 new original video programs targeted at women. Even before this launch, everyone of the top 10 in 13 of the top 15 original video programs on the Web in the U.S. is from Yahoo!. 
Turning now to Search. Third quarter ex-TAC revenue was $374 million, ahead of our expectations. Owned and Operated revenue was slightly better than expected and continued to benefit from the Microsoft RPS guarantee. With respect to operational Search metrics, our worldwide O&O query volume was down mid-single digits versus last year and worldwide RPS was up mid-single digits. In the U.S. marketplace, where we fully transitioned to Microsoft systems, query volume in RPS, including the guarantee, were both up slightly. Once again, operational RPS in the U.S. grew sequentially as both Microsoft and Yahoo! completed initiatives to close the gap. At the end of 3Q, we had closed nearly 30% of the RPS gap that existed in April. In order to create more financial certainty, Microsoft and Yahoo! recently agreed to extend the RPS guarantee in the U.S. and Canada through March 2013. We will continue our joint work with Microsoft to close the remaining gap as quickly as possible, and we're obviously working to do so before that time frame. Both companies remained fully committed to the success of our Search Alliance and the RPS guarantee extension represents an important sign of that commitment. 
With respect to the progress of the Algo transition, as we discussed last quarter, our stated goal was to complete the transition of all markets by the end of this year. We expect that goal to be achieved next month. We have transitioned and syndication partners in over 40 markets from Yahoo! Search to Microsoft, for Web, image, and video Algo Search results across both desktop and mobile. One Algo Search market remains to be completed, that's Korea, which we plan to transition in November. 
Finally, we also completed the Page Search transition in India this quarter and expect to begin transition activities for additional page Search markets early in 2012, following the holiday season. 
With that review of our core business dynamics, I'll now turn to the values of each of our Asian assets. First, on Japan, based on public market data as of September 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan was $6.4 billion. Our efforts to unlock shareholder value on a tax efficient basis are ongoing, but potential transactions are complex and generally involve extended timeframes to complete. 
And with respect to Ali Baba group, using the pending third-party tender offer from employee-owned shares as a value guide based on the number of shares Yahoo! owns and the proposed offering price, we believe our investment in Alibaba Group will be valued at just over $14 billion on a pretax basis. 
Finally, turning to fourth quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,125,000,000 to $1,235,000,000. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $925 million to $975 million for fourth quarter, with the midpoint up roughly $55 million sequentially due primarily to seasonality and continued investments in salesforce buildout and video. Recall that we fully utilized the $150 million transition allowance from Microsoft to ongoing transition work that's reflected in our cost structure. We are managing that transition costs within the parameters of our overall profitability goals. At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for  4Q operating income is $230 million, implying 20% for ex-TAC operating margin. Before I close, I want to say a sincere thank you to all of the Yahoo! employees around the world who remain focused on our plan and continued to work hard on our progress. Their focus and that of the leadership team is to move the business forward with new technology, partnerships, products and premium personalized content. Much more premiums to be done, but we'll continue to build on encouraging progress being made in so many areas across our company. With that, let's open it up to questions. Operator?"

We know we have to go out there and earn the business in a much more competitive market. And I think Ross and Lynn and the team are really as we talked about last quarter a little bit painful in the short term as we restructured the sales force but getting the new skill sets and the new approach to selling that we've previously discussed, it's just vitally important for us going forward. As far as Homepage or anything else, I think we're selling value there, and I'm don't -- I honestly don't have any comments on pricing and yield, other than we saw a pretty good yield overall for the quarter. It wasn't out of line, it wasn't materially down, it wasn't materially up. I think it was a pretty solid performance on yield, there are a lot of efforts go into that. But again, we've got a lot of value to sell and I think the teams are doing a good job of that."

In terms of could APAC stand-alone, it's really a very integrated company when you look at how we run our infrastructure and our platforms, so it's a little bit tough for me to envision that.

On the premium side, we're going to continue to ramp up our sales force. Our sellthrough rates will continue as we start to sell over these multiple quarters, not only in the new sales approach, but the tent poles and anchor strategy, combined with the new tools we're providing the sales force and the partnerships that we're striking. I think they're great. Yes, a lot of them are WebShare, but that is completely additional revenue, incremental revenue for us. It's a terrific margin. So I feel great about ABC, working well with Facebook, working well with a number of video producers. So that part, are really, I see it with the position that we have in terms of audience in the #1 ranking of our properties in the U.S. and in some of them worldwide, where we have a lot of strengths we can bring to the game, and we're looking to grow in as many different ways on the premium side as we can. This isn't just a 1 trick game. On the nonpremium side or nonguaranteed side, I think there is a lot of fragmentation out there. I think that's what we all see in the market. But let's break it down into 2 things, supply and yield. On the supply side, we can still do a lot to drive Page views with new and better content, our tent poles and Akers strategy again there, we can do a better job of packaging and ad solutions, a better job of programming, our page views to the right places, impressions per Page view. In terms of really increasing those, is there any tweaking and optimizing our product, especially our new ones especially like Mail and the new platform in a row that our and news to improve that. So all of that, I think, are great opportunities to help us out on the supply side. And then on the yield side, we have, we continue to make improvements in RMX technology and the architecture there with regard to budgets moving, auction design, deepening the auction participation, our prediction, algorithms, in matching algorithms, all have great opportunity for us to expand, to improve and expand. So both sides, honestly, I really see our ability to do better and we've got great plans in place on both the region and product sides to do so."

Third quarter, you're right, 20% that's up a couple of points versus last year so we feel good about that, too, which if you string all the quarters together, it adds up to another year of margin expansion, which is a great objective for us. You take the cost guidance that I just gave and you look back a few years, I think we're down something like, what the implied guidance would give you something like $1.3 billion over the last few years. There's been an awful lot of work to reorient the company, refocus the company. There is a lot of great cost productivity work that's gone into it. But an awful lot of reinvestment as well. And probably directed to the last couple of Investor Days that we've done where I've laid out pretty exquisitely our cost structure and the amount in the areas where we see efficiencies, and more importantly, the amount in the areas that we see for investment in the company. And we really are quite bullish on where we can take some of these investment areas and the growth that we can generate. So as we go forward, our goal was really to balance the investment in the other growth opportunities with the productivity focus, get a good blend of the 2, and continue to move the business forward. We've talked previously about operating margin goals and I said at Investor Day in May, this past May, that it will be largely because of the structure is kind of right on track and maybe a little bit ahead of schedule, it's largely going to be dependent on our revenue growth. So that's really the focus, is we really need to see where all of this work on platforms, in content strategies, et cetera, starts to really bear fruit and give us the revenue growth."

So on the RPS extension, it's just kind of interesting because this is all be a great outcome for Yahoo!, but it comes with the expense of Microsoft financially. So can you help us understand why they chose to extend the guarantee if they're not contractually bound? Are there any things that Yahoo! and Microsoft are talking about in terms of partnering that would give Microsoft incentive to do this and potentially extend the financial hit? Or they just feel they're going to close the gap and just buy additional time? And then the question on Display is, just trying to reconcile the 30% EMEA, APAC comment. Is that x currency or is that on a dollar basis? And then can you just talk about your media Page view growth in those regions versus the U.S.? Is the 9% overall company average? Is that consistent across regions or is it Europe and APAC growing any faster than the U.S. in that category?"

There's a little currency in there. I think it's roughly 20%, excluding the currencies, it's pretty robust regardless. And media page view growth international versus U.S., honestly, I don't really look at it that way. We look at it more of on properties. But I'm going to venture I guess that with a lot of the LEGO rollouts that sort of Yahoo! publishing platform rollouts that it's really been much more internationally focused. I think that's created some nice inventory Page view, less internationally. So I'm just going to guess that it's roughly the same, maybe a little bit more in EMEA, APAC potentially."

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our discussion of third quarter 2011 financial results. We are pleased that revenue, operating income and EPS were all above consensus estimates this quarter and look forward to discussing the details of our performance with you. In addition to these financial results, the key operating take away, our underscore is that we remain focused on executing against our key strategies to build best-in-class technology, deepen the quality and personalization of our content, and grow monetization. Before I get into the details of our results, let me reiterate what the Board has said about its comprehensive strategic review process. The board is actively looking at the full range of options available to return the company to a path of robust growth and industry-leading innovation. The objective is to deliver on our company's potential and to create value for our employees, advertisers, users and our shareholders. The Board also has said that when it has something to announce, it will do so. That will take time. It will not be today and not on this call. For the rest of my comments, we'll focus on third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. 
Let's begin with an overview of third quarter. On the top line, our 3Q ex-TAC revenue of $1,072,000,000 was fractionally below the midpoint of our guidance range. Our operating income of $177 million was above the high end of our range and ex-TAC operating margins were higher than we expected and roughly flat with last year's third quarter at 17%. Earnings per share were $0.23. Adjusted EPS were $0.21, which is up 32% versus 3Q a year ago. This excludes a $25 million onetime gain in 3Q '11 related to our ownership in Alibaba Group, and also a $186 million gain on the sale of HotJobs from the prior year. We are also very pleased to have repurchased 44 million shares for $593 million during the quarter. 
Diving into revenue in more detail, worldwide ex-TAC Display revenue was flat year-over-year at $449 million, below our expectations for modest growth. Premium Display revenue grew versus prior year, helped by Page View growth of 9% on our media properties. By contrast, nonpremium Display revenue declined due to lower impressions in yield. As in 2Q, Display revenue in EMEA and APAC performed well, growing nearly 30% versus 2010. In Americas, we're seeing some positive momentum and some headwinds. On the plus side, our media properties are seeing growth in sell-through rates, solid impressions and revenue for premium or guaranteed placements. However, declines in nonguaranteed placements across Mail and other high-reach sites contributed to an overall Display revenue decline in the Americas region. 
We told you last quarter that we're restructuring the U.S. sales force and I'm happy to report that we're seeing signs of progress. Our headcount has stabilized, we continue to hire aggressively in sales and we have great additional talent in the pipeline. As you all know, it takes time to reestablish and refine the account coverage and budgets are both well ahead of time, so our efforts are a work in progress. But sales productivity is ramping up. We see it in the sequential improvements in premium revenue, sell-through and solid impressions that I just mentioned, as well as in key areas like our home page, where we sold more premium placements in 3Q than we did in 2Q. We expect to see increased efficiency in expanding growth opportunities as the new team gets fully ramped up and sells over multiple quarters. Along those lines, there continue to be encouraging signs we can point to. 
During the quarter, we ran major campaigns for many of leading brands, including P&G, Visa, Dodge, Toyota, Jaguar, AT&T, Bank of America, Levi's and Paramount Pictures, as well as all of the major TV networks who promoted their new fall TV lineups. But it's clear there's still work to do. Continuing to expand sales force capacity and sell-through over multiple quarters will enable our premium strategy to fully take hold. On the nonpremium side, we're taking actions to improve both our overall supply and ad serving as well as our yield, including marketplace demand, sell-through and technology capabilities. Important, however, to put these combined efforts into the larger context of improvements in technology and content that will drive engagement and, therefore, position us for future Display revenue growth. 
With that in mind, I'll quickly run through several key areas of progress for you. First, technology. We brought up 28 sites on the new Yahoo! Publishing platform since the end of last quarter, bringing the total to 95. And we also launched Yahoo! News activity, a new way for users to discover content on Yahoo! News by seeing what their Facebook friends are reading. Second, content, several examples here. We've recently introduced a broad strategic alliance with ABC News, underscoring our commitment to premium content. And 9/11 remembered, our 9/11 anniversary site, generated more than 300 million page views and more than 250 million photo views. We're also securing exclusive content such as the online interview with President Obama 2 weeks ago and the Clinton Foundation concert, which we broadcast live on Yahoo! this past weekend. 
Lastly, I'd like to emphasize an important progress in video. We just launched our new video destination, Yahoo! Screen, along with our slate of 8 new original video programs targeted at women. Even before this launch, everyone of the top 10 in 13 of the top 15 original video programs on the Web in the U.S. is from Yahoo!. 
Turning now to Search. Third quarter ex-TAC revenue was $374 million, ahead of our expectations. Owned and Operated revenue was slightly better than expected and continued to benefit from the Microsoft RPS guarantee. With respect to operational Search metrics, our worldwide O&O query volume was down mid-single digits versus last year and worldwide RPS was up mid-single digits. In the U.S. marketplace, where we fully transitioned to Microsoft systems, query volume in RPS, including the guarantee, were both up slightly. Once again, operational RPS in the U.S. grew sequentially as both Microsoft and Yahoo! completed initiatives to close the gap. At the end of 3Q, we had closed nearly 30% of the RPS gap that existed in April. 
In order to create more financial certainty, Microsoft and Yahoo! recently agreed to extend the RPS guarantee in the U.S. and Canada through March 2013. We will continue our joint work with Microsoft to close the remaining gap as quickly as possible, and we're obviously working to do so before that time frame. Both companies remain fully committed to the success of our Search Alliance and the RPS guarantee extension represents an important sign of that commitment. 
With respect to the progress of the algo [algorithmic] transition, as we discussed last quarter, our stated goal was to complete the transition of all markets by the end of this year. We expect that goal to be achieved next month. We have transitioned O&O and syndication partners in over 40 markets from Yahoo! Search to Microsoft, for Web, image, and video algo Search results across both desktop and mobile. One algo search market remains to be completed, that's Korea, which we plan to transition in November. 
Finally, we also completed the Page Search transition in India this quarter and expect to begin transition activities for additional page search markets early in 2012, following the holiday season. 
With that review of our core business dynamics, I'll now turn to the value of each of our Asian assets. First, on Japan, based on public market data as of September 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan was $6.4 billion. Our efforts to unlock shareholder value on a tax efficient basis are ongoing, but potential transactions are complex and generally involve extended timeframes to complete. 
And with respect to Alibaba group, using the pending third-party tender offer from employee-owned shares as a value guide based on the number of shares Yahoo! owns and the proposed offering price, we believe our investment in Alibaba Group will be valued at just over $14 billion on a pretax basis. 
Finally, turning to fourth quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,125,000,000 to $1,235,000,000. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $925 million to $975 million for fourth quarter, with the midpoint up roughly $55 million sequentially due primarily to seasonality and continued investments in sales force buildout and video. Recall that we fully utilized the $150 million transition allowance from Microsoft to ongoing transition work as reflected in our cost structure. We are managing that transition cost within the parameters of our overall profitability goals. 
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for 4Q operating income is $230 million, implying 20% for ex-TAC operating margin. Before I close, I want to say a sincere thank you to all of the Yahoo! employees around the world who remain focused on our plan and continue to work hard on our progress. Their focus and that of the leadership team is to move the business forward with new technology, partnerships, products and premium personalized content. Much more premiums to be done, but we'll continue to build on encouraging progress being made in so many areas across our company. 
With that, let's open it up to questions. Operator?"

But really, this is an overriding concern of ours of working with our partner, Microsoft, and working very well with them to address the concern that we've heard consistently from investors. So we feel very, very good about that. On your second question, the Comms and Communities' page views, they're right about in the same level, 8%, 9%. You're right, it's a big difference though on the minutes, and that is really attributable to the rollout of our new Mail product that's gaining some pretty wide acceptance here at this point. We designed it to improve engagement, and I think that's working early on here as indicated by the jump up in minutes."

But getting the new skill sets and the new approach to selling that we've previously discussed, it's just vitally important for us going forward. As far as home page or anything else, I think we're selling value there, and I don't -- I honestly don't have any comments on pricing and yield other than we saw a pretty good yield overall for the quarter. It wasn't out of line, it wasn't materially down, it wasn't materially up. I think it was a pretty solid performance on yield, there are a lot of efforts that go into that. But again, we've got a lot of value to sell and I think the teams are doing a good job of that."

On the premium side, we're going to continue to ramp up our sales force. Our sell-through rates will continue as we start to sell over these multiple quarters as in the not only the new sales approach, but the tent poles and anchor strategy, combined with the new tools we're providing the sales force and the partnerships that we're striking. I think they're great. Yes, a lot of them are web share, but that is completely additional revenue, incremental revenue for us. It's a terrific margin. So I feel great about ABC, working well with Facebook, working well with a number of video producers. So that part, I really, I see it -- with the position that we have in terms of audience in the #1 ranking of our properties in the U.S. and in some of them worldwide, where we have a lot of strengths we can bring to the game, and we're looking to grow in as many different ways on the premium side as we can. This isn't just a 1-trick game. On the nonpremium side or nonguaranteed side, I think there is a lot of fragmentation out there. I think that's what we all see in the market. But let's break it down into 2 things: supply and yield. On the supply side, we can still do a lot to drive Page views with new and better content, our tent poles and anchors strategy again there. Better if we can do a better job of packaging and ad solutions, a better job of programming to direct our page views to the right places, impressions per Page view. In terms of really increasing those, tweaking and optimizing our product, especially our new ones like Mail and the new platform that just rolled out on News to improve that. So all of that, I think, are great opportunities to help us out on the supply side. And then on the yield side, we have -- we continue to make improvements in RMX technology and the architecture there with regard to budgets moving, auction design, deepening the auction participation, our prediction, algorithms, in matching algorithms, all have great opportunity for us to expand, to improve and expand. So both sides, honestly, I really see our ability to do better and we've got great plans in place on both the region and product sides to do so."

Fourth quarter, you're right, 20% that's up a couple of points versus last year so we feel good about that too, which, if you string all the quarters together, it adds up to another year of margin expansion, which is a great objective for us. You take the cost guidance that I just gave and you look back a few years, I think we're down something like, what the implied guidance would give you something like $1.3 billion over the last few years. There's been an awful lot of work to reorient the company, refocus the company. There is a lot of great cost productivity work that's gone into it. But an awful lot of reinvestment as well. I'd probably direct you to the last couple of Investor Days that we've done where I've laid out pretty explicitly our cost structure and the amount in the areas where we see efficiencies, and more importantly, the amount in the areas that we see for investment in the company. And we really are quite bullish on where we can take some of these investment areas and the growth that we can generate. So as we go forward, our goal was really to balance the investment in the outer growth opportunities with the productivity focus, get a good blend of the 2, and continue to move the business forward. We've talked previously about operating margin goals and I said at Investor Day in May, this past May, that it'll be largely -- because of the structure is kind of right on track, maybe a little ahead of schedule, it's largely going to be dependent on our revenue growth. So that's really the focus, is we really need to see where all of this work on platforms, in content strategies, et cetera, starts to really bear fruit and give us the revenue growth."

So on the RPS extension, it's just kind of interesting because this is obviously a great outcome for Yahoo!, but it comes with the expense of Microsoft financially. So can you help us understand why they chose to extend the guarantee if they're not contractually bound? Are there other things that Yahoo! and Microsoft are talking about in terms of partnering that would give Microsoft incentive to do this and potentially extend the financial hit? Or do they just feel they're going to close the gap and just bide additional time? And then the question on Display, I'm just trying to reconcile the 30% EMEA, APAC comment. Is that x currency or is that on a dollar basis? And then can you just talk about your media Page view growth in those regions versus the U.S.? Is the 9% overall company average?

There is a little currency in there. I think it's roughly 20%, excluding the currencies, so it's pretty robust regardless. And then media Page view growth international versus U.S., honestly, I don't really look at it that way. We look at it more on properties. But I'm going to venture a guess that with a lot of the Waygo [ph] rollouts or the Yahoo! publishing platform rollouts that it's really been much more internationally-focused. I think that's created some nice inventory Page view, less internationally. So I'm just going to guess that it's roughly the same, maybe a little bit more in EMEA and APAC potentially."

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our discussion of third quarter 2011 financial results. We are pleased that revenue, operating income and EPS were all above consensus estimates this quarter and look forward to discussing the details of our performance with you. In addition to these financial results, the key operating take away, I’ll underscore is that we remain focused on executing against our key strategies to build best-in-class technology, deepen the quality and personalization of our content, and grow monetization. Before I get into the details of our results, let me reiterate what the Board has said about its comprehensive strategic review process. The board is actively looking at the full range of options available to return the company to a path of robust growth and industry-leading innovation. The objective is to deliver on our company's potential and to create value for our employees, advertisers, users and our shareholders. The Board also has said that when it has something to announce, it will do so. That will take time. It will not be today and not on this call. For the rest of my comments, we'll focus on third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. 
Let's begin with an overview of third quarter. On the top line, our 3Q ex-TAC revenue of $1,072,000,000 was fractionally below the midpoint of our guidance range. Our operating income of $177 million was above the high end of our range and ex-TAC operating margins were higher than we expected and roughly flat with last year's third quarter at 17%. Earnings per share were $0.23. Adjusted EPS were $0.21, which is up 32% versus 3Q a year ago. This excludes a $25 million onetime gain in 3Q '11 related to our ownership in Alibaba Group, and also a $186 million gain on the sale of HotJobs from the prior year. We are also very pleased to have repurchased 44 million shares for $593 million during the quarter. 
Diving into revenue in more detail, worldwide ex-TAC Display revenue was flat year-over-year at $449 million, below our expectations for modest growth. Premium Display revenue grew versus prior year, helped by Page View growth of 9% on our media properties. By contrast, nonpremium Display revenue declined due to lower impressions in yield. As in 2Q, Display revenue in EMEA and APAC performed well, growing nearly 30% versus 2010. In Americas, we're seeing some positive momentum and some headwinds. On the plus side, our media properties are seeing growth in sell-through rates, serving impressions and revenue for premium or guaranteed placements. However, declines in nonguaranteed placements across Mail and other high-reach sites contributed to an overall Display revenue decline in the Americas region. 
We told you last quarter that we're restructuring the U.S. sales force and I'm happy to report that we're seeing signs of progress. Our headcount has stabilized, we continue to hire aggressively in sales and we have great additional talent in the pipeline. As you all know, it takes time to reestablish and refine the account coverage and budgets are both well ahead of time, so our efforts are a work in progress. But sales productivity is ramping up. We see it in the sequential improvements in premium revenue, sell-through and serving impressions that I just mentioned, as well as in key areas like our home page, where we sold more premium placements in 3Q than we did in 2Q. We expect to see increased efficiency in expanding growth opportunities as the new team gets fully ramped up and sells over multiple quarters. Along those lines, there continue to be encouraging signs we can point to. 
During the quarter, we ran major campaigns for many leading brands, including P&G, Visa, Dodge, Toyota, Jaguar, AT&T, Bank of America, Levi's and Paramount Pictures, as well as all of the major TV networks who promoted their new fall TV lineups. But it's clear there's still work to do. Continuing to expand sales force capacity and sell-through over multiple quarters will enable our premium strategy to fully take hold. On the nonpremium side, we're taking actions to improve both our overall supply and ad serving as well as our yield, including marketplace demand, sell-through and technology capabilities. Important, however, to put these combined efforts into the larger context of improvements in technology and content that will drive engagement and, therefore, position us for future Display revenue growth. 
With that in mind, I'll quickly run through several key areas of progress for you. First, technology. We brought up 28 sites on the new Yahoo! Publishing platform since the end of last quarter, bringing the total to 95. And we also launched Yahoo! News activity, a new way for users to discover content on Yahoo! News by seeing what their Facebook friends are reading. Second, content, several examples here. We've recently introduced a broad strategic alliance with ABC News, underscoring our commitment to premium content. And 9/11 remembered, our 9/11 anniversary site, generated more than 300 million page views and more than 250 million photo views. We're also securing exclusive content such as the online interview with President Obama 2 weeks ago and the Clinton Foundation concert, which we broadcast live on Yahoo! this past weekend. 
Lastly, I'd like to emphasize an important progress in video. We just launched our new video destination, Yahoo! Screen, along with our slate of 8 new original video programs targeted at women. Even before this launch, everyone of the top 10 in 13 of the top 15 original video programs on the Web in the U.S. is from Yahoo!. 
Turning now to Search. Third quarter ex-TAC revenue was $374 million, ahead of our expectations. Owned and Operated revenue was slightly better than expected and continued to benefit from the Microsoft RPS guarantee. With respect to operational Search metrics, our worldwide O&O query volume was down mid-single digits versus last year and worldwide RPS was up mid-single digits. In the U.S. marketplace, where we fully transitioned to Microsoft systems, query volume in RPS, including the guarantee, were both up slightly. Once again, operational RPS in the U.S. grew sequentially as both Microsoft and Yahoo! completed initiatives to close the gap. At the end of 3Q, we had closed nearly 30% of the RPS gap that existed in April. 
In order to create more financial certainty, Microsoft and Yahoo! recently agreed to extend the RPS guarantee in the U.S. and Canada through March 2013. We will continue our joint work with Microsoft to close the remaining gap as quickly as possible, and we're obviously working to do so before that time frame. Both companies remain fully committed to the success of our Search Alliance and the RPS guarantee extension represents an important sign of that commitment. 
With respect to the progress of the algo [algorithmic] transition, as we discussed last quarter, our stated goal was to complete the transition of all markets by the end of this year. We expect that goal to be achieved next month. We have transitioned O&O and syndication partners in over 40 markets from Yahoo! Search to Microsoft, for Web, image, and video algo Search results across both desktop and mobile. One algo search market remains to be completed, that's Korea, which we plan to transition in November. 
Finally, we also completed the Page Search transition in India this quarter and expect to begin transition activities for additional page search markets early in 2012, following the holiday season. 
With that review of our core business dynamics, I'll now turn to the values of each of our Asian assets. First, on Japan, based on public market data as of September 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan was $6.4 billion. Our efforts to unlock shareholder value on a tax efficient basis are ongoing, but potential transactions are complex and generally involve extended timeframes to complete. 
And with respect to Alibaba group, using the pending third-party tender offer from employee-owned shares as a value guide based on the number of shares Yahoo! owns and the proposed offering price, we believe our investment in Alibaba Group will be valued at just over $14 billion on a pretax basis. 
Finally, turning to fourth quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,125,000,000 to $1,235,000,000. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $925 million to $975 million for fourth quarter, with the midpoint up roughly $55 million sequentially due primarily to seasonality and continued investments in sales force buildout and video. Recall that we fully utilized the $150 million transition allowance from Microsoft so ongoing transition work as reflected in our cost structure. We are managing that transition cost within the parameters of our overall profitability goals. 
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for 4Q operating income is $230 million, implying 20% for ex-TAC operating margin. Before I close, I want to say a sincere thank you to all of the Yahoo! employees around the world who remain focused on our plan and continue to work hard on our progress. Their focus and that of the leadership team is to move the business forward with new technology, partnerships, products and premium personalized content. Much more premiums to be done, but we'll continue to build on encouraging progress being made in so many areas across our company. 
With that, let's open it up to questions. Operator?"

We are still working to close that gap, absolutely as soon as we possibly can and we've made some nice progress, as I talked about in the script. But really, this is an overriding concern of ours of working with our partner, Microsoft, and working very well with them to address the concern that we've heard consistently from investors. So we feel very, very good about that. On your second question, the Comms and Communities' page views, they're right about in the same level, 8%, 9%. You're right, it's a big difference though on the minutes, and that is really attributable to the rollout of our new Mail product that's gaining some pretty wide acceptance here at this point. We designed it to improve engagement, and I think that's working early on here as indicated by the jump up in minutes."

As far as home page or anything else, I think we're selling value there, and I don't -- I honestly don't have any comments on pricing and yield other than we saw a pretty good yield overall for the quarter.

On the premium side, we're going to continue to ramp up our sales force. Our sell-through rates will continue as we start to sell over these multiple quarters as in the not only the new sales approach, but the tent poles and anchor strategy, combined with the new tools we're providing the sales force and the partnerships that we're striking. I think they're great. Yes, a lot of them are web share, but that is completely additional revenue, incremental revenue for us. It's a terrific margin. So I feel great about ABC, working well with Facebook, working well with a number of video producers. So that part, I really, I see it -- with the position that we have in terms of audience in the #1 ranking of our properties in the U.S. and in some of them worldwide, where we have a lot of strengths we can bring to the game, and we're looking to grow in as many different ways on the premium side as we can. This isn't just a 1-trick game. On the nonpremium side or nonguaranteed side, I think there is a lot of fragmentation out there. I think that's what we all see in the market. But let's break it down into 2 things: supply and yield. On the supply side, we can still do a lot to drive Page views with new and better content, our tent poles and anchors strategy again there. Better if we can do a better job of packaging and ad solutions, a better job of programming to direct our page views to the right places, impressions per Page view. In terms of really increasing those, tweaking and optimizing our product, especially our new ones like Mail and the new platform that just rolled out on News to improve that. So all of that, I think, are great opportunities to help us out on the supply side. And then on the yield side, we have -- we continue to make improvements in RMX technology and the architecture there with regard to budgets moving, auction design, deepening the auction participation, our prediction, algorithms, in matching algorithms, all have great opportunity for us to expand, to improve and expand. So both sides, honestly, I really see our ability to do better and we've got great plans in place on both the region and product sides to do so."

Fourth quarter, you're right, 20% that's up a couple of points versus last year so we feel good about that too, which, if you string all the quarters together, it adds up to another year of margin expansion, which is a great objective for us. You take the cost guidance that I just gave and you look back a few years, I think we're down something like, what the implied guidance would give you something like $1.3 billion over the last few years. There's been an awful lot of work to reorient the company, refocus the company. There is a lot of great cost productivity work that's gone into it. But an awful lot of reinvestment as well. I'd probably direct you to the last couple of Investor Days that we've done where I've laid out pretty explicitly our cost structure and the amount in the areas where we see efficiencies, and more importantly, the amount in the areas that we see for investment in the company. And we really are quite bullish on where we can take some of these investment areas and the growth that we can generate. So as we go forward, our goal was really to balance the investment in the outer growth opportunities with the productivity focus, get a good blend of the 2, and continue to move the business forward. We've talked previously about operating margin goals and I said at Investor Day in May, this past May, that it'll be largely -- because of the structure is kind of right on track, maybe a little ahead of schedule, it's largely going to be dependent on our revenue growth. So that's really the focus, is we really need to see where all of this work on platforms, in content strategies, et cetera, starts to really bear fruit and give us the revenue growth."

So on the RPS extension, it's just kind of interesting because this is obviously a great outcome for Yahoo!, but it comes with the expense of Microsoft financially. So can you help us understand why they chose to extend the guarantee if they're not contractually bound? Are there other things that Yahoo! and Microsoft are talking about in terms of partnering that would give Microsoft incentive to do this and potentially extend the financial hit? Or do they just feel they're going to close the gap and just bide additional time? And then the question on Display, I'm just trying to reconcile the 30% EMEA, APAC comment. Is that x currency or is that on a dollar basis? And then can you just talk about your media Page view growth in those regions versus the U.S.? Is the 9% overall company average?

There is a little currency in there. I think it's roughly 20%, excluding the currencies, so it's pretty robust regardless. And then media Page view growth international versus U.S., honestly, I don't really look at it that way. We look at it more on properties. But I'm going to venture a guess that with a lot of the LEGO] rollouts or the Yahoo! publishing platform rollouts that it's really been much more internationally-focused. I think that's created some nice inventory Page view, less internationally. So I'm just going to guess that it's roughly the same, maybe a little bit more in EMEA and APAC potentially."

Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our discussion of third quarter 2011 financial results. We are pleased that revenue, operating income and EPS were all above consensus estimates this quarter and look forward to discussing the details of our performance with you. In addition to these financial results, the key operating take away, our underscore is that we remain focused on executing against our key strategies to build best-in-class technology, deepen the quality and personalization of our content, and grow monetization. Before I get into the details of our results, let me reiterate what the Board has said about its comprehensive strategic review process. The board is actively looking at the full range of options available to return the company to a path of robust growth and industry-leading innovation. The objective is to deliver on our company's potential and to create value for our employees, advertisers, users and our shareholders. The Board also has said that when it has something to announce, it will do so. That will take time. It will not be today and not on this call. For the rest of my comments, we'll focus on third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. 
Let's begin with an overview of third quarter. On the top line, our 3Q ex-TAC revenue of $1,072,000,000 was fractionally below the midpoint of our guidance range. Our operating income of $177 million was above the high end of our range and ex-TAC operating margins were higher than we expected and roughly flat with last year's third quarter at 17%. Earnings per share were $0.23. Adjusted EPS were $0.21, which is up 32% versus 3Q a year ago. This excludes a $25 million onetime gain in 3Q '11 related to our ownership in Alibaba Group, and also a $186 million gain on the sale of HotJobs from the prior year. We are also very pleased to have repurchased 44 million shares for $593 million during the quarter. 
Diving into revenue in more detail, worldwide ex-TAC Display revenue was flat year-over-year at $449 million, below our expectations for modest growth. Premium Display revenue grew versus prior year, helped by Page View growth of 9% on our media properties. By contrast, nonpremium Display revenue declined due to lower impressions in yield. As in 2Q, Display revenue in EMEA and APAC performed well, growing nearly 30% versus 2010. In Americas, we're seeing some positive momentum and some headwinds. On the plus side, our media properties are seeing growth in sell-through rates, serving impressions and revenue for premium or guaranteed placements. However, declines in nonguaranteed placements across Mail and other high-reach sites contributed to an overall Display revenue decline in the Americas region. 
We told you last quarter that we're restructuring the U.S. sales force and I'm happy to report that we're seeing signs of progress. Our headcount has stabilized, we continue to hire aggressively in sales and we have great additional talent in the pipeline. As you all know, it takes time to reestablish and refine the account coverage and budgets are both well ahead of time, so our efforts are a work in progress. But sales productivity is ramping up. We see it in the sequential improvements in premium revenue, sell-through and serving impressions that I just mentioned, as well as in key areas like our home page, where we sold more premium placements in 3Q than we did in 2Q. We expect to see increased efficiency in expanding growth opportunities as the new team gets fully ramped up and sells over multiple quarters. Along those lines, there continue to be encouraging signs we can point to. 
During the quarter, we ran major campaigns for many leading brands, including P&G, Visa, Dodge, Toyota, Jaguar, AT&T, Bank of America, Levi's and Paramount Pictures, as well as all of the major TV networks who promoted their new fall TV lineups. But it's clear there's still work to do. Continuing to expand sales force capacity and sell-through over multiple quarters will enable our premium strategy to fully take hold. On the nonpremium side, we're taking actions to improve both our overall supply and ad serving as well as our yield, including marketplace demand, sell-through and technology capabilities. Important, however, to put these combined efforts into the larger context of improvements in technology and content that will drive engagement and, therefore, position us for future Display revenue growth. 
With that in mind, I'll quickly run through several key areas of progress for you. First, technology. We brought up 28 sites on the new Yahoo! Publishing platform since the end of last quarter, bringing the total to 95. And we also launched Yahoo! News activity, a new way for users to discover content on Yahoo! News by seeing what their Facebook friends are reading. Second, content, several examples here. We've recently introduced a broad strategic alliance with ABC News, underscoring our commitment to premium content. And 9/11 remembered, our 9/11 anniversary site, generated more than 300 million page views and more than 250 million photo views. We're also securing exclusive content such as the online interview with President Obama 2 weeks ago and the Clinton Foundation concert, which we broadcast live on Yahoo! this past weekend. 
Lastly, I'd like to emphasize an important progress in video. We just launched our new video destination, Yahoo! Screen, along with our slate of 8 new original video programs targeted at women. Even before this launch, everyone of the top 10 in 13 of the top 15 original video programs on the Web in the U.S. is from Yahoo!. 
Turning now to Search. Third quarter ex-TAC revenue was $374 million, ahead of our expectations. Owned and Operated revenue was slightly better than expected and continued to benefit from the Microsoft RPS guarantee. With respect to operational Search metrics, our worldwide O&O query volume was down mid-single digits versus last year and worldwide RPS was up mid-single digits. In the U.S. marketplace, where we fully transitioned to Microsoft systems, query volume in RPS, including the guarantee, were both up slightly. Once again, operational RPS in the U.S. grew sequentially as both Microsoft and Yahoo! completed initiatives to close the gap. At the end of 3Q, we had closed nearly 30% of the RPS gap that existed in April. 
In order to create more financial certainty, Microsoft and Yahoo! recently agreed to extend the RPS guarantee in the U.S. and Canada through March 2013. We will continue our joint work with Microsoft to close the remaining gap as quickly as possible, and we're obviously working to do so before that time frame. Both companies remain fully committed to the success of our Search Alliance and the RPS guarantee extension represents an important sign of that commitment. 
With respect to the progress of the algo [algorithmic] transition, as we discussed last quarter, our stated goal was to complete the transition of all markets by the end of this year. We expect that goal to be achieved next month. We have transitioned O&O and syndication partners in over 40 markets from Yahoo! Search to Microsoft, for Web, image, and video algo Search results across both desktop and mobile. One algo search market remains to be completed, that's Korea, which we plan to transition in November. 
Finally, we also completed the Page Search transition in India this quarter and expect to begin transition activities for additional page search markets early in 2012, following the holiday season. 
With that review of our core business dynamics, I'll now turn to the values of each of our Asian assets. First, on Japan, based on public market data as of September 30, the pretax value of our 35% stake in Yahoo! Japan was $6.4 billion. Our efforts to unlock shareholder value on a tax efficient basis are ongoing, but potential transactions are complex and generally involve extended timeframes to complete. 
And with respect to Alibaba group, using the pending third-party tender offer from employee-owned shares as a value guide based on the number of shares Yahoo! owns and the proposed offering price, we believe our investment in Alibaba Group will be valued at just over $14 billion on a pretax basis. 
Finally, turning to fourth quarter guidance. We expect ex-TAC revenue to be in the range of $1,125,000,000 to $1,235,000,000. For ex-TAC expenses, we expect a range of $925 million to $975 million for fourth quarter, with the midpoint up roughly $55 million sequentially due primarily to seasonality and continued investments in sales force buildout and video. Recall that we fully utilized the $150 million transition allowance from Microsoft to ongoing transition work as reflected in our cost structure. We are managing that transition cost within the parameters of our overall profitability goals. 
At the midpoint of these revenue and expense expectations, our outlook for 4Q operating income is $230 million, implying 20% for ex-TAC operating margin. Before I close, I want to say a sincere thank you to all of the Yahoo! employees around the world who remain focused on our plan and continue to work hard on our progress. Their focus and that of the leadership team is to move the business forward with new technology, partnerships, products and premium personalized content. Much more premiums to be done, but we'll continue to build on encouraging progress being made in so many areas across our company. 
With that, let's open it up to questions. Operator?"

Our sell-through rates will continue as we start to sell over these multiple quarters as in the not only the new sales approach, but the tent poles and anchor strategy, combined with the new tools we're providing the sales force and the partnerships that we're striking. I think they're great. Yes, a lot of them are web share, but that is completely additional revenue, incremental revenue for us. It's a terrific margin. So I feel great about ABC, working well with Facebook, working well with a number of video producers. So that part, I really, I see it -- with the position that we have in terms of audience in the #1 ranking of our properties in the U.S. and in some of them worldwide, where we have a lot of strengths we can bring to the game, and we're looking to grow in as many different ways on the premium side as we can. This isn't just a 1-trick game. On the nonpremium side or nonguaranteed side, I think there is a lot of fragmentation out there. I think that's what we all see in the market. But let's break it down into 2 things: supply and yield. On the supply side, we can still do a lot to drive Page views with new and better content, our tent poles and anchors strategy again there. Better if we can do a better job of packaging and ad solutions, a better job of programming to direct our page views to the right places, impressions per Page view. In terms of really increasing those, tweaking and optimizing our product, especially our new ones like Mail and the new platform that just rolled out on News to improve that. So all of that, I think, are great opportunities to help us out on the supply side. And then on the yield side, we have -- we continue to make improvements in RMX technology and the architecture there with regard to budgets moving, auction design, deepening the auction participation, our prediction, algorithms, in matching algorithms, all have great opportunity for us to expand, to improve and expand. So both sides, honestly, I really see our ability to do better and we've got great plans in place on both the region and product sides to do so."

Fourth quarter, you're right, 20% that's up a couple of points versus last year so we feel good about that too, which, if you string all the quarters together, it adds up to another year of margin expansion, which is a great objective for us. You take the cost guidance that I just gave and you look back a few years, I think we're down something like, what the implied guidance would give you something like $1.3 billion over the last few years. There's been an awful lot of work to reorient the company, refocus the company. There is a lot of great cost productivity work that's gone into it. But an awful lot of reinvestment as well. I'd probably direct you to the last couple of Investor Days that we've done where I've laid out pretty explicitly our cost structure and the amount in the areas where we see efficiencies, and more importantly, the amount in the areas that we see for investment in the company. And we really are quite bullish on where we can take some of these investment areas and the growth that we can generate. So as we go forward, our goal was really to balance the investment in the outer growth opportunities with the productivity focus, get a good blend of the 2, and continue to move the business forward. We've talked previously about operating margin goals and I said at Investor Day in May, this past May, that it'll be largely -- because of the structure is kind of right on track, maybe a little ahead of schedule, it's largely going to be dependent on our revenue growth. So that's really the focus, is we really need to see where all of this work on platforms, in content strategies, et cetera, starts to really bear fruit and give us the revenue growth."

Is this because you had to use it up more right media had during the quarter or as per one previous question, there were some concessions given on pricing? Or a third option is potentially better Communications and Communities Page views are a disproportionately bigger percentage of total. So if you can provide some insight into that, that would be appreciated."

The premium side was up in the low single digits. The nonpremium or nonguaranteed side was down a little bit. It really, on the premium side, we saw, again, a pretty good job on volume, the sales force did a nice job there, sell-through was good, pricing was solid. On the nonguaranteed side, there was -- we are a little bit light on both the volume and the yield side. So I don't know if I'd refer that necessarily as pricing. But as I said, we're working on yield improvements, and I think there's great opportunity for us to continue to improve yield there and I went through the list earlier about the RMX architecture improvements that we're working on between budgets moving and option design, et cetera. So that's really what's going on. The premium side, pretty solid on both dimensions, a little bit weaker on the nonguaranteed side on both of those dimensions. But we've actively got some good focus on that, probably a better focus on that, I would say, than we have historically had."

So on the RPS extension, it's just kind of interesting because this is obviously a great outcome for Yahoo!, but it comes with the expense of Microsoft financially. So can you help us understand why they chose to extend the guarantee if they're not contractually bound? Are there other things that Yahoo! and Microsoft are talking about in terms of partnering that would give Microsoft incentive to do this and potentially extend the financial hit? Or do they just feel they're going to close the gap and just bide additional time? And then the question on Display, I'm just trying to reconcile the 30% EMEA, APAC comment. Is that x currency or is that on a dollar basis? And then can you just talk about your media Page view growth in those regions versus the U.S.? Is the 9% overall company average? Is that consistent across regions or is Europe and APAC growing any faster than the U.S. in that category?"

I know why we did it. We wanted to provide more financial certainty. We heard loud and clear that's what our investors were concerned about, so we went to them with this concern and were able to work it out with them. Both companies still working really hard to get back to parity, and more importantly, above parity as soon as we possibly can. On EMEA and APAC, 30%, yes, that's a dollar basis. There is a little currency in there. I think it's roughly 20%, excluding the currencies, so it's pretty robust regardless. And then media Page view growth international versus U.S., honestly, I don't really look at it that way. We look at it more on properties. But I'm going to venture a guess that with a lot of the LEGO] rollouts or the Yahoo! publishing platform rollouts that it's really been much more internationally-focused. I think that's created some nice inventory Page view, less internationally. So I'm just going to guess that it's roughly the same, maybe a little bit more in EMEA and APAC potentially."

There's probably a little bit of timing between 2Q and 4Q on the data centers themselves. But basically, we have the same outlook as I gave on last call for CapEx. In terms of Product Development, there is nothing onetime in that. The things we're investing now are the same things we talked about in Investor Day in the last couple of years. I mean, all the important dimensions, the platform rollouts, the new technologies and improvements in our ad serving, our tech stack, we've got the video, the different content plays, mobile, some of the social integrations like you saw again with Facebook and News this quarter. So it's really the same subset of things that we've been talking about, but we seem to be gaining traction. Again, I want to shout a big congratulations to that product team who's go a lot going on, a lot has rolled out here over the last couple of months and they've got a pretty crowded schedule for rollouts in the coming months as well. So I think they are coming up to speed, doing a nice job. We have a better product planning process in cycle this year that Blake has introduced than we have in previous years. And honestly, we've got some great engineering talent. I mean there are just some really, really talented people that have come into the company, especially and our refreshing the way we go about launching products and the innovation we're using in creating them.
