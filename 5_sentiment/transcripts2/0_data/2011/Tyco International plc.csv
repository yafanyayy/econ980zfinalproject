With me today are Tyco’s chairman and chief executive officer, Ed Breen and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Sklarsky.
Just a reminder that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask you to look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release is issued this morning and all related tables, as well as conference call slides, can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC form 10-Q later today. In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in average revenue per user, backlog, and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency.
Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call are excluding special items, which is a non-GAAP measure. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. 
Before discussing our operating results, I just want to remind you of the segment realignment we completed this quarter. We have created an integrated global fire segment which combines the fire suppression and life safety platforms of our former safety product segment into our fire protection segment. Additionally, the electronic security products platform within our former safety products segment was integrated into our security solutions segment, which includes ADT.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter’s results. Revenue in the quarter of 4.4 billion was up 5% year-over-year with organic revenue growth of 4%, including a 1% point contribution from the electrical and metal products business. 
Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $1.00 and included $0.25 of benefit from special items primarily related to the gain on the sale of a majority interest in the electrical and metal products business.
Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.75 compared to our previous guidance of $0.65 to $0.67, driven by strong operating growth in our security and fire businesses. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.

Our results for the quarter were driven by improved market additions in most of our product and system installation businesses around the globe as well as the continued benefits from our restructuring and cost containment actions.
Additionally, the continued growth in our service and recurring revenue businesses, which represented 43% of our total revenue, also contributed nicely to our performance in the quarter. 
Operating income before special items increased 19% and the operating margin improved 130 basis points year-over-year.
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for each of our businesses, and then Frank will provide you with more details in a few minutes. Security had a strong start to the year. Organic revenue grew across all businesses and all geographies. Our key metrics continued their positive momentum and the synergies we expected from the Broadview acquisition are playing out as we planned.
On a global basis, security's operating margin improved 240 basis points year-over-year, driven by increased volume in our commercial and product businesses, growth in our higher margin recurring revenue business, and the continued benefit of restructuring and productivity initiatives.
Turning to fire, revenue was about what we had expected. The turnaround in order activity we saw over the last few quarters translated into positive organic revenue growth in SimplexGrinell, our North America service and contracting business. Additionally, our product businesses, which are fire protection and life safety, which comprise about 30% of fire's total revenue, continued to grow nicely. Fire exceeded our expectations.
The continued benefit of restructuring and cost containment initiatives, and the selectivity of project work, drove solid year-over-year operating margin improvement. In Flow Control, the organic revenue decline continued to moderate, and the order trends have been encouraging. 
Valves and controls, which is by far the largest piece of the business, has seen positive year-over-year order activity for the last three quarters. As there is a six- to nine-month order-to-revenue conversion cycle for valves, we expect to see this part of the business return to positive organic revenue growth in the second half of the year. We have also seen our earlier cycle actuation and instrumentation orders grow significantly over the past few quarters, and this historically leads our valve business by six to nine months.
The operating margin performance in the quarter was impacted by a charge related to a project in a business that we retained as part of the 2008 divestiture of the Earth Tech business. Excluding this charge, the operating margin was about what we had expected.
The improvements we have made in the business over the last few years, as well as the pickup in order activity over the last few quarters, is expected to improve our operating performance in the second half of the year.
Now I'd like to comment on a few key areas of focus for 2011: growth opportunities, productivity improvements, and capital allocation. First, we will continue to pursue growth opportunities in our three core platforms of security, fire, and flow. These investments will include initiatives that drive top line growth such as the continued investment in our subscriber and dealer channels in ADT, incremental investments in R&D which we plan to take up for the third year in a row, and increased spend related to sales and marketing. We will also pursue bolt-on acquisitions to further strengthen our global competitive position. 
Second, we will continue to focus on productivity. We are seeing the benefits of past actions in our operating margin performance and have identified additional opportunities to further reduce our cost structure. 
And third, capital allocation. Our balance sheet is strong and in early December our credit rating was upgraded by Fitch to A-, which follows a similar upgrade by S&P. Over the last few months we've received almost $1 billion of divestiture proceeds, and we ended the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash.
We will deploy our cash to fund our internal growth initiatives as well as productivity and restructuring plans. Excess cash will then be invested in areas that we expect will generate the best return for our shareholders, including additional bolt-on acquisitions as well as returning cash to shareholders.
Since November, we have repurchased 19 million shares, for approximately $800 million of cash under the current $1 billion share repurchase program. And we recently announced a proposed dividend increase to $1 per share that our shareholders will vote on at our annual general meeting in March. The proposed dividend represents about a 20% increase.
With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Frank Sklarsky, Tyco's new chief financial officer. Frank joined the company on December 1, and I'm delighted to have him on board. Some of you have already had the opportunity to meet Frank, and I know that he's looking forward to meeting our investors and analysts in the coming months. Frank?

With respect to our results for the quarter, let me start with security. Revenue of $2.1 billion reflected overall growth of 10% in the quarter, with organic revenue growth across all regions and businesses",1560,"Thanks very much Ed, and good morning everyone. With respect to our results for the quarter, let me start with security. Revenue of $2.1 billion reflected overall growth of 10% in the quarter, with organic revenue growth across all regions and businesses totaling 6%. Recurring revenue, which now represents 57% of security's total revenue, continued to perform well with 4% organic growth in the quarter.
Nonrecurring revenue, which includes product sales, system installation, and service revenue, represents the remaining 43% of security's revenue, and this portion of the business grew 7% organically in the quarter, with a nice turnaround in the North American and EMEA regions, which grew for the first time in almost three years. Nonrecurring revenue also benefitted from strong growth in our security products business.
From a profit perspective, security's operating income before special items in the quarter was $352 million and the operating margin was 16.7%. Higher sales volumes across the globe, improved operational performance in the commercial business, and the continued benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives drove a 240-basis point operating margin improvement year-over-year. 
From a regional perspective within security, nearly 90% of our North American residential and small business revenue is recurring. This recurring portion grew by 32%, including the impact of the Broadview acquisition, and organic growth was 5% for the quarter while our operating margin remained strong. 
Year-over-year, our North American residential account base grew 31%, primarily reflecting the impact of the Broadview acquisition. Growth in average revenue per user was 1% year-over-year, and was impacted by the addition of Broadview accounts, which have lower monthly average revenue. 
Heritage ADT accounts grew average revenue per user by 3% year-over-year, mainly due to the favorable impact of higher monthly revenue rates from new accounts. Our residential attrition rate of 13% improved 30 basis points year-over-year and was flat on a quarter sequential basis.
Touching on the Broadview acquisition, we've completed our ADT branding, financial, and HR process integration. Looking forward, our near term efforts are completing field integration and we continue to consolidate our branch office footprint to drive improved productivity and improved customer service. Overall, the Broadview integration is progressing as planned, and we are on track to deliver on our synergy and earnings accretion targets.
Turning to our North American commercial business, the mix of revenue is very different from residential and small business. 65% of commercial revenue is driven by nonrecurring system installation and service, while 35% is recurring revenue. After 12 consecutive quarters of organic revenue decline, our North American commercial business grew 6% organically in the quarter and the operating margin improved 190 basis points year-over-year. 
Our attrition rate improved 120 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points on a quarter sequential basis to 12.8%. Additionally, we now have three quarters of year-over-year growth in orders, with 13% growth in the first quarter. 
Next, in the EMEA region, we saw positive organic revenue growth for the first time in almost three years, with 1% growth in the quarter. The operating margin in EMEA improved 600 basis points year-over-year to 11.6%, reflecting the continued benefits from restructuring and cost containment initiatives. 
In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, where revenue is predominantly commercial in nature, organic revenue grew 8% with an operating margin in the low teens.
Turning to the key metrics for our overall global recurring revenue business, our worldwide account base grew 20% year-over-year or 2% when adjusting for the accounts acquired as part of the Broadview acquisition. Average revenue per user for our heritage ADT account base grew 2% year-over-year on a global basis.
As the mix in our account base has shifted more to residential with the Broadview acquisition, our global average revenue per user of $45.17 declined 2.5% year-over-year. Our worldwide attrition rate of 12.7% improved 10 basis points on a quarter sequential basis.
And finally, security products, which includes intrusion, video, and access control, had organic revenue growth of 21%. Improved operating margins were driven by higher sales volume and continuing improvements in the operational performance of the business.
Let me now turn to fire protection, which now includes the fire protection products and life safety businesses, realigned from the former safety products segment. Overall, revenue in the quarter was $1.1 billion, with organic revenue growth of 1.5%. 
The largest piece of fire protection, our service and system installation business, is comprised of 55% service and 45% contracting. In this part of the business, total revenue of $801 million declined 1% organically in the quarter. 
Growth in our service revenue of 1% was more than offset by a 3% organic revenue decline in system installation, partly due to project selectivity. The remaining portion of our fire protection business, fire products, which includes both fire and life safety products, had revenue of $299 million in the quarter, with organic revenue of 9%. 
Overall, fire's operating income before special items was $127 million in the quarter, and the operating margin was 11.6%. The 190-basis point improvement in margin year-over-year was driven by increased volume in fire and life safety products along with project selectivity in our service and contracting business, as well as the continued benefit of restructuring and cost containment initiatives. Total fire backlog of $1.2 billion increased 1% on a quarter sequential basis, excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of a joint venture.
Moving to flow control, revenue was $826 million in the quarter, and the organic revenue decline moderated to 2%. Organic revenue growth in thermal controls of 8% was more than offset by a 5% decline in valves and 2% decline in water. As Ed mentioned, we expect to see growth in the valves business in the second half of the year. The organic revenue decline in water will, however, accelerate as we have essentially completed the Australian desalination project in the first quarter.
Operating income before special items in flow was $100 million and the operating margin was 12.1%. Included in operating income is a $5 million charge related to a project in a business we retained as part of the Earth Tech divestiture in 2008, which adversely affected the operating margin by 60 basis points. We expect to see improved operating margins in the second half of the year as volume continues to improve and the benefits from previous restructuring activities and ongoing productivity initiatives are realized.
Overall, orders in the quarter increased 7% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year order growth, with 6% order growth in valves and controls, driven by strength in oil and gas and strong bookings in thermal, offset by an order decline in water. Backlog of $1.5 billion increased 3% on a quarter sequential basis, and the book-to-bill ratio was 1.05.
Let me briefly touch on the quarter's results for the electrical and metal products business. Revenue of $347 million increased 15% organically, mainly driven by higher selling prices for both steel and copper products. Operating income before special items was $13 million, and the operating margin was 3.7% as increased selling prices were more than offset by higher material costs.
Lastly, we have closed on the previously announced sale of a majority interest in electrical and metal products. Total cash received from the transaction was $713 million and we recorded a pre-tax gain on the sale of $259 million. 
Beginning with the second quarter, we will report the earnings from our remaining minority ownership under the equity method, meaning a single after-tax number will appear in our P&L in the ""other income and expense"" line within continuing operations. For the remainder of 2011, we continue to expect that our equity interest post-closing will result in a P&L loss of approximately $15 million, with a $10 million loss in the second quarter due to non-cash purchase accounting adjustments such as the write up of inventory as well as previously anticipated interest expense.
Let me know touch on a few other important items. First, corporate expense before special items was $97 million in the quarter, which is about what we expected. For the second quarter, we expect corporate expense of approximately $105 million. Additionally, we incurred $53 million of net interest expense in the quarter. For the full year, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $225 million.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter before the impact of special items was 17%. For the second quarter, we are planning for a tax rate of approximately 18%. 
We exited the quarter with an average diluted share count of 492 million shares. Based on our expected share repurchase activity, we expect an average share count slightly below 480 million shares in the second quarter.
I also want to quickly touch on restructuring activities. To date, we have incurred approximately $37 million of restructuring and integration charges compared to our previously communicated estimate of $150 million for the year. As Ed mentioned, we have identified additional cost-saving opportunities and we now expect that our full-year restructuring charges will be approximately $200 million.
These restructuring actions will provide a very attractive payback, with the majority of the savings expected to be realized in fiscal 2012. It is these types of actions that have significantly helped us reduce our cost structure, achieve productivity improvements, and make our operations more efficient.
Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to wrap up this morning's call.

Before we open up the lines for questions, I want to spend a few minutes on our guidance for the second quarter, and our expectations for the second half of the year. Based on our current order rates and backlog, we expect organic revenue growth of 3-4% in the second quarter, with total revenue in the range of $3.95 billion to $4 billion.
From a business perspective, we see year-over-year organic revenue growth of 5% in security. We expect a sequential decline in operating margin to approximately 15.8%, due to a normal seasonality we see in the business, particularly in retail, which traditionally yields higher revenue and operating income in the first quarter.
In our fire business, we expect the top line to be similar to the first quarter, with operating income before special items of approximately $125 million. 
Moving to flow control, we expect revenue to be similar to Q1, with operating income before special items of approximately $105 million. We fully expect flow to be a larger contributor to earnings in the second half of the year as we exit the low part of the cycle by the end of the second quarter.
Lastly, as Frank mentioned, we expect to record a loss of $10 million related to our retained ownership interest in the electrical and metal products business in the second quarter. Remember, this compares to an operating income of $13 million in the first quarter, representing a headwind of $0.04 per share on a sequential basis.
From an earnings perspective, this is expected to result in second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations before special items to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.66 per share. 
As we look to the balance of the year, there are a few items that we expect to be tailwinds in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year. First, security and fire have seasonal increases in revenue and income in the third and fourth quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. As I mentioned, we expect flow control to increase its earnings contribution in the second half of the year based on order activity over the last few quarters.
Given our first quarter results, current order activity, and our business expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance, excluding special items, to a range of $2.93 to $2.98 from our previous range of $2.85 to $2.95.

I think we'll be up more towards the high threes to maybe 4%. But let me also point out, as Frank mentioned, it doesn't help us on the revenue line as much in upping the total revenue of the company, because we're deconsolidating a JV because of new accounting rules. It takes about $100 million of revenue out of the business for the year. So use that number a little bit, but I do expect the organic to be higher. You know, the first quarter I'd take electrical and metal out of it, because it won't be there the rest of the year. Our organic was 2.8%, and now we're thinking we're about 4% in the second quarter. So I think if you average out the year we'll be high threes, around four, something like that.
<TAG>Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Right. So if things aren't getting worse, and it sounds like they're getting better at flow and maybe some of the other commercial related businesses, why wouldn't that be at least a tick higher. I mean, you should be exiting the year at a little bit of a better rate here in the fourth quarter. Is there something that you're worried about in the back half of the year? Is there something in the water business that drops off dramatically, or is this just a momentary uptick in revenue? It just seems like if you're doing this kind of growth rate in the first half of the year, things should be better in the back half, especially flow. So I'm just curious as to what are you worried about as something that drops off.

As you can see, we saw an uplift on the commercial orders in ADT across all regions, and it was double-digit in all regions. So I would say that was one of the pleasant surprises in the quarter. It really comes down to phasing for us. We're seeing nice trends in the order rates in our businesses, but let me give you a couple particulars. Flow control orders were up about 7% this quarter, but when you really look at the phasing of our backlog - and that's why what I stressed last quarter - we really are going to see a lot of that benefit as we go into fiscal 2012. Remember, we're in our fifth month of our fiscal year already. So as we look at phasing, it does phase up in the third quarter. It phases up more in the fourth quarter in flow, but the real benefit starts accruing toward the end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of next year. And by the way, there is one thing that mutes our number a little bit in flow. You really have to look at the pieces, and we do have a very tough water compare over the remainder of this year through the second, third, and fourth quarter, and that compare in flow on the water side goes away as we go into fiscal '12. So that's the one thing I would say mutes us a little bit on the flow side, but the underlying trends obviously look very, very good in the business, what we're seeing on the order side. So yeah, I do think, by the way, by the time we get to the fourth quarter our organic rate might even be higher than that, but when you take a 2.8 in the first quarter, a 4% in the second quarter, you know it averages out kind of to a 4% for the year. We probably will uptick a little bit more, but no, I would say there's no trends we're seeing that are concerning us. If anything, we're feeling very, very good about what we saw this quarter.
<TAG>Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase & Co.
What's the source of the tough order comp? It seems like there's always some sort of project, something kind of comes out of the blue here. I don't recall last year being that dramatically good for flow. So what's the source of the tough flow comp?

We had a very large de-sal water project in Australia last year, and we highlighted it and we had it because we knew it was a one-time big, nice order. And that's a compare problem right now. So by the way, let me give you the detail behind that so you can sort of see the order comparison here. When you take our results for the first quarter in flow, let me give you a few numbers here that I think will put this in perspective. Our total orders in flow were up 7%. And let me read totals for you for the last five quarters to give you the trending. First quarter 2010 was -13%, so that was the real bottom. Second quarter was +36%, third quarter was a +3%. Fourth quarter was a +5.3% and then this quarter that we just ended was a +7%. So you can see it trending nicely. So that's total flow. If you look at the pieces, and let me give you the first quarter that we just ended. When you look at the pieces, valves was up 6.2%, but water, and this is the compare problem we're going to have through the year, water was down 23%, and that's the de-sal project we were booking and then shipping last year. And then thermal was up 43%, which gets you to the 7% total. Let me also point out to you the valve orders, which turn later than thermal, have gone from the third quarter of +2%. The fourth quarter was a +3%. Now it's to a +6.2% in the first quarter and I hate to always give one month, because this is a lumpy business, but January our valve orders were up 9.5%. So I think you can see underlying trends very positive, but for the next few quarters we'll have a tough compare on water. But that does not negate the fact that our revenues and bottom line are going to pick up starting in the third quarter in flow, but maybe not to the extent that you would expect until we get to the first quarter of fiscal '12.

I think we're up maybe $50 million this year over last year, but I think that's about the range we're in. I would model that pretty consistent moving forward. And by the way, part of that this year we're just ramping up our dealers with training and all to be launching the whole Pulse platform. If you remember when we talked last quarter, we were introducing it with our direct sales team and now we're doing very heavy training on the dealer side. So you know, that's really the big push with the dealers during this fiscal year, to get them up to speed. And I would expect by the time we get into the third quarter the dealers will be starting to ramp on the sales effort on the Pulse side, the interactive platform. But the real investment that we're focused on is increasing the direct channel more, and we are presently increasing the number of direct sales people that we have selling for us. When we closed on Broadview, we were down about 200 sales people from where we wanted to be because of some attrition, uncertainty. You know, people joining the Broadview sales force in that period of time. And now we're about 100 above that combination from when we started and we've told our team. They're planning right now for instance of hiring 200 more people on the sales team. We'll track how we're doing. If we're doing well there we've told them to go hire another 200 people. So that's where you're going to see the investment going in. And as you know, I think you've modeled this pretty well for us, the internal channel is a very high return on invested capital channel, so we'd like to be able to crank that one up on a percentage basis.

And that's that about 10% of our portfolio tracks to some of our other competitors in the business, which I would call even earlier-cycle than our valves, and that would be actuation and instrumentation, the process stuff. And those orders have been up for the last two quarters, very nicely up in the 20%+ range. So the real leading indicator has been higher for a couple quarters, and now we finally are seeing nice turn on the valve orders as you're seeing.

By the way, I do think, although I don't have - I have I would say subjective comments around this, and I think maybe in another quarter I'll actually be able to put something more specifically around your direct question. But we do think we're signing up some customers that maybe would not have taken it if it was just the traditional security package. We really believe from what we're hearing we're going to expand the category some with more of this ""lifestyle"" capability. And quite frankly, it's just getting out there. You're starting to hear the hype around it, so I don't think the general consumer yet sees this. But you know, they're beginning to with the TV advertising or doing some of the talk out at the CES show and a lot of things going on. So I do think that we'll expand the category. Hopefully, we'll be able to put some numbers around that soon. But we're still running, again with only our direct sales team, about 15% of our customers are taking Pulse, and about 85% of them are taking the first tier of the package. We do feel we're going to be able to work those percentages up on the higher packages over time. We didn't go back and retrain the sales team. We did one big blitz on training. We will go back and work the training on how to walk people up and market them up the packages. So that will help, and then as I said, by the time we get to the third quarter, you'll see the dealers kick in on selling the Pulse product also. But I think this is interesting to note on this is how we work the RPU over time. I'll give you four numbers on the RPU side that I think are interesting. Remember Broadview accounts that we just put into our base had the lowest RPU at $33 on average a month. The heritage ADT base is $36 a month. The new accounts that we're generating, so the new accounts we generated during the first quarter, are about $43 a month. And that is being helped because the Pulse customers we're getting, which are now 15% of the new adds, is about $50 a month average. So that's kind of the four numbers that we kind of look at as we look at increasing RPU month to month, quarter to quarter.

Remember, we are always seasonal from first to second quarter because mostly a lot of weather related. We do a lot of service, system install in the summer, especially colleges, universities, etc. So if you go back the last three years of new Tyco, this is a very, very typical trend for us that we drop anywhere from 10-12% sequentially on EPS. This year we're saying we're going to drop 13% sequentially in EPS and it's totally related to your point, which is temp. So if I look at the numbers high level, we did a $0.75 first quarter. Tax and corporate will be a headwind of $0.02. Temp will be a headwind of $0.04. That's the $13 million we made this quarter to a $10 million loss.

By the way, I would point out the orders not only were double-digit in every region of ADT in the commercial side, but half of our fire business on the commercial side, which is the North America footprint - SimplexGrinnell, that was also up 15% on orders this quarter. What muted the order rate in fire was Europe, because we're rejiggering our whole sales effort there. When you hear us talk about project selectivity, we're really moving very aggressively away from what I would call more commoditized contracting on the sprinkler side and moving to much more key verticals like we have in North America. So I think Europe is still soft anyway. Our numbers are even softer on the order side there because we're going through a rejiggering here over the next couple quarters. But that will improve also. So what really impressed me this quarter was North America fire picked up real nice for the first time, and all of ADT commercial picked up. When I look at it, and you really go through the details, it's almost exactly what you would expect would happen. We are seeing, on the ADT side and fire side, a lot of retrofits and upgrades. So for instance on the fire side at Simplex, when you dig into that big order growth, it's not new construction-related. We are seeing a very small uptick in new construction, but people are upgrading their electronic panels because there's a lot of new features and software capability. You know, technology, it's got a five year life cycle to it, so in the last three years no one's done anything. So what we really are seeing is a lot of retrofit and upgrade there and then what we are seeing that's still soft, and we're purposely making it even softer, is the contracting side, which is more of our international business, on fire for instance, is more contracting of sprinkler install, and that business is still down because sprinklers are good for 20 to 30 years. And so you need to see new construction pick up to start seeing that part of the business pick up. So I think it's typically what you would expect, and I don't know if this is all true, but as you read the architectural building reports, when you look at non-resi construction reports - and by the way you look at our steel number is maybe a sliver of an indicator, new construction is starting to pick up off a very bad bottom, but I don't think it helps us until fiscal '12 in any significant way.

So as I look at prioritization, I kind of look at a couple moves we would make that are strategically, directly down the middle of the plate. That doesn't mean at some point we wouldn't look at something that was contiguous and tightly contiguous, like some pump business and all that. But for instance, the opportunity we think we're close on on a bolt-on acquisition would be a very nice positioning for us directly on the valve side of the business, and the acquisition we did about eight months ago, the two acquisitions we did in Brazil, were directly down the middle of the plate on the valve side. So it's just more of a prioritization of some things we know we can fill in directly there. But clearly if there was something smart contiguous, we would take a look at it.

Remember, I was pleasantly surprised that our attrition really didn't actually go up that much in the downturn. Otherwise, I think we'd see a quicker ramp down.

So I think one key point you make is absolutely correct. People aren't moving as much. So despite how bad housing was, I think that probably helped us a little bit. So considering that the housing market, still as rough as it is out there on that side, I don't feel bad about it. And globally, we did bring it down a little bit. I tell you where I was pleasantly happy was the big move on the commercial side we saw. I was not expecting that. That attrition rate improved 120 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially, so it seems like there's some stability on the commercial side. And let's see how the resi piece goes.

As I think I mentioned, we compete now in 20-25 of our key markets presently with cable companies. I do think they'll launch interactive in those markets and expand maybe into some other markets. My feeling has been all along that this is going to lift all boats. If that does happen, there's going to be more advertising, more awareness. By the way, it was interesting, I think I mentioned this last quarter, when Brinks was going through their double advertising I would call it because of their brand change, we saw regeneration increase for ourselves. So I think that is what will occur here. I also think over time, and I don't think any of this happens quickly, but over multiple years I think if a couple of these cable guys or phone guys markets more security than they are now, I think over time it's at the expense of the smaller, local players and the big, branded players will do very, very well in that environment. You have to remember that only 19-20% of the homes in North America are penetrated with security. My belief, and again this is multiple years, is that this is about a 40% penetrated service and I do think interactivity helps that percentage get there eventually because to a question earlier I think more people are going to be attracted to the service because of the opportunity to do more things. We have 25% North America market share with thousands of others having the other 75%. I've always been a believer this industry will consolidate. If it consolidates around a few players, I think we do very, very well in that environment. I would also point out that this is not that easy to do for everybody because one of the reasons the local, little player actually does well is that they have a sales force like we have a sales force. Between our dealers and our direct sales team, we have almost 9,000 sales people in North America, and 90% of the sales that we close we sit in the home with the homeowner to close the sale. It’s not like cable, it's not like getting a phone service, where it's an automatic ""you're going to get it."" It's a utility. This you have to go in and market it. So there's a lot of nuances here and I think we do very well in that environment. I'll just comment to a part of your other question. We talk to all the players. We talk to all the cable players. We talk to the phone guys. We're very close to them. I'm close to a lot of them just because of my background. And if there's opportunity that makes sense, we'll look at it as we get down the road.

With me today are Tyco's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ed Breen, and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Sklarsky.
As you are aware, there have been recent reports speculating about the possibility of a transaction involving Tyco International. I would like to take this opportunity to make clear that it is Tyco's policy not to respond to enquiries from the news media or others regarding rumors or speculation on transactions, which may involve the company. We do not intend to make any further comment about this matter today.
I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we would be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today's press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we've included there.
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions, and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at tyco.com.
Please also note that we will be filing our quarterly SEC Form 10-Q later today. In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in average revenue per user, backlog, and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency.
Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call exclude special items, and this metric is a non-GAAP measure. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Now let me quickly recap this quarter's results.
Revenue in the quarter of $4.0 billion was up 6% year-over-year, excluding the impact of electrical and metal products. And organic revenue grew by 3%. The benefit of foreign currency contributed 2 percentage points to our overall revenue growth.
Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Tyco common shareholders was $0.67. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.73, representing a 26% increase year-over-year.
Now let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.

We continue to strengthen our competitive capabilities in our three core platforms of security, fire, and flow control. We returned excess cash to shareholders, and operationally, we saw strong operating margin improvement year-over-year.
Service revenue, which includes recurring revenue represented over 45% of our total revenue and continues to grow nicely in the quarter. More importantly, systems installation and product revenue, which represents about 55% of our total revenue, continued to see improved year-over-year order flow.
If we take a look back, orders first turned positive on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter of 2010, and since then have continued to trend upwards. Year-over-year orders improved 3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, 6% in the first quarter, and now 7% in the second quarter.
Although we are still early into the third quarter, April orders are off to a good start, coming in with year-over-year improvement of about 10%. We are very encouraged by this continued improvement in our lifecycle businesses and expect this trend to fuel our growth in the latter part of this year and into 2012.
Before we jump into each of the businesses, let me start with a few general comments.
From a capital allocation perspective, organic investments will continue to be utmost priority. The investments we made in our businesses throughout the economic downturn have not only benefited our operating margins, but have also positioned us well for the recovery in our lifecycle end markets.
Year-to-date, our capital spending levels have increased 7% on a year-over-year basis with a high percentage of our capital directed towards growth investments. We also continue to fund engineering and product development, increasing our year-to-date spend by 15%, mainly in our emerging market R&D centers.
As we move into the second half of the year, we plan to further increase our R&D efforts around the globe and ramp up our investments in sales and marketing, particularly in our ADT North America Residential Business.
As I had previously mentioned, we plan to supplement our organic growth initiatives with strategic bolt-on acquisitions. During the quarter, we announced two acquisitions, one in security and one in flow control that strengthen our leadership position in key markets and provide incremental returns to our shareholders.
Frank will walk you through the details of these two deals in a few minutes. From a balance sheet perspective, our cash balance was about $1.8 billion at the end of the quarter, $500 million of which will be used for previously announced acquisitions.
As you know, our free cash flow generation is historically much stronger in the second half of the year, which provides us the flexibility to fund growth investments, as well restructuring any efficiency initiatives. Additionally, we are evaluating a few other bolt-on acquisitions that will utilize an additional $500 million over the next twelve months. After funding these actions, we will still be in a strong position to continue return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.
Over the last twelve months, we had repurchased about 10% of our outstanding shares for $1.9 billion at an average price of $39.35 a share. And this morning, we announced a new $1 billion share repurchase program.
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for each of our businesses, and then Frank will provide you with more details.
Starting with Security, we continued to see good revenue growth in the second quarter. Year-over-year expansion in the account base and higher average revenue per user drove the organic growth in recurring revenue. On the non-recurring revenue side, growth was fueled by the turnaround in order activity we saw last quarter, which continues to remain strong.
Year-over-year securities operating margin expanded nicely with improvements in all geographic regions.
Turning to Fire, revenue was about what we had expected, with improving organic revenue growth in our service and our product businesses. Additionally, order activity gained momentum in the quarter with a year-over-year increase of 5%.
From an operating margin perspective, results in Fire were very solid. Stronger sales, selectivity of project work and the continued benefit of restructuring and cost containment initiatives drove the 190 basis point improvement in operating margin year-over-year.
In Flow Control, revenue and earnings fell short of our expectations. Severe weather conditions and the flooding in Australia persisted throughout the second quarter which significantly impacted our Water business. However, valves, which is by far the largest piece of our Flow Control business has turned the corner with positive organic revenue growth in the quarter.
As we look out over the next few quarters, we believe favorable market conditions will continue to bode well for increased order activity in Flow. This, coupled with our backlog, should improve our overall operating performance as we exit this year and enter fiscal 2012.
Now, let me turn the call over to Frank to discuss our operating results in more detail.

Revenue has improved; the benefits of better operating leverage have become apparent; and the continued focus on cost and productivity have contributed to an improved operating margin.
Operating income before special items, excluding the electrical and metal products business improved by 26% on a corresponding 6% revenue increase. And the momentum of our order conditions gives us greater confidence that the revenue and earnings will continue to show good year-over-year comparisons.
Let me review our results for the quarter for each operating business. Starting with security solutions, overall revenue for the quarter grew 12% to $2.1 billion with organic growth of 5.5%. Recurring revenue increased from 55% of security's total revenue in last year's second quarter to 58% this year, primarily due to the Broadview acquisition. Organic growth of 4.5% in recurring revenue was driven by our North American residential and small business operations.
We also continued to see good recurring revenue growth in Asia-Pacific, in Latin America, and for the first time in almost two years, recurring revenue growth turned positive in the EMEA region. Non-recurring revenue grew 7% organically in the quarter, driven by strong order growth over the last couple of quarters in all geographic regions.
Operating income before special items was $335 million, and the operating margin increased 170 basis points over the prior year to 16.1%.
Growth in recurring revenue increased volume in the commercial business, and the continued benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives drove the year-over-year operating margin improvement.
From a regional perspective within Security, let me start with our North American residential and small business, where nearly 90% of the revenue is recurring. This recurring portion grew 33% year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of the Broadview acquisition.
Organically, recurring revenue grew 5% in the quarter. The operating margin remained strong despite incremental investments in sales and marketing.
Our North American residential recurring account base now stands at $5.9 million customers. Year-over-year, the account base has grown 31%, driven largely by the impact of the Broadview acquisition. Overall, growth in average revenue per user of 1% year-over-year was impacted by the addition of Broadview accounts which have lower monthly average revenue. Excluding acquired Broadview accounts, average revenue per user grew 3% year-over-year mainly due to the favorable impact of higher monthly revenue rates from new accounts.
Our residential attrition rate of 12.9% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points on a quarter sequential basis.
Focusing on the Broadview integration for a moment, we are nearing the one year anniversary of the acquisition, and are pleased to report that we are tracking to the synergies we expected to achieve at this point as well as the cost to achieve these synergies.
Let's move on to our North American commercial business, where the mix of revenue is very different. About 60% of the quarter's revenue was derived from non-recurring systems installation and service, and 40% from recurring revenue. The momentum in top-line growth we saw in the first quarter has continued with 7% organic growth in the second quarter.
The operating margin improved 80 basis points year-over-year as a result of this increased volume. Additionally, orders grew 22% year-over-year in the second quarter.
In the EMEA region, we are clearly seeing the benefits of tax restructuring actions and cost containment initiatives. Year-over-year, the operating margin improved 570 basis points and 40 basis points sequentially to 11.8%.
In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, where revenue is predominantly commercial in nature, organic revenue grew 10% on a combined basis. The operating margin, which is in the low teens also improved on a year-over-year basis.
Turning to the key metrics for our overall global recurring revenue security business, our worldwide account base grew 20% year-over-year to 8.9 million accounts or 2.5% on adjusting for the accounts acquired as part of the Broadview acquisition.
Average revenue per user, excluding acquired Broadview accounts grew 2% year-over-year on a global basis. Including the accounts from the Broadview acquisition, which shifted the mix in our account base more to residential, our global average revenue per user of $45.72 declined 2% year-over-year excluding currency.
On a quarter sequential basis, average revenue per user increased slightly as new accounts were added to the base at a higher rate attributable to our new Pulse offering. Our worldwide attrition rate of 12.7% improved 40 basis points year-over-year and remained flat on a quarter sequential basis.
And finally, security products which include intrusion, video, and access control had organic revenue growth of 14% in the second quarter. The R&D investments we've been making in this business should position us well for future growth.
I would also like to quickly comment on the acquisition of Signature Security that we announced in February for approximately $170 million. As Ed mentioned, this acquisition is right in line with our strategy to focus on bolt-on acquisitions. With its attractive customer base of recurring revenue, Signature allows ADT to broaden its sales, installation and service capabilities in the Australian and New Zealand markets and solidifies ADT as a leading electronic security provider in that region.
Several areas of opportunity have been identified to realize cost synergies over a two year period. The nature of these synergies positions this acquisition to become accretive in the near term.
Let me now turn to Fire Protection. Overall revenue in the quarter was $1.1 billion with organic revenue growth of 4%. Our service and systems installation business, which is the largest piece of fire protection reported total revenue of $804 million.
Organic revenue growth of 4% in Service was partially offset by a decline in systems installation revenue of 1.5% as a result of project selectivity. The remaining portion of our fire protection business, Fire Products, which includes the manufacturing arm of the fire business reported revenue of $305 million in the quarter with organic revenue growth of 11%.
Overall, Fire Protection's operating income before special items was $135 million in the quarter and operating margin was 12.2%. The 190 basis point improvement in operating margin year-over-year was driven by increased activity in our North American SimplexGrinell business as well as our fire protection and life safety products businesses, which are seeing good leverage as volume picks up.
Increased service revenue, project selectivity in our systems installation business as well as the continued benefit of restructuring and cost containment initiatives also contributed to the improvement in operating margin.
We are also encouraged by the year-over-year order growth of 5%, driven by our North American SimplexGrinell business, mostly due to increased demand for retrofit and upgrade work as well as increased orders in the products business.
Total Fire backlog of $1.25 billion increased 2% on a quarter sequential basis.
Moving to Flow Control, severe weather conditions and flooding in Australia which persisted throughout the second quarter significantly impacted shipments to customers. In addition to the shipment impact, these external conditions also resulted in lost productivity in the Water business, which together had a negative impact on operating income.
Overall, these factors reduced revenue by approximately $30 million, and operating income by approximately $13 million, about half of which will be recovered in subsequent quarters. Adjusting for these conditions in Australia, revenue and operating income in the quarter were about what we had expected.
Overall, Flow Control revenue was $804 million in the quarter, representing an organic revenue decline of 5%. Valves, which comprises about 60% of Flow Control's annualized revenue has recovered from the trough and grew 1% organically in the quarter.
More importantly, orders in valves continued to recover in the quarter with 11% year-over-year growth, primarily driven by demand in oil and gas and solid growth in our Process and Mining end markets.
Water revenue declined 31% organically in the quarter, partially due to the severe weather and flooding that I mentioned earlier and a tough compare with the prior year quarter which included the Australian desalination project.
Organic revenue growth of 5% in Thermal Controls was driven by strong sales of products during the winter season. Typically, Thermal Controls' product revenue is seasonally stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters, as product sales are driven by the colder weather.
Operating income before special items in Flow was $91 million and the operating margin was 11.3%. As we have mentioned, we expected that the second quarter would be our trough quarter, and results were further impacted by the factors I've previously described.
Overall, total Flow orders in the quarter increased 8% year-over-year; Valves were up 11%, Thermal increased 8% and Water orders remained flat. Backlog of $1.65 billion increased 5% on a quarter sequential basis.
Based on our current backlog and order activity over the last few quarters, we expect to see a sequential improvement in third quarter and an even more significant operating income increase in the fourth quarter, as we benefit from increased volume in Valves.
As we've said previously, volume improvement in Valves in this part of the cycle typically results in about 35% flow-through to operating income.
Let me spend a few minutes on our expectations for the second half of the year in Flow Control.
Information in this regard is included on Page 10 of the slide deck. In the third quarter, we expect Flow Control revenue to grow to approximately $900 million, reflecting growth in Valves as well as the recovery of a portion of the Water shortfalls in the second quarter.
We expect Flow Controls' operating margin in the full quarter to be approximately 12% as the benefit of volume leverage in Valves is partially offset by approximately $15 million of a quarter sequential reduction in earnings in Thermal Controls due to normal seasonal reductions in heating product sales and increased lower margin installation revenue.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, we expect Flow Control revenue of approximately $950 million, predominantly driven by growth in Valves and to a lesser extent, Thermal.
We expect Flow Controls' fourth quarter operating margin to be about 14%, as we benefit from the volume leverage in Valves and the expected normal seasonal mix improvement in Thermal Controls as distributors restock product ahead of the coming winter season. These estimates exclude the impact of the KEF acquisition, which is expected to close in fiscal fourth quarter.
Once again, we are very encouraged by the orders we are seeing in Valves, Thermal and in Flow Control overall. This gives us a high degree of confidence that revenue will continue to improve, resulting in attractive leverage to the operating margin line. Given the typical lag time associated with converting orders into deliveries and recognize revenue, this improvement will be most evident as we get further into the back half, most notably in the fourth quarter, and of course as we enter fiscal 2012. Clearly, this business is now gaining momentum.
Before moving to other items, let me spend a minute on our announced acquisition of a 75% stake in Dubai-based KEF Holdings. The Middle East is a key emerging market for us, and this acquisition provides us with a strategic presence in this growing region. KEF is the region's only fully integrated valve business with local manufacturing. This will allow us to better serve both local and global customers predominantly in the oil and gas industry. We have had a longstanding business relationship with KEF, which is providing castings to some of our valve facilities for the past 14 years.
The synergies around this acquisition are a bit different than the typical cost-outs. We plan to significantly increase utilization of KEF's world-class foundry facility to provide castings for our valves in addition to KEF's existing customer base, which in turn should provide us significant operating leverage. Just as important, this region has and will continue to experience a disproportionate amount of worldwide capital spending in the oil and gas sector.
Additionally, the combination of Tyco's well known valve brands and KEF's strong growing reputation in the region positions us very well for some large revenue opportunities in the Middle East and beyond. It's also important to keep in mind that KEF is in the tax free jurisdiction in a growing emerging market.
We expect the benefits of volume leverage in KEF's foundry. All of the large regional project opportunities will make this acquisition accretive in the near term and should provide Tyco an attractive long term return on investment.
Let me now touch on a few other important items. First, corporate expense before special items was $86 million in the quarter, which is favorable to the full year run rate, mostly due to the timing of certain expenses. As many of you know, corporate expense tends to be higher in the second half of the year due to the timing of certain expenses and a number of actuarial valuations that we perform annually.
As a result, we expect corporate expense for the third quarter to be in the range of $130 to $140 million and we continue to expect that our full year corporate expense will be in the range of approximately $400 million to $420 million.
Other Expense of $6 million in the quarter primarily relates to our 49% minority interest in the Electrical and Metal Products business, which is now known as Atkore, we expect that our equity interest in Atkore will be negligible in the third quarter and slightly negative for the year.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter before the impact of special items was 15.4%. As we discussed in the past, the timing of the impact of certain tax items can cause the rate to move from quarter-to-quarter. We expect the tax rate to be approximately 18% for the third quarter and for the full year.
Now let me turn the call back over to Ed to ramp up this morning's call.

We expect revenue for the third quarter to increase to approximately $4.2 billion, a 5% sequential increase over the second quart",489,"Before we open up the lines for questions, I want to spend a few minutes on our guidance for the third quarter and full year. We expect revenue for the third quarter to increase to approximately $4.2 billion, a 5% sequential increase over the second quarter.
In terms of bottom-line results, improving business conditions will result in a nice sequential improvement in our third quarter operating results in all three businesses. However, this will be more than offset by an expected increase in corporate expense and a higher tax rate.
Let me comment on a few of these moving pieces. First, as Frank mentioned, we expect a sequential improvement in Flow Control operations as we leverage increased volume in Valves and begin to recover lost shipments in Water. Additionally, the seasonal nature of our Security and Fire businesses also benefits the second half of the year.
This operational improvement in Security, Fire, and Flow is expected to increase our earnings by approximately $0.06 on a quarter sequential basis. Second, our proportionate share of the earnings of the Electrical and Metal Products business should shift from a $6 million loss in the second quarter to breakeven in the third quarter. This should add a $0.01 per share to earnings on a quarter sequential basis.
Third, the expected increase in corporate expense to a $130 million to $140 million in the third quarter, which compares to $86 million in the second quarter is expected to cost us about $0.08 per share. And finally, we are forecasting an 18% tax rate in the third quarter.
Given the lower tax rate we had in the second quarter due to the timing of certain items, this is expected to result in a sequential headwind of $0.02 per share. When combined, these items result in a net reduction of about $0.03 per share on a quarter sequential basis. With an expected average share count slightly above 470 million shares, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the third quarter to be about $0.70.
Based on our year-to-date performance and our guidance for the third quarter, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance to a range of $3.02 to $3.07 per share compared to our previous guidance of $2.93 to $2.98 per share. Our full year guidance incorporates a share count of just under 480 million shares.
We now expect full year revenue of approximately $16.9 billion to $17 billion, including the $347 million of revenues generated from the electrical and metal products business in the first quarter.
Lastly, we feel good about the operational improvements we have made in our businesses, and I am very encouraged by our increasing order activity. These items, along with recovery of our lifecycle businesses should position Tyco for a solid 2012.
Thanks for joining us on the conference call this morning. And with that, Operator, let's open up the lines for any questions.

First of all, I would say if you go back and do the math, the combination of the value created from that I am very proud of. With the Dow where it is versus where it was then, Tyco, when you recombine it all, is at an all-time high of stock price if you look at the three.
And I'd also point out, when we did that, we always, as a management team and as a Board, always look at how do we create long term sustainable shareholder value, which is exactly what we looked at when we did the split up of the company the last time. We were not looking for on overnight top in stock price or anything like that but what's the best thing for the long term.
And I would point out, many of our investors have said this to me over the past year; all three companies are really focused on their core platforms and all three of those Tyco companies are doing extremely well and I think they are positioned well for the future. So I think it played out pretty much how we would have wanted it to play it out.
Kind of more to the current look; as you've heard me say many times, I love the status of the company now, I love the mix of businesses we have. I think they all have great dynamics coming over the next five to ten years, they all play out nice in the emerging markets and we just have nice growth opportunity coming.
And clearly, Fire and Security, we can do a lot of things together because of the nature of the customer base. But as we pointed out to you, we're looking at some pretty neat enterprise selling opportunities, based around actually the Flow Control costumer base where we can sell in a lot of foreign security like oil and gas, refinery platforms, mining platforms etcetera, etcetera.
So I like where we're at, but I will say to you as I always talk about, we always as a management team present to our Board and talk to them about all the alternatives you could have to create long term, sustainable shareholder value. We look at every analysis, the shape of the company, what should it look like, what should it be, and we will continue to do that as we move down the road.

You're right, you'll start to see it here in the second half of the year, but when you look at the trending of the orders we are now booking, it really hits us in the fourth quarter nice. And we start getting out of these compare problems. For instance, the last really bad compare quarter for Water is this actual quarter, we are in now the third quarter. And that reduces very significantly in the fourth quarter.
It's still a negative compare, but it's in the single digits. And then that compare problem goes away as we enter fiscal 2012. And Thermal should run very solid in 2012. Remember, as we mentioned, we do have seasonality in business; you got a stronger first and second quarter, a weaker third quarter, then you build back up in the fourth, and then you get a little higher in the first and second. So you are always going to have that seasonal trend there.
But the Valve piece, the way we are seeing these orders come through, and I'd say more importantly as I keep talking, the sales pipeline of projects we're working on feels very robust. One thing I would point out, we have not booked what I would call one of the big elephant deals yet. This is kind of the day-to day business picking up, and there are projects, I heard our competitors talk about the same thing, we are all bidding on a few big projects that are out kind of in that next six month timeframe that makes you feel good about the order trends as we move through 2012.
So you're not going to have a lot of these anomalies on compares that we had during this year, except seasonality of Thermal.

Our Fire revenue in all the BRIC countries, the emerging market countries, it's more than those four but it's basically the BRICs.

Our internal sales team, which is about actually half the sales people, because the other half is in our dealer network, they have all been trained to some extent, but different regions or different stages of what I would call kind of maturity of the training process, but that, as we exit this quarter, that would be pretty much completed where the initial training has all been done and all that.
By the way, we have a lot of experience of this. This kind of takes a year to get the right traction you want because of just learning to sell, getting the confidence to sell the product and all that. So we are going to track this, obviously kind of weekly and monthly.
As we mentioned, about 15% of our new sales have taken the Pulse package. I will tell you, as we were going into the back half of the quarter and into April, that is starting to move up, and I don't exaggerate this, I would say if I just look at the numbers and lump the last 30 days together, I'd say the 15% is now about 18%. So a little bit of traction occurring there.
And the other thing we are gaining a little traction on, and this doesn't surprise me, just takes time and confidence and training is that initially we were getting 85% of the people that were taking the first level package. And now it's down to 80% taking the first level package, and therefore 20% you have taken the second or third tier package.
We're averaging a right around $50 on ARPU. And I would point out I think I mentioned in last quarter that compares to ARPU that was new account up until Pulse, we were up to $43. The heritage ADT base is at $36 per month and the Broadview base is at $33. So it's $33, $36. The new accounts ex-Pulse $43 with the Pulse $50.
So we are more excited here, not only getting this thing rolled out. But the next step for us is to get the dealers trained up in the second half of the year. So by the time we get into '12, they're cranking along, that would be the other half of the sales force. And that we're putting our plan together to go back to our installed base, this $33 base and $36 base and look at to remarket to them on the Pulse product.
So that's kind of where we're at. And by the way, I would point out, which we track very closely. The IRRs are higher on the new Pulse accounts than they are on the underlying accounts we generate normally at ADT.

An",445,"Jeff, as we mentioned, I know one of our competitors mentioned pricing. But I think they really clarified that the last couple of orders they took, a couple of bigger projects at lower margins, and I think you're going through their pipeline right now. And the rest of us really at least, I haven't heard anybody mention it, and we clearly haven't seen much pricing pressure. We saw some, but we had it covered with other cost initiatives and all that at the business. So it is very, very modest for us.
The only headwind we have and I think every other industry have talked about at this quarter is commodities. And our two big commodities are steel because of the Flow company. And the other big one for us is oil and gas, because of our massive fleet that we have around the world, both in our fire and security business. So if you say what's hitting you and that you say the headwind that would be a headwind.
We've approximated that commodity headwind is about $0.60 or $60 million in the second half of our year, which is about $0.06 of earning. And a high percentage of that we have offset with our own cost action to things like that. And by the way, we probably haven't covered a little bit of it, but then were getting an FX help in the second half of the year. So I kind of neutralized those out.
I would say we're about where we thought we would be. And by the way, excuse me, that $60 million I said, that's about $0.10 headwind second half of the year, not $0.06. But I think we've got two thirds of that covered in that and kind of third, we don't have cover, it's kind of covered through the FX help that we're getting. So that would be the one headwind.
But Jeff, as I look out and more specifically I think to your direct question, the projects that we're bidding on are about where our margins are. Our gross margins arise absolute. We're not feeling pressured to low ball pricing to win projects. And as we look at some of the bigger projects, I don't feel any different about them either.
We've got good unique products for these applications. And so it's not a price we're out there. And I think as you're seeing with this kind of demand starting to pick up, I will think that question will be off the table at some point. There's just so much demand. It looks like sitting out there and we're starting to see it coming in the order book.

You're seeing the nice fall through, and let me use the fourth quarter, you're seeing a very healthy fall through on the valve business as the volume picks up. And as Frank said, we estimate that in the mid 30% level. And clearly the valve revenue is going to pick up, because if you look at the backlog, we're building there in the order rates. Thermal starts to pick up and do all that.
So I think that's a nice baseline to plan from. I would point out one item for you. We will have 14% in the fourth quarter on a run rate basis, but the time here when we close KEF could hit us just a little bit on purchase accounting adjustments and all that. But I don't know when that is, so when we said 14%, it's probably something in the fourth quarter. But that's also kind of one-time in nature. So I think that's a good plan to build on.

They can't lay the pipe because the ground is too wet so and so forth. A lot of that is just straight productivity.
Let me interpret as that a 40% or there, but a good chunk of it is margin and that a good chunk of it is just one-time productivity loss. They way I would look at that is we will gain the revenue back and we'll gain about half the OI back in the second half of the year. And then to Frank's point, we're not going to gain the other half of the OI back, because we literally just lost productivity with all our installed people on all that.

Let me give you on the order side, then you can kind of extrapolate this out, I think is your planning, as you're looking at the 2012. And the way I would look at this is, remember 45% of the company is for the service and recurring business, which you kind of know where we're running that at and it's very stable. Hopefully that picks up a little bit more from where it is, because of the improving economy.
And then if you look at the total company orders, I'll read you back, maybe six months or so of orders, because I think this kind of gives you the story. Total Tyco, which is minus-45% of the company that's recurring and service. The other 55%, if you go back to first quarter of 2010 our orders were down 11%, the second quarter 2010 they were down up 3%, the third quarter they turned positive at 3% approximately, the fourth quarter of 2010 was 3%, the first quarter of this year was 6%, the second quarter was now 7% and our April orders for total Tyco were 10%. So that maybe gives you a little bit of phasing how you're going to look at it.

And first of all, the revenue in this business is growing on a percentage basis, very nicely. So there's a nice ramp going on in this business and projects out very nicely over the next few years. The piece is maybe hard for you to get, John, around is remember they've got one of the largest foundries, certainly for this type of business in the world. It's a huge facility over there that we have and it's under-absorbed right now.
Other customers use their casting facility, we use the casting facility that they have. And we have a very detailed plan laid out to really get that thing absorbed and really cranking. And by the way, a lot of that will be with our own existing products that we will pump in to there in addition to our third party customer base. So you got to realize, you've got this huge fixed cost base with this huge foundry there and we really lever that thing up to get advantage out of that.
And as Frank mentioned, we're also on a tax free jurisdiction. So anyway, when you add all that together, you end up with a business that by year or two will add our cost of capital, and we're above that by year three. And on an ROIC basis, by the time we're at year three, we're kind of around at 12% and we grow from there.
So it's a lot quicker than I think people realize, but it's because of the leverage we get, the volume build of this business, the tax free nature of the business. And if I put all of that aside, it's probably the most strategic region to make sure you have a very big presence in for our Flow control company for the future.

With me today are TYCO’s chairman and chief executive officer, Ed Breen and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Sklarsky. 
I would like to remind you that during the course of the call we will be providing certain forward looking information. We ask you to look at today’s press release and read through the forward looking cautionary informational statements that we’ve included there. In addition we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.TYCO.com. Please also note that we’ll be filing our quarterly SEC form 10-Q later today. 
In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes and average revenue per user, backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call exclude special items and this metric is a non-GAAP measure. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
Let me quickly recap this quarter’s results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.3 billion was up 10.5% year-over-year excluding the impact of electrical and metal products and organic revenue grew by 4%. The benefit of foreign currency contributed 6 percentage points to our overall revenue growth. Earnings Per Share from continuing operations attributable to TYCO common shareholders was $.76. Earnings Per Share from continuing operations before special items was $.85 representing an 18% increase year-over-year. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.

Our results were strong in almost every area and we continue to strengthen our three core platforms while returning excess cash to shareholders. 
On a total TYCO basis, our organic revenue growth picked up from the previous quarter and this combined with productivity initiatives resulted in a year-over-year operating margin improvement of 170 basis points. On a quarter sequential basis we saw revenue growth and operating margin expansion across all business segments. The steady growth of our recurring revenue base coupled with a 7% increase in orders and our continued focus on cost gives us confidence that we are well positioned for future growth. 
Year to date we have announced strategic acquisitions across all three of our core platforms. Most recently we announced an agreement to acquire ChemGuard, a leader in developing and manufacturing specialty foams and other fire suppression chemicals. ChemGuard is a nice tuck in to our fire protection products business and further expands our product and service offerings in the fire suppression market. 
Additionally we further increased our R&D efforts and ramped up our investments in sales and marketing. Year-over-year we have increased our R&D spend by 18% and our sales and marketing spend by 7% in Q3. 
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for each of our businesses and then Frank will provide you with more details. Starting with security we had another solid quarter. Growth and recurring revenue was driven by higher average revenue per user coupled with continued growth in the customer base which now exceeds 9 million accounts. 
On the non-recurring revenue side we have now lapped a year of quarterly organic revenue growth and continued to see good top line expansion despite the (inaudible) compare. Securities operating margin continued to expand year-over-year with improvement in all geographic regions. 
Turning to fire, organic revenue growth accelerated in the quarter driven by increased service and product revenue. Stronger sales, selectivity of installation projects and the continued benefit of restructuring and cost containment initiatives resulted in very strong operating margin performance. 
In flow control organic revenue turned slightly positive in the quarter after two years of organic decline and order activity within our valves and our thermal businesses continues to be robust. The recent increase in orders for valves is now converting to higher revenue and we are seeing the expecting leverage of 35% reflected in our operating income. 
Now let me turn the call over to Frank to discuss our operating results in more detail.

107534,136706195,147899,"Tyco International Ltd., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2011",2011-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Tyco International plc","Executives","Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Let me review our results for the quarter for each operating business. Starting with security solutions overall revenue for the quarter grew 13% to $2.2 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Recurring revenue, which rep",1804,"Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Let me review our results for the quarter for each operating business. Starting with security solutions overall revenue for the quarter grew 13% to $2.2 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Recurring revenue, which represents 57% of total revenue, continues its positive momentum with 5% organic growth in the quarter. Growth across the globe was led by North American residential and small business operations. We’re also pleased that the EMEA region grew recurring revenue organically for the second quarter in a row. 
On the non-recurring revenue side organic growth first turned positive a year ago after eight consecutive quarters of decline. During this year’s Q3 non-recurring revenue grew 4% organically with contributions from each geographic region. From a profit perspective, securities operating income and margin before special items also improved and were slightly above what we had expected. Operating income before special items was $358 million and the operating margin increased 170 basis points over the prior year to 16.5%. The improvement was due to growth in recurring revenue including the benefit of the Broadview acquisition, the continued benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives and increased volume in the commercial business. 
From a regional perspective with insecurity, let me start with our North American residential and small business operations where nearly 90% of revenue is recurring. Organically recurring revenue in North America grew 5% in the quarter driven by an increase in the number of accounts and higher average revenue per user. The operating margin improved year-over-year as incremental investments in sales and marketing were more than paid for by the increase in recurring revenue. Our North American residential account base now stands at 6 million customers, a more than 1% increase from the prior year. Average revenue per user grew just over 3% year-over-year mainly due to the favorable impact of higher monthly revenue rates from new accounts including pulse. Our residential attrition rate of 12.8% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points on a quarter sequential basis. 
In our North American commercial business organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter driven by increased activity and non-recurring system installation and service which comprises about 60% of the commercial revenue. Orders increased 7% year-over-year driven by Retrofit and upgrade work. 
In the EMEA region we continued to see modest top line growth. The benefits of past restructuring actions and cost containment initiatives drove the 11.8% operating margin in the quarter. 
In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions where revenue is predominantly commercial in nature, organic revenue grew 8% on a combined basis with continued improvement in the operating margin year-over-year. 
Turning now to some of our key metrics for our overall global recurring revenue security business, our worldwide account base grew 2% year-over-year to over 9 million accounts. In addition to growing our account base, our global average revenue per user also increased to $46.30 representing a 3% increase year-over-year excluding currency effects. The average revenue per user has been steadily increasing as a result of our broader product offerings. Our total worldwide attrition rate of 12.7% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and remains steady on a quarter sequential basis. 
And finally, security products, which includes intrusion, video and access control had organic revenue growth of 6% in Q3. I’d like to point out that this piece of the business is where much of our security technology is developed and over the last three quarters we’ve been increasing our investment in R&D. we plan to continue to increase our investment in technology to provide an even more extensive portfolio of security product offerings. 
Let me quickly comment on Broadview and Signature Security. We’ve now lapped the one year anniversary of the Broadview acquisition and are pleased to report that we are tracking to the synergies we expected to achieve. 
Signature Security closed during Q3 and the integration plan, which is similar to Broadview’s is well under way. Although purchase accounting adjustments are a bit dilutive to earnings initially, we have identified cost synergies that will enable this acquisition to become accretive in the near term. 
Let me now turn to fire protection. Overall revenue in the quarter was $1.2 billion with organic revenue growth of 5%. Our service and systems installation business, which is the largest piece of fire protection, reported total revenue of $859 million. Service revenue grew 5% organically in the quarter. Systems installation was relatively flat on an organic basis as growth in North America and Asia-Pacific offset a decline in EMEA due to selectivity of installation work. The remaining portion of our fire protection business, fire products, which encompasses the fire protection products and life safety businesses, reported revenue of $341 million in the quarter with organic revenue growth of 11%. 
I would also like to quickly comment on the acquisition of ChemGuard that we announced last week. This acquisition expands our fire suppression offerings and provides greater penetration into certain end markets, particularly the petro chemical and oil and gas verticals. From a financial perspective ChemGuard is a very attractive acquisition with a purchase price reflecting a mid-single digit multiple. Similar to the other parts of our fire products business, ChemGuard also has a strong operating margin profile and this along with several synergy opportunities that have been identified will allow this acquisition to be quickly accretive to earnings. The ChemGuard transaction’s expected to close by the end of the calendar year subject to anti-trust clearance and other customer closing conditions.
Turning back to the results of our overall fire segment, operating income before special items was $158 million in the quarter and the operating margin was 13.2%. As we discussed with you last year, the operating results in the prior year Q3 were positively impacted by an $8 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes, which increased buyers operating margin by 80 basis points. Adjusting for this prior year pension benefit, the year-over-year operating margin increased 140 basis points. Increased leverage from higher volume in the fire protection and life safety product businesses along with an increased mix of service revenue across all regions drove the year-over-year operating margin improvement. Year-over-year (inaudible) growth of 2% included 5% growth in service, 9% growth in fire products and a 5% decline in systems installation which was related to the project selectivity. 
A similar player backlog of $1.26 billion was flat on a quarter sequential basis. Moving to flow control, revenue on $928 million was slightly better than we expected. This was driven largely by the thermal business where a few large customers accelerated the installation phase of their projects during Q3 and this more than offset a shortfall on water revenue. Operating income before special items was $106 million and the operating margin was 11.4% which was a little short of our guidance due to lower than expected operating margin in water. The balance in controls, which comprises about 60% of flow control’s annualized revenue, grew 8% organically in the quarter. A very good improvement from the 1% growth we saw in Q2. The sequential increase in revenue to $575 million leveraged at the anticipated 35% incremental profit. This drove a 200 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. Orders in (inaudible) also continued to accelerate in the quarter with 15% year-over-year growth, indicating strength in all end markets, particularly in oil and gas and power. 
In thermal controls organic revenue growth of 23% was driven by strong project activity during the quarter and we continue to see strong project activity in thermal as orders grew 30% year-over-year. In water, organic revenue declined 31% with more than half of the decline attributable to the completion of the Australian desale project earlier this year. 
In addition, the current absence of large scale pipeline projects has reduced margins in water for the mid single digit range from a historical range in the mid-teens. We are however pursuing several large projects which are currently in the bidding phase and for which TYCO is a strong contender. 
We’ve made a deliberate decision to maintain our infrastructure of expertise and manufacturing capabilities as we look to book these projects beginning in a Q2 of next year. This should result in improved operating results in water in the second half of fiscal 2012. Overall flow orders in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year and backlog of $1.75 billion increased 4% on a quarter sequential basis. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on our expectations for Flow Control in Q4. As noted on slide 10 of the review materials, we expect flow control revenue before the contribution from the KEF acquisition to be approximately $1 billion, a 6% organic revenue increase year-over-year. From an operating income perspective we expect the sequential revenue increase to drive 26% incremental operating income for total flow as the expected leverage in valves controls and thermal is partially offset by the previously described near term dynamics in the water business. This will result in a Q4 operating margin before the impact of the KEF acquisition of approximately 12.5%. The acquisition of KEF, which closed at the beginning of Q4 is expected to contribute approximately $30 million of revenue. Non-cash purchase accounting adjustments which are typically higher in the first few months after acquisition are expected to impact Flow Control’s operating margin in Q4 by about 150 basis points. Flow Control’s overall reported revenue is expected to be $1 billion $30 million with an all-in operating margin of approximately 11%. 
Now I’d like to touch on a few other important items. First corporate expense before special items was $102 million in the quarter, which is quite favorable versus our original estimate. This is mostly due to lower adjustments required for actuarial evaluations, which were completed in the quarter as well as the timing of certain project related expenditures which will be incurred in Q4. We expect corporate expense in Q4 to be approximately $110 million bringing our full year expense to slightly below the low end of our previous guidance of $400 million to $420 million. This revised amount represents a reduction of approximately $50 million or 10% as compared to the previous year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter before the impact of special items was 13.9%. The tax rate in Q3 was favorable impacted by the timing of the resolution of certain pre-separation tax liabilities. We expect the Q4 tax rate to be about 18% and the full year tax rate to be approximately 16%. 
Lastly, our cash and overall balance sheet remains strong. This provides us the flexibility to continue to invest organically in our businesses, make strategic blot on acquisitions and return excess cash to shareholders. 
Now let me turn things back over to Ed to wrap up this morning’s call and then we’ll move into the Q&A session.

For Q4 we expect revenue of approximately $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion with organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%. The overall operating margin in Q4 should be similar to what we achieved in Q3 as the improvement in security and fire will be partly offset by non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and sequentially higher corporate expense. Below the line we expect and operating loss of $8 million related to our minority interest in ad core and as Frank just mentioned, an 18% tax rate in Q4. We therefore expect our EPS before special items in Q4 to be about $.85. Based on our Q4 guidance we now expect full year EPS from continuing operations before special items to be approximately $3.17 which is a $.10 to $.15 per share increase from our previous guidance.

So we got about 100 million operationally that we’ve got baked in already, it’s happened. If you’ll remember there was about 50 million of one time items that improved our numbers also on the synergies which was the re-branding going away and the royalty payment back to the Brinks parent going away. So that was about another 50 million. So that’s 150 that we’ve already kind of put in the bag. And then there’s 50 million on the tax line that we’re getting most of it as we get through this year and into the beginning of next year. So net-net I think by the time we actually end this fiscal year, we’ll be a good 80% to 85% of the way through the synergies on Broadview and the rest will happen in the beginning of next year. As we mentioned, it’s EPS accretive to us on a year run rate basis of at least $.10. I think we’re probably going to come in a little bit better than what we had planned. And also remember on a cash basis it’s more like $.18 per share accretive. So I think it’s going very, very well. Just in tracking slightly ahead of where we had projected, both a little bit on dollars and a little bit on timing. 
I would mention what I like about the signature security acquisition, again much smaller in nature but we’re basically using the playbook from the Broadview integration. You know it’s almost identical. We bought a security company with accounts, a field sales force installation team and we’re really doing the exact same integration process and we’ve actually used some of our North American talent to help structure the synergy, a roll forward on the signature piece. I fell very good that we’ll get that very quickly accreted to earnings. But because of the size I’d say it’s a penny or two when you look at next year on that. 
The one I’m really personally focusing on is the KEF acquisition which we just closed on in the Middle East. We have a lot of cost synergies there as you know because we’re going to load up the foundry with a lot of product to get the absorption rate way up so we’re just beginning that process. That’s very important that we track on to that one because that has a lot to do with the cost side of making these numbers work. But what I’m more excited about is the growth opportunity in that market. And we are going to expand with that base in the Saudi Arabia during fiscal 12 with our own facility, our own plant and all. So we’re both focused on the cost side of that one and the revenue potential of that one going forward. 
And I would point out without the two customer names, we’ve won two awards over the last 30 to 45 days since people knew we were buying KEF from KEF relationships where we won a little over $30 million in orders because of the relationships that they had. But these were actually orders for TYCO valve products that we’re getting. So that was a nice start on that.

You know last year we did 150 some million of restructuring two-year type paybacks so you can extrapolate that into this year’s numbers. This year our restructuring by the way will be a little bit lower which we’ll mention then we had thought because we’re not going to do some restructuring in the water business that we were planning on. And so we’re going to maybe come in around another $140 million to $150 million this year restructuring again with about a two year payback which kind of rolls into next year’s numbers on the upside. And then the bigger issue is I think we mentioned this on the last call. We are looking at a three to three and a half year project to take about another $500 million of cost out of the company. It mostly comes out of the G&A line. As you can see we’re ramping up R&D, we’re ramping up sales and marketing but our G&A structure we’re going to make the last big push here over the next few years and that’s where we’ll get a lot of this productivity. It’s mostly back office functionality being tied together in the regions around the world. And so that’s our big focus as we enter 2012. 
Now by the way when we get that 500, this is not exact but the way I look at it, a good half of that will drop to the bottom line of the company just from taking the cost actions. The other half of that money will probably be spent on growth initiatives. However they should also have a nice payback to them or we wouldn’t do them. So that’s the way I would look at that.

I will also add we constantly talk to people about should partner, should we not. There’s a lot of conversations going on in the industry that could potentially be interesting.

But what’s interesting here, let me give you Q1 and Q3 on mix. I’ll just give you two of the packages. The introductory package which is select, that’s the lowest level package. In Q1 it was an 84% take rate. And the premiere package which is the high one was a 10% take rate. In the quarter that just ended, Select was a 74% take rate, so 10 points lower. But the Premier has a 23% take rate up from 10. So you can see the mix is skewing also to some extent to the higher end. And as I’ve said for the last few quarters when we talk, that’s just the maturing of the sales force learning how to move people up the food chain. Understanding how to market it and sell it.

So the 130 down to the five is the next three year progression. And the other big piece of that is we’re putting in a consolidated HRF system so the two big pieces are ERP and the global HR systems and we’re taking that down to a single platform. And then when we do all that or as we do all that, we take the G&A structure of the company down.

But when you look at flow we did put a chart out, I think it was page ten in the package this morning. That piece of it did come back but we did fall a little bit short on the water side during the quarter so maybe to your question it’s maybe hard to see. But we did get those shipments. We missed on some other things on the water side. 
And what I would point out on that chart when you look at it, as Frank said on the call, we made a very deliberate decision in Q3 to hold onto our overhead in the water business. It’s the only part, if you look at flow the valves are really booming right now and we’re getting great fall through. We are getting very solid business opportunities in thermal which look really good over the next few years. As you can see our orders were up 30%, that’s a good margin business. Our only weak spot here was water and what we were going to do in Q3 was downsize in the business but we’ve been waiting and waiting because we now have three large water projects that are on the horizon here. We are actually feeling very good about our position on these three projects and they are three fairly decent size projects that would last for multiple quarters. And so we made a decision just to hang on the overhead because a lot of this is in Australia, it’s a tight labor market, we can’t get rid of the people and then do a ramp on these three major programs so we think those orders start hitting in Q2 so we just made a decision to eat through a little bit of pain on the water margins for a couple quarters here to get the real benefit for multiple quarters going forward. I’d say that’s the dynamic there.

Spreads now are contracting a little bit which is why we’ll see a little bit of this loss when we put the Q4 guidance out.

But as that picks up, the tent business obviously will improve very nicely off of a very significant bottom. So they can make decent money even in this environment as we showed and they did last quarter. But that’s still based on no activity really on the new construction on the non-resi side. 
And just as an overall comment to TYCO since we have exposure to the commercial markets, as we said last quarter, we are not counting on any lift whatsoever from new construction in North America or Europe to hit until the middle of next year. That’s how we planned. So the orders we’re seeing right now, the momentum we’re seeing is really a lot of retro fit and upgrade work. And then I think the last late cycle for us to come back, which is really late cycle obviously here is this commercial piece.

With me today are TYCO’s chairman and chief executive officer, Ed Breen and our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Sklarsky.
 I would like to remind you that during the course of the call we will be providing certain forward looking information. We ask you to look at today’s press release and read through the forward looking cautionary informational statements that we’ve included there. In addition we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables as well as the conference call slides can be found on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.TYCO.com. Please also note that we’ll be filing our quarterly SEC form 10-Q later today.
 In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes and average revenue per user, backlog and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, references to our operating margins during the call exclude special items and this metric is a non-GAAP measure. Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.
 Let me quickly recap this quarter’s results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.3 billion was up 10.5% year-over-year excluding the impact of electrical and metal products and organic revenue grew by 4%. The benefit of foreign currency contributed 6 percentage points to our overall revenue growth. Earnings Per Share from continuing operations attributable to TYCO common shareholders was $.76. Earnings Per Share from continuing operations before special items was $.85 representing an 18% increase year-over-year.
 Now let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.

 On a total TYCO basis, our organic revenue growth picked up from the previous quarter and this combined with productivity initiatives resulted in a year-over-year operating margin improvement of 170 basis points. On a quarter sequential basis we saw revenue growth and operating margin expansion across all business segments. The steady growth of our recurring revenue base coupled with a 7% increase in orders and our continued focus on cost gives us confidence that we are well positioned for future growth.
 Year to date we have announced strategic acquisitions across all three of our core platforms. Most recently we announced an agreement to acquire ChemGuard, a leader in developing and manufacturing specialty foams and other fire suppression chemicals. ChemGuard is a nice tuck in to our fire protection products business and further expands our product and service offerings in the fire suppression market.
 Additionally we further increased our R&D efforts and ramped up our investments in sales and marketing. Year-over-year we have increased our R&D spend by 18% and our sales and marketing spend by 7% in Q3.
 Now let me give you a quick overview of our results for each of our businesses and then Frank will provide you with more details. Starting with security we had another solid quarter. Growth and recurring revenue was driven by higher average revenue per user coupled with continued growth in the customer base which now exceeds 9 million accounts.
 On the non-recurring revenue side we have now lapped a year of quarterly organic revenue growth and continued to see good top line expansion despite the (inaudible) compare. Securities operating margin continued to expand year-over-year with improvement in all geographic regions.
 Turning to fire, organic revenue growth accelerated in the quarter driven by increased service and product revenue. Stronger sales, selectivity of installation projects and the continued benefit of restructuring and cost containment initiatives resulted in very strong operating margin performance.
 In flow control organic revenue turned slightly positive in the quarter after two years of organic decline and order activity within our valves and our thermal businesses continues to be robust. The recent increase in orders for valves is now converting to higher revenue and we are seeing the expecting leverage of 35% reflected in our operating income.
 Now let me turn the call over to Frank to discuss our operating results in more detail.

Let me review our results for the quarter for each operating business. Starting with security solutions overall revenue for the quarter grew 13% to $2.2 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Recurring revenue, which re",1804," Thanks Ed and good morning everyone. Let me review our results for the quarter for each operating business. Starting with security solutions overall revenue for the quarter grew 13% to $2.2 billion with organic growth of 4.5%. Recurring revenue, which represents 57% of total revenue, continues its positive momentum with 5% organic growth in the quarter. Growth across the globe was led by North American residential and small business operations. We’re also pleased that the EMEA region grew recurring revenue organically for the second quarter in a row.
 On the non-recurring revenue side organic growth first turned positive a year ago after eight consecutive quarters of decline. During this year’s Q3 non-recurring revenue grew 4% organically with contributions from each geographic region. From a profit perspective, securities operating income and margin before special items also improved and were slightly above what we had expected. Operating income before special items was $358 million and the operating margin increased 170 basis points over the prior year to 16.5%. The improvement was due to growth in recurring revenue including the benefit of the Broadview acquisition, the continued benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives and increased volume in the commercial business.
 From a regional perspective with insecurity, let me start with our North American residential and small business operations where nearly 90% of revenue is recurring. Organically recurring revenue in North America grew 5% in the quarter driven by an increase in the number of accounts and higher average revenue per user. The operating margin improved year-over-year as incremental investments in sales and marketing were more than paid for by the increase in recurring revenue. Our North American residential account base now stands at 6 million customers, a more than 1% increase from the prior year. Average revenue per user grew just over 3% year-over-year mainly due to the favorable impact of higher monthly revenue rates from new accounts including pulse. Our residential attrition rate of 12.8% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points on a quarter sequential basis.
 In our North American commercial business organic revenue grew 4% in the quarter driven by increased activity and non-recurring system installation and service which comprises about 60% of the commercial revenue. Orders increased 7% year-over-year driven by Retrofit and upgrade work.
 In the EMEA region we continued to see modest top line growth. The benefits of past restructuring actions and cost containment initiatives drove the 11.8% operating margin in the quarter.
 In the Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions where revenue is predominantly commercial in nature, organic revenue grew 8% on a combined basis with continued improvement in the operating margin year-over-year.
 Turning now to some of our key metrics for our overall global recurring revenue security business, our worldwide account base grew 2% year-over-year to over 9 million accounts. In addition to growing our account base, our global average revenue per user also increased to $46.30 representing a 3% increase year-over-year excluding currency effects. The average revenue per user has been steadily increasing as a result of our broader product offerings. Our total worldwide attrition rate of 12.7% improved 20 basis points year-over-year and remains steady on a quarter sequential basis.
 And finally, security products, which includes intrusion, video and access control had organic revenue growth of 6% in Q3. I’d like to point out that this piece of the business is where much of our security technology is developed and over the last three quarters we’ve been increasing our investment in R&D. we plan to continue to increase our investment in technology to provide an even more extensive portfolio of security product offerings.
 Let me quickly comment on Broadview and Signature Security. We’ve now lapped the one year anniversary of the Broadview acquisition and are pleased to report that we are tracking to the synergies we expected to achieve.
 Signature Security closed during Q3 and the integration plan, which is similar to Broadview’s is well under way. Although purchase accounting adjustments are a bit dilutive to earnings initially, we have identified cost synergies that will enable this acquisition to become accretive in the near term.
 Let me now turn to fire protection. Overall revenue in the quarter was $1.2 billion with organic revenue growth of 5%. Our service and systems installation business, which is the largest piece of fire protection, reported total revenue of $859 million. Service revenue grew 5% organically in the quarter. Systems installation was relatively flat on an organic basis as growth in North America and Asia-Pacific offset a decline in EMEA due to selectivity of installation work. The remaining portion of our fire protection business, fire products, which encompasses the fire protection products and life safety businesses, reported revenue of $341 million in the quarter with organic revenue growth of 11%.
 I would also like to quickly comment on the acquisition of ChemGuard that we announced last week. This acquisition expands our fire suppression offerings and provides greater penetration into certain end markets, particularly the petro chemical and oil and gas verticals. From a financial perspective ChemGuard is a very attractive acquisition with a purchase price reflecting a mid-single digit multiple. Similar to the other parts of our fire products business, ChemGuard also has a strong operating margin profile and this along with several synergy opportunities that have been identified will allow this acquisition to be quickly accretive to earnings. The ChemGuard transaction’s expected to close by the end of the calendar year subject to anti-trust clearance and other customer closing conditions.
 Turning back to the results of our overall fire segment, operating income before special items was $158 million in the quarter and the operating margin was 13.2%. As we discussed with you last year, the operating results in the prior year Q3 were positively impacted by an $8 million benefit related to certain pension plan changes, which increased buyers operating margin by 80 basis points. Adjusting for this prior year pension benefit, the year-over-year operating margin increased 140 basis points. Increased leverage from higher volume in the fire protection and life safety product businesses along with an increased mix of service revenue across all regions drove the year-over-year operating margin improvement. Year-over-year (inaudible) growth of 2% included 5% growth in service, 9% growth in fire products and a 5% decline in systems installation which was related to the project selectivity.
 A similar player backlog of $1.26 billion was flat on a quarter sequential basis. Moving to flow control, revenue on $928 million was slightly better than we expected. This was driven largely by the thermal business where a few large customers accelerated the installation phase of their projects during Q3 and this more than offset a shortfall on water revenue. Operating income before special items was $106 million and the operating margin was 11.4% which was a little short of our guidance due to lower than expected operating margin in water. The balance in controls, which comprises about 60% of flow control’s annualized revenue, grew 8% organically in the quarter. A very good improvement from the 1% growth we saw in Q2. The sequential increase in revenue to $575 million leveraged at the anticipated 35% incremental profit. This drove a 200 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin. Orders in (inaudible) also continued to accelerate in the quarter with 15% year-over-year growth, indicating strength in all end markets, particularly in oil and gas and power.
 In thermal controls organic revenue growth of 23% was driven by strong project activity during the quarter and we continue to see strong project activity in thermal as orders grew 30% year-over-year. In water, organic revenue declined 31% with more than half of the decline attributable to the completion of the Australian desale project earlier this year.
 In addition, the current absence of large scale pipeline projects has reduced margins in water for the mid single digit range from a historical range in the mid-teens. We are however pursuing several large projects which are currently in the bidding phase and for which TYCO is a strong contender.
 We’ve made a deliberate decision to maintain our infrastructure of expertise and manufacturing capabilities as we look to book these projects beginning in a Q2 of next year. This should result in improved operating results in water in the second half of fiscal 2012. Overall flow orders in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year and backlog of $1.75 billion increased 4% on a quarter sequential basis.
 Now let me spend a few minutes on our expectations for Flow Control in Q4. As noted on slide 10 of the review materials, we expect flow control revenue before the contribution from the KEF acquisition to be approximately $1 billion, a 6% organic revenue increase year-over-year. From an operating income perspective we expect the sequential revenue increase to drive 26% incremental operating income for total flow as the expected leverage in valves controls and thermal is partially offset by the previously described near term dynamics in the water business. This will result in a Q4 operating margin before the impact of the KEF acquisition of approximately 12.5%. The acquisition of KEF, which closed at the beginning of Q4 is expected to contribute approximately $30 million of revenue. Non-cash purchase accounting adjustments which are typically higher in the first few months after acquisition are expected to impact Flow Control’s operating margin in Q4 by about 150 basis points. Flow Control’s overall reported revenue is expected to be $1 billion $30 million with an all-in operating margin of approximately 11%.
 Now I’d like to touch on a few other important items. First corporate expense before special items was $102 million in the quarter, which is quite favorable versus our original estimate. This is mostly due to lower adjustments required for actuarial evaluations, which were completed in the quarter as well as the timing of certain project related expenditures which will be incurred in Q4. We expect corporate expense in Q4 to be approximately $110 million bringing our full year expense to slightly below the low end of our previous guidance of $400 million to $420 million. This revised amount represents a reduction of approximately $50 million or 10% as compared to the previous year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter before the impact of special items was 13.9%. The tax rate in Q3 was favorable impacted by the timing of the resolution of certain pre-separation tax liabilities. We expect the Q4 tax rate to be about 18% and the full year tax rate to be approximately 16%.
 Lastly, our cash and overall balance sheet remains strong. This provides us the flexibility to continue to invest organically in our businesses, make strategic blot on acquisitions and return excess cash to shareholders.
 Now let me turn things back over to Ed to wrap up this morning’s call and then we’ll move into the Q&A session.

For Q4 we expect revenue of approximately $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion with organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%. The overall operating margin in Q4 should be similar to what we achieved in Q3 as the improvement in security and fire will be partly offset by non-cash purchase accounting adjustments and sequentially higher corporate expense. Below the line we expect and operating loss of $8 million related to our minority interest in ad core and as Frank just mentioned, an 18% tax rate in Q4. We therefore expect our EPS before special items in Q4 to be about $.85. Based on our Q4 guidance we now expect full year EPS from continuing operations before special items to be approximately $3.17 which is a $.10 to $.15 per share increase from our previous guidance.

We’re probably about 75% through after the one year mark beginning the synergies. So we got about 100 million operationally that we’ve got baked in already, it’s happened. If you’ll remember there was about",555," It’s kind of high level on Broadview. We’re probably about 75% through after the one year mark beginning the synergies. So we got about 100 million operationally that we’ve got baked in already, it’s happened. If you’ll remember there was about 50 million of one time items that improved our numbers also on the synergies which was the re-branding going away and the royalty payment back to the Brinks parent going away. So that was about another 50 million. So that’s 150 that we’ve already kind of put in the bag. And then there’s 50 million on the tax line that we’re getting most of it as we get through this year and into the beginning of next year. So net-net I think by the time we actually end this fiscal year, we’ll be a good 80% to 85% of the way through the synergies on Broadview and the rest will happen in the beginning of next year. As we mentioned, it’s EPS accretive to us on a year run rate basis of at least $.10. I think we’re probably going to come in a little bit better than what we had planned. And also remember on a cash basis it’s more like $.18 per share accretive. So I think it’s going very, very well. Just in tracking slightly ahead of where we had projected, both a little bit on dollars and a little bit on timing.
 I would mention what I like about the signature security acquisition, again much smaller in nature but we’re basically using the playbook from the Broadview integration. You know it’s almost identical. We bought a security company with accounts, a field sales force installation team and we’re really doing the exact same integration process and we’ve actually used some of our North American talent to help structure the synergy, a roll forward on the signature piece. I fell very good that we’ll get that very quickly accreted to earnings. But because of the size I’d say it’s a penny or two when you look at next year on that.
 The one I’m really personally focusing on is the KEF acquisition which we just closed on in the Middle East. We have a lot of cost synergies there as you know because we’re going to load up the foundry with a lot of product to get the absorption rate way up so we’re just beginning that process. That’s very important that we track on to that one because that has a lot to do with the cost side of making these numbers work. But what I’m more excited about is the growth opportunity in that market. And we are going to expand with that base in the Saudi Arabia during fiscal 12 with our own facility, our own plant and all. So we’re both focused on the cost side of that one and the revenue potential of that one going forward.
 And I would point out without the two customer names, we’ve won two awards over the last 30 to 45 days since people knew we were buying KEF from KEF relationships where we won a little over $30 million in orders because of the relationships that they had. But these were actually orders for TYCO valve products that we’re getting. So that was a nice start on that.

You know last year we did 150 some million of restructuring two-year type paybacks so you can extrapolate that into this year’s numbers. This year our restructuring by the way will be a little bit lower which we’ll mention then we had thought because we’re not going to do some restructuring in the water business that we were planning on. And so we’re going to maybe come in around another $140 million to $150 million this year restructuring again with about a two year payback which kind of rolls into next year’s numbers on the upside. And then the bigger issue is I think we mentioned this on the last call. We are looking at a three to three and a half year project to take about another $500 million of cost out of the company. It mostly comes out of the G&A line. As you can see we’re ramping up R&D, we’re ramping up sales and marketing but our G&A structure we’re going to make the last big push here over the next few years and that’s where we’ll get a lot of this productivity. It’s mostly back office functionality being tied together in the regions around the world. And so that’s our big focus as we enter 2012.
 Now by the way when we get that 500, this is not exact but the way I look at it, a good half of that will drop to the bottom line of the company just from taking the cost actions. The other half of that money will probably be spent on growth initiatives. However they should also have a nice payback to them or we wouldn’t do them. So that’s the way I would look at that.

I will also add we constantly talk to people about should partner, should we not. There’s a lot of conversations going on in the industry that could potentially be interesting.

But what’s interesting here, let me give you Q1 and Q3 on mix. I’ll just give you two of the packages. The introductory package which is select, that’s the lowest level package. In Q1 it was an 84% take rate. And the premiere package which is the high one was a 10% take rate. In the quarter that just ended, Select was a 74% take rate, so 10 points lower. But the Premier has a 23% take rate up from 10. So you can see the mix is skewing also to some extent to the higher end. And as I’ve said for the last few quarters when we talk, that’s just the maturing of the sales force learning how to move people up the food chain. Understanding how to market it and sell it.

So the 130 down to the five is the next three year progression. And the other big piece of that is we’re putting in a consolidated HRF system so the two big pieces are ERP and the global HR systems and we’re taking that down to a single platform. And then when we do all that or as we do all that, we take the G&A structure of the company down.

All of that is a big piece of this. So it’s three functions, it’s ERP, it’s legal entity, it’s consolidation tools and leveraging the horizontal pipes across the organization. So we’re underway now.

But when you look at flow we did put a chart out, I think it was page ten in the package this morning. That piece of it did come back but we did fall a little bit short on the water side during the quarter so maybe to your question it’s maybe hard to see. But we did get those shipments. We missed on some other things on the water side.
 And what I would point out on that chart when you look at it, as Frank said on the call, we made a very deliberate decision in Q3 to hold onto our overhead in the water business. It’s the only part, if you look at flow the valves are really booming right now and we’re getting great fall through. We are getting very solid business opportunities in thermal which look really good over the next few years. As you can see our orders were up 30%, that’s a good margin business. Our only weak spot here was water and what we were going to do in Q3 was downsize in the business but we’ve been waiting and waiting because we now have three large water projects that are on the horizon here. We are actually feeling very good about our position on these three projects and they are three fairly decent size projects that would last for multiple quarters. And so we made a decision just to hang on the overhead because a lot of this is in Australia, it’s a tight labor market, we can’t get rid of the people and then do a ramp on these three major programs so we think those orders start hitting in Q2 so we just made a decision to eat through a little bit of pain on the water margins for a couple quarters here to get the real benefit for multiple quarters going forward. I’d say that’s the dynamic there.

But as that picks up, the tent business obviously will improve very nicely off of a very significant bottom. So they can make decent money even in this environment as we showed and they did last quarter. But that’s still based on no activity really on the new construction on the non-resi side.
 And just as an overall comment to TYCO since we have exposure to the commercial markets, as we said last quarter, we are not counting on any lift whatsoever from new construction in North America or Europe to hit until the middle of next year. That’s how we planned. So the orders we’re seeing right now, the momentum we’re seeing is really a lot of retro fit and upgrade work.

So you’ve got to think at some point as we’re into next year we’ll see a little bit of lift that helps us on that, and just the continued improvement in that business.
 And then the third big bucket is the point about the restructuring that we’re on, the $500 million or so.  A big chunk of that obviously would fall into security because of the size of our security business.  So to me it’s drive the resi business hard, that continues to improve margins; drive the growth rate of the commercial business and really that whole mix issue there, and then drive the restructuring or the simplification initiative are the three big buckets.

Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release.  
For 2011, our full year and fourth quarter include an extra week of results compared to the prior year.  In order to reflect the true underlying organic growth of the businesses, we have adjusted down both organic revenue growth and orders growth to exclude the estimated impact of this additional week.  All references to organic revenue and order’s growth discussed in today’s call exclude the estimated impact of the extra week.  
Now, let me quickly recap this quarter’s results.  Revenue in the quarter of $4.7 billion was up 14% year-over-year excluding the contribution from the electrical and metal products business in the prior year quarter.  Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter and again, this number excludes the estimated impact of the extra week.  Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to TYCO common shareholders was $0.83 and included charges of $0.09 related to special items.  
Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.92 compared to our previous guidance of about $0.85 led by strong operating results across all businesses as well as a lower than expected tax rate.  Now, let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments.

Continued growth in our large a",930,"Overall this was a very good year for TYCO both operationally and strategically.  We had nice top line growth, strong operating margin expansion, a 25% increase in operating income and a 21% increase in earnings per share.  Continued growth in our large and stable base of service and recurring revenue, momentum in our late cycle businesses and the sustained benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives all contributed to the strong operational performance this year. 
Additionally, the strength of our market leading businesses has positioned TYCO well for our recently announcement to separate into three independent publically traded companies. This marks a key strategic milestone for our North America residential, commercial fire and security, and flow control businesses.  Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing the progress we have made on the key areas of focus we laid out at the beginning of the year: growth opportunities; productivity improvements; and third, capital allocation.
Starting with growth opportunities, we continue to invest in our businesses both organically and inorganically to drive top line growth.  Let me share with you a few highlights.  Capital spending grew 12% year-over-year to $1.4 billion.  A high percentage of our capital goes towards growth in our larger recurring revenue base which grew 4.5% organically in 2011, and along with service represented 45% of our total revenue.  
From a technology and innovation standpoint, we increased our R&D investment by an additional 12% during the year.  We have 16 R&D centers around the globe focused on providing innovative products and services to meet our customer’s needs.  For example, we are now developing Scott Connect in our life safety business which will, in addition to other benefits, allow fire fighters wearing our Scott fireproof protection gear to be remotely monitored for critical indicators such as location and air supply, thereby allowing quicker response in a hazardous situation.
Additionally, we increased our sales and marketing spend by 5% year-over-year as we continue to expand our efforts in emerging markets, align our businesses along key verticals and create awareness around our new ADT Pulse offering which was launched with our internal sales force about one year ago.  We have also completed several key bolt on acquisitions across our three core platforms.  These acquisitions have increased our presence in emerging markets, broadened our technology portfolio and strengthened our competitive position.
Security solutions acquired Signature Security in April.   Signature expanded our sales, installation and service capabilities to residential and small business customers in Australia and New Zealand and solidified our leading market position in that region.  Next, our fire protection business acquired Chemguard, a leading provider of fire suppression products, services and specialty chemicals.  Chemguard broadened our global fire suppression products portfolio and increased our R&D capabilities in firefighting foam applications.  It also augments our presence in high growth areas such as the Middle East and Latin America.
Flow control required a majority ownership stake in Dubai based KEF Holdings at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter.  This acquisition was a key strategic move in the Middle East for our valve business and flow control enhancing our presence in key emerging markets and industries.   KEF’s products are highly complementary to our current valve offerings and provides us with one of the world’s leading steel casting facilities, while enhancing our local footprint and management team.
Thirdly, moving on to our productivity improvements, we continue to focus on restructuring and productivity programs as well as cost containment initiatives throughout the year.  These actions coupled with organic revenue growth contributed to the strong year-over-year improvement in TYCO’s operating margin of 160 basis points.  Lastly, we continued to return excess cash to shareholders.  During fiscal 2011, we used $1.3 billion of cash to repurchase 6% of our outstanding shares, and since year end have repurchased an additional 5 million shares for $200 million.
Now, turning to our results for the fourth quarter, organic revenue grew 6%.  Additionally, we expanded the operating margin in the quarter by a 100 basis points year-over-year excluding the benefit related to the contribution of the electrical metals product business.  
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results in the quarter for each business and I’ll turn it over to Frank to give you more details in a few moments.  Starting with security solutions, recurring revenue grew nicely in the quarter with continued momentum in ARPU and account growth.  Non-recurring revenue grew at an even higher rate than recurring driven by strong growth in North America and the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions.  Top line growth in security coupled with the benefits of restructuring actions and productivity initiatives contributed to the 100 basis point improvement in operating margin year-over-year.  
Moving on to fire, positive order momentum continued in the fourth quarter.  Increased volume in service and products as well as gains from productivity and cost containment initiatives resulted in strong operating margin performance in the quarter.  In flow control, the 14% year-over-year increase in orders once again exceeded prior quarter levels and marks the seventh consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year order growth.  Flow’s positive order trends over the last few quarters are now starting to drive top line growth.
Overall for TYCO we have seen a nice pick up in our organic revenue growth over the last few quarters.  Growth in service revenue, momentum in order activity related to our late cycle businesses, and a continued solid performance in our recurring revenue, positions us well as we’ve entered fiscal 2012.  With that, let me turn it over to Frank.

Strong rev",1571,"Before I get into the details of our business segment performance, I would like to give you an overall perspective on our financial performance in the quarter.  Revenue in the quarter of $4.7 billion grew 14% with organic revenue growth of 6%.  Strong revenue growth across all of our businesses was led by our late cycle flow control business.  When combined with cost reduction activity across all of our business units and at corporate, operating income before special items increased 25% and earnings per share grew 24% year-over-year.  
Now for our operating results by business; starting with security solutions revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $2.3 billion with 6% organic growth.  Recurring revenue which represents 57% of security’s total revenue in the quarter continued to perform well with organic revenue growth in all geographic regions.  Continued ARPU expansion and account additions drove the 5% organic revenue growth in this category.  The remaining 43% of revenue which is non-recurring in nature grew 7% organically driven by growth in every region.
From a profit perspective, operating income before special items was $374 million and the operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 16.4%.  Increased investments to sales and marketing and R&D were more than offset by growth in recurring revenue and the continued positive impact of restructuring and cost containment initiatives.  
Now, let me walk you through the regional performance of security solutions for the quarter.  Starting with North American residential and small business, nearly 90% of revenue is recurring and we had another strong quarter.  Organic revenue grew 5% with higher average revenue per user and an increase in the number of accounts driving the positive year-over-year growth.  The North American residential account base of 6 million customers increased 1% from the prior year.  
Average revenue per user grew about 3% year-over-year as new accounts were added to the base at a higher monthly revenue rate per account partly driven by the increased penetration of Pulse.  During the quarter we saw continued momentum in the Pulse take rate which increased to 23% of the new accounts added by our internal sales force.  Additionally, new Pulse customers continued to migrate towards the higher end packages.  Attrition remained relatively flat at 12.9% on both the quarter sequential and year-over-year basis.
In our North American commercial business, organic revenue growth was up 7% driven mainly by retrofit and upgrade work.  In the EMEA region, organic revenue grew 4% with growth in both recurring and non-recurring revenue for the second consecutive quarter.  We continued to see substantial improvement in the operating margin in this region as past restructuring actions drove a 330 basis point year-over-year improvement to 12.7%.  The Asia Pacific and Latin America region had a strong fourth quarter with organic revenue growth of 11%. 
Turning to some of our key metrics for the global recurring revenue business, our account base of over 9 million customers grew by more than 2% year-over-year, and global average revenue per user also grew by more than 2% on a constant currency basis to $45.35.  Average revenue per user continues to benefit from our broader product offerings.  Lastly, our worldwide attrition rate improved 10 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%.    
Let me make a quick comment on security products.  Revenue in the quarter of $104 million grew 1% organically following a 24% increase in the prior year quarter and significantly improved its operating margin year-over-year while increasing its investment in R&D.  Additionally, we recently announced the acquisition of Visonic, a leading global developer and manufacturer of wireless electronic security systems and components based in Israel.  
Visonic will expand our technology platform in wireless encryption and remote diagnostics while complementing our market presence in the intrusion security market.  We expect this transaction will close by the end of the calendar year.  
Moving to fire protection, overall revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion with organic revenue growth of 4%.  Service revenue in the quarter of $500 million grew 6% organically as we continued to focus efforts on expanding our service base, especially recurring service.  Systems installation revenue of $460 million was down 1% on an organic basis as growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset with declines in North America and EMEA due to project selectivity and the continued softness in the non-residential construction market.
The remaining portion of our fire protection business, fire products which encompasses the fire protection products and life safety businesses reported revenue of $375 million in the quarter with organic revenue of 8%.  Operating income before special items was $183 million in the quarter and the operating margin increased 160 basis points to 13.7%.  Increased leverage from higher volume in the product businesses, a higher mix of service revenues across all regions, and gains from productivity and cost containment initiatives drove the operating margin improvement year-over-year.
As most of you know, the fourth quarter is fire’s strongest revenue quarter as a significant amount of electronic upgrade work is performed while schools are on breaks during the summer months.  Given this seasonality and as we expected, total fire backlog of $1.13 billion declined 9% on a quarter sequential basis excluding currency. Year-over-year orders grew 3% including 6% growth in service, 10% growth in fire products, and a 5% decline in systems installation.  
Moving to flow control, revenue of $1.08 billion was driven by strong sales in valves, as well as the continued impact of customers accelerating the completion of installation work on some large projects in thermal.  Operating income before special items was $124 million and the operating margin was 11.5%.  Valves and controls which comprises about 60% of flow control’s annualized revenue grew 13% organically in the quarter.  We also continued to see good sequential margin improvement in valves driven by the leverage on the incremental revenue.
Orders in valve controls remained strong during the quarter with 15% growth year-over-year.  Order activity was positive in all end markets led by strong growth in oil and gas and power.  We have spoken previously that there were a number of large projects awaiting final approval from our customers and we are now beginning to see larger orders from some greenfield projects including some recent project wins for a large natural gas pipeline and an aluminum refinement project in the Middle East.
Additionally, we recently announced that we will participate in a five year frame agreement with Shell to provide certain values and aftermarket service on a global basis.  We expect this to begin resulting in order activity later this fiscal year.  
In thermal controls organic revenue growth of 34% was driven by strong order activity over the last two quarters as thermal orders tend to translate into revenue within 60 to 90 days.  In water, organic revenue declined 18% as a result of the completion of the Australian [inaudible] project earlier this year and soft order activity in water over the last few quarters.  We have however, recently been awarded several midsized water projects and believe we’re in a very good position to win other large projects during the first half of this year.  This gives us confidence that operating results in water, including margins, will improve in the second half of fiscal 2012.
Overall, flow orders in the quarter increased 14% year-over-year with a 15% increase in valves, a 41% increase in thermal, and a 14% decline in water. Backlog of $1.74 billion increased 4% on a quarter sequential basis.  
Now, let me touch on a few other important items.  First, our cash and overall balance sheet remains strong.  For the year we generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.1 billion which included $252 million of cash paid for special items.  While working capital grew somewhat during the year as a result of our revenue growth, working capital days were in line with the prior year.  
We’re also pleased with the continued improvement in the average duration of our accounts receivable.   Next, corporate expense before special items was $107 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year corporate expense to $392 million.  We expect corporate expense in 2012 to be similar to last year with first quarter expense in the range of $90 to $95 million.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter and full year, before the impact of special items was 15.5%.  the tax rate was favorably impacted by a number of one-time items during the year.
For fiscal 2012, we are expecting our full year effective tax rate before special items to be in the range of 19% to 20% with a tax rate in the first quarter of approximately 20%.  With regard to fiscal 2012 guidance related to other below the line items, net interest expense is expected to increase to $225 million, primarily due to a lower average cash balance.  
Lastly, let me quickly touch on restructuring.  We ended 2011 with total restructuring and acquisition related charges of $126 million. In light of the separation announcement, we have identified several actions to further streamline our operations.  We expect to incur restructuring charges in the range of $125 to $150 million in 2012.  These charges are in addition to the $700 million of costs related to the separation, and both of these figures will be excluded when we provide our guidance for 2012.  
Now, let me turn things back over to Ed to wrap up this morning’s call.

The most complicated work is in our legal, tax, and financial reporting groups and we are making good progress in each of these areas.  In addition, we are in the process of building out the management teams with public company capability and we have also begun the process of recruiting new independent board members for our companies.  Overall, we are on track with the separation process.  
Now let’s turn to our earnings guidance for the full year.  As you know, exchange rates have been extremely volatile.  So using current exchange rates we expect total revenue of $17.5 billion to $17.7 billion.  Embedded in this guidance is year-over-year organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% which excludes the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and the extra week in fiscal 2011.  
Based on the actions we have taken to date to streamline our operations and the additional actions we are planning for fiscal 2012, we expect the revenue increase to leverage quite nicely resulting in year-over-year operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points.  This represents an overall increase in operating income before special items of approximately 10% to 13%.  
Based on these items and the specific guidance Frank provided for corporate expense and below the line items, including a higher tax rate, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items for the full year to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.60.  As in prior years, we expect our earnings per share to be stronger in the second half of the year due to the normal seasonality of our businesses. 
Now, let’s shift to our guidance for the first quarter.  Starting with security solutions, we expect continued growth in both recurring and non-recurring revenue, with overall organic revenue growth of approximately 4% year-over-year.  The operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be similar to last year’s first quarter.  Turning to fire, growth in service and product revenue is expected to be partially offset by a continued modest decline in system installation.  We expect total revenue of approximately $1.1 billion with an operating margin of approximately 12%.  
In our flow control business, we expect to see year-over-year organic revenue growth of approximately 8% driven by the continued momentum in valve order activity.  In total, we expect flow controls revenue to approximate $915 million, with an operating margin of 11%.  We expect sequential operating margin expansion each quarter in fiscal 2012 and anticipate reaching a 14% margin in flow sometime during the second half of the year as we continue to leverage the increased volume in valves and begin executing on water projects.  
Overall for TYCO, we expect revenue in the first quarter to approximate $4.2 billion with an operating margin of approximately 12%.  This coupled with our expectations for corporate expense and below the line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the first quarter to be about $0.77.

Remember, we had to be out of the market when we were going into separation so that’s why we took our foot off the throttle there for a few months.  Then you saw us just recently repurchase about $200 million worth, about 5 million shares during the last 45 days or so, something like that.  So I would expect we’d repurchase some more shares here as we move forward, but we do have a couple of timing issues.  
One, because of separation we really have to do our acquisitions in the first half of this year because we have to kind of freeze our books, if I could say it, going into the second half of the year with all our filings.  We have three or four acquisitions we expect are going to total about $250 million.  We’re very excited about them, they’re strategic for the businesses, but they will be in the first half of the year.  Remember, our cash is lower in the first half of the year than it is in the second half of the year.
  I would add a third thing, we’re talking to the rating agencies. Our ratings are very important to us as we talked about on the last earnings call, so we will potentially look at how we throttle different pieces of this including share repurchase by quarter through the year, but we do expect to be repurchasing shares.

In security, the technology turns over quicker Jeff so we kind of look at it, when you go back and really study it, it’s kind of a four to five year turnover, a lot of new software products, so the electronics tend to turn over softer so as the markets have come back some, and frank made this point, 90% of the orders were getting a retrofit and upgrade work because there’s not a lot of new non-resi construction out there.  So we’re seeing that more.  
And in fire, the products clearly last longer, more in the nine to 10 year, double that range so that’s a key part of it right there.  However, when you look at kind of the macro picture and then our picture, us being down a little bit on systems install, we are also impacting that by the selectivity of projects. As I mentioned the last few quarters we’ve really made a concerted efforts not to go after certain verticals on install and go after more, I call it core verticals, which I’d say hospitals, universities, those types of things we want and we want to get the recurring tail on those.  So we’re clearly impacting that by a few points on our own. 
I do think Jeff, if you do some study around this, I think that if you look at our results both security and fire on the commercial side, I think it’s very clear this year we’ve gained some share in the marketplace.  Even on fire where we’re a little negative on system install we’re less than half as negative as the overall market is so I actually feel really good on our overall position.  I do think system install will continue to impact us on fire through this year.  We’re kind of expecting it to kind of be flat.  Some quarters down a little, maybe up a little but generally no growth there.  Again, we’re not expecting the market to come back until later this year to see some lift and secondly the selectivity continuing.

By the way, let’s all keep in mind, we’re seeing that on a few points of organic growth because we’re not living off any new construction yet.  
As I’ve said for the last year Jeff, I think we were very conservative over the last couple of years and said we didn’t expect non-resi to start lifting until the second half of this fiscal year.  I still think that’s accurate.  It might actually be out another quarter or two before you see some lift up.  But without that, I think we have nice margin expansion continuing through fiscal ’12.

There is no change to any of our metrics and we track them all [inaudible] rates, ARPU rates, the whole thing in those markets.  By the way, I think you can tell from other company’s comments there is very little momentum.  But, you have to remember - first of all Steve, you have to look at it apples-to-apples.  Let me give you one for instance, we have one competitor in a couple of markets that to your point is $8 to $10 below us but on an apples-to-apples basis because we include in ours our service maintenance package, we’re really almost right on top of each other.
I don’t see pricing - and by the way there are people that are launching a couple of systems that are actually a couple of bucks above us.  I think when you neutralize everything and really look at it apples-to-apples which we do in every market, everyone’s pricing is pretty similar and that does not surprise me with the costs and the structure you have to have to run the business.  
Secondly, by the way, you’ll always see people do promotional deals.  I always use the example with all of you, watch cable and satellite guys, so sometimes you have to ferret through what’s promotional and what’s the real run rate after six or eight months in the business.  We track all that stuff very carefully.  But no, we’ve seen no change whatsoever in growth rates or anything in those markets.
By the way Steve, it’s not just the install people, remember 90% of what we see in security, we have a sales person go in the home, talk about where all the products should be in the home, especially with the interactive service with cameras, energy management control what do you want controlled what do you don’t?  It’s a pretty in depth sales process and that’s the reason we have between our dealer network and internal network 9,000 sales people in every town and city around the country.  It’s not just the install, there’s a lot more to it and I think we’ll continue to see nice momentum in fiscal ’12.

So I don’t think that comment keeps lapping itself as we go through the rest of this year, to your point.
But remember, the market, I looked at some data the last couple of days again, the actuals because I don’t really care about the forecasts, the actuals on construction numbers, the dodge reports and all that, and the industry year-over-year is probably down 7% to 8%, maybe almost to 9% when you look at the data and we’re down way, way less than that.  I also think if you look at some third party reports you’ll see that we did gain share.  I think we have a couple of competitors that are consolidating businesses together, they’re maybe not as focused right now and I think that probably plays in to it also.  The selectivity piece, I think by the time we wrap up this quarter, I would say that’s really the one year lap on it.

You know, you always test it and tweak it so there’s always changes, but back to the prior conversation, I think we sit very nice competitively with our pricing on the interactive platform, from everything we’ve seen out there.  So I kind of feel we’re in the sweet spot of where we should be on that.  The take rate did hit 23%.  We said all along that we expect to get the take rate to 25% or 30% so I’d take the 25% off and I’d say 30% was always our initial goal.  I would say, I think you can see from these results, we’re just tracking very nicely there.
If you go back since we launched, we started with a 14%, went to a 15%, went to a 20%, now to a 23% it’s pretty nice progress.  The other thing I’m happy about is let me just read you the top package, the premier package because Frank had mentioned this in his comments.  The premier package if you go back to the first quarter of the year started at 10% take rate.  So out of those that take it, now I’m giving you the percent that take the top package, 10%.  The second quarter was 17%, the third quarter was 23% of those that take it and the fourth quarter was 25% so off the one fourth.
So not only are we seeing the take rate overall for interactive go up but our people are getting better, and better, which is the way it always works at moving people up with the packages.  We’re also seeing that momentum.  I think as we get later in the year we’ll talk about what the targets are for this type of business.  Obviously, I think we’re nicely on track and remember, we’re going to launch the dealers as we exit this year.  We’re in market trials with them right now and remember, these numbers are only from half the sales force which is the internal sales force.

Now, I will point out that one of the things we like is we will get better and better as kind of the next year goes along on our install time.  We really spend a lot of time working on that because I think back to one of the prior questions, that’s very important that you continue to work that down.  
Anyway, the IRRs are higher than the typical ADT account that comes on.  By that IRR, is making an assumption that we stick with the current attrition rates that the company has, I think from all data points all of us have from these types of businesses, it’s going to be a stickier account over time and so hopefully there’s some movement on attrition, certainly to that part of the base.  
I think the second part of your question is the one that’s exciting, we just have to get to the point where we can go back and do this, and that’s that the existing base, and I think I’ve given you these numbers before, but the existing base of ADT accounts, the heritage base what I would call it, is sitting in there at $36.  The Broadview accounts that we brought on a year ago are sitting at $33 and Pulse is selling at $50 on average.  So there’s one of the interesting opportunities that we have over the next few years.

By the way, we’re accreting nice profit dollars, we’re very happy about that but because the margins are lower on commercial that’s probably about a 20 point headwind when you look at it on that basis.  Then because a big piece of security is billed on a monthly basis, it’s the recurring part, the ADT part, we still are only billing on a monthly basis whatever it is the $40 or the $36 a month but we were actually expensing an extra week of people and overhead.  That had about a 20 basis point negative impact so I was very pleased with where the margins came in at the 16.4 for the quarter, especially based on the one is actually a positive.  It affects percent but we’re getting profit dollars in, the other is a onetime blip.

But remember, 70% of it is in place so what we’re doing is filling out the public company functionalities.  It’s not affecting whose running which division and all of that.  So they have work to do there and a little bit of work to do, like the Presidents for instance we’re selecting new board members and that type of thing.
Again, we have a very high percentage of board members already identified because as I mentioned the last time, our board members all want to participate in these companies going forward.  So that’s where they’re spending some time.  Where they also spend time is on the restructuring actions and we do get, as we just mentioned, more restructuring opportunities by putting a couple of things together that weren’t together before, but that’s all part of running a business and I view that as very positive.
It’s interesting, what ends up happening and Gautam you’re absolutely right, there’s a ton of work here but 90% of it is done by the corporate team, it’s tax, it’s legal, it’s the controllers’ group.  And as I think I mentioned on the last call, we did bring back I’d say pretty darn full time, Chris Coughlin who has been with us which has taken the big burden off of Frank and I.  Chris is leading the separation process so really myself, Frank, the teams out there running the businesses, it’s a little bit business as usual besides a couple of those points I just mentioned.  Then if you were here in Princeton and saw the corporate team you would see them all pulling their hair out.

Now by the way, that has nothing against the momentum of this business.  The orders are looking very nice.  We’re having very solid years, we just highlighted to you with our guidance.  I do think the second half of the year obviously is stronger than the first half because these new projects are just starting to kind of come in.  As Frank highlighted, we just booked the initial parts of two of them.  We haven’t booked anything on the Shell frame agreement, for instance, yet.  We haven’t booked anything on the tar sands on some stuff we’re working on.  I’m a big believer that fiscal ’12 the margins expand nicely, this business is growing nicely and I think we’re on a multiyear run here unless something happens in the global economy.

With me today are TYCO’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen, and our Chief Financial officer Frank Sklarsky.  
I would to remind you that during the course of the call, we will be providing certain forward-looking information. We ask that you look at today’s press release and read through the forward-looking cautionary informational statements that we’ve included there.  
In addition, we will use certain non-GAAP measures in our discussions and we ask you to read through the sections of our press release that address the use of these items. The press release issued this morning and all related tables, as well as the conference call slides, can be found on the investor relation’s portion website at www.TYCO.com.  
Please also note that we will be filing our annual SEC Form 10K later today. Certain items to be discussed during today’s call, including those related to the company’s proposed separations will be addressed in a proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Before making any voting decisions, investors are urged to read the proxy statement regarding the proposed separations and any other relevant documents carefully in their entirety as they become available because they will contain certain important information about the proposed separations.  
Free copies of the proxy statement, when available, and other documents filed with the SEC by TYCO can be obtained through the SEC’s website as well as through TYCO’s website. In discussing our segment operations, when we refer to changes in average revenue per user, backlog, and order activity, these figures exclude the impact of foreign currency.  Additionally, references to our earnings per share and operating margins during the call excludes special items and these metrics are non-GAAP measures.  
Again, these non-GAAP measures are reconciled in the schedules attached to our press release. For 2011, our full year and fourth quarter include an extra week of results compared to the prior year. In order to reflect the true underlying organic growth of the businesses, we have adjusted down both organic revenue growth and orders growth to exclude the estimated impact of this additional week. All references to organic revenue and order’s growth discussed in today’s call exclude the estimated impact of the extra week. 
Now, let me quickly recap this quarter’s results. Revenue in the quarter of $4.7 billion was up 14% year-over-year excluding the contribution from the electrical and metal products business in the prior year quarter.  Organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter and again, this number excludes the estimated impact of the extra week. Earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to TYCO common shareholders was $0.83 and included charges of $0.09 related to special items. Earnings per share from continuing operations before special items was $0.92 compared to our previous guidance of about $0.85 led by strong operating results across all businesses as well as a lower than expected tax rate.  
Now, let me turn the call over to Ed for some opening comments."

Continued growth in our large and",930,"Overall this was a very good year for TYCO both operationally and strategically. We had nice top line growth, strong operating margin expansion, a 25% increase in operating income and a 21% increase in earnings per share. Continued growth in our large and stable base of service and recurring revenue, momentum in our late cycle businesses and the sustained benefits of productivity and restructuring initiatives all contributed to the strong operational performance this year. Additionally, the strength of our market leading businesses has positioned TYCO well for our recent announcement to separate into three independent publically traded companies. This marks a key strategic milestone for our North America residential, commercial fire and security, and flow control businesses.  
Before I get into our results for the quarter, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing the progress we have made on the key areas of focus we laid out at the beginning of the year: growth opportunities; productivity improvements; and third, capital allocation.
Starting with growth opportunities, we continue to invest in our businesses both organically and inorganically to drive top line growth.  
Let me share with you a few highlights. Capital spending grew 12% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. A high percentage of our capital goes towards growth in our larger recurring revenue base which grew 4.5% organically in 2011, and along with service represented 45% of our total revenue. From a technology and innovation standpoint, we increased our R&D investment by an additional 12% during the year.  
We have 16 R&D centers around the globe focused on providing innovative products and services to meet our customer’s needs. For example, we are now developing Scott Connect [ph], our life safety business, which will, in addition to other benefits, allow fire fighters wearing our Scott fireproof protection gear to be remotely monitored for critical indicators such as location and air supply, thereby allowing quicker response in a hazardous situation.
Additionally, we increased our sales and marketing spend by 5% year-over-year as we continue to expand our efforts in emerging markets, align our businesses along key verticals and create awareness around our new ADT Pulse offering which was launched with our internal sales force about one year ago. We have also completed several key bolt on acquisitions across our three core platforms.  These acquisitions have increased our presence in emerging markets, broadened our technology portfolio and strengthened our competitive position.
Security solutions acquired Signature Security in April. Signature expanded our sales, installation and service capabilities to residential and small business customers in Australia and New Zealand and solidified our leading market position in that region. Next, our fire protection business acquired Chemguard, a leading provider of fire suppression products, services and specialty chemicals. Chemguard broadened our global fire suppression products portfolio and increased our R&D capabilities in firefighting foam applications. It also augments our presence in high growth areas such as the Middle East and Latin America.
Flow control required a majority ownership stake in Dubai based KEF Holdings at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter. This acquisition was a key strategic move in the Middle East for our valve business and flow control enhancing our presence in key emerging markets and industries. KEF’s products are highly complementary to our current valve offerings and provide us with one of the world’s leading steel casting facilities, while enhancing our local footprint and management team.
Thirdly, moving on to our productivity improvements, we continue to focus on restructuring and productivity programs as well as cost containment initiatives throughout the year.  These actions coupled with organic revenue growth contributed to the strong year-over-year improvement in TYCO’s operating margin of 160 basis points. Lastly, we continued to return excess cash to shareholders.  
During fiscal 2011, we used $1.3 billion of cash to repurchase 6% of our outstanding shares, and since year end have repurchased an additional 5 million shares for $200 million.
Now, turning to our results for the fourth quarter, organic revenue grew 6%. Additionally, we expanded the operating margin in the quarter by a 100 basis points year-over-year excluding the benefit related to the contribution of the electrical metal product business.  
Now let me give you a quick overview of our results in the quarter for each business and I’ll turn it over to Frank to give you more details in a few moments. Starting with security solutions, recurring revenue grew nicely in the quarter with continued momentum in ARPU and account growth.  Non-recurring revenue grew at an even higher rate than recurring driven by strong growth in North America and the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Top line growth in security coupled with the benefits of restructuring actions and productivity initiatives contributed to the 100 basis point improvement in operating margin year-over-year.  
Moving on to fire, positive order momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Increased volume in service and products as well as gains from productivity and cost containment initiatives resulted in strong operating margin performance in the quarter.  
In flow control, the 14% year-over-year increase in orders once again exceeded prior quarter levels and marks the seventh consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year order growth. Flow’s positive order trends over the last few quarters are now starting to drive top line growth.
Overall for TYCO, we have seen a nice pick up in our organic revenue growth over the last few quarters. Growth in service revenue, momentum in order activity related to our late cycle businesses, and a continued solid performance in our recurring revenue, positions us well as we’ve entered fiscal 2012. 
With that, let me turn it over to Frank."

Strong r",1571,"Before I get into the details of our business segment performance, I would like to give you an overall perspective on our financial performance in the quarter.  Revenue in the quarter of $4.7 billion grew 14% with organic revenue growth of 6%.  
Strong revenue growth across all of our businesses was led by our late cycle flow control business. When combined with cost reduction activity across all of our business units and at corporate, operating income before special items increased 25% and earnings per share grew 24% year-over-year.  
Now for our operating results by business: starting with security solutions revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $2.3 billion with 6% organic growth. Recurring revenue, which represents 57% of security’s total revenue in the quarter, continued to perform well with organic revenue growth in all geographic regions. Continued ARPU expansion and account additions drove the 5% organic revenue growth in this category.  The remaining 43% of revenue which is non-recurring in nature grew 7% organically driven by growth in every region.
From a profit perspective, operating income before special items was $374 million and the operating margin improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 16.4%. Increased investments to sales and marketing and R&D were more than offset by growth in recurring revenue and the continued positive impact of restructuring and cost containment initiatives. 
Now, let me walk you through the regional performance of security solutions for the quarter. Starting with North American residential and small business, nearly 90% of revenue is recurring and we had another strong quarter. Organic revenue grew 5% with higher average revenue per user and an increase in the number of accounts driving the positive year-over-year growth.  
The North American residential account base of 6 million customers increased 1% from the prior year. Average revenue per user grew about 3% year-over-year as new accounts were added to the base at a higher monthly revenue rate per account partly driven by the increased penetration of Pulse. During the quarter we saw continued momentum in the Pulse take rate which increased to 23% of the new accounts added by our internal sales force. Additionally, new Pulse customers continued to migrate towards the higher end packages.  
Attrition remained relatively flat at 12.9% on both the quarter sequential and year-over-year basis.
In our North American commercial business, organic revenue growth was up 7% driven mainly by retrofit and upgrade work.  
In the EMEA region, organic revenue grew 4% with growth in both recurring and non-recurring revenue for the second consecutive quarter. We continued to see substantial improvement in the operating margin in this region as past restructuring actions drove a 330 basis point year-over-year improvement to 12.7%.  
The Asia Pacific and Latin America region had a strong fourth quarter with organic revenue growth of 11%. 
Turning to some of our key metrics for the global recurring revenue business, our account base of over 9 million customers grew by more than 2% year-over-year, and global average revenue per user also grew by more than 2% on a constant currency basis to $45.35. Average revenue per user continues to benefit from our broader product offerings. Lastly, our worldwide attrition rate improved 10 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year to 12.6%.    
Let me make a quick comment on security products. Revenue in the quarter of $104 million grew 1% organically following a 24% increase in the prior year quarter and significantly improved its operating margin year-over-year while increasing its investment in R&D. Additionally, we recently announced the acquisition of Visonic, a leading global developer and manufacturer of wireless electronic security systems and components based in Israel. Visonic will expand our technology platform in wireless encryption and remote diagnostics while complementing our market presence in the intrusion security market. We expect this transaction will close by the end of the calendar year.  
Moving to fire protection, overall revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion with organic revenue growth of 4%. Service revenue in the quarter of $500 million grew 6% organically as we continued to focus efforts on expanding our service base, especially recurring service. Systems installation revenue of $460 million was down 1% on an organic basis as growth in Asia Pacific was more than offset with declines in North America and EMEA due to project selectivity and the continued softness in the non-residential construction market.
The remaining portion of our fire protection business, fire products, which encompasses the fire protection products and life safety businesses, reported revenue of $375 million in the quarter with organic revenue of 8%.  
Operating income before special items was $183 million in the quarter and the operating margin increased 160 basis points to 13.7%. Increased leverage from higher volume in the product businesses, a higher mix of service revenues across all regions, and gains from productivity and cost containment initiatives drove the operating margin improvement year-over-year.
As most of you know, the fourth quarter is fire’s strongest revenue quarter as a significant amount of electronic upgrade work is performed while schools are on breaks during the summer months. Given this seasonality and as we expected, total fire backlog of $1.13 billion declined 9% on a quarter sequential basis excluding currency. Year-over-year, orders grew 3% including 6% growth in service, 10% growth in fire products, and a 5% decline in systems installation.  
Moving to flow control, revenue of $1.08 billion was driven by strong sales in valves, as well as the continued impact of customers accelerating the completion of installation work on some large projects in thermal.  Operating income before special items was $124 million and the operating margin was 11.5%. Valves and controls which comprises about 60% of flow control’s annualized revenue grew 13% organically in the quarter. We also continued to see good sequential margin improvement in valves driven by the leverage on the incremental revenue.
Orders in valve controls remained strong during the quarter with 15% growth year-over-year. Order activity was positive in all end markets led by strong growth in oil and gas and power. We have spoken previously that there were a number of large projects awaiting final approval from our customers and we are now beginning to see larger orders from some greenfield projects including some recent project wins for a large natural gas pipeline and an aluminum refinement project in the Middle East.
Additionally, we recently announced that we will participate in a 5 year frame agreement with Shell to provide certain values and aftermarket service on a global basis. We expect this to begin resulting in order activity later this fiscal year.  
In thermal controls, organic revenue growth of 34% was driven by strong order activity over the last two quarters as thermal orders tend to translate into revenue within 60 to 90 days.
In water, organic revenue declined 18% as a result of the completion of the Australian desal project earlier this year and soft order activity in water over the last few quarters. We have, however, recently been awarded several midsized water projects and believe we’re in a very good position to win other large projects during the first half of this year. This gives us confidence that operating results in water, including margins, will improve in the second half of fiscal 2012.
Overall, flow orders in the quarter increased 14% year-over-year with a 15% increase in valves, a 41% increase in thermal, and a 14% decline in water. Backlog of $1.74 billion increased 4% on a quarter sequential basis.  
Now, let me touch on a few other important items. First, our cash and overall balance sheet remains strong. For the year, we generated operating cash flow of $2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.1 billion which included $252 million of cash paid for special items. While working capital grew somewhat during the year as a result of our revenue growth, working capital days were in line with the prior year.  
We’re also pleased with the continued improvement in the average duration of our accounts receivable.  
Next, corporate expense before special items was $107 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year corporate expense to $392 million.  We expect corporate expense in 2012 to be similar to last year with first quarter expense in the range of $90 to $95 million.  
Our effective tax rate for the quarter and full year, before the impact of special items was 15.5%. The tax rate was favorably impacted by a number of one-time items during the year. For fiscal 2012, we are expecting our full year effective tax rate before special items to be in the range of 19% to 20% with a tax rate in the first quarter of approximately 20%.  
With regard to fiscal 2012 guidance related to other below the line items, net interest expense is expected to increase to $225 million, primarily due to a lower average cash balance.  
Lastly, let me quickly touch on restructuring. We ended 2011 with total restructuring and acquisition related charges of $126 million. In light of the separation announcement, we have identified several actions to further streamline our operations. We expect to incur restructuring charges in the range of $125 to $150 million in 2012. These charges are in addition to the $700 million of costs related to the separation, and both of these figures will be excluded when we provide our guidance for 2012.  
Now, let me turn things back over to Ed to wrap up this morning’s call."

The most complicated work is in our legal, tax, and financial reporting groups and we are making good progress in each of these areas. In addition, we are in the proces",526,"Before I go to guidance, I wanted to provide a quick update regarding the separation.  The most complicated work is in our legal, tax, and financial reporting groups and we are making good progress in each of these areas. In addition, we are in the process of building out the management teams with public company capability and we have also begun the process of recruiting new independent board members for our companies. Overall, we are on track with the separation process.  
Now let’s turn to our earnings guidance for the full year. As you know, exchange rates have been extremely volatile. So using current exchange rates we expect total revenue of $17.5 billion to $17.7 billion. Embedded in this guidance is year-over-year organic revenue growth of 4.5% to 5.5% which excludes the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and the extra week in fiscal 2011. Based on the actions we have taken to date to streamline our operations and the additional actions we are planning for fiscal 2012, we expect the revenue increase to leverage quite nicely resulting in year-over-year operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points. This represents an overall increase in operating income before special items of approximately 10% to 13%. 
Based on these items and the specific guidance Frank provided for corporate expense and below the line items, including a higher tax rate, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items for the full year to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.60. As in prior years, we expect our earnings per share to be stronger in the second half of the year due to the normal seasonality of our businesses. 
Now, let’s shift to our guidance for the first quarter. Starting with security solutions, we expect continued growth in both recurring and non-recurring revenue, with overall organic revenue growth of approximately 4% year-over-year. The operating margin for the first quarter is expected to be similar to last year’s first quarter.  
Turning to fire, growth in service and product revenue is expected to be partially offset by a continued modest decline in systems installation.  We expect total revenue of approximately $1.1 billion with an operating margin of approximately 12%.  
In our flow control business, we expect to see year-over-year organic revenue growth of approximately 8% driven by the continued momentum in valve order activity. In total, we expect flow controls revenue to approximate $915 million, with an operating margin of 11%.  We expect sequential operating margin expansion each quarter in fiscal 2012 and anticipate reaching a 14% margin in flow sometime during the second half of the year as we continue to leverage the increased volume in valves and begin executing on water projects.  
Overall for TYCO, we expect revenue in the first quarter to approximate $4.2 billion with an operating margin of approximately 12%. This coupled with our expectations for corporate expense and below the line items, we expect earnings per share from continuing operations before special items in the first quarter to be about $0.77.

So I would expect we’ll repurchase some more shares here as we move forward, but we do have a couple of timing issues. One, because of separation we really have to do our acquisitions in the first half of this year because we have to kind of freeze our books, if I could say it, going into the second half of the year with all our filings. We have 3 or 4 acquisitions we expect are going to total about $250 million. We’re very excited about them, they’re strategic for the businesses, but they will be in the first half of the year.

In security, the technology turns over quicker Jeff so we kind of look at it, when you go back and really study it, it’s kind of a 4 to 5 year turnover, a lot of new software products, so the electronics tend to turn over softer so as the markets have come back some, and Frank made this point, 90% of the orders were getting are retrofit and upgrade work because there’s not a lot of new non-resi construction out there. So we’re seeing that more.  And in fire, the products clearly last longer, more in the 9 to 10 year, double that range so that’s a key part of it right there. However, when you look at kind of the macro picture and then our picture, us being down a little bit on systems install, we are also impacting that by the selectivity of projects. As I mentioned the last few quarters, we’ve really made a concerted efforts not to go after certain verticals on install and go after more, I call them more core verticals, which I’d say hospitals, universities, those types of things we want and we want to get the recurring tail on those.  So we’re clearly impacting that by a few points on our own. I do think Jeff, if you do some study around this, I think that if you look at our results both security and fire on the commercial side, I think it’s very clear this year we’ve gained some share in the marketplace.  
Even on fire where we’re a little negative on system install we’re less than half as negative as the overall market is so I actually feel really good on our overall position. I do think systems install will continue to impact us on fire through this year. We’re kind of expecting it to kind of be flat. Some quarters down a little, maybe up a little but generally no growth there.

It really is about strong balance sheets with giving these companies financial flexibility to pursue their own growth strategies.  That’s really where we’re focused on.

A lot of the beta tests that I’m looking at now have product systems that are sort of trainable in a handful of hours, six hours, 10 hours of training for some of these guys. I’m just wondering what you’re seeing on that front in terms of level of competitiveness from these other folks. Pricing, as I understand it, also coming in around maybe $10 below your low end.

There is no change to any of our metrics and we track them all [inaudible] rates, ARPU rates, the whole thing in those markets.  By the way, I think you can tell from other companies’ public comments there is very little momentum. But, you have to remember -- first of all, Steve, you have to look at it apples-to-apples. Let me give you for one instance, we have one competitor in a couple of markets that to your point is $8 to $10 below us but on an apples-to-apples basis because we include in ours our service maintenance package, we’re really almost right on top of each other.
I don’t see pricing -- and by the way there are people that are launching a couple of systems that are actually a couple of bucks above us. I think when you neutralize everything and really look at it apples-to-apples which we do in every market, everyone’s pricing is pretty similar and that does not surprise me with the costs and the structure you have to have to run the business.  
Secondly, by the way, you’ll always see people do promotional deals. I always use the example with all of you, watch cable and satellite guys, so sometimes you have to ferret through what’s promotional and what’s the real run rate after six or eight months in the business. We track all that stuff very carefully. But no, we’ve seen no change whatsoever in growth rates or anything in those markets.
By the way Steve, it’s not just the install people, remember 90% of what we sell in security, we have a sales person go in the home, talk about where all the products should be in the home, especially with the interactive service with cameras, energy management control what do you want controlled what do you don’t?  It’s a pretty in depth sales process and that’s the reason we have between our dealer network and internal network 9,000 sales people in every town and city around the country.  It’s not just the install, there’s a lot more to it and I think we’ll continue to see nice momentum in fiscal ’12."

Finally, I’m shuffling a little bit because it’s about probably by the end of this quarter, you’re absolutely right this will be about a year after this quarter where we’ve really started focusing on the verticals with the project selectivity. So I don’t think that comment keeps lapping itself as we go through the rest of this year, to your point.
But remember, the market, I looked at some data the last couple of days again, the actuals because I don’t really care about the forecasts, the actuals on construction numbers, the dodge reports and all that, and the industry year-over-year is probably down 7% to 8%, maybe almost to 9% when you look at the data and we’re down way, way less than that. I also think if you look at some third party reports you’ll see that we did gain share.  I think we have a couple of competitors that are consolidating businesses together, they’re maybe not as focused right now and I think that probably plays in to it also. The selectivity piece, I think by the time we wrap up this quarter, I would say that’s really the one year lap on it."

When you start putting 2 major global platforms together, and the teams are now meeting with each other, I think we have 23 different streams of teams meeting. It’s marketing, it’s IT, it’s sales, it’s the whole thing, you go down the list. We’re identifying other great projects as the teams start talking to each other so that’s really where it comes from.

You know, you always test it and tweak it so there’s always changes, but back to the prior conversation, I think we sit very nice competitively with our pricing on the interactive platform, from everything we’ve seen out there. So I kind of feel we’re in the sweet spot of where we should be on that. The take rate did hit 23%. We said all along that we expect to get the take rate to 25% or 30% so I’d take the 25% off and I’d say 30% was always our initial goal. I would say, I think you can see from these results, we’re just tracking very nicely there.
If you go back since we launched, we started with a 14%, went to a 15%, went to a 20%, now to a 23% it’s pretty nice progress. The other thing I’m happy about is let me just read you the top package, the premier package because Frank had mentioned this in his comments. The premier package if you go back to the first quarter of the year started at 10% take rate. So out of those that take it, now I’m giving you the percent that take the top package, 10%. The second quarter was 17%, the third quarter was 23% of those that take it and the fourth quarter was 25% so off the 1/4.
So not only are we seeing the take rate overall for interactive go up but our people are getting better, and better, which is the way it always works at moving people up with the packages. We’re also seeing that momentum. I think as we get later in the year, we’ll talk about what the targets are for this type of business. Obviously, I think we’re nicely on track and remember, we’re going to launch the dealers as we exit this year.  We’re in market trials with them right now and remember, these numbers are only from half the sales force which is the internal sales force."

First of all, the IRRs on the interactive platform are higher. By the way, that’s with the install time being longer obviously because there’s a lot more here, more complications to it. Now, I will point out that one of the things we like is we will get better and better as kind of the next year goes along on our install time. We really spend a lot of time working on that because I think back to one of the prior questions, that’s very important that you continue to work that down. Anyway, the IRRs are higher than the typical ADT account that comes on. By that IRR, is making an assumption that we stick with the current attrition rates that the company has, I think from all data points all of us have from these types of businesses, it’s going to be a stickier account over time and so, hopefully, there’s some movement on attrition, certainly to that part of the base. I think the second part of your question is the one that’s exciting, we just have to get to the point where we can go back and do this, and that’s that the existing base, and I think I’ve given you these numbers before, but the existing base of ADT accounts, the heritage base what I would call it, is sitting in there at $36. The Broadview accounts that we brought on a year ago are sitting at $33 and Pulse is selling at $50 on average.

But remember, 70% of it is in place so what we’re doing is filling out the public company functionalities. It’s not affecting whose running which division and all of that. So they have work to do there and a little bit of work to do, like the Presidents for instance we’re selecting new board members and that type of thing.
Again, we have a very high percentage of board members already identified because as I mentioned the last time, our board members all want to participate in these companies going forward. So that’s where they’re spending some time. Where they also spend time is on the restructuring actions and we do get, as we just mentioned, more restructuring opportunities by putting a couple of things together that weren’t together before, but that’s all part of running a business and I view that as very positive.
It’s interesting, what ends up happening and Gautam you’re absolutely right, there’s a ton of work here but 90% of it is done by the corporate team, it’s tax, it’s legal, it’s the controllers’ group. And as I think I mentioned on the last call, we did bring back I’d say pretty darn full time, Chris Coughlin who has been with us which has taken the big burden off of Frank and I.

Now by the way, that has nothing against the momentum of this business.  The orders are looking very nice. We’re going to have a very solid year, as we just highlighted to you with our guidance. I do think the second half of the year obviously is stronger than the first half because these new projects are just starting to kind of come in.
