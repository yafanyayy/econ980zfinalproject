Good morning and thank you for joining us. The past year was marked by significant accomplishments at our company. I’m pleased to report that 2010 core earnings reached $2.75 per share within the upper end of our most recent earnings guida",1913,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning and thank you for joining us. The past year was marked by significant accomplishments at our company. I’m pleased to report that 2010 core earnings reached $2.75 per share within the upper end of our most recent earnings guidance range issued in late October and nearly equaling 2009 core earnings of $2.79 per share.
Improved earnings at our regulated utilities nearly offset a decline in core results from our Merchant Generation business. Factors favorably affecting 2010 core earnings included a 9% increase in electric Kwh sales to native load customers, new electric utility rates, lower financing cost and disciplined cost management.
The increase in Kwh sales was the result of favorable weather, a recovering economy, and the return to full service of the large customers’ aluminum smelter plant. Total kwh sales to industrial customers rose 16% and even after excluding sales to the aluminum smelter plant, industrial sales increased 8%. Kwh sales to residential and commercial customers rose 7%.
Items offsetting these favorable factors included lower Merchant Generation margins due to lower power prices and higher fuel and related transportation cost and higher companywide depreciation and amortization expenses.
Overall, our non-fuel operations and maintenance cost increased only slightly reflecting the cost of the refueling outage at our Callaway Nuclear Plant, offset by disciplined cost management across all of our business segments.
You may recall that our nuclear plant did not have a refueling outage in 2009. Per share results also reflected an increased average number of common shares outstanding.
Turning to page #4, you will find a list of other accomplishments in 2010. We’ve discussed many of these with you previously, so I won’t touch on each of them. However, I’d like to highlight the fact that free cash flow reached the positive $341 million in 2010. In addition, our safety and customer satisfaction showed improvement compared to 2009, as both power plant and distribution system reliability remained solid.
We returned our newly rebuild Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric plant to service and placed scrubbers into service at three of our power generating units. And we launched plants for growing our transmission business. All of the accomplishments listed were the result of a focused and dedicated workforce.
Moving now to page #5 today, we also announced 2011 GAAP and core earnings guidance of $2.20 per share to $2.60 per share. The expected decline in 2011 core earnings per share compared to 2010 primarily reflects an assumed return to normal weather and expected lower margins at our Merchant Generation business.
I’m pleased to report that we expect positive free cash flow in 2011. In fact, our Merchant Generation business expects positive free cash flow, even though 2011 capital expenditures for this segment are expected to increase, compared to prior guidance.
This increase in capital expenditures reflects our plan to accelerate the installation of scrubbers at our Newton plant and the addition of an equipment upgrade at one of our large Merchant Generation plants.
We’ve moved up the in-service dates of the two scrubbers at Newton by approximately one year to late 2013 and spring 2014. This decision was driven by our plants are complying with the US EPA proposed Clean Air Transport Rule.
Installing scrubbers at Newton is also a key part of our plan for complying with the Illinois multi-pollutant standards.
Shifting to capital spending plans in our Regulated businesses, the five-year budget that Marty will discuss in a few minutes now includes the cost of installing scrubbers at two of our Missouri coal-fired units. These scrubbers are projected to enter service by late 2015. Marty will provide further details on our 2010 earnings and cash flow and our 2011 earnings and cash flow guidance including budgeted capital expenditures.
Before Marty speaks, I’d like to review recent regulatory developments at our utilities. Turning to page #6, we’ve been authorized to increase rates at both our Missouri and Illinois utilities over the past 12 months.
In mid 2010, our Missouri utility obtained approval from the Missouri Public Service Commission to increase electric rates by $230 million annually and then in February this year to increase gas rates by $9 million annually. These rate increases have been necessary to recover the costs of infrastructure investments, higher fuel costs and other operating expenses.
While on the topic of prior rate orders, I’d like to comment on ongoing litigation surrounding appeals of certain aspects of the two most recent Missouri Electric orders.
As disclosed in an 8-K filed on Wednesday of last week the Missouri Office of Public Counsel made a filing with the Missouri Public Service Commission arguing that a late December Missouri Circuit Court stay of our 2010 electric rate increase as it applies to four industrial customers should now be effective for all customers.
Needless to say, this would be unprecedented and we adamantly disagree with the OPC’s argument. In late December, the Missouri Circuit Court found that four industrial customers appealing the 2010 electric rate increase could pay the portions of their bills representing increases from previously approved levels into the court’s registry pending resolution of these appeals. This effectively stayed the rate increase for those parties.
We disagree with the court’s ruling granting these industrial customers a stay and we do not believe any of the issues being appealed by the parties are probable of loss based on the merits.
Given that this is an act of legal matter, we won’t be able to comment further on this call, but we’ll be responding to the arguments of the Office of Public Counsel in supporting arguments made by certain industrial customers and filings with the Missouri Public Service Commission this week.
Turning now to Illinois. In November 2010, our Illinois delivery utility received an order on rehearing from the Illinois Commerce Commission on issues arising from the Commission’s amended order of May 2010. This rehearing order brought the total annual revenue increase in this case to $53 million.
Moving to pending rate cases in September 2010, our Missouri Utility filed for a $263 million annual electric revenue increase. On February 8, other parties filed their initial testimony.
While we strongly disagree with elements of the staffs and other parties initial recommendation this case is still in its early stages. We look forward to presenting our case to the Missouri Public Service Commission beginning in April. A Public Service Commission order is expected in July.
A few days ago, our Illinois electric and gas delivery utility filed with the Illinois Commerce Commission for a $111 million increase in annual revenues. This request is based on a test year ending December 31st 2012 with an ICC decision expected in January of 2012.
The use of a future test year is designed to better match our 2012 rate levels to our expected 2012 cost, reducing regulatory lag and providing an improved opportunity to earn a fair return on investment.
Marty will provide further details on the interveners initial recommendations in the Missouri electric case and the Illinois delivery rate filing.
In addition to these developments in our state jurisdictions, we’re awaiting action from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on our filing for pre-approval of supportive rate treatment for Phase I of our proposed Grand Rivers regional electric transmission projects.
We continue to position our company for long-term success. On February, the 9th we announced changes in assignments for several members of our executive management.
Chuck Naslund, who did a tremendous job of better positioning our Merchant Generation business to weather this period of low power prices, will assume the role of Senior Vice President, Generation and Environmental Projects at Ameren Missouri. Chuck will also lead our Ameren wide generation initiative, which includes evaluation and optimization of environmental compliant strategies.
In Chuck’s career at Ameren, he has a one time or another overseen the operation of all our power plants and has been instrumental at optimizing the performance of our Merchant Sioux existing scrubbers and re-evaluating and lowering projected cost of compliance with the Illinois Multi-Pollutant Standard.
Over the coming months we expect to see a host of proposals and rules from the US EPA and I believe that having Chuck’s focused time and attention on Ameren wide compliance planning efforts will ensure that we make the best decisions for our future.
Steve Sullivan, our Corporate Secretary and General Counsel succeeds Chuck as President and CEO of Ameren Energy Resources. In addition to his many years of legal, regulatory and financial experience, Steve has also been responsible for overseeing government and regulatory relations at both the state and federal levels, fuel purchasing and our electric transmission organization.
We’re making these changes and others within our organization to take full advantage of our leadership expertise and bring new ideas to the evolving business conditions we face.
As I mentioned, this could be a pivotal year in the area of environmental regulation. The EPA is scheduled to finalize its proposed clean air transport rule which is aimed at reducing emissions of sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Further the agency has scheduled proposed requirements for retrofitting power plants with maximum, achievable, control technologies to reduce hazardous air pollutants such as mercury and acid gases.
The EPA is also expected to issue cooling water standards and rules for reducing green house gas emissions. These rules are expected to impose additional cost that could be substantial for the company and therefore our customers.
I want to assure you that we’ve a team of experts in place who are continually anticipating and evaluating changing environmental standards for our power plants and are focused on meeting these requirements in a most cost-effective manner possible.
In addition, we’re actively working to shape new environmental rules for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our strategy for financial success is unchanged.
Our regulated utilities remain focused on earning fair returns on investment by seeking consistent constructive regulatory outcomes including mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag like the use of the future test year in our Illinois rate filing. Further, we continue to focus on disciplined cost management, including aligning our spending with the levels of rates authorized by our regulators.
In 2010, our regulated utilities narrowed the gap between their core earnings and they are allowed returns on equity by almost 300 basis points and by more than 100 basis points on a weather-normalized basis. Our 2011 regulated utility earnings guidance equates to a return on equity of 8% to 9% in line with the improved level we achieved in 2010 on a weather-normalized basis.
Let me be clear that this return continues to be below our authorized level and what we consider to be appropriate. We believe our pending rate cases, our cost control efforts and ongoing work to improve our regulatory frameworks will allow us to further narrow the gap between our earned and allowed returns.
Our Merchant Generation business continues to aggressively manage operating and capital costs so that this business remains well-positioned to weather current low power prices and benefit from an expected power price recovery. In 2010, our Merchant Generation business further lowered its cost structure to enhance its long-term competitiveness.
At the same time, we’ve increased the resources we’re dedicating to marketing and delivering higher value energy projects to large retail customers in the Midwest region, where we compete. And at both our regulated and Merchant businesses we remain committed to operating in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Marty.

Turning to page #7 of the presentation and the year 2010 column, today, we reported 2010 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $0.58 per share compared to 2009 GAAP earnings of $2.78 per share. Exclud",2900,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to page #7 of the presentation and the year 2010 column, today, we reported 2010 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $0.58 per share compared to 2009 GAAP earnings of $2.78 per share. Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren reported 2010 core earnings of $2.75 per share, compared with 2009 core earnings of $2.79 per share.
2010 core earnings exclude three items that are included in GAAP earnings. The first of these is goodwill and other asset impairment charges associated with our Merchant Generation business. We recorded these charges in the third quarter. These non-cash charges reduced 2010 GAAP results by $522 million or $2.19 per share.
The second item excluded is a $0.08 per share gain from the net effect of an unrealized mark-to-market activity.
The third item excluded in arriving at 2010 core earnings is a charge for the deferred tax impact of new Federal Healthcare loss which decreased earnings by $0.06 per share.
On page #8, we highlight key factors driving the variance between core earnings per share for 2010 and 2009. Factors favorably impacting this comparison included increased regulated electric and natural gas margins, excluding the impact of rate changes. These margins lifted earnings by $0.71 per share driven by the previously discussed increase in electricity sales.
Warmer summer and to a lesser extent colder winter weather increased 2010 earnings by an estimated $0.40 per share compared to 2009 and by an estimated $0.24 per share compared to normal weather.
New utility rates increased 2010 earnings by $0.36 per share net of certain related expenses compared to 2009 results. Reduced financing expenses, primarily reflecting increased capitalization of construction financing costs or AFEDC, improved 2010 earnings by $0.10 per share.
Factors adversely impacting the comparison between 2010 and 2009 core earnings included a decline in 2010 margins at the Merchant Generation business of $0.79 per share compared to 2009. This reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs.
Higher depreciation and amortization expenses reduced 2010 earnings by $0.09 per share, reflecting increased investment in our businesses. These investments included scrubbers placed in service in late 2009 and early 2010 at the Coffeen Merchant Generation plant.
Higher non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses decreased 2010 earnings by $0.02 per share compared to 2009. Expenditures in 2010 reflected the cost of the Callaway refueling outage. There was no refueling outage in 2009.
As Tom mentioned, these costs were mitigated by disciplined cost management across all our business segments. This included reduced non-fuel O&M spending at our Merchant Generation business.
Last, an increased average number of common shares outstanding reduced 2010 earnings as compared to 2009 on a per share basis. This increase in shares primarily reflected our September 2009 stock offering.
Turning to page #9, I’d now like to discuss the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2011 earnings guidance for our Missouri and Illinois regulated utility businesses of $2.05 to $2.30 per share. In 2011, we expect to achieve an earned return on equity of approximately 8% to 9% on regulated average utility common equity of about $6.2 billion. This guidance for our regulated utilities assumes a return to normal weather reducing EPS by an estimated $0.24, compared to 2010 results.
Weather-normalized margins are expected to increase as a result of moderate growth in weather-normalized electricity sales volumes, new Missouri natural gas delivery rates effective in February and Missouri electric rates expected to be effective in early August.
Regulated utility earnings guidance for 2011 incorporates increased non-fuel operations and maintenance costs as well as increased depreciation and amortization expenses.
From a timing perspective, this year’s Callaway Nuclear Plant refueling and maintenance outage is scheduled for the fall compared to the spring refueling in 2010 and the 2011 cost is expected to be slightly less than the 2010 level.
In 2011, financing costs are expected to increase because of lower equity related capitalized financing costs or AFUDC. This lower equity related AFUDC is expected to reduce earnings by $0.11 per share compared to 2010.
Amongst other things, the post-construction accounting treatment authorized for the Sioux scrubbers in the 2010 Missouri electric rate order provides for Ameren Missouri to continue to capitalize for regulatory purposes, its full financing cost including equity related cost through the date when the new electric rates go into effect.
However, accounting rules do not permit the recognition of current income for the equity portion of carrying costs being capitalized. That income will be recognized over the regulatory recovery period.
Moving to page #10, let’s now shift to a discussion of the key drivers and assumptions behind our 2011 Merchant Generation business earnings guidance. We expect this business segment to post earnings of $0.15 to $0.30 per share this year.
The largest driver of the expected earnings decline in 2011 compared to 2010 is a decrease in margins of $0.10 to $0.20 per share due to lower realized power prices and higher oil and fuel costs.
We expect our merchant plants to generate approximately 29.5 million MWh in 2011 with approximately 26 million MWh of this sold or hedged at an average price of $46 per MWh.
Our guidance assumes that all non-hedged expected generation is sold at current market prices. In 2011, we anticipate having base-load capacity available to generate up to 34 million MWh in the event power prices rise and support higher generation levels.
Further we estimate that a $5 per MWh improvement in 2011 market power prices as compared to current prices would increase our 2011 generation output by approximately 2 million MWh and our 2011 Merchant Generation margin by approximately $30 million.
Our all-in base-load fuel costs are about 90% hedged and we expect the all-in cost of such volume to be approximately $23.50 per megawatt hour. We project non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses will approximate $310 million in 2011.
Depreciation expense at the Merchant Generation business is expected to be essentially flat while interest expense is expected to decline increasing earnings by approximately $0.06 per share. This lower projected interest expense primarily reflects the benefit of redeeming $200 million of Genco debt in late 2010.
Regarding key Ameren wide assumptions our earnings guidance reflects an effective consolidated income tax rate of approximately 36.5% to 37% which incorporates the expected impact of higher Illinois state income taxes.
The average number of common share outstanding in 2011 is expected to approximate $242 million up from approximately $239 million in 2010. Reflecting the use of new issue shares for our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) plans.
As I close our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance. I’ll remind you that any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will affect our GAAP earnings but are excluded from our GAAP and core earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses.
Further, our earnings guidance for 2011 is subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in the forward-looking statement section of today’s press release.
Turning then to page #11 we provide both our actual 2010 and projected 2011 cash flow information. As Tom mentioned, we’re able to achieve free cash flow of $341 million in 2010. For 2011, we anticipate free cash flow of approximately $100 million. Cash from operations included the benefits of bonus depreciation, actual for 2010 and expected for 2011.
For 2011, cash from operations includes a planned incremental contribution to Ameren Illinois post-retirement benefit plan of up to $100 million. The amount is expected to be confirmed in the course of Ameren Illinois rate case.
Despite lower expected earnings and higher capital expenditures at our Merchant Generation business, we anticipate that free cash flow from this business will be positive in 2011. Our only long-term debt maturity in 2011 is a $150 million senior secured note at our Illinois regulated utility which we planned to redeem using available cash on its balance sheet.
Our total available liquidity was a solid $1.7 billion at the end of January 2011. This includes cash on hand as well as available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities.
Moving now to an update on key pending regulatory matters, on page #12, we provide a summary of the pending Missouri electric rate case. As Tom mentioned, we’ve filed a request with the Missouri Public Service Commission for $263 million rate increase that incorporates a 10.9% return on equity, a 51% equity ratio and rate base of $6.8 billion.
The vast majority of the rate increase request is driven by rate-based investments and higher net based fuel cost. By the time rates go into effect, we’ll put into service an excess of $1 billion of new investments to improve reliability and provide cleaner air for our customers.
The filed rate base is approximately $850 million higher than the level used to set rates in the May 2010 order. Approximately, $73 million of the revenue request relates to increased net base fuel cost.
On page #13, on February 8, other parties filed their initial recommendations in this case. The Missouri Public Service Commission staff recommended a $72 million annual revenue increase using the 8.75% midpoint of their recommended return on equity range and a 51% equity ratio.
The most significant drivers of the difference between our request and the staff’s recommendation are, return on equity, which accounts for about $125 million of the difference at the staff’s midpoint; rate base adjustments, including $32 million proposed Sioux scrubber disallowance, which in total account for about $25 million of the revenue requirement difference; various operations and maintenance expense differences of about $25 million to $30 million; and net base fuel cost adjustments of $15 million to $20 million.
Also, the staff recommended that the fuel adjustment clause be changed to pass-through to customers 85% of deviations between actual net fuel cost and the level of net fuel cost included in base rates. Currently, 95% of deviations are passed through. Other particulars of the staff’s recommendations are listed on page #13.
Several other parties also filed recommendations in the case. The Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers recommended $147 million of downward adjustments to our requested revenue requirement.
These downward adjustments included approximately $65 million related to a 9.75% midpoint return on equity, approximately $26 million related to income and property taxes and approximately $24 million related to lower net-based fuel costs and various amortizations.
As is typical, MIEC did not directly address every element of our rate filing. The Missouri Energy Group, which represents certain other business customers, filed testimony supporting a 10.2% midpoint return on equity.
Finally, the Office of Public Counsel has recommended disallowance of the approximately $90 million of Taum Sauk power plant investment, which we’ve included in our filed rate base.
We are asking for a recovery of only the portion of Taum Sauk costs that are related to enhancements or that would have been incurred in the absence of the upper reservoir breach that occurred several years ago, consistent with our 2007 settlement agreement with the State of Missouri.
We’ll soon update our filing for operating and financial data through the end of the true-up period, which is the 28th of this month. As a result, it is likely that many of the numbers put forward by parties to the case including those of Ameren Missouri will be adjusted.
We expect that the updated numbers will be reflected in an April 20th public filing by the Public Service Commission staff and evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin on April 26th. A Public Service Commission order is expected in July with new rates expected to be effective in early August.
Turning then to page #14, on February 18th our Illinois utility filed a request with the Illinois Commerce Commission to increase electric and gas delivery rates by $111 million annually. The request incorporates returns on equity of 11.25% for electric service and 11% for gas service.
Filed capitalization is 53% equity with aggregate rate base of approximately $3 billion. The request is based on a future test year ended December 31, 2012.
Amongst other items, we’re asking for a pension expense rider that synchronize the amount of pension expenses recovered in rates to the actual of each year’s pension expenses.
We are also requesting the authority to defer the impact of the increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate which climbed from 7.3% to 9.5% on January 1, 2011 and to collect the resulting regulatory assets over a two-year period.
Key drivers of the rate request are listed on this page. They include higher operating expenses, net of reductions at administrative and general and pension and benefits expenses. Other drivers are higher income and other taxes and the cost of capital reflecting proposed rates of return and an updated capital structure.
In addition, we’re requesting revenues to reflect higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Expected low growth mitigates the requested rate increase. The Illinois Commerce Commission is required to issue a rate decision in 11 months and new rates are expected to be effective by mid-January 2012.
We are certainly aware that higher utility rates are difficult to some of our customers to absorb, especially in the current economic environment. At both our Illinois and Missouri utilities, we’ve taken many proactive steps to help our customers manage their energy costs. These steps have included reductions in planned operating and capital spending.
Our cost control efforts benefit utility customers by holding down the amount of rate increases we need to request. Other steps that help customers manage their energy costs include our active energy efficiency programs in both Illinois and Missouri.
On page #15, we detail Ameren’s updated five-year capital expenditure outlook. Over the 2011 through 2015 period, cumulative capital spending is projected to range between $6.4 billion and $8.2 billion with an annual target range of between $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion.
I’d characterize the environmental expenditures embedded in this outlook as those required to meet current environmental rules and regulations as well as our assessment of the likely impact of the proposed Clean Air Transport Rule and coal combustion byproduct rules.
As Tom discussed, this five-year budget includes the estimated cost of installing scrubbers at each of the two units of our Merchant Generation Newton plant and at two units of a Missouri regulated plant.
On this page we also provide a percentage breakdown of our five-year infrastructure investment budget for our regulated businesses by jurisdiction and type, be it FERC-regulated transmission, Missouri regulated environmental controls, or Illinois Regulated.
Moving now to page #16, we outline our expected capital expenditures for our Merchant Generation business for each of the next five years, showing the breakdown between expenditures for maintenance and for environmental compliance. The amounts on this graph reflect the previously mentioned acceleration of the in-service states for scrubbers at the Newton plant and the previously mentioned equipment upgrade.
These Merchant Generation numbers are included in the total Ameren-wide capital expenditures that I discussed a few minutes ago. Of course, we’ll continue to review and adjust our Merchant Generation spending plan in light of evolving outlooks for power prices, delivered fuel cost, environmental standards and compliance technology among other factors.
Moving now to page #17, we provide an update on our 2011 and 2012 forward power sales and hedges and introduce our 2013 hedge data. As you can see we’ve significant hedges in place at power prices above current market levels. We already discussed our 2011 power hedges. For 2012, we’ve hedged approximately 15 million MWh at an average price of $50 per MWh.
Further for 2013, we’ve hedged approximately 7.5 million MWh at an average price of $42 per MWh. I’d note that about 55% of the MWh hedged in 2013 are associated with long term contracts and the remainder of our financial contracts.
None of the financial contracts hedged in 2012 and 2013 expected sales are Sinhub [ph] contracts and the pricing reflected has already been basis adjusted as necessary to Illinois generation node pricing, based on two years historical average basis differentials.
Our capacity sales are approximately 75% hedged for 2011 appropriately 44% hedged for 2012 and approximately 22% hedged in 2013. To assist you in understanding our Merchant Generation business segments margin drivers we’ve provided a pie chart that breaks down our 2011 expected revenue by type.
Turning to our final page, no. 18, we update our Merchant Generation segment’s fuel and related transportation hedges. We previously discussed our 2011 fuel hedges. For 2011, we’ve hedged approximately 16 million MWh at about $25 per MWh. For 2013, we’ve hedged approximately 4 million MWh at about $28.50 per MWh.
These 2013 co-hedges include a large proportion of our expected burn of Illinois basin coal and a much smaller proportion of our expected burn of Powder River basin coal.
To provide perspective, our typical burn is 3% Illinois and 97% Powder River basin coal. The embedded cost of coal in this 2013 hedge price is approximately $24 per ton which is approximately $7.50 per ton higher than current 2013 broker quotes for PRB coal.
Similar to our previous slide, dealing with Merchant Generation revenues we’ve included a pie chart that breaks down forecasted 2011 all-in fuel cost to provide a perspective on how each component contributes to our overall cost.
This completes our prepared remarks. We’ll now be happy to take your questions.

Previously, we had forecast that at 2014 and 2015, we’ve moved that up to late 2013, early 2014.
And as we said on the call, primarily because of the expected impact that the Clean Air Transport Rules will have on our fleet, so we believe it’s prudent to move that investment up and that’s the big driver of the cash flows.

Let me try and address your questions, because I think they’re probably two of them in there. Number one, as you saw in the 8-K filing, basically, the Office of Public Counsel and some of our industrial customers are arguing that a stay of our rate increase which was granted to four of our industrial customers in the December 2010 Circuit Court order should essentially be applied to all customers, and that is essentially what they have asked the Commission to address. They have not addressed the commission to address the essential merits of those two rate orders, which are on appeal before the various courts. Those orders probably had anywhere from 8 to 10 issues which are still pending.
And so in the bigger picture of things when you look at those issues which are being appealed, they are obviously at much smaller subset, compared to the overall rate increase, and as I have stated on the call, we do not believe that any of those issues on the merits are a probable loss at this time, and we’ll continue to address those appropriately in the courts.
And, of course, as Tom said in the call, we strongly disagree with the positions taken by both the Office of Public Counsel and the industrial customers in their interpretation of that circuit order, as well as the overall stay order that was issued in December of 2010 and you can plan on us to vigorously defend our position before the Public Service Commission and the courts as appropriate and you can expect our complete response to those matters, no later than February 25.

Concerning the rate formula bill, we certainly are very supportive of the bill as it’s been presented. As you know, it would enable utilities to continue to make prudent and reasonable investments into the system and then be allowed to realize a reasonable return on the investment.
The amendment is the rate formula bill will be introduced this afternoon in a committee hearing and then from that point on, it will begin the process of discussions and eventually consideration. It’s very early in the session to give any sort of prediction but we and other will participate and we’ll strive to see if we can end up with a workable compromise and do so yet this spring legislative session.

We feel like when we get out to 2015 the necessary efforts and expenditures will be behind us.

Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we announced Q1 2011 core earnings of $0.25 per share compared to Q1 2010 core earnings of $0.40 per share.

Today we announced Q1 2011 core earnings of $0.25 per share compared to Q1 2010 core earnings of $0.40 per share. These results were in line with our expectations despite being lower than those of the same period last year. The decline in core earnings per share was primarily the result of reduced margins in our Merchant Generations segment, as well as higher operations and maintenance expenses and reduced capitalized financing costs in our regulated utilities segments.
Kilowatt hours sales of electricity to native load utility customers decreased 3% in Q1 of 2011 compared to Q1 of 2010 due in part to milder winter temperatures. Kilowatt hour sales to residential and commercial customers, both of which are temperature-sensitive, declined 4%. Kilowatt hour sales to industrial customers grew a strong 7%, an encouraging sign of continued economic growth.
The decline in merchant generation segment margins reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs. The higher O&M expenses at our Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois regulated utilities segments in Q1 of 2011 largely reflected increased storm-related expenses compared to Q1 of 2010. We continued to exercise disciplined cost control in Q1 2011 with operations and maintenance expenses, excluding storm-related costs, up just slightly over the year-ago quarter. Factors favorably contributing to Q1 2011 core earnings compared to Q1 2010 core earnings included lower interest expenses and 2010 electric rate changes in Missouri and Illinois.
Turning to page 4. Today we are reaffirming our GAAP and core earnings guidance of $2.20 to $2.60 per share for this year. Further we are reiterating our GAAP and core guidance ranges of $2.05 to $2.30 per share for our combined Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois segments and $0.15 to $0.30 per share for our merchant generation segment.
Moving to page 5 we continue to anticipate positive free cash flow of approximately $100 million in 2011. This amount excludes approximately $45 million of potential cash proceeds from the pending sale of our remaining interest in the Columbia Combustion Turbine Facility to the City of Columbia, Missouri. Regarding storm impacts, this year our region has been hit very hard by a series of winter and spring storms affecting the lives of tens of thousands of our customers.
Our employees in Missouri and Illinois have worked tirelessly and effectively to restore power and help meet other community needs. In Illinois, the February storms were the most widespread severe winter weather to hit our service area in years. Snow, ice, sustained high winds and freezing rain caused power outages in 50 counties and created several days of challenging work. More than 1600 Ameren Illinois employees and outside partners were part of the restoration effort. Reflecting the effectiveness of our work the Illinois Commerce Commission commended Ameren Illinois in our efforts in preparing for and responding to these historic winter storms.
In Missouri, while significant efforts and expenditures were incurred to prepare for and deal with the February storms - and a tornado in early January - the most severe weather in that state hit in April. Not only did the torrential rain and gale-force winds from an F4 tornado uproot and damage more than 500 poles and toss electric wires onto streets and yards, they left hundreds of people homeless, destroyed churches and businesses, and shut down our region’s international airport. This was the worst tornado to hit the St. Louis region in nearly 40 years with more than 2500 buildings damaged beyond repair.
These April 22nd storms followed storms that tore into Illinois earlier that week. Ameren Illinois supplied more than 1000 people to safely restore our Illinois customers only to subsequently send hundreds of crews to Missouri. Ameren Missouri assembled and deployed crews of more than 2000. We managed to safely restore power to nearly all of our Missouri customers within 72 hours and to the St. Louis airport in 24 hours.
During extraordinary events like these our employees’ commitment to our customers is clear and I am proud of their performance. I want to recognize and thank all of our Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois coworkers for their dedication over the past few months and the teamwork exhibited as crews traveled back and forth between the two states, assisting one another with service restoration efforts.
Moving to page 6 and regulatory matters, we are currently in the middle of an important electric rate case proceeding before the Missouri Public Service Commission. Last September we filed for an electric rate increase of approximately $263 million. We recently revised our request to approximately $200 million annually, or an approximate 8% increase in overall electric rates to reflect updates in the settlement of various issues. This request is driven by the significant investments we have made in our electric infrastructure to maintain and to improve the reliability of our system and to provide cleaner energy consistent with customers’ expectations.
Included in our request are costs associated with the newly-installed scrubbers on our Sioux power plant, which represents approximately $106 million of our total request. The second key driver of the cost is higher net fuel costs. In a few minutes Marty will provide more detail on our updated request as well as the current positions of other parties to the case. The outcome of this case is very important to our company, our customers, our shareholders, and the state of Missouri.
The bottom line is that we are seeking to recover the costs and investments we are actually incurring to provide service to our customers and to earn a fair return on our investments. In addition, we are seeking consistent, constructive regulatory policies that support necessary investments for safe, reliable and cleaner energy for the betterment of our customers and all stakeholders now and in the future.
While we are discussing Missouri rates I would like to provide an update related to the appeals of certain aspects of our recent Missouri Electric order. In late December 2010 the Coal County Circuit Court in Missouri allowed four industrial customers, appealing the 2010 electric rate increase, to pay the portions of their bills representing increases from previously approved levels, into the court’s registry pending resolution of these appeals. This December court order staid the two most recent electric rate increases for those four customers subject to certain bonds being posted, which they did in February. Over the last two months the Office of Public Counsel and the Missouri industrial energy consumers have sought to rollback our 2010 electric rate increase to 2007 or to 2009 levels for all customers.
These rollback attempts have been made at the Missouri Public Service Commission, the Missouri Western District Appellate Court, and most recently the Coal County Circuit Court. We strongly disagreed with all these motions and they were denied in all instances. In the most recent ruling on this matter the Coal County Circuit Court stated that the December 2010 stay only applied to the four industrial customers - it did not apply to all Ameren Missouri electric customers. As we have previously stated we disagree with the Circuit Court’s original December ruling creating a stay for the four industrial customers. Based on the merits of the case we do not believe it is probable that a loss will result from any of the issues being appealed by the parties, and we will continue to vigorously argue for our positions before the courts.
Turning to Illinois regulatory matters, in that state we have requested a $111 million increase in annual electric and natural gas delivery revenues based on a future test year ending on December 31st, 2012. In Illinois, a Commerce-commissioned decision is expected in mid-January, 2012, with new rates expected to be effective that same month. The use of a future test year is designed to better match our 2012 rate levels to our expected 2012 costs, reducing regulatory lag and providing an improved opportunity to earn a fair return on investment. The ICC recently established a schedule for this case and we have listed several key dates on this page.
On the Illinois legislative front we are proactively engaged in supporting the advancement of House Bill 14, the Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act. This infrastructure legislation is designed to benefit the State of Illinois and its electric and gas utility customers by providing incentives for substantial new investments that would modernize and upgrade electric and natural gas systems and improve service reliability, enable the delivery of more competitive supply sources of natural gas, and create jobs. These goals would be achieved by authorizing formulaic rate-making for qualifying utilities. This would be done by prescriptively establishing a rate of return on equity and allowing for annual resetting of rates, all while still providing appropriate regulatory oversight by the ICC.
Qualifying Ameren Illinois would need to invest in an incremental $950 million of capital over a ten-year period. This would be in addition to a baseline level of capital expenditures determined by Ameren Illinois’ average capital expenditures for calendar years 2008 through 2010. We would also need to commit to creating 750 jobs either internally or externally and to achieving certain performance improvement goals.
Shifting from our regulated utilities to our merchant generation business, we continue to seek and act upon opportunities to market and sell power at premiums to visible market prices to reduce and eliminate operating and planned capital expenditures, and to take other actions such as the sale of our Columbia combustion turbine asset to fund the cash needs of that segment and limit its needs for additional external financing.
Moving now to environmental matters, as I stated in February, 2011 looks to be a pivotal year for federal environmental regulation. In March the US EPA issued proposed rules for retrofitting power plants with maximum achievable control technologies to reduce hazardous air pollutants such as mercury and acid gasses. Also in March the Agency issued proposed cooling water standards. Later this year, the US EPA is scheduled to finalize its propose Clean Air Transport Rule which is aimed at reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Further, the agency is scheduled to issue rules for managing coal combustion byproducts and reducing greenhouse gas emissions later this year.
These rules are expected to impose additional costs on our company and our customers and these additional costs could be substantial. We continue to have a team of experts actively evaluating these proposed and anticipated environmental standards. The team is focused on ensuring that we meet these standards in the most cost effective manner possible, taking into account outlooks for power prices, delivered fuel costs, and alternate compliance approaches to end technologies among other factors. We are still evaluating the rules proposed by the EPA in March and their impact on each of our generating units. As a result, we are not updating our environmental compliance or related capital expenditure plans at this time. In addition to evaluating proposed and anticipated rules, we are actively working with other companies in our industry to develop responses to the EPA’s proposals and meeting with state and federal officials including members of Congress in an effort to protect and promote the interests of our customers and shareholders.
In closing, I want to reaffirm our dedication to positioning our company for long-term success. We are doing so by maintaining a sharp focus on customer satisfaction and by managing our expenditures in a disciplined manner. We remain committed to seeking utility rates and constructive regulatory frameworks that allow us to recover our costs and that provide an opportunity to earn a fair return on our investments. Further, we are committed to aligning our overall spending consistent with regulatory outcomes and the related cash flows provided by those decisions. And in both our regulated and merchant businesses we remain dedicated to operating in a safe, reliable and environmentally-responsible manner. Now I will turn the call over to Marty.

Turning to page 7 of the presentation, today we reported Q1 2011 earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles - or GAAP - of $0.29 per share compared to the Q1 2010 GAAP earnings of $0.43 per share. Excluding certain items in each year, Ameren recorded Q1 2011 core earnings of $0.25 per share, compared with Q1 2010 core earnings of $0.40 per share. Q1 2011 core earnings exclude one item that is included in GAAP earnings. This item is a four-set [ph] per share gain from the impact of unrealized marked to market activity primarily related to non-qualified power and fuel-related hedges.
Moving now to page 8, here we highlight the key drivers of the variants between fore earnings per share for the Q1 of 2011 and for Q1 of 2010. Factors adversely affecting the comparison included a decline in margins at the merchant generation business segment resulting in reduced earnings of $0.07 per share. The reduced margins reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and related transportation costs.
Winter weather was also a key factor behind the decline in earnings. Storm-related expenses reduced Q1 2011 earnings by $0.05 per share, compared to Q1 of 2010, while lower regulated electric and natural gas margins, excluding the impact of rate changes, reduced earnings by $0.40 per share. Half of this $0.40 was due to milder winter temperatures compared to Q1 of 2010. The other $0.02 of this margin-related earnings decline reflects lower Ameren Missouri wholesale electric sales and a change in the mix of Ameren Illinois electric sales mitigated in part by the benefits of the Tomsock [ph] Hydroelectric plant which returned to service in Q2 2010.
Other factors contributing to lower Q1 2011 earnings included reduced equity-related capitalized financing costs, or EFCFC equity, of $0.03 per share compared to Q1 of 2010. The lower EFCFC equity reflected the 2010 completion of the scrubbers at Ameren Missouri’s Sioux Power Plant. We expect the Sioux scrubber project to be reflected in rates beginning early August, 2011, eliminating this temporary drag on earnings.
The final adverse factor of note was a higher effective income tax rate on core earnings. This reduced earnings by $0.02 per share due in part to the higher income tax rate in Illinois effective at the beginning of this year. You will note that the Q1 2011 effective tax rate on core earnings was 38.5%, however, over the course of this year we expect this rate to moderate to within the range of 36.5% to 37%, the expected 2011 range that we shared with you in February.
Key factors favorably affecting the variants between core earnings per share for Q1 2011 and for the Q1 of 2010 included lower interest expense, which boosted earnings by $0.04 per share. This reflects both reduced borrowings as well as greater capitalized interest costs. Finally, 2010 electric rate changes in Missouri and Illinois increased Q1 2011 earnings by $0.03 per share, net of certain related expenses, compared to Q1 2010.
As Tom mentioned we are reaffirming our GAAP and core earnings guidance of $2.20 to $2.60 per share for this year. Further, we are reaffirming our guidance ranges for our combined Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois segments and for our merchant generation segment.
Of course, extraordinary storms and related restoration efforts are very costly. Q1 2011 storm-related operations and maintenance expenses totaled $20 million, which is $18 million more than costs incurred in the prior year’s Q1. In addition, Q1 2011 storm-related capital expenditures were approximately $9 million. At this point, figures are not yet available for the April storms however, unlike the Q1 storms, we expect these April costs to be more heavily weighted towards capital expenditures rather than O&M as the vast majority of our effort was focused on infrastructure removal and replacement. On another note, I would like to remind you that from an O&M timing perspective this year’s Calloway Nuclear Plant refueling and maintenance outage is scheduled for the fall as compared to the spring refueling in 2010.
Before I leave the subject of guidance I would like to discuss a recent Missouri Public Service Commission action and its expected impact on 2011 earnings. On April 27th the Missouri Public Service Commission issued an order in its first prudence review since implementation of Ameren Missouri’s fuel adjustment clause. The review covered the period from March 1st through September 30th, 2009. In this order, the PSC ruled that Ameren Missouri should have included in the fact calculation all revenues and costs associated with certain long-term partial requirement sales that were made by Ameren Missouri due to the loss of load from Narando-Luminum’s [ph] Missouri smelter plant. The loss of load was due to a severe ice storm in January, 2009.
We are very disappointed in and disagree with the PSC’s order’s classification of these sales. We believe that the terms of the fuel adjustment clause tariff do not provide for the inclusion of these sales in the fuel adjustment clause calculation. Therefore, we intend to seek rehearing of the order and if necessary to appeal it through the judicial process. In addition, we are also considering other regulatory approaches to recover this extraordinary loss resulting from the January 2009 ice storm.
However, as a result of the order we will record a Q2 pre-tax charge to earnings of $17 million. These sales were recognized by Ameren Missouri during the period from March 1st, 2009, through September 30th, 2009. Ameren Missouri also recognized an additional $25 million of pre-tax earnings associated with the same long-term partial requirements sales contracts subsequent to September 30th, 2009. The Missouri Public Service Commission has not completed a prudency review of the fact calculation for this subsequent period. If we determine that these sales are probable of inclusion in the fact, a charge to earnings would be recorded in the period in which that determination is made.
As I close our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance I need to remind you that any net unrealized marked to market gains or losses will affect our GAAP earnings but are excluded from our GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses for the full year. Core earnings and guidance exclude any net unrealized marked to market gains or losses as well. Further, our earnings guidance for 2011 is subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in today’s press release including the forward-looking statements section of that release.
Turning now to page 9 and our pending Missouri electric rate case. Here we provide a summary of our request updated with certain true-ups through February 28, 2011, and settlement of certain issues. As Tom mentioned we are now requesting an annual electric rate increase of approximately $200 million based on a 10.7% return on equity, a 52.2% equity ratio, and rate base of approximately $6.7 billion. Approximately $40 million of the request reflects increased net base fuel costs. Other parties have also updated their recommendations in this case. The Missouri Public Service Commission staff now recommends an approximate $86 million annual revenue increase.
The drivers of the difference between our updated request and the staff’s updated recommendation are provided on this page. As you can see, the largest driver is return on equity, accounting for about $108 million of the difference based on the staff’s midpoint return on equity. Also the staff continues to recommend that the fuel adjustment clause is changed to pass through to customers 85% of deviations between actual net fuel costs and the level of net fuel costs included in base rates. Currently, 95% of deviations are passed through.
On page 10, key aspects of the updated positions of several other parties to the case are outlined. The Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers are recommending $58 million of downward adjustment to our requested revenue requirement primarily reflecting a 9.9% midpoint return on equity and the exclusion of approximately $11 million of property taxes related to the Sioux scrubbers and Tomsock [ph]. The Office of Public Counsel has recommended disallowance of the approximately $90 million of Tomsock [ph] Power Plant investment which we have included in our filed rate base. The revenue requirement associated with this proposed disallowance is approximately $10 million annually.
We are asking for recovery of only the portion of Tomsock [ph] costs that are related to enhancements or that would have been incurred in the absence of the upper reservoir breach that occurred several years ago net of insurance proceeds. This request is consistent with our 2007 settlement agreement with the State of Missouri. Finally, the Missouri Energy Group which represents certain other business customers, filed testimony supporting an approximate 9.9% midpoint return on equity.
Hearings for this case are currently underway before the Missouri Public Service Commission and are scheduled to continue through mid-May. A Public Service Commission order is expected in July with new rates expected to be effective in early August. As Tom stated a moment ago, this electric rate case is very important for our company. The results will impact the cash flows we have available to make important investments in our energy infrastructure in the future. We are committed to aligning our operations and maintenance spending and capital investments within our rate regulated businesses with the revenue and related cash flow levels provided by regulatory decisions.
Moving now to our merchant generation business segment on page 11, we provide an update of our forward power sales and hedge data. As you can see we have significant hedges in place which are at power prices above current market levels. We expect our merchant plants to generate approximately 29 million megawatt hours in 2011. These 29 million megawatt hours include 100% of the expected generation of the Edison Electric Energy Inc. plant, a plant in which Ameren owns an 80% interest. For 2011 approximately 27 million megawatt hours of our generation is sold or hedged at an average price of $45 per megawatt hour. For 2012 we have hedged approximately 17.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $48 per megawatt hour. Further, for 2013 we have hedged approximately 9 million megawatt hours at an average price of $42 per megawatt hour. Our capacity sales are approximately 80% hedged for 2011, approximately 52% hedged for 2012, and approximately 26% hedged for 2013.
Turning to page 12, here we update our merchant generation segment’s fuel and related transportation hedges. For 2011 we have hedged approximately 28 million megawatt hours at about $23.50 per megawatt hour; for 2012 we have hedged approximately 20 million megawatt hours at about $24.50 per megawatt hour. That cost is approximately $0.50 per megawatt hour lower than the figure we disclosed in February 2011, and for 2013 we have now hedged approximately 8 million megawatt hours at about $27 per megawatt hour. This cost is also an improvement by approximately $1.50 per megawatt hour compared to our February disclosure.
These 2013 coal hedges continue to include a large proportion of our expected burn of Illinois Basin coal and a much smaller proportion of our expected burn of Powder River Basin coal. To provide perspective, our typical burn is 3% Illinois and 97% Powder River Basin coal. This hedging information completes our prepared remarks. We will now be happy to take questions.

Let me make sure I try to hit them all though. I think the first one was about the EFCFC equity. Last year when we were constructing the Sioux scrubber we were certainly capitalizing all of the financing costs associated with that as part of the EFCFC - those are both interest costs as well as equity financing costs. Once the scrubbers went into service, in accordance with a regulatory agreement we were able to defer them for regulatory purposes: the depreciation associated with that scrubber after it went into service as well as all financing costs, both the interest financing costs and the equity related financing costs. And once we get to the point of our new rates going into effect in Missouri we would expect that all of those costs would then be getting recovered.
For accounting purposes, for financial reporting purposes, we are able to defer the appreciation recognition and the interest financing costs associated with that scrubber. However, we are not able to continue to recognize EFCFC equity, so that was a plus last year; this year when you compare year-over-year results we don’t have those same EFCFC equity earnings. However, for regulatory purposes those are being deferred and we certainly will get those returns once the new rates go into effect.
And we did, if you look back at our guidance we gave in February my recollection is we expected a $0.07 to $0.08 negative impact year-over-year related to that EFCFC equity issue. But I think that was your first question.
The second question I think related to storm costs. We mentioned in our prepared remarks that we did have this year in Q1 about $20 million of incremental operations and maintenance expenses associated with storm restoration costs. That equates to about $0.05 per share and they have been included in the ongoing earnings - we have not stripped those out. So that was I think your second question.
And then I believe your third question had to do with the Naranda [ph] related issue, and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks we expect that based on the Public Service Commission’s order in our fuel adjustment clause proceeding that in Q2 we would take a charge of about $17 million, and so that is also reflected in the ongoing earnings and is also reflected in the guidance we gave today.

This is Marty again. When we look at the sales for the quarter as we talked about in our talking points, a couple things that I’d say impacted overall the native load margins: some of that was reduced residential and commercial sales which was in part due to the weather. However, when we strip out weather we do still see in the Q1 year-over-year some slight reduction in the residential and commercial sales. We talked at the beginning of the year about our expectation of moderate sales growth and what we’re looking for over the course of the year today is probably in the range across the company of around 1% growth in residential and commercial sales, probably a little less on the residential side and a little more on the commercial side, and that’ll vary a little bit from state to state as well. But that is what we’re looking for over the course of the year.
In terms of industrial sales, if you’re getting to economic recovery, we did see again year-over-year pretty good sales growth in industrial even excluding the impact of Naranda [ph]. Overall we saw, as we talked about in our talking points, a 7% year-over-year improvement in industrial sales. Over the course of the year we don’t necessarily expect industrial sales to be that robust but we do expect that we may be able to still see mid-single digit improvement year-over-year in industrial sales. And again I’d say this year, seeming to be led by Illinois where we saw more outsized growth, Missouri excluding Naranda [ph] is frankly still down a little bit year-over-year in the industrial sector.

So we added some coal hedges to get the percentages up in line with our power hedges, and as we did that we were able to bring the blended average of our hedges down.
And we tried to communicate that back in February that that was our expectation, that based on current prices and broker quotes that we believed that we would, as we put additional hedges in place we’d be able to bring the average cost down.

That CT that we talked about, just for clarity because I know you just transitioned and I know you realized this, that we transitioned a little bit from a Missouri discussion over to a merchant discussion in GenCo. There is a GenCo asset that’s being sold and that’s $45 million of potential additional cash for GenCo to finance its operations.
But Julien, we’re at a point where I’d say we’re giving out any guidance with respect to ‘12 or ‘13. I’d go back to my prior comments that we are looking at every opportunity to improve margins associated with that business and reduce operating and capital costs to avoid the need for additional financing, and we’ll look at opportunities like the sale we talked about here - $45 million sale of the CT - to plug any cash flow needs that that business segment may need. So those are our objectives and that’s what we’re working to achieve.

I think that when you have a rate increase sometimes there are things that are annualized, like increases in depreciation or amortizations, however that would also include, Julien, things like changes in the timing of when fuel costs, for example, are recognized under fuel adjustment clause in Missouri. To the extent that the timing of the inclusion of a base fuel cost changes from period to period, that would affect the margins that we have for that segment.
So I go back a little bit to what we mentioned in the comments about we did see some lower margins. We said part of that had to do with some of our weather-sensitive loads, also some of it had to do with these long-term requirement sales which again were included in the overall net based fuel cost calculation in the last rate case. So again, incorporating those and incorporating a different timing pattern of fuel costs you’ll get to a little bit different margin month by month. So I’m not sure you can get to a real run rate on the net other items.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced second quarter 2011 core earnings of $0.59 per share, compared to second quarter 2010 core earnings of $0.73 per share. These results were on track with our expectations.The de",2549,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced second quarter 2011 core earnings of $0.59 per share, compared to second quarter 2010 core earnings of $0.73 per share. These results were on track with our expectations.
The decline in second quarter 2011 earnings, compared to second quarter 2010 earnings reflected a 4% decrease in kilowatt hour sales to regulated utility native load customers. The lower sales were due in part to milder temperatures through June.
Second quarter 2011 earnings also included a charge to earnings resulting from an April 2011 Missouri Public Service Commission order associated with our fuel adjustment clause or FAC.
You will remember from our first quarter call that a PSC order required the net margins associated with certain long-term, partial requirement sales included in the FAC calculation and, therefore, be credited to customers.
Other factors reducing second quarter 2011 earnings included increased storm-related expenses, higher property taxes as well as our higher effective income tax rate. Factors that favorably contributed second quarter 2011 earnings compared to second quarter 2010, included rate increases, the absence of a nuclear refueling and maintenance outage at our Callaway energy center and lower interest expense.
Turning to page four. We were challenged by an unusually large number of storms in the first half of this year but in every instance, in Illinois and in Missouri our employees responded aggressively and effectively to quickly and safely restore service and meet our customer’s expectations. Our management team also took action during the quarter to align client spending with business conditions.
Further while we estimate that about half of the second quarter 2011 decline in electric sales to native load customers compared to the second quarter of 2010 was due to milder weather, economic conditions and customer’s conservation efforts have also impacted sales.
As a result of our first half sales trends we have lowered our weather normalized sales growth expectations for the remainder of the year. To offset these reduced sales expectations we have reduced our spending plans.
In addition we are taking actions to better align our overall spending with rate orders and related regulatory policies. As a result today we’re able to essentially reaffirm our 2011 core earnings guidance with a narrow range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share. This narrowed guidance incorporates the impacts of our recently concluded Missouri rate case.
And I would note that this guide also assumes normal weather conditions for the second half of 2011. So far we are on track for a very hot summer. We also remain on track to generate positive free cash flow this year. Marty will provide more details on our earnings and cash flow guidance in a moment.
Moving to page five. I would like to provide an update on our compliance plans recently proposed and recently finalized environmental regulations. We have completed our initial review of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or Casper, which was issued in July of 2011 and have updated our strategy and capital expenditure estimates for meeting the requirements of this rule, the Illinois multi-pollutant standard and the proposed hazardous air pollutant maximum achievement control technology or HAPs-MACT.
Casper requires significant reductions in sulfur dioxide or SO2 and nitrogen oxide or NOx emissions beginning in 2012 with additional reductions required in 2014. Casper standards for reduced SO2 emissions were generally in line with the rules we expected the EPA to adopt. With the standards for reduced NOx emissions were more stringent than we had expected.
For many years, we have proactively worked to reduce our emissions of both SO2 and NOx in innovative and cost effective ways to improve air quality and keep generation costs low. These steps have included making modifications to our energy centers several years ago to burn low sulfur coal. NOx emissions have been lowered through the use of low NOx burners, stage combustion over-fire air systems, combustion control technology, selective catalytic reduction and rich reagent selective non-catalytic reduction systems.
Recently, we’ve installed a total of five scrubbers with three at our merchant generation energy centers in Illinois and two at our regulated energy centers in Missouri. Just last year, we put into service wet scrubbers at our Missouri Sue energy center at a total cost of approximately $600 million. These proactive steps have significantly reduced our SO2 and NOx emissions over time and offered us greater flexibility as we analyze and explore options for compliance with these new rules.
For our Missouri operations, compliance with these more stringent SO2 emission reduction levels might have required costly new equipment by 2014 or forced us to significantly reduce generation levels at our energy centers absent these proactive steps. However, today I’m very pleased to announce that at our Missouri regulated operations we’re moving ahead with the third option to meet the stringent environmental standards for SO2 emissions, the purchase of ultra-low sulfur coal.
We recently entered into a coal purchase contract for approximately 90 million tons of ultra-low sulfur coal to be delivered between 2012 and 2017 at fair market prices. Not only is the purchase of this coal consistent with our expected coal supply needs to serve our Missouri customers. But most importantly, this strategy will entirely eliminate the need for dry sorbent injection or fabric filters and will allow us to delay the installation of additional scrubbers in our Missouri fleet until after 2017.
We have also entered into additional rail transportation contracts at market rates to deliver coal supplied under the new coal purchase contract through 2017. This compliance strategy is a win for our customers, our shareholders, and the State of Missouri.
As a result of this strategy, we will be able to avoid estimated rate increases for our customers of approximately 15% to 20% by 2017 that might otherwise have been required to meet the SO2 emission standards of this rule. We believe that this strategy will benefit the State of Missouri by keeping Ameren Missouri’s electric rates among the most competitive in the nation helping the State better retain and attract new businesses.
As a result of this strategy, we’re able to reduce our planned Missouri capital expenditures for the period 2011 to 2015 by approximately $500 million compared to our first quarter 2011 10-Q disclosures. This reduction primarily reflects the removal of scrubbers for two of our generating units from our five year capital expenditure estimates.
This strategy also meaningfully reduces potential increases in operations and maintenance expenses related to meeting the SO2 emissions standards of this rule. Overall, this strategy provides us greater flexibility to manage our spending as we seek to combat regulatory lag and earn a fair return on our investments in Missouri.
Moving to our merchant generation business in Illinois. Our SO2 compliance strategy continues to include the already operating scrubbers at our Duck Creek and Coffeen energy centers as well as two scrubbers at our Newton energy center.
However, we no longer plan to installed dry sorbent injection, our DSI at our Joppa energy center. Instead we will use DSI at our Edwards energy center in conjunction with the addition of a new baghouse to achieve overall system compliance. Like the two scrubbers at Newton, this baghouse has been included in our previously disclosed compliance and spending plans.
As I mentioned a moment ago the new CSAPR standards for NOX emission reductions are more stringent than we or the industry at large had expected and the required reductions must be achieved beginning in just five months on January 1, 2012.
Both in our Missouri regulated operations and in our merchant generation business, we are evaluating all options for compliance, so at this time we do not expect that the ultimate plans will materially increase our capital expenditure requirements over the next five years. We will update you when we firm up our compliance plans for the NOX component of the CSAPR rule.
As a result of our continued optimization of environmental compliance plans and reductions of discretionary non-environmental spending our merchant generation team has reduced our merchant generation 2011 to 2015 planned capital expenditures by approximately $200 million from the level we provided you in our first quarter of 2011 10-Q disclosures.
We are happy to have greater clarity on some of our environmental compliance plans and we are pleased to report anticipated savings versus previous cost estimates, but it is critical that policy makers carefully consider the cumulative economic cost of complying with these environmental rules in relation to their benefits.
We will continue to proactively work to help shape pending rules, so we can realize progress on the environmental front yet minimize to the greatest extent possible the impact of these rules on our operations and on our customers.
Moving now to page six. I would like to discuss recent and pending developments across our regulatory jurisdictions. In Missouri, the Public Service Commission recently issued a decision on our electric rate case, authorizing a $173 million rate increase.
In general, we consider the rate order to be fair and reasonable in most respects. Importantly, it included in rates our full investment in the Sioux scrubbers and related operating costs and property taxes.
Further the decision maintained our existing fuel adjustment clause as well as the vegetation management, infrastructure inspection, pension, and OPEB cost trackers, all of which are important cost recovery mechanisms.
The allowed return on equity of 10.2% was a bit better than the level we received in our prior order and is close to the national average. However, it is still below the level we consider appropriate, in part because of the regulatory lag we experience in Missouri.
In addition while the commission continued to permit full recovery of our energy efficiency investments, we would have liked them to make more progress on the regulatory treatment of such investments to better align our companies and our customer’s interests in energy efficiency.
Finally, we are clearly disappointed in the Missouri Commissions disallowance of $89 million of cost related to the rebuilding of the Taum Sauk energy center. The opportunity to seek recovery of these costs was consistent with our settlement with the State of Missouri, which allowed for costs for enhancements or costs we would have occurred absent the reservoir breach.
We believe this disallowance was not supported by the record in the case and we have appealed the matter to the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District. Our filing at the Court of Appeals is consistent with newly enacted Missouri legislation that eliminates the ability of any party to stay a commission order while the appeal is pending.
As we have stated we will take appropriate actions to align our overall spending both operating and capital with this electric rate order in its policies it reflects. With better alignment of our spending to both this order and our sales growth expectations, we expect to make significant progress toward closing the gap between our earned and allowed returns on equity at Missouri - Ameren Missouri in 2012 from the 2011 levels.
Before I finish my discussion on Missouri, I want you to be aware we filed the request in late July with the Missouri Public Service Commission for an accounting order. If approved, this accounting order would allow us to defer for potential future recovery $36 million of fixed costs, not recovered as a result of the loss of random aluminum load due to a severe ice storm that occurred in January of 2009. At this time, there is no timetable set for the Commission to consider this matter.
Turning now to Illinois regulatory matters, we filed our rebuttal testimony in our pending electric and natural gas slurry rate cases on July 26th. We are now requesting a $90 million annual increase in these delivery rates. Recall that our filing is based on a 2012 test year to provide an improved opportunity to earn a fair return on investment. Marty will provide more on the status of these cases.
On the Illinois legislative front, we continue to be proactively engaged in supporting Senate Bill 1652, The Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, in late May the Bill passed both chambers of the Illinois General Assembly with strong majority.
The bill is expected to be forward to Governor Quinn shortly, and he will then have 60 days to act on it. If the governor vetoes the bill we will continue to work for an override in the legislature’s fall veto session. This legislation would benefit the State of Illinois and its electric customers by providing a more predictable rate making system.
The additional investments required by the legislation would modernize and upgrade electric systems and improve service reliability. These investments would also create additional employment opportunities within and outside of Ameren Illinois.
The more predictable rate making system incorporates formulaic ratemaking for qualifying utilities, including a rate of return on equity of 600 basis points above an average of 30 year treasury bond yields. It allows for annual adjustment of rates while still providing appropriate regulatory oversight by the Illinois Commerce Commission to insure that the investments made in the costs incurred are prudent.
Finally, moving to the federal jurisdiction, in May the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved requested rate treatments for more than $1 billion of our planned transmission projects. We anticipate that the Board of Directors of the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator will prove several of our projects in its December meeting and we are set to move ahead with engineering and construction upon approval.
While we expect the FERC’s recent order Number 1000 to have various impacts on transmission planning and cost allocation going forward, we do not expect that the order will delay or impede our plans to construct the projects that are now before MISO.
Another matter before the FERC is MISO’s July filing of a plan to replace the current monthly construct for the capacity power market with an annual construct. This plan is in response to FERC’s June 2010 order directing MISO to develop a plan that incorporates vocational capacity market mechanisms into its resource adequacy plan. We were studying MISO’s filing and will file comments at FERC this September.
That said, we continue to support a multi-year procurement construct, one that is efficient and effective, sending appropriate price signals for the development of new generation and the removal of barriers between markets. While MISO’s filing is a step forward, we believe it falls short of these objectives and we will continue to work with MISO on further developing the market.
Before I turn the call over to Marty, I want to reaffirm our dedication to maintaining a sharp focus on customer satisfaction and on managing our expenditures in a disciplined manner.
We remain committed to seeking constructive regulatory frameworks and outcomes that allow us to recover our costs in a timely fashion and that provide a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on our investments.
These regulatory frameworks provide us with the necessary cash flows to invest in our energy infrastructure to meet our customer’s expectations and create jobs in both Missouri and Illinois and at both our regulated and merchant generation businesses, we remain dedicated to operating in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Marty.

373264,138425643,152517,"Ameren Corporation, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2011",2011-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Turning to page seven of the presentation, today we reported second quarter 2011 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $0.57 per share, compared to second quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $0.64 per share",2036,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to page seven of the presentation, today we reported second quarter 2011 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP of $0.57 per share, compared to second quarter 2010 GAAP earnings of $0.64 per share.
Second quarter 2011 core earnings were $0.59 per share compared with second quarter 2010 core earnings of $0.73 per share. Core results excluded net unrealized mark-to-market losses from the second quarters of 2011 and 2010 of $0.02 and $0.09 per share respectively. These mark-to-market impacts are primarily related to non-qualified power and fuel related hedges.
Moving now to page eight, we highlight key drivers of the variance between core earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 and for the second quarter of 2010. Factors adversely affecting the comparison included the decline in margins at our regulated utilities of $0.14 per share after excluding rate changes and net of certain related expenses compared to the second quarter of 2010.
Five of these $0.14 were due to milder temperatures compared to the second quarter of 2010. Another $0.05 were due to the previously discussed charge for the Missouri Public Service Commission, fuel adjustment clause related order and while mentioning this charge I do want to let you know that we have appealed this PSC order to the courts.
Regarding weather cooling degree days were 13% fewer in the second quarter of 2011 than in the very hot second quarter of 2010. Expenses for the numerous 2011 storms that Tom mentioned earlier reduced earnings by $0.04 per share. Tax related items reduced second quarter 2011 earnings by $0.04 per share.
Half of this variance reflected higher property taxes and the other half was due to a higher effective income tax rate. The second quarter 2011 earnings comparison was also negatively impacted by reduced equity related capitalized financing costs of $0.02 per share.
The lower AFUDC equity primarily reflected the 2010 completion of the scrubbers at Ameren Missouri’s few Energy Center. Lower margins for our merchant generation business segment reduced earnings by $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2011. This was primarily the result of lower generation levels and higher fuel and transportation related costs.
Key factors favorably affecting the core earnings variance between the quarters included lower plant operations and maintenance expenses. This had $0.08 per share impact. This lower plant O&M reflects the absence of the Callaway Nuclear refueling outage in the second quarter of 2011, last year’s refueling outage reduced second quarter 2010 earnings by $0.11 per share. Callaway’s typically refueled every 18 months with the 2011 refueling scheduled for this fall. Planned outages at some of our fossil plants lead to operations and maintenance expenses which mitigated the Callaway reduction.
Rate changes, net of certain related expenses, increased second quarter 2011 earnings by $0.04 per share. These rate changes included electric rate increases in Illinois and Missouri, both effective in 2010 and a gas delivery rate increase in Missouri effective in early 2011.
A final key factor favorably impacting the comparison of second quarter 2011 earnings to those of the second quarter of 2010 was lower interest expense of $0.03 per share. This reflected reduced levels of both long-term and short-term debt.
As Tom mentioned, we have essentially reaffirmed our 2011 core earnings guidance within a narrow range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share. This reflects a narrowing of core guidance for our combined Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois segments to $2.10 to $2.25 per share from our previous range of $2.05 to $2.30. The core guidance range for our merchant generation segment has also been narrowed to $0.20 to $0.30 per share from our prior range of $0.15-$0.30. The $0.05 per share increase from the lower end of the range reflects better than expected year-to-date margins and lower costs.
Before I leave the subject of guidance, I would like to note the earnings impact of the July Missouri PSC rate order disallowance of $89 million of our Tom Sauk investment. As a result of this disallowance we will take a third quarter 2011 charge estimated at $0.23 per share. This charge is excluded from our 2011 core earnings guidance but will of course be included in our GAAP results.
As I close our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance, I need to remind you that our guidance assumes normal weather for the second half of the year. Further any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will affect our GAAP earnings but are excluded from our GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses for the full year.
Core earnings and guidance exclude any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses. Further, our earnings guidance for 2011 is subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined first or referred to in today’s press release including the forward-looking statement section of that release.
Turning now to page nine, and our recently decided Missouri Electric rate case. Here we provide some of the details of the Missouri Public Service Commission’s July order. As Tom mentioned, we were authorized to increase electric rates effective July 31st by a total of $173 million with 121 million of this being for non-fuel related revenues. This compares to our revised total rate increase request of 211 million with 159 million being for non-fuel related expenses or excuse me, non-fuel related revenues.
The decision was based on a 10.2% return on equity which comprised 52.2% of capitalization. Further, the order reflected an electric rate base of $6.6 billion. The decision continued our fuel adjustment clause and its current 95% pass through to customers of deviations between actual net fuel costs and the level of net fuel costs included in base rates. Other key aspects of this order are provided on this page.
Before we leave our discussion of the Missouri rate order I would note with new rates now effective we have stopped deferring depreciation and interest financing costs associated with the approximate $600 million Sioux scrubber investment. Sioux scrubber depreciation will be approximately $21 million annually.
Turning now to page 10 and our pending delivery rate cases in Illinois. As previously mentioned, we filed our rebuttal testimony on July 26, 2011. Our combined electric and gas rate increase request has been lowered to $90 million annually from our initial request of $111 million, primarily reflecting lower requested returns on equity and a correction related to insurance expense.
We are now requesting returns on equity of 11% for electric delivery and 10.75% for natural gas delivery. Each of these numbers is a 25 basis point reduction from our initial request, reflecting an updated assessment of capital market conditions.
On June 29th, before we filed a rebuttal testimony, the Illinois Commerce Commission staff and other interveners filed their direct testimony in the rate cases. While these parties positions will be updated in the rebuttal testimony, which is due August 23rd, this page outlines their initial position in the cases.
The ICC staff recommended a combined revenue increase of $6 million based on electric rate decrease and a natural gas rate increase. Of the $84 million difference between their position and our rebuttal position, return on equity is by far the most material at $39 million. The second largest difference relates to the staffs view of savings and costs related to the recent merger of our three Illinois utilities. This represents a $19 million variance.
As you can see on page 10 we’ve also noted a few of the other differences between the staff and our positions. Moving into Page 11, we outline key points of the Attorney Generals and Citizen Utility Board’s initial positions as well as those of the Illinois industrial energy consumers. The Administrative Law Judges are scheduled to issue their proposed order on November 15th of this year with an Illinois Commerce Commission’s decision expected in mid-January 2012.
Turning now to Page 12. I would like to provide updated 2011 projected cash flow information. We now expect to achieve free cash flow of approximately $225 million up from our prior guidance of approximately 100 million. The largest single reason for the improved cash flow outlook is the $45 million of cash flow proceeds we received from the sale in June of a remaining interest in the Columbia Energy Center. This amount is netted in the capital expenditure line.
Recall from our 2011 cash from operations includes an incremental contribution to Ameren Illinois’ postretirement benefit plan of $100 million which we plan to make this month.
On this page we also have a breakdown of our consolidated capitalization which is now solid 52% equity. Further, we provide a breakdown of our debt balances by reporting segment as of June 30, 2011.
On page 13, we update Ameren’s five-year capital expenditure outlook to incorporate the previously discussed improvements in our capital spending plans. We now project that the four year 2012 through 2015 cumulative capital spending will range between 5.2 billion and 6 billion with an annual target range between 1.3 billion and 1.5 billion.
This brings down the midpoint of our capital spending range for the 2012 to 2015 period by about $400 million versus our first quarter 2011 10-Q disclosures.
On this page, we also provide a percentage breakdown of our five-year infrastructure investment plan for our regulated businesses by jurisdiction and type. As a percentage of planned investment, you’ll note that FERC regulated transmission has grown. This is in part due to reduced spending expectations and other categories coupled however with accelerated transmission spending.
We now expect to invest approximately 1.15 billion over the five-year period to harden and replace existing aging transmission infrastructure as well as to expand the transmission system.
Moving now to page 14, we outline our expected capital expenditures for our merchant generation business for each of the next five years showing the breakdown between expenditures for maintenance and for environmental compliance.
These merchant generation numbers are included in the total Ameren-wide capital expenditures that I discussed a few minutes ago. Of course, we will continue to review and adjust our merchant generation spending plans in light of evolving outlooks for power prices, delivered fuel costs, environmental standards and compliance technologies among other factors.
Moving now to page 15, we provide an update of our forward power sales and hedge data. As you can see we have significant hedges in place which are at power prices above current market levels.
We now expect our merchant generation business to generate approximately 29.5 million megawatt-hours in 2011. These 29.5 million megawatt-hours include 100% of the expected generation of the Electric Energy Inc. or Joppa Energy Center, a facility in which Ameren owns an 80% interest.
For 2011 approximately 27.5 million megawatt-hours of this generation are sold or hedged at an average price of $45 per megawatt-hour. For 2012, we have hedged approximately 19.5 million megawatt-hours at price of $47 per megawatt-hour.
Further for 2013, we’ve hedged approximately 10 million megawatt-hours at an average price of $41 per megawatt-hour. Our capacity sales are approximately 80% hedged for 2011, approximately 54% hedged for 2012, and approximately 26% hedged for 2013.
You will note that while capacity hedge percentages stayed flat or rose slightly, expected revenues dropped a bit in each year. This is due to the sale of the Columbia Energy Center which had provided capacity revenues offset in part by increased capacity revenues associated with our Elgin Energy Center which is located in the PJM West power market.
Turning now to page 16, we update our Merchant Generation segments fuel and related transportation hedges.
For 2011 we’ve hedged approximately 29 million-megawatt hours at about $23 per megawatt hour. This cost is approximately $0.50 per megawatt hour lower than the figure we disclosed in May of 2011. For 2012 we’ve hedged approximately 18 million-megawatt hours at about 2350 per megawatt hour which is approximately $1 per megawatt hour lower than our May disclosure and for 2013, we have now hedged approximately 7 million-megawatt hours at about $26.50 per megawatt hour which is approximately $0.50 per megawatt hour lower than the previous disclosures.
This hedging information completes our prepared remarks. We will now be happy to take your questions.

But secondly, the thing that gave us quite a bit of flexibility was the proactive installation of our Sioux scrubbers which we just installed late last year. That gave us the option to take a look at this ultra-low sulfur coal strategy and consequently in looking at that and looking at our system we’re able to purchase this coal through 2017 and execute not only our coal purchase which is necessary for our customers’ needs but frankly is going to avoid significant capital expenditures for things like fabric filters, as well as DSI and brought significant savings for our customers. So I wouldn’t say it’s a meaningful change. It’s something we’ve been doing for some time to try and anticipate where these regulations were going to come and we were able to execute the strategy successfully.

Thanks for the question. I recall you asking a question about this last quarter. As we’ve gone through the year, what we certainly have seen is that while weather has played a role as we talked about, we did have much milder temperatures this year than last. They’ve been warmer than normal this year, but certainly lower than last. We had a very hot June last year.
And we estimate weather and strip that out. For the six months year-to-date, we are still seeing declining sales trends as it relates to our residential and commercial categories. And so, we have revised our expectations for the year. I think Erica, you’ll recall that we had talked about some very modest growth plus or minus 1% expectations in residential commercial when we talked last quarter, but as we’ve gone through the six months and looked at the data, we felt it more prudent to lower our forecast and what we’ve now got built in is sales declines of around 1% on residential with the expectation of really no growth in commercial this year.
We’re still seeing overall for the company positive trends in industrial primarily on the Illinois side of our business and we’re still expecting to see low to mid single-digit kind of growth in industrial, but we felt it prudent to lower those sales forecast expectations and again, as we talked about, align our spending plans to make sure we’re able to deliver on the earnings guidance that we’ve provided so we have built those in.
Looking back at last year, it’s interesting. Last year, we had pretty solid growth in 2010 over 2009 levels, residential came in about 1.2% up, commercial about 2.6% up, so what we’re seeing here in the six months, we feel like we need to adjust to and we’ll continue to assess it.

I think that implies an ROE range in the neighborhood of 8.3% to 8.9% and so if you take the midpoint of that for example, obviously you’re right around 8%, 8.6%.
As you look ahead we’ve just completed the Missouri rate case so we’re only getting a partial benefit of that rate case this year and as you point out, we’ve got a rate case pending in Illinois that would adjust rates in January of 2012 and of course that’s based on a forecasted test year.
And also our commitment to continue to align our spending to the overall business conditions we face. We are focused on improving our earned returns and on the call we talked about for instance in Missouri expecting to significantly narrow that gap between our earned returns this year and our allowed returns, so that’s what we’re focused on and just as a metric, I mean if we improve the earned returns from say that mid-point I gave you around 8.6% by 100 basis points to 9.6%, that adds about $0.20 to $0.25 of earnings year-over-year to the guidance that range that I gave you.

There was, Paul, one period subsequent to that - period subsequent of that were similarly we held certain revenues outside the fact there’s about another $25 million exposure there, the Commission has not ruled on that at this time.
However, beyond that there isn’t any exposure because after the last rate case we had, all of those types of revenues from those types of sales were through the rate making process, actually included in our base - net base fuel cost that go into the fuel adjustment clause.

I would also note that the other differentiation is that in the merchant side of our fleet we’re also complying with the multi-pollutant standard, so you’ve got the over layoff those rules on top of CSAPR that impacts your overall compliance decisions.
And lastly when you look at the sales profile in Missouri, we certainly have steady regulated load growth to meet over time and in the merchant business, we do seek to line the hedging between our power sales and our fuel hedges over time, so those are some of the differentiating things that we think about.

As we sit here today, I would say that those broker quote prices still look to be a little bit below the pricing that we have in the embedded contracts, a little more than below as it relates to 2013 frankly where the embedded costs are a bit higher because of the mix of some of the coal purchases that we actually have in the embedded hedges, so what you see on that fuel slide is as we’ve added megawatt hours hedged in terms of our coal, its brought the blended average price down.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced strong third quarter 2011 core earnings of $1.57 per share, compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.40 per share.

Today we announced strong third quarter 2011 core earnings of $1.57 per share, compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.40 per share. The increase in three quarter 2011 core earnings compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings reflected Illinois and Missouri electric rate increases and lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses as a result of continued cost discipline. Improvement in earnings was also due to lower interest expense driven by debt reduction and also weather that was slightly warmer than that of the year ago quarter. These positive factors were partially offset by reduced margins in the merchant generation segment due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation related expenses.
While temperate in the third quarter of 2011 were not significantly different than those experienced in the third quarter of 2010, they were much warmer than normal. Before I move on to discussion of earnings guidance, I would like to comment on our operating performance during the third quarter of 2011. I’m proud to report that our energy centers performed exceptionally well during the summer months.
Equivalent availability at our base load energy centers was a strong 94% and the net capacity factor was a strong 84% in the third quarter of 2011. This performance included our Callaway nuclear energy center which operated continuously from its last refueling which ended in June of 2010 until the beginning of its current refueling in mid October 2011, a period of 489 days. This was the facility’s second longest breaker-to-breaker run since it began operating in 1984.
Turning to page 4, reflecting our strong third quarter earnings, today we’re raising our 2011 core earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share up from our prior range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share.
Martin will provide further details regarding our third quarter 2011 earnings and 2011 guidance later in this call.
Moving to page five, we now expect 2011 positive free cash flow to reach approximately $325 million, an increase of $100 billion from the estimate we provided on our second quarter conference call. We have been using our free cash flow to reduce outstanding borrowings. This has included not only the June 2011 maturity of $150 million of Ameren Illinois Company long-term debt but also a significant amount of short-term debt. In fact at September 30, 2011, cash and equivalents exceeded short-term debt and we expect this also be the case at year end. These reductions in debt contributed to a common equity ratio that stood at a solid 53.9% of total capitalization at the end of the third quarter.
Reflecting the steps we have taken over the last few years to strengthen our financial performance and position, on October 14, 2011, Ameren’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend payment to common shareholders of $0.40 per share, a 3.9% increase over the prior quarterly dividend rate. This new annualized equivalent rate of $1.60 per share is at level that is well covered by earnings and cash flows from our regulated business segments. This new annualized rate represents a 7% payout of 2011 core earnings from our regulated business segments based on the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to page six. In addition to the positive news I’ve shared with you regarding earnings, cash flows and dividends, I’m also able to report significant progress on important strategic initiatives. This progress is the result of our focused and sustained efforts to improve the performance of our company for the mutual benefit of our investors and customers.
On several occasions, I have stated that we’re committed to seeking and obtaining constructive regulatory frameworks that allow us to recover our costs in a timely fashion and then provide a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on our investments. As important constructive regulatory frameworks provide us with a - as important constructive regulatory frameworks provide us with the necessary cash flows to invest in our energy infrastructure so we can meet our customer’s expectation and create good paying jobs in our communities.
I’m very pleased that just last week, the Illinois General Assembly approved a new constructive regulatory framework that provides electric delivery utilities in that state with the opportunity to choose performance-based formula rate making. The legislature enacted into law Senate Bill 1652, the Energy Infrastructure Monetization Act and approved a trailer bill that will amend Senate Bill 1652. Governor Quinn has 60 days to act on the trailer bill. If he does nothing by the end of the 60-day period, the trailer bill becomes law. If he vetoes the trailer bill we sent back to the house and senate for further consideration.
This legislation is a win for the economy of the State of Illinois, a win for our Illinois Electric delivery customers and a win for our Ameren Illinois Utility.
Utilities will have the opportunity to benefit from more predictable rate making that will allow them to invest in their businesses, receive timely cash flows from these investments and have greater confidence that they will be able to earn close to their allowed return on such investments.
This law is designed to create nearly 2,500 additional good paying jobs throughout the state. And further, the additional investments required of participating utilities should provide customers with improved service quality and reliability as well as long-term savings. The legislation includes a number of customer protections and other benefits many of which are listed on this page. These protections include regulatory oversight by the Illinois Commerce Commission to ensure that the investments made and costs incurred are prudent.
Page seven provides highlights of the new regulatory framework. Ameren Illinois plans to withdraw its pending electric delivery rate case and is developing plans for filing for performance-based formula electric delivery rates under Senate Bill 1652.
However, our pending gas delivery rate case will continue to move forward and Senate Bill 1652 does not apply to the gas utility business
Moving to page eight of, of course, our commitment to earnings fair returns on our investments also extends to Missouri. Ameren Missouri expects to make significant progress towards closing the gap between its earned and allowed return on equity in 2012.
On October 21, we announced a voluntary retirement offer as part of Ameren Missouri’s efforts to tighten its belt during this challenging economic period. This action should lower overall costs to our customers as well as allowing spending with regulatory outcomes in economic conditions and improve earned returns at our Missouri utility. The voluntary retirement offer has been made to approximately 715 management and union employees of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Services. Ameren Services provides support services to Ameren and all of its subsidiaries.
Those accepting the offer are expected to retire by year-end 2011. While we do not know how many employees will accept this offer, a similar offer in 2009 had an acceptance rate of approximately 30%. In connection with this program, there’s one thing I want to be clear about. We will not reduce our workforce to allow all that will impact our employee’s ability to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers.
Looking ahead, Missouri will continue to explore options to reduce regulatory lag, to enhance our cash flows and earn returns and thereby facilitate more timely investments in our energy infrastructure. Facilitating such investments will improve reliability and create jobs to the benefit of all our stakeholders in the entire state of Missouri.
In addition to these developments that are regulated utilities, our merchant generation business recently took steps that are expected to further reduce operating costs and capital spending plans. These steps are part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that this business is well-positioned to weather the current period of low power prices and benefit from the expected improvement in such prices.
In early October, our merchant generation business announced that it will cease operating in the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers in Illinois by the end of 2011. These two smaller, older energy centers provided approximately 4% of our merchant generation segments total generation over the last two years. The closures are primarily the result of complying with a Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in July of 2011. CSAPR tightens sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission levels - emission limits to point their continued operations of these facilities is not economic.
Closure of Meredosia and Hutsonville will reduce our merchant generation fleet emission levels. However, we will retain the emission credits for SO2 and NOx associated with these plans through 2015. As a result, we no longer plan to use dry sorbent injection at our Edwards plant to comply with the SO2 limitations of the Illinois multi-polluting standard and CSAPR. Moving to dry sorbent injection from our complying strategy, Edwards eliminated one of the reasons for planned bag houses at that energy center.
The other reason for bag houses was of course for a particular control and anticipation of the half macros. However, as a result of further testing, we now expect that upgrading the existing electrostatic precipitators at Edwards will allow us to achieve the anticipated particular compliance requirements without the need for bag houses at a reduced net capital cost. As a result, we’ve further reduced our expected 2011 through 2015 merchant generation segment capital expenditures by approximately $70 million. These reductions are in addition to the approximately $200 million of lower planned merchant generation capital expenditures for the 2011 to 2015 period, which we announced on the second quarter conference call.
In summary, we believe that the following recent developments approval of a new constructive, regulatory framework for Illinois electric delivery businesses, receipt of new electric rates in Missouri this past July, disciplined cost reductions at our Missouri utility to align our spending with business conditions, reduced environmental capital spending plans for our merchant generation business along with plans that we have discussed in detail in prior presentations for significantly growing our investments in Federal, Energy Regulatory Commission regulated electric transmission projects together place Ameren in an improved position for future success.
Finally, we believe that to be successful we must and we will remain dedicated to operating in a safe both in environmentally responsible manner.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Martin.

Turning to the page nine of the presentation, today we reported third quarter 2011 earnings in accordance with general accepted accounting principles or GAAP of $1.18 per share compared to a third quarter 2010 GAAP loss of $0.70 per share.
Third quarter 2011 core earnings improved to a $1.57 per share compared with third quarter 2010 quarter earnings of $1.40 per share. The following items were excluded from third quarter 2011 and 2010 core earnings. A charge for the Missouri Public Service Commission’s July 2011 disallowance of costs of enhancements related to the rebuilding of the Taum Sauk energy center, which reduced third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.23 per share, this disallowance was appealed to the courts. Impairment and other charges related to Ameren’s merchant generation segment reduced earnings by $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2011. Goodwill, impairment and other charges also related to the merchant segment reduced earnings by $2.19 per share in the third quarter of 2010. The 2011 charges were related to the decision to cease operations at the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers by the end of 2011.
And finally the net effect of unrealized mark to market activity primarily related to non-qualified power and fuel related hedges reduce third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.07 per share an increase third quarter 2010 earnings by $0.09 per share.
Moving to page 10, here we highlight key drivers of the variance between core earnings per share for the third quarters of 2011 and 2010. Key factors driving the earnings improvement included rate changes, net of certain related expenses. This factor increased third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.10 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010 reflecting an electric rate increase in Illinois effective in November of 2010 and an electric rate increase in Missouri effective in late July 2011.
A second key driver was lower core non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, which increased third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.09 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010. The lower O&M reflected discipline cost management across all of our business segments.
Lower interest expense was also a factor behind the improvement in third quarter 2011 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2010. This increased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Weather was significantly warmer than normal in the third quarter of 2011 and slightly warmer than that of the year ago quarter. This boosted earnings by an estimated $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010 and by an estimated $0.14 per share compared to normal.
The primary factor negatively affecting the comparison between third quarter 2011 earnings and third quarter 2010 earnings was lower margins at our Merchant Generation segment, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. These lower margins reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation related expenses.
While margins were down, Merchant Generation Energy Center operations were strong. Equivalent availability was 92% and the net capacity factor was 80% at this segment’s base load energy centers in the third quarter of 2011.
As Tom mentioned, we have raised our 2011 core earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up from our prior range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share. This increase in guidance reflects strong third quarter core earnings driven by warmer than normal weather and continued disciplined cost management.
The core earnings guidance for our combined Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois segments was raised to a range of $2.25 to $2.30, up from our prior range of $2.10 to $2.25. The core guidance range for our Merchant Generation segment was narrowed to a range of $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share in the upper half of our prior range. Before I leave our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance, I would like to remind you that fourth quarter earnings results will be impacted by cost related scheduled 2011 Callaway nuclear energy center with fueling and maintenance average which is currently in progress. In addition I would like to discuss a pending regulatory matter in Missouri that could impact fourth quarter GAAP and core earnings. In Missouri the staff of the Public Service Commission is required to initiate a prudence review of costs subject to the fuel adjustment clause at least every 18 months. The staff recently initiated its second such review since implementation of Ameren Missouri’s fuel adjustment clause.
This second review covers the period from October 1, 2009 through May 31, 2011. In its first review the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission recommended at the - and the PSC ruled in April of 2011 by a three-two vote that Ameren Missouri flow through the FAC and credit to customers all margins associated with certain long-term partial requirement sales, they were made by Ameren Missouri due to the loss of load from Noranda Aluminum’s, Missouri smelter plan. You’ll recall this loss of load was caused by a severe ice-storm in January of 2009. As a result of this order we recorded a second quarter of 2011 pretax charge of $18 million to core earnings or about $0.05 per share.
We continue to disagree with PSCs order in its classification of these sales, and believe that the terms of the FAC tariff did not provide for margins from these sales to be flowed through the FAC. Therefore, we have appealed this decision to the courts.
As we have previously disclosed Ameren Missouri recognized additional margin associated with the same long-term partial requirement sales contracts subsequent to September 30, 2009. The recently initiated second FAC prudence review covers the subsequent period. On October 28, the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission recommended that the PSC required these additional margins which it calculates to be $26 million also be flowed through the FAC and therefore credited the customers.
The staffs report dealt only with this issue and it plans to file a report on the balance of its FAC review by the end of February 2012. The PSC has not indicated whether we will rule on the treatment of this $26 million before it receives the staffs report from the balance of its review. If the PSC rules that this $26 million should be flowed through the FAC and the courts have not overturned the PSCs prior FAC prudence review decision, we would expect to take a charge to core earnings of approximately $0.07 per share in the period when such a decision is issued. Such a potential charge has not been assumed in our 2011 earnings guidance.
As I close our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance, I need to remind you that our guidance assumes normal weather for the fourth quarter of this year. Further any charge that may result from the recently announced voluntary retirement offer to certain employees as well as any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings that are excluded from GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses for the full year.
Core earnings and guidance exclude any charge resulting from the voluntary retirement offer and any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses. Further, our earnings guidance for 2011 is subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in today’s press release including the forward-looking statement section of that release.
Turning to page 11, I would now like to provide updated 2011 projected cash flow information. We now expect to achieve free cash flow of approximately $325 million up from our prior guidance of approximately $225 million. The improved cash flow outlook reflects increased 2011 earnings expectations, lower capital expenditures and updated working capital expectations.
Turning now to page 12 in a discussion of our pending delivery rate cases in Illinois, in October the parties filed initial and reply briefs in these cases. Our rate increased request continued to total $89 million annually with $39 million of this related to electric delivery service and $50 million related to gas delivery service.
We planned to withdraw our electric delivery case as permitted by the recently passed trailer bill and move to the newly authorized performance based formula rate making. However, the gas rate case will still proceed to completion. On this page and the next, we have provided a breakdown of the electric and gas service numbers included in our and other party’s positions.
The ICC staff is now recommending a combined revenue increase of $33 million with $29.5 million of this related to the gas rate case. By far the most material difference between our position and that of the staff is related to return on equity.
On page 13, we outlined key points of the attorney general’s and Citizen Utility Board’s for vital positions as well as those of the Illinois industrial energy customers. The administrative law judges are expected to issue their proposed order on November 15 of this year and the deadline for Illinois Commerce Commission decision is January 12, of 2012 with new rates expected to be effective shortly thereafter.
Moving now to page 14, in our Merchant Generation business, I would like to provide additional details on the financial impact of shutting down Meredosia and Hutsonville by year-end 2011. Combined these energy centers are expected to be about breakeven in 2011 from a cash flow perspective. Going forward we expect to closure of these facilities in the resulting 2011 impairments will improve perspective earnings by about $0.01 to $0.02 per share annually.
Tom already mentioned the ceasing operations at these two energy centers enable us in part to reduce our planned Merchant Segment capital expenditures due primarily to the elimination of the previously planned baghouses at Edwards. On this page, we provided you with our revised lower Merchant Generation plant capital expenditures for 2011 through 2015 by year.
On page 15, we provide an update on our four power sales and hedged data as of September 30, 2011. We continue to expect our Merchant Generation business to generate approximately 29.5 million megawatt hours in 2011 with approximately 27.5 million of this coming from our five largest coal-fired energy centers, the Coffeen, Duck Creek, Edwards, Joppa, and Newton facilities. These 29.5 million megawatt hours due include 100% of the expected generation of the Electric Energy, Inc. or Joppa Energy Center, a facility in which Ameren owns an 80% interest.
As you can see our projected 2011 power sales are very close to fully hedged. For 2012 we have now hedged approximately 21.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour. Further for 2013 we’ve hedged approximately 11 million megawatt hours at an average price of $41 per megawatt hour. Our capacity sales are approximately 63% hedged for 2012 and approximately 42% hedged in 2013.
Turning to the last page of our formal presentation, page 16, here we provide an update of our Merchant Generation’s segments fuel and transportation related hedges. For 2011 we have hedged essentially all of our expected generation. For 2012 we have now hedged approximately 25 million megawatt hours at about $24 per megawatt hour. For 2013, we have now hedged approximately 9 million megawatt hours at about 26.50 per megawatt hour. This is hedging information then completes our prepared remarks.
And we will now be happy to take your questions.

Our generation profile is typically more about 52% on peak and basically what you see in there is megawatt hours that have been sold more like our generation profile, more like that 52% on peak, 48% off peak and that does include any kind of hedges or forward sales we’ve made. So whether they be financial products or physical products most of that I would say in that period of time does represent physical contracts that we have with counterparties and would include then some energy, some capacity and some other services.

And so we’re going to stay focused on disciplined cost control disciplined investment as we seek to improve those earned returns.

In fact as you know we’ve seen some declines in residential and commercial sales this year when you strip out the impacts of weather. And so, as a result of that we’ve certainly been looking to tighten our belt, keep costs under control and importantly that also helps to - help contain costs for our customers as we recently have been going in for rate cases and of course the benefits of those costs savings eventually accretive to customer in terms of lower rate increases.
So that’s what we are doing. I’d say looking forward given Senate Bill 1652, certainly in Illinois, we’re going to be looking to add employees as we look to make investments in that state to improve service reliability, service quality and roll out some of the smart grid plant so that we laid out, and are laid out in the legislation.

Paul, in complete answer to your question when you look at Ameren Illinois, I’d also not forget that the gas rates will be reset based on the forecasted test year we filed.

The Merchant Generation write-down really as you know had to do with the closure of Meredosia and Hutsonville. You know when we had our last quarterly call we talked about the fact that we thought like we are getting pretty good clarity on getting our arms around our environmental capital expenditures and what was necessary to comply with the various rules that were out there. And the one I known really was and how we’re going to comply with respect to the tighten NOx submission standards. And so as we look at specifically that the tighten NOx submission standards ultimately it was decided that we were forced to really shutdown Meredosia and Hutsonville to be able to comply with those CSAPR rules the NOx component of CSAPR rules, so that was the big driver there.
But then Paul as we talked about on the call what that allowed us to do is once that decision is made you look at your overall SO2 and NOx allowances given that those plans are no longer in the mix. And then that allows you to kind of relook at your overall compliance strategy for SO2, for your fleet that led us to the conclusion that we could actually reduce our capital expenditures or excuse me eliminate the use of DSI I would say at Edwards. And then that triggered basically our ability to relook at the baghouses in the need for those versus upgrades to our precipitator. So the CSAPR rules were certainly the cause of the decision to shut down Meredosia and Hutsonville, but that lead to sort of a chain of decisions that led to reduced capital costs at our Edwards facility.

But I think well that’s a legislative. I think we are not supporting them. We also consider other alternatives to reduce lag including speaking ways to reduce lag potentially through the regulatory process. So we will look at both of those but in the interim as Martin said, what we are doing, we are taking steps to better align our spending to be consistent with the regulatory outcomes in the economic conditions in order to reduce lag and make significant progress towards closing that gap. So, we are looking at both regulatory approach, a legislative approach and then really an operational approach. We are very focused on it.

We’ve also had a retail marketing effort as well. I think you’re right, we are seeing some increases in switching within the state and we’re staying active in the State.
I think if you look back at some of our sales overtime, like if you look at this year, I’d say that about 45% of the sales we’re making this year from our generation are going to sort of physical delivery, physical end use. So as far as our merchant business that’s something we’re going to continue to focused on and we’re going to target something greater than 50% of our generation to go to physical delivery customers as we move forward.

Looking forward to seeing you in paradise. So just think of some high level sort of question, as I look at how you guys have positioned your company over the last 12 months, I mean you have addressed the cost side in Missouri and through legislation, you’ll hopefully be addressing the revenue side and there were no way on the utilities and so you’ve gotten some visibility on an earnings trajectory to get you the authorized return and thus the signal with the dividend which is great? And on the power generation side, you can control the denominator, you can’t really - you have a limited control over the numerator, but you do in your regardless to reduce the cost, so you don’t want have to add investment at leverage, right. So I mean what’s the current leverage that’s allocated to the Genco, is it about 1.5 billion is that right if I take a look at the parent debt and the Genco debt?

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced strong third quarter 2011 core earnings of $1.57 per share, compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.40 per share.

Today we announced strong third quarter 2011 core earnings of $1.57 per share, compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.40 per share. The increase in third quarter 2011 core earnings compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings reflected Illinois and Missouri electric rate increases and lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses as a result of continued cost discipline. Improvement in earnings was also due to lower interest expense driven by debt reduction and also weather that was slightly warmer than that of the year ago quarter. These positive factors were partially offset by reduced margins in the merchant generation segment due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation related expenses.
While temperatures in the third quarter of 2011 were not significantly different than those experienced in the third quarter of 2010, they were much warmer than normal. Before I move on to a discussion of earnings guidance, I would like to comment on our operating performance during the third quarter of 2011. I’m proud to report that our energy centers performed exceptionally well during the summer months.
Equivalent availability at our base load energy centers was a strong 94% and the net capacity factor was a strong 84% in the third quarter of 2011. This performance included our Callaway nuclear energy center which operated continuously from its last refueling which ended in June of 2010 until the beginning of its current refueling in mid-October 2011, a period of 489 days. This was the facility’s second longest breaker-to-breaker run since it began operating in 1984.
Turning to page four, reflecting our strong third quarter earnings, today we’re raising our 2011 core earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share up from our prior range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share.
Martin will provide further details regarding our third quarter 2011 earnings and 2011 guidance later in this call.
Moving to page five, we now expect 2011 positive free cash flow to reach approximately $325 million, an increase of $100 billion from the estimate we provided on our second quarter conference call. We have been using our free cash flow to reduce outstanding borrowings. This has included not only the June 2011 maturity of $150 million of Ameren Illinois Company long-term debt but also a significant amount of short-term debt. In fact at September 30, 2011, cash and equivalents exceeded short-term debt and we expect this also be the case at year end. These reductions in debt contributed to a common equity ratio that stood at a solid 53.9% of total capitalization at the end of the third quarter.
Reflecting the steps we have taken over the last few years to strengthen our financial performance and position, on October 14, 2011, Ameren’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend payment to common shareholders of $0.40 per share, a 3.9% increase over the prior quarterly dividend rate. This new annualized equivalent rate of $1.60 per share is a level that is well covered by earnings and cash flows from our regulated business segments. This new annualized rate represents a 7% payout of 2011 core earnings from our regulated business segments based on the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to page six. In addition to the positive news I’ve shared with you regarding earnings, cash flows and dividends, I’m also able to report significant progress on important strategic initiatives. This progress is the result of our focused and sustained efforts to improve the performance of our company for the mutual benefit of our investors and customers.
On several occasions, I have stated that we’re committed to seeking and obtaining constructive regulatory frameworks that allow us to recover our costs in a timely fashion and then provide a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on our investments. As important constructive regulatory frameworks provide us with the necessary -- as important constructive regulatory frameworks provide us with the necessary cash flows to invest in our energy infrastructure so we can meet our customer’s expectation and create good paying jobs in our communities.
I’m very pleased that just last week, the Illinois General Assembly approved a new constructive regulatory framework that provides electric delivery utilities in that state with the opportunity to choose performance-based formulaic rate making. The legislature enacted into law Senate Bill 1652, the Energy Infrastructure Monetization Act and approved a trailer bill that will amend Senate Bill 1652. Governor Quinn has 60 days to act on the trailer bill. If he does nothing by the end of the 60-day period, the trailer bill becomes law. If he vetoes the trailer bill it will be sent back to the house and senate for further consideration.
This legislation is a win for the economy of the State of Illinois, a win for our Illinois Electric delivery customers and a win for our Ameren Illinois Utility.
Utilities will have the opportunity to benefit from more predictable rate making that will allow them to invest in their businesses, receive timely cash flows from these investments and have greater confidence that they will be able to earn close to their allowed return on such investments.
This law is designed to create nearly 2,500 additional good paying jobs throughout the state. And further, the additional investments required of participating utilities should provide customers with improved service quality and reliability as well as long-term savings. The legislation includes a number of customer protections and other benefits many of which are listed on this page. These protections include regulatory oversight by the Illinois Commerce Commission to ensure that the investments made and costs incurred are prudent.
Page seven provides highlights of the new regulatory framework. Ameren Illinois plans to withdraw its pending electric delivery rate case and is developing plans for filing for performance-based formula electric delivery rates under Senate Bill 1652.
However, our pending gas delivery rate case will continue to move forward and Senate Bill 1652 does not apply to the gas utility business.
Moving to page eight, of course our commitment to earnings fair returns on our investments also extends to Missouri. Ameren Missouri expects to make significant progress towards closing the gap between its earned and allowed return on equity in 2012.
On October 21, we announced a voluntary retirement offer as part of Ameren Missouri’s efforts to tighten its belt during this challenging economic period. This action should lower overall costs to our customers as well as allying spending with regulatory outcomes in economic conditions and improve earned returns at our Missouri utility. The voluntary retirement offer has been made to approximately 715 management and union employees of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Services. Ameren Services provides support services to Ameren and all of its subsidiaries.
Those accepting the offer are expected to retire by year-end 2011. While we do not know how many employees will accept this offer, a similar offer in 2009 had an acceptance rate of approximately 30%. In connection with this program, there’s one thing I want to be clear about. We will not reduce our workforce to a level that will impact our employees’ ability to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers.
Looking ahead, Missouri will continue to explore options to reduce regulatory lag, to enhance our cash flows and earn returns, and thereby facilitate more timely investments in our energy infrastructure. Facilitating such investments will improve reliability and create jobs to the benefit of all our stakeholders in the entire state of Missouri.
In addition to these developments that are regulated utilities, our merchant generation business recently took steps that are expected to further reduce operating costs and capital spending plans. These steps are part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that this business is well-positioned to weather the current period of low power prices and benefit from the expected improvement in such prices.
In early October, our merchant generation business announced that it will cease operating the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers in Illinois by the end of 2011. These two smaller, older energy centers provided approximately 4% of our merchant generation segments' total generation over the last two years. The closures are primarily the result of complying with a Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in July of 2011. CSAPR tightened sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission levels -- emission limits to the point that continued operation of these facilities is not economic.
Closure of Meredosia and Hutsonville will reduce our merchant generation fleet emission levels. However, we will retain the emission credits for SO2 and NOx associated with these plans through 2015. As a result, we no longer plan to use dry sorbent injection at our Edwards plant to comply with the SO2 limitations of the Illinois multi-pollutant standard and CSAPR. Removing dry sorbent injection from our compliant strategy at Edwards eliminated one of the reasons for planned baghouses at that energy center.
The other reason for baghouses was of course for  particulate control in anticipation of the half-mac rules. However, as a result of further testing, we now expect that upgrading the existing electrostatic precipitators at Edwards will allow us to achieve the anticipated particulate compliance requirements without the need for baghouses at a reduced net capital cost. As a result, we’ve further reduced our expected 2011 through 2015 merchant generation segment capital expenditures by approximately $70 million. These reductions are in addition to the approximately $200 million of lower planned merchant generation capital expenditures for the 2011 to 2015 period, which we announced on the second quarter conference call.
In summary, we believe that the following recent developments: approval of a new constructive, regulatory framework for Illinois electric delivery businesses; receipt of new electric rates in Missouri this past July; disciplined cost reductions at our Missouri utility to align our spending with business conditions; reduced environmental capital spending plans for our merchant generation business; along with plans that we have discussed in detail in prior presentations for significantly growing our investments in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulated electric transmission projects, together place Ameren in an improved position for future success.
Finally, we believe that to be successful we must and we will remain dedicated to operating in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Martin."
373264,142268909,198941,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Turning to page nine of the presentation, today we reported third quarter 2011 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, of $1.18 per share compared to a third quarter 2010 GAAP loss of $0.70 per share.Th",1873,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to page nine of the presentation, today we reported third quarter 2011 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, of $1.18 per share compared to a third quarter 2010 GAAP loss of $0.70 per share.
Third quarter 2011 core earnings improved to a $1.57 per share compared with third quarter 2010 quarter earnings of $1.40 per share. The following items were excluded from third quarter 2011 and 2010 core earnings. A charge for the Missouri Public Service Commission’s July 2011 disallowance of costs of enhancements related to the rebuilding of the Taum Sauk energy center, which reduced third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.23 per share. This disallowance was appealed to the courts. Impairment and other charges related to Ameren’s merchant generation segment reduced earnings by $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2011. Goodwill, impairment and other charges also related to the merchant segment reduced earnings by $2.19 per share in the third quarter of 2010. The 2011 charges were related to the decision to cease operations at the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers by the end of 2011.
And finally, the net effect of unrealized mark to market activity primarily related to non-qualified power and fuel related hedges reduced third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.07 per share and increased third quarter 2010 earnings by $0.09 per share.
Moving to page 10, here we highlight key drivers of the variance between core earnings per share for the third quarters of 2011 and 2010. Key factors driving the earnings improvement included rate changes, net of certain related expenses. This factor increased third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.10 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010, reflecting an electric rate increase in Illinois effective in November of 2010 and an electric rate increase in Missouri effective in late July 2011.
A second key driver was lower core non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, which increased third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.09 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010. The lower O&M reflected discipline cost management across all of our business segments.
Lower interest expense was also a factor behind the improvement in third quarter 2011 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2010. This increased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Weather was significantly warmer than normal in the third quarter of 2011 and slightly warmer than that of the year ago quarter. This boosted earnings by an estimated $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010 and by an estimated $0.14 per share compared to normal.
The primary factor negatively affecting the comparison between third quarter 2011 earnings and third quarter 2010 earnings was lower margins at our Merchant Generation segment, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. These lower margins reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation related expenses.
While margins were down, Merchant Generation Energy Center operations were strong. Equivalent availability was 92% and the net capacity factor was 80% at this segment’s base load energy centers in the third quarter of 2011.
As Tom mentioned, we have raised our 2011 core earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up from our prior range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share. This increase in guidance reflects strong third quarter core earnings driven by warmer than normal weather and continued disciplined cost management.
The core earnings guidance for our combined Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois segments was raised to a range of $2.25 to $2.30, up from our prior range of $2.10 to $2.25. The core guidance range for our Merchant Generation segment was narrowed to a range of $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share in the upper half of our prior range. Before I leave our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance, I would like to remind you that fourth quarter earnings results will be impacted by costs related to scheduled 2011 Callaway nuclear energy center refueling and maintenance outage which is currently in progress. In addition, I would like to discuss a pending regulatory matter in Missouri that could impact fourth quarter GAAP and core earnings. In Missouri the staff of the Public Service Commission is required to initiate a prudence review of costs subject to the fuel adjustment clause at least every 18 months. The staff recently initiated its second such review since implementation of Ameren Missouri’s fuel adjustment clause.
This second review covers the period from October 1, 2009 through May 31, 2011. In its first review, the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission recommended at the - and the PSC ruled in April of 2011 by a 3-2 vote, that Ameren Missouri flow through the FAC and credit to customers all margins associated with certain long-term partial requirement sales, that were made by Ameren Missouri due to the loss of load from Noranda Aluminum’s, Missouri smelter plan. You’ll recall this loss of load was caused by a severe ice-storm in January of 2009. As a result of this order, we recorded a second quarter 2011 pretax charge of $18 million to core earnings or about $0.05 per share.
We continue to disagree with PSCs order in its classification of these sales, and believe that the terms of the FAC tariff did not provide for margins from these sales to be flowed through the FAC. Therefore, we have appealed this decision to the courts.
As we have previously disclosed, Ameren Missouri recognized additional margins associated with the same long-term partial requirement sales contracts subsequent to September 30, 2009. The recently-initiated second FAC prudence review covers this subsequent period. On October 28, the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission recommended that the PSC required these additional margins which it calculates to be $26 million also be flowed through the FAC and therefore credited to customers.
The staff's report dealt only with this issue and it plans to file a report on the balance of its FAC review by the end of February 2012. The PSC has not indicated whether it will rule on the treatment of this $26 million before it receives the staff's report from the balance of its review. If the PSC rules that this $26 million should be flowed through the FAC and the courts have not overturned the PSC's prior FAC prudence review decision, we would expect to take a charge to core earnings of approximately $0.07 per share in the period when such a decision is issued. Such a potential charge has not been assumed in our 2011 earnings guidance.
As I close our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance, I need to remind you that our guidance assumes normal weather for the fourth quarter of this year. Further, any charge that may result from the recently-announced voluntary retirement offer to certain employees, as well as any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings, but are excluded from GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses for the full year.
Core earnings and guidance exclude any charge resulting from the voluntary retirement offer and any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses. Further, our earnings guidance for 2011 is subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in today’s press release including the forward-looking statement section of that release.
Turning to page 11, I would now like to provide updated 2011 projected cash flow information. We now expect to achieve free cash flow of approximately $325 million up from our prior guidance of approximately $225 million. The improved cash flow outlook reflects increased 2011 earnings expectations, lower capital expenditures and updated working capital expectations.
Turning now to page 12 in a discussion of our pending delivery rate cases in Illinois, in October the parties filed initial and reply briefs in these cases. Our rate increase requests continued to total $89 million annually with $39 million of this related to electric delivery service and $50 million related to gas delivery service.
We plan to withdraw our electric delivery case as permitted by the recently-passed trailer bill and move to the newly-authorized performance-based formulaic ratemaking. However, the gas rate case will still proceed to completion. On this page and the next, we have provided a breakdown of the electric and gas service numbers included in our and other party’s positions.
The ICC staff is now recommending a combined revenue increase of $33 million with $29.5 million of this related to the gas rate case. By far the most material difference between our position and that of the staff is related to return on equity.
On page 13, we outlined key points of the attorney general’s and Citizen Utility Board’s rebuttal positions as well as those of the Illinois industrial energy customers. The administrative law judges are expected to issue their proposed order on November 15 of this year and the deadline for an Illinois Commerce Commission decision is January 12, of 2012 with new rates expected to be effective shortly thereafter.
Moving now to page 14, in our Merchant Generation business, I would like to provide additional details on the financial impact of shutting down Meredosia and Hutsonville by year-end 2011. Combined, these energy centers are expected to be about breakeven in 2011 from a cash flow perspective. Going forward we expect the closure of these facilities and the resulting 2011 impairments will improve perspective earnings by about $0.01 to $0.02 per share annually.
Tom already mentioned that ceasing operations at these two energy centers enable us in part to reduce our planned Merchant Segment capital expenditures, due primarily to the elimination of the previously-planned baghouses at Edwards. On this page, we provided you with our revised lower Merchant Generation planned capital expenditures for 2011 through 2015 by year.
On page 15, we provide an update on our 4 power sales and hedged data as of September 30, 2011. We continue to expect our Merchant Generation business to generate approximately 29.5 million megawatt hours in 2011 with approximately 27.5 million of this coming from our 5 largest coal-fired energy centers: the Coffeen, Duck Creek, Edwards, Joppa, and Newton facilities. These 29.5 million megawatt hours do include 100% of the expected generation of the Electric Energy, Inc. or Joppa Energy Center, a facility in which Ameren owns an 80% interest.
As you can see our projected 2011 power sales are very close to fully hedged. For 2012 we have now hedged approximately 21.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour. Further for 2013 we’ve hedged approximately 11 million megawatt hours at an average price of $41 per megawatt hour. Our capacity sales are approximately 63% hedged for 2012 and approximately 42% hedged in 2013.
Turning to the last page of our formal presentation, page 16, here we provide an update of our Merchant Generation’s segments fuel and transportation related hedges. For 2011 we have hedged essentially all of our expected generation. For 2012 we have now hedged approximately 25 million megawatt hours at about $24 per megawatt hour. For 2013, we have now hedged approximately 9 million megawatt hours at about $26.50 per megawatt hour. This hedging information then completes our prepared remarks.
And we will now be happy to take your questions."

And so we’re going to stay focused on disciplined cost control, disciplined investment as we seek to improve those earned returns.

In fact as you know we’ve seen some declines in residential and commercial sales this year when you strip out the impacts of weather. And so, as a result of that we’ve certainly been looking to tighten our belt, keep costs under control and importantly that also helps to -- help contain costs for our customers as we recently have been going in for rate cases and of course the benefits of those costs savings eventually accretive to customer in terms of lower rate increases.
So that’s what we are doing. I’d say looking forward given Senate Bill 1652, certainly in Illinois, we’re going to be looking to add employees as we look to make investments in that state to improve service reliability, service quality and roll out some of the smart grid plans that we laid out, that are laid out in the legislation.

The Merchant Generation write-down really as you know had to do with the closure of Meredosia and Hutsonville. You know when we had our last quarterly call we talked about the fact that we felt like we are getting pretty good clarity on getting our arms around our environmental capital expenditures and what was necessary to comply with the various rules that were out there. And the one unknown really was and how we’re going to comply with respect to the tightened NOx submission standards. And so as we look at specifically that, the tightened NOx submission standards, ultimately it was decided that we were forced to really shut down Meredosia and Hutsonville to be able to comply with those CSAPR rules -- the NOx component of CSAPR rules -- so that was the big driver there.
But then, Paul, as we talked about on the call what that allowed us to do is once that decision is made you look at your overall SO2 and NOx allowances given that those plants are no longer in the mix. And then that allows you to kind of relook at your overall compliance strategy for SO2 for your fleet. That led us to the conclusion that we could actually reduce our capital expenditures or excuse me eliminate the use of DSI I would say at Edwards. And then that triggered basically our ability to relook at the baghouses in the need for those versus upgrades to our precipitator. So I'd say the CSAPR rules were certainly the cause of the decision to shut down Meredosia and Hutsonville, but that did lead to sort of a chain of decisions that led to reduced capital costs at our Edwards facility."

Because importantly as Tom said, reducing regulatory lag will enhance our cash flows and returns, but most importantly facilitate greater investments in energy infrastructure to improve liability, create good paying jobs and ultimately benefit our customers in the state. But I think while that’s a legislative...it's important that we also consider other alternatives to reduce lag including speaking ways to reduce lag potentially through the regulatory process. So we will look at both of those but in the interim as Martin said, what we are doing, we are taking steps to better align our spending to be consistent with the regulatory outcomes and economic conditions in order to reduce lag and make significant progress towards closing that gap.

But today we are still spending millions of dollars on energy efficiency in Missouri, both when you combine both the electric and gas side and we’re going to continue to stay focused on trying to find a solution to this issue."

I think if you look back at some of our sales overtime, like if you look at this year, I’d say that about 45% of the sales we’re making this year from our generation are going to sort of physical delivery, physical end use. So as far as our merchant business that’s something we’re going to continue to focuse on and we’re going to target something greater than 50% of our generation to go to physical delivery customers as we move forward."

And on the power generation side, you can control the denominator, you can’t really - you have a limited control over the numerator, but you doing your darndest to reduce the cost, so you don’t want have to add investment at leverage, right. So I mean what’s the current leverage that’s allocated to the Genco, is it about $1.5 billion is that right if I take a look at the parent debt and the Genco debt?"

So, I guess the last leg of the stool here from a strategic perspective is you’ve done a fantastic job addressing the utility side of things and hopefully you will execute and get to the earned returns.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced strong third quarter 2011 core earnings of $1.57 per share, compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.40 per share. The increase in third quarter 2011 core earnings comp",1722,"Thanks, Doug. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today we announced strong third quarter 2011 core earnings of $1.57 per share, compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings of $1.40 per share. The increase in third quarter 2011 core earnings compared to third quarter 2010 core earnings reflected Illinois and Missouri electric rate increases and lower non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses as a result of continued cost discipline. Improvement in earnings was also due to lower interest expense driven by debt reduction and also weather that was slightly warmer than that of the year ago quarter. These positive factors were partially offset by reduced margins in the merchant generation segment due to lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation related expenses.
While temperatures in the third quarter of 2011 were not significantly different than those experienced in the third quarter of 2010, they were much warmer than normal. Before I move on to a discussion of earnings guidance, I would like to comment on our operating performance during the third quarter of 2011. I’m proud to report that our energy centers performed exceptionally well during the summer months.
Equivalent availability at our base load energy centers was a strong 94% and the net capacity factor was a strong 84% in the third quarter of 2011. This performance included our Callaway nuclear energy center which operated continuously from its last refueling which ended in June of 2010 until the beginning of its current refueling in mid-October 2011, a period of 489 days. This was the facility’s second longest breaker-to-breaker run since it began operating in 1984.
Turning to Page 4, reflecting our strong third quarter earnings, today we’re raising our 2011 core earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share up from our prior range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share.
Martin will provide further details regarding our third quarter 2011 earnings and 2011 guidance later in this call.
Moving to Page 5, we now expect 2011 positive free cash flow to reach approximately $325 million, an increase of $100 billion from the estimate we provided on our second quarter conference call. We have been using our free cash flow to reduce outstanding borrowings. This has included not only the June 2011 maturity of $150 million of Ameren Illinois Company long-term debt but also a significant amount of short-term debt. In fact at September 30, 2011, cash and equivalents exceeded short-term debt and we expect this also be the case at year end. These reductions in debt contributed to a common equity ratio that stood at a solid 53.9% of total capitalization at the end of the third quarter.
Reflecting the steps we have taken over the last few years to strengthen our financial performance and position, on October 14, 2011, Ameren’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend payment to common shareholders of $0.40 per share, a 3.9% increase over the prior quarterly dividend rate. This new annualized equivalent rate of $1.60 per share is a level that is well covered by earnings and cash flows from our regulated business segments. This new annualized rate represents a 7% payout of 2011 core earnings from our regulated business segments based on the midpoint of our guidance range.
Turning to Page 6. In addition to the positive news I’ve shared with you regarding earnings, cash flows and dividends, I’m also able to report significant progress on important strategic initiatives. This progress is the result of our focused and sustained efforts to improve the performance of our company for the mutual benefit of our investors and customers.
On several occasions, I have stated that we’re committed to seeking and obtaining constructive regulatory frameworks that allow us to recover our costs in a timely fashion and then provide a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on our investments. As important constructive regulatory frameworks provide us with the necessary -- as important constructive regulatory frameworks provide us with the necessary cash flows to invest in our energy infrastructure so we can meet our customer’s expectation and create good paying jobs in our communities.
I’m very pleased that just last week, the Illinois General Assembly approved a new constructive regulatory framework that provides electric delivery utilities in that state with the opportunity to choose performance-based formulaic rate making. The legislature enacted into law Senate Bill 1652, the Energy Infrastructure Monetization Act and approved a trailer bill that will amend Senate Bill 1652. Governor Quinn has 60 days to act on the trailer bill. If he does nothing by the end of the 60-day period, the trailer bill becomes law. If he vetoes the trailer bill it will be sent back to the house and senate for further consideration.
This legislation is a win for the economy of the State of Illinois, a win for our Illinois Electric delivery customers and a win for our Ameren Illinois Utility.
Utilities will have the opportunity to benefit from more predictable rate making that will allow them to invest in their businesses, receive timely cash flows from these investments and have greater confidence that they will be able to earn close to their allowed return on such investments.
This law is designed to create nearly 2,500 additional good paying jobs throughout the state. And further, the additional investments required of participating utilities should provide customers with improved service quality and reliability as well as long-term savings. The legislation includes a number of customer protections and other benefits many of which are listed on this page. These protections include regulatory oversight by the Illinois Commerce Commission to ensure that the investments made and costs incurred are prudent.
Page 7 provides highlights of the new regulatory framework. Ameren Illinois plans to withdraw its pending electric delivery rate case and is developing plans for filing for performance-based formula electric delivery rates under Senate Bill 1652.
However, our pending gas delivery rate case will continue to move forward and Senate Bill 1652 does not apply to the gas utility business.
Moving to Page 8, of course our commitment to earnings fair returns on our investments also extends to Missouri. Ameren Missouri expects to make significant progress towards closing the gap between its earned and allowed return on equity in 2012.
On October 21, we announced a voluntary retirement offer as part of Ameren Missouri’s efforts to tighten its belt during this challenging economic period. This action should lower overall costs to our customers as well as allying spending with regulatory outcomes in economic conditions and improve earned returns at our Missouri utility. The voluntary retirement offer has been made to approximately 715 management and union employees of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Services. Ameren Services provides support services to Ameren and all of its subsidiaries.
Those accepting the offer are expected to retire by year-end 2011. While we do not know how many employees will accept this offer, a similar offer in 2009 had an acceptance rate of approximately 30%. In connection with this program, there’s one thing I want to be clear about. We will not reduce our workforce to a level that will impact our employees’ ability to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers.
Looking ahead, Missouri will continue to explore options to reduce regulatory lag, to enhance our cash flows and earn returns, and thereby facilitate more timely investments in our energy infrastructure. Facilitating such investments will improve reliability and create jobs to the benefit of all our stakeholders in the entire state of Missouri.
In addition to these developments that are regulated utilities, our merchant generation business recently took steps that are expected to further reduce operating costs and capital spending plans. These steps are part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that this business is well-positioned to weather the current period of low power prices and benefit from the expected improvement in such prices.
In early October, our merchant generation business announced that it will cease operating the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers in Illinois by the end of 2011. These two smaller, older energy centers provided approximately 4% of our merchant generation segments' total generation over the last two years. The closures are primarily the result of complying with a Cross-State Air Pollution Rule or CSAPR issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in July of 2011. CSAPR tightened sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission levels -- emission limits to the point that continued operation of these facilities is not economic.
Closure of Meredosia and Hutsonville will reduce our merchant generation fleet emission levels. However, we will retain the emission credits for SO2 and NOx associated with these plans through 2015. As a result, we no longer plan to use dry sorbent injection at our Edwards plant to comply with the SO2 limitations of the Illinois multi-pollutant standard and CSAPR. Removing dry sorbent injection from our compliant strategy at Edwards eliminated one of the reasons for planned baghouses at that energy center.
The other reason for baghouses was of course for  particulate control in anticipation of the half-mac rules. However, as a result of further testing, we now expect that upgrading the existing electrostatic precipitators at Edwards will allow us to achieve the anticipated particulate compliance requirements without the need for baghouses at a reduced net capital cost. As a result, we’ve further reduced our expected 2011 through 2015 merchant generation segment capital expenditures by approximately $70 million. These reductions are in addition to the approximately $200 million of lower planned merchant generation capital expenditures for the 2011 to 2015 period, which we announced on the second quarter conference call.
In summary, we believe that the following recent developments: approval of a new constructive, regulatory framework for Illinois electric delivery businesses; receipt of new electric rates in Missouri this past July; disciplined cost reductions at our Missouri utility to align our spending with business conditions; reduced environmental capital spending plans for our merchant generation business; along with plans that we have discussed in detail in prior presentations for significantly growing our investments in Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulated electric transmission projects, together place Ameren in an improved position for future success.
Finally, we believe that to be successful we must and we will remain dedicated to operating in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Martin."
373264,142268909,205877,"Ameren Corporation, Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2011",2011-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Ameren Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 9 of the presentation, today we reported third quarter 2011 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, of $1.18 per share compared to a third quarter 2010 GAAP loss of $0.70 per share.Third",1873,"Thanks, Tom. Turning to Page 9 of the presentation, today we reported third quarter 2011 earnings in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, of $1.18 per share compared to a third quarter 2010 GAAP loss of $0.70 per share.
Third quarter 2011 core earnings improved to a $1.57 per share compared with third quarter 2010 quarter earnings of $1.40 per share. The following items were excluded from third quarter 2011 and 2010 core earnings. A charge for the Missouri Public Service Commission’s July 2011 disallowance of costs of enhancements related to the rebuilding of the Taum Sauk energy center, which reduced third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.23 per share. This disallowance was appealed to the courts. Impairment and other charges related to Ameren’s merchant generation segment reduced earnings by $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2011. Goodwill, impairment and other charges also related to the merchant segment reduced earnings by $2.19 per share in the third quarter of 2010. The 2011 charges were related to the decision to cease operations at the Meredosia and Hutsonville energy centers by the end of 2011.
And finally, the net effect of unrealized mark to market activity primarily related to non-qualified power and fuel related hedges reduced third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.07 per share and increased third quarter 2010 earnings by $0.09 per share.
Moving to Page 10, here we highlight key drivers of the variance between core earnings per share for the third quarters of 2011 and 2010. Key factors driving the earnings improvement included rate changes, net of certain related expenses. This factor increased third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.10 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010, reflecting an electric rate increase in Illinois effective in November of 2010 and an electric rate increase in Missouri effective in late July 2011.
A second key driver was lower core non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, which increased third quarter 2011 earnings by $0.09 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010. The lower O&M reflected discipline cost management across all of our business segments.
Lower interest expense was also a factor behind the improvement in third quarter 2011 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2010. This increased earnings by $0.03 per share.
Weather was significantly warmer than normal in the third quarter of 2011 and slightly warmer than that of the year ago quarter. This boosted earnings by an estimated $0.02 per share compared to the third quarter of 2010 and by an estimated $0.14 per share compared to normal.
The primary factor negatively affecting the comparison between third quarter 2011 earnings and third quarter 2010 earnings was lower margins at our Merchant Generation segment, which reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. These lower margins reflected lower realized power prices and higher fuel and transportation related expenses.
While margins were down, Merchant Generation Energy Center operations were strong. Equivalent availability was 92% and the net capacity factor was 80% at this segment’s base load energy centers in the third quarter of 2011.
As Tom mentioned, we have raised our 2011 core earnings guidance range to $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up from our prior range of $2.30 to $2.55 per share. This increase in guidance reflects strong third quarter core earnings driven by warmer than normal weather and continued disciplined cost management.
The core earnings guidance for our combined Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois segments was raised to a range of $2.25 to $2.30, up from our prior range of $2.10 to $2.25. The core guidance range for our Merchant Generation segment was narrowed to a range of $0.25 per share to $0.30 per share in the upper half of our prior range. Before I leave our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance, I would like to remind you that fourth quarter earnings results will be impacted by costs related to scheduled 2011 Callaway nuclear energy center refueling and maintenance outage which is currently in progress. In addition, I would like to discuss a pending regulatory matter in Missouri that could impact fourth quarter GAAP and core earnings. In Missouri the staff of the Public Service Commission is required to initiate a prudence review of costs subject to the fuel adjustment clause at least every 18 months. The staff recently initiated its second such review since implementation of Ameren Missouri’s fuel adjustment clause.
This second review covers the period from October 1, 2009 through May 31, 2011. In its first review, the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission recommended at the - and the PSC ruled in April of 2011 by a 3-2 vote, that Ameren Missouri flow through the FAC and credit to customers all margins associated with certain long-term partial requirement sales, that were made by Ameren Missouri due to the loss of load from Noranda Aluminum’s, Missouri smelter plan. You’ll recall this loss of load was caused by a severe ice-storm in January of 2009. As a result of this order, we recorded a second quarter 2011 pretax charge of $18 million to core earnings or about $0.05 per share.
We continue to disagree with PSCs order in its classification of these sales, and believe that the terms of the FAC tariff did not provide for margins from these sales to be flowed through the FAC. Therefore, we have appealed this decision to the courts.
As we have previously disclosed, Ameren Missouri recognized additional margins associated with the same long-term partial requirement sales contracts subsequent to September 30, 2009. The recently-initiated second FAC prudence review covers this subsequent period. On October 28, the staff of the Missouri Public Service Commission recommended that the PSC required these additional margins which it calculates to be $26 million also be flowed through the FAC and therefore credited to customers.
The staff's report dealt only with this issue and it plans to file a report on the balance of its FAC review by the end of February 2012. The PSC has not indicated whether it will rule on the treatment of this $26 million before it receives the staff's report from the balance of its review. If the PSC rules that this $26 million should be flowed through the FAC and the courts have not overturned the PSC's prior FAC prudence review decision, we would expect to take a charge to core earnings of approximately $0.07 per share in the period when such a decision is issued. Such a potential charge has not been assumed in our 2011 earnings guidance.
As I close our discussion of 2011 earnings guidance, I need to remind you that our guidance assumes normal weather for the fourth quarter of this year. Further, any charge that may result from the recently-announced voluntary retirement offer to certain employees, as well as any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses will impact GAAP earnings, but are excluded from GAAP earnings guidance because the company is unable to reasonably estimate the impact of any such gains or losses for the full year.
Core earnings and guidance exclude any charge resulting from the voluntary retirement offer and any net unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses. Further, our earnings guidance for 2011 is subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined or referred to in today’s press release including the forward-looking statement section of that release.
Turning to Page 11, I would now like to provide updated 2011 projected cash flow information. We now expect to achieve free cash flow of approximately $325 million up from our prior guidance of approximately $225 million. The improved cash flow outlook reflects increased 2011 earnings expectations, lower capital expenditures and updated working capital expectations.
Turning now to Page 12 in a discussion of our pending delivery rate cases in Illinois, in October the parties filed initial and reply briefs in these cases. Our rate increase requests continued to total $89 million annually with $39 million of this related to electric delivery service and $50 million related to gas delivery service.
We plan to withdraw our electric delivery case as permitted by the recently-passed trailer bill and move to the newly-authorized performance-based formulaic ratemaking. However, the gas rate case will still proceed to completion. On this page and the next, we have provided a breakdown of the electric and gas service numbers included in our and other party’s positions.
The ICC staff is now recommending a combined revenue increase of $33 million with $29.5 million of this related to the gas rate case. By far the most material difference between our position and that of the staff is related to return on equity.
On Page 13, we outlined key points of the attorney general’s and Citizen Utility Board’s rebuttal positions as well as those of the Illinois industrial energy customers. The administrative law judges are expected to issue their proposed order on November 15 of this year and the deadline for an Illinois Commerce Commission decision is January 12, of 2012 with new rates expected to be effective shortly thereafter.
Moving now to Page 14, in our Merchant Generation business, I would like to provide additional details on the financial impact of shutting down Meredosia and Hutsonville by year-end 2011. Combined, these energy centers are expected to be about breakeven in 2011 from a cash flow perspective. Going forward we expect the closure of these facilities and the resulting 2011 impairments will improve perspective earnings by about $0.01 to $0.02 per share annually.
Tom already mentioned that ceasing operations at these two energy centers enable us in part to reduce our planned Merchant Segment capital expenditures, due primarily to the elimination of the previously-planned baghouses at Edwards. On this page, we provided you with our revised lower Merchant Generation planned capital expenditures for 2011 through 2015 by year.
On Page 15, we provide an update on our 4 power sales and hedged data as of September 30, 2011. We continue to expect our Merchant Generation business to generate approximately 29.5 million megawatt hours in 2011 with approximately 27.5 million of this coming from our 5 largest coal-fired energy centers: the Coffeen, Duck Creek, Edwards, Joppa, and Newton facilities. These 29.5 million megawatt hours do include 100% of the expected generation of the Electric Energy, Inc. or Joppa Energy Center, a facility in which Ameren owns an 80% interest.
As you can see our projected 2011 power sales are very close to fully hedged. For 2012 we have now hedged approximately 21.5 million megawatt hours at an average price of $46 per megawatt hour. Further for 2013 we’ve hedged approximately 11 million megawatt hours at an average price of $41 per megawatt hour. Our capacity sales are approximately 63% hedged for 2012 and approximately 42% hedged in 2013.
Turning to the last page of our formal presentation, Page 16, here we provide an update of our Merchant Generation’s segments fuel and transportation related hedges. For 2011 we have hedged essentially all of our expected generation. For 2012 we have now hedged approximately 25 million megawatt hours at about $24 per megawatt hour. For 2013, we have now hedged approximately 9 million megawatt hours at about $26.50 per megawatt hour. This hedging information then completes our prepared remarks.
And we will now be happy to take your questions."

In fact as you know we’ve seen some declines in residential and commercial sales this year when you strip out the impacts of weather. And so, as a result of that we’ve certainly been looking to tighten our belt, keep costs under control and importantly that also helps to -- help contain costs for our customers as we recently have been going in for rate cases and of course the benefits of those costs savings eventually accretive to customer in terms of lower rate increases. So that’s what we are doing. I’d say looking forward given Senate Bill 1652, certainly in Illinois, we’re going to be looking to add employees as we look to make investments in that state to improve service reliability, service quality and roll out some of the smart grid plans that we laid out, that are laid out in the legislation.

The Merchant Generation write-down really as you know had to do with the closure of Meredosia and Hutsonville. You know when we had our last quarterly call we talked about the fact that we felt like we are getting pretty good clarity on getting our arms around our environmental capital expenditures and what was necessary to comply with the various rules that were out there. And the one unknown really was and how we’re going to comply with respect to the tightened NOx submission standards. And so as we look at specifically that, the tightened NOx submission standards, ultimately it was decided that we were forced to really shut down Meredosia and Hutsonville to be able to comply with those CSAPR rules -- the NOx component of CSAPR rules -- so that was the big driver there. But then, Paul, as we talked about on the call what that allowed us to do is once that decision is made you look at your overall SO2 and NOx allowances given that those plants are no longer in the mix. And then that allows you to kind of relook at your overall compliance strategy for SO2 for your fleet. That led us to the conclusion that we could actually reduce our capital expenditures or excuse me eliminate the use of DSI I would say at Edwards. And then that triggered basically our ability to relook at the baghouses in the need for those versus upgrades to our precipitator. So I'd say the CSAPR rules were certainly the cause of the decision to shut down Meredosia and Hutsonville, but that did lead to sort of a chain of decisions that led to reduced capital costs at our Edwards facility."

And on the power generation side, you can control the denominator, you can’t really - you have a limited control over the numerator, but you doing your darndest to reduce the cost, so you don’t want have to add investment at leverage, right. So I mean what’s the current leverage that’s allocated to the Genco, is it about $1.5 billion is that right if I take a look at the parent debt and the Genco debt?"

Just using 7 to 8 times EBITDA is a rough multiple. So, I guess the last leg of the stool here from a strategic perspective is you’ve done a fantastic job addressing the utility side of things and hopefully you will execute and get to the earned returns. You are really doing a great job controlling the investment on the cost side, but -- and the gist of all the other questions I’ve heard on the Genco is when are we going to see the -- when are we going to see the offsetting revenues notwithstanding how bad the forward curve looks?"
