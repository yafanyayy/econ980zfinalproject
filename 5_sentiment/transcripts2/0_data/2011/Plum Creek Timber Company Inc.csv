297268,117868715,97386,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2011",2011-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon and happy new year. Despite challenging economic environment with near-record unemployment and a very weak housing market, Plum Creek had a good year in 2010. Performance in our Timber Resource segments, our Manufacturing segment and our no",613,"Good afternoon and happy new year. Despite challenging economic environment with near-record unemployment and a very weak housing market, Plum Creek had a good year in 2010. Performance in our Timber Resource segments, our Manufacturing segment and our non-Timber Resource businesses all improved in 2010., as we were able to take advantage of marketplace anomalies. 
During the first half of the year, unusually wet weather in the South and inventory restocking of both log yards and the finished product supply chain helped boost prices and income in our Timber Resource and Manufacturing businesses. In addition we were able to take advantage of the disruption in medium density fiberboard and plywood markets caused by the Chilean earthquake to incrementally add to our Manufacturing earnings.
In our Real Estate segment, we completed the final phase of our three-year Montana conservation transaction. While total real estate income declined $98 million from 2009, all of the reduction is due to the smaller size of the final phase of the Montana conservation transaction. Income from the final stage was $125 million lower than the phase completed in 2009. We continue to hold our most valuable real estate in such states as Florida and Georgia of the market. We'll patiently wait for the value of these properties to rebound when the overall real estate market recovers.
Throughout 2010, we continue to manage our assets with an eye on long-term value. We invested $71 million in our businesses, using $65 million to replant trees and improve forest productivity, which will increase the future harvest and cash flow from this asset. Given the weak markets and continued depressed prices for our sawlogs, we reduced our sawlog harvest more than 500,000 tons from our initial plans. Although this decision impacted our cash flow and earnings for 2010, it also allows us to plant and harvest these trees in the future and capture significantly more values as markets and prices recover.
We also focused on strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet by refinancing upcoming debt maturities at attractive rates. During the year, we reduced our total debt by nearly $100 million and in November, completed a $575 million 10-year bond offering at 4.7%. We used the proceeds from this attractively priced offering to prepay $213 million of notes maturing in 2011. The average coupon on the notes retired was 7.71%. In addition, we prepaid in full a $250 million term credit agreement scheduled to mature in 2012. The remaining $84 million of 2011 debt maturities will be funded with our line of credit. Both Moody's and S&P reaffirmed our investment-grade credit rating and upgraded our outlook to positive during the course of the year.
We also renewed our line of credit for $600 million at favorable rates, which provides the company with ample liquidity. We continue to manage our portfolio of timberlands, selling some nonstrategic lands at attractive prices and using the proceeds to repurchase our stock at attractive values. During 2010, we sold 24,000 acres that generated marginal cash flow for $32 million. We used the proceeds to repurchase 1.4 million shares of our common stock at 36 37 per share. Over the last five years, we've repurchased $24 million shares or 13% of our shares at compelling values in attractive long-term investment and are saving $40 million annually in dividends in attractive short-term investment.
Importantly, our cash flow from operations was $449 million, which more than covered our annual dividend payment of $272 million. We ended the year in excellent financial shape with $252 million of cash and additional $434 million available under our line of credit. 
David will now review our fourth quarter results and discuss our outlook for 2011. David?"

We reported  fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. This includes an $0.08 per share charge on the early retirement of debt.

This includes an $0.08 per share charge on the early retirement of debt. Excluding this charge, earnings were $0.45 a share and within our guidance range of $0.40 to $0.47.
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $1 million operating profit, down from the third quarter's $5 million profit. As planned, harvest volumes during the fourth quarter were 13% lower than those of the third quarter. The lower harvest volumes drove most of the decline in operating profit. 
Our average Northern sawlog prices were weaker than we initially expected at about 6% or about $4 per ton from the third quarter. Prices for softwood sawlogs in the Northwest drifted down through November and started recovering in December. Western sawmills have increased production in response to strengthening offshore lumber demand, particularly from China.  Fourth quarter lumber production in the West Coast was up 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
Additionally, export log volumes to China from West Coast increased significantly. Northern pulpwood prices held steady at $39 per ton during the fourth quarter. Customer demand was good and prices remained attractive. 
Northwest log prices continued to improve in January, driven by higher lumber production aimed at export markets, coupled with growth in export log demand. We expect to export 7% of our Oregon sawlogs to China in the first quarter compared to only nominal volumes in the fourth quarter.
We expect our average Northern segment sawlog prices to increase $3 per ton from the fourth quarter's level. In aggregate, we expect higher sawlog prices, slightly lower pulpwood prices and fairly stable volumes compared to the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect our Northern sawlog harvest volumes and mix to be similar to 2010, about 4 million tons with 55% sawlogs and 45% pulpwood mix.
Turning to our Southern Resources segment. Our fourth quarter operating profit was $28 million, up $3 million from the third quarter's $25 million profit. The increase in operating profit was primarily a function of higher sawlog harvest volumes. Prices for sawlogs and pulpwood both declined 3% to 4% as favorable logging conditions caused by unseasonably dry weather kept customer mills well supplied across the south. Pulpwood demand from pulp and paper customers strong and pulpwood prices remained attractive by historic standards. We expect Southern lumber production to increase during the first quarter, as a handful of males in our operating areas have reopened or are increasing production. 
However, logging conditions remained favorable across the South, and mills are in relatively good shape from an inventory standpoint. As a result, we expect first quarter sawlog and pulpwood prices to hold at fourth quarter levels. We expect our first quarter harvest will be approximately 200,000 tons lower than the first quarter of last year, as we anticipate there will be better pricing opportunities as the year progresses.
The reductions are split evenly between sawlogs and pulpwood. We expect the overall Southern harvest in 2011 to be similar to 2010's level, about 11.4 million tons. We expect our 2010 Southern harvest mix will be similar to the 2010 mix, roughly 45% sawlogs and 55% pulpwood. 
As mills expand production in 2011, we expect existing contractor capacity may become a gating item that limits log supply. However, Plum Creek is an excellent position to respond to market opportunities when and where they arise, as we have a sawlog base of established contractors. As always, we will continues to adjust our harvest plans in response to market conditions, deferring harvest in weaker markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $155 million and operating profit of $73 million for the fourth quarter. The final phase of the Montana conservation sale contributed $89 million to revenue and $37 million to operating profit. The balance of the fourth quarter revenue and income came from the sale of roughly 16,000 of recreation and higher and better used land at an average price of $2,000 per acre. About 2/3 of the acres sold during the quarter came from lower value regions of the Gulf South and the Lake States. 
Small amounts of strategic land sales also contributed to the quarter's performance, with about 21,000 acres selling at an average price of $1,000 per acre. These lands are almost exclusively lower-productivity properties scattered across the South.
In addition to the final phase of the Montana conservation sale, we completed the sale of 8,200 acres of conservation land at an average value of $1,000 per acre. Individuals and family buyers remain cautious and value-oriented. Rural land markets were a bit better in 2010 than in 2009. And we expect an increase in interest and activity level as the economy continues to recover. We expect 2011 Real Estate segment revenues between $250 million and $300 million. We expect to see a typical seasonal pattern in this segment for the second half of the year stronger than the first half. For the year, we estimate land basis will be approximately 30% of segment revenue.
We expect first quarter Real Estate revenues to be between $50 million and $60 million. We estimate land basis will be approximately 30% of revenue for the first quarter. 
The Manufacturing segment reported a $3 million profit during the fourth quarter, down $4 million from the third quarter's $7 million profit. This is better than we initially expected due to stronger lumber prices. Our average lumber price increased 5% compared to the third quarter, while our lumber sales volumes declined about 7% to typical seasonal decline. Our plywood and MDF prices declined 4% to 5%, while their sales volumes declined seasonally as well, both down about 18%.
As mentioned in our press release, we expect the Manufacturing segment to earn between $15 million and $20 million in 2011, a bit less than 2010. We expect underlying business conditions to improve gradually. But we are not counting on a repeat of the dramatic spring 2010 lumber inventory cycle or the tightness in global MDF markets caused by the Chilean earthquake last year. However, growing domestic demand, combined with incremental export demand, could provide stronger-than-expected lumber prices.
Rick reviewed our fourth quarter refinancing activities earlier. After considering the effects of these transactions, we expect our 2011 third party interest expense to be essentially flat with 2010 to approximately $81 million. Lower Manufacturing segment results should result in a small tax benefit in 2011 of less than $5 million. In all, we expect 2011 income from continuing operations to be between $1.20 and $1.45 per share, with the first quarter results between $0.20 and $0.25 per share. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

Business conditions appear to be improving, albeit slowly in each of our businesses. Lumber prices have been moving up over the past few months. We believe good production discipline on the part of lumber manufacturers, combined with growing export demand, is the primary driver of these improved prices. 
Today, West Coast export log volumes are relatively small. However, they are growing rapidly in excellent long-term growth prospects. 
In 2010, we started to see lumber production, the key driver for sawlogs, begin to recover from its lows. Regional lumber production data shows the relationships between lumber production and sawlog prices. On the West Coast, lumber production was up 33% compared to 2009. These markets also showed the strongest price movement for sawlog, with our average price increasing 18% from 2009. In the U.S. South where lumber production was only slightly above that of 2009, our average sawlog prices increased only about 2%. 
We have planned for 2011 conservatively. We assume a fairly muted housing recovery, with residential construction activity growing from a 590,000 start level of the past year to about 680,000 starts in 2011. We also believe that increasing consumer confidence should lead to improved lumber demand from the repair and remodel sector. 
The earnings outlook that we shared with you today assumes the slow improvement demand over the coming months. However, with modest improvements in domestic demand coupled with growing export demand, we could see a stronger price environment. 
As David outlined, our 2011 harvest plans are very similar in terms of both volume and mix to those of the prior year. We plan to keep the harvest our most valuable sawlogs low. Of course we have the option of bringing more volume to the market, should log values return to attractive levels. And we are in excellent position to benefit for any temporary market dislocations that may occur. 
In our Real Estate segment, we will concentrate on capturing attractive prices for lower value properties, holding our most valuable lands for the future. We will continue to keep a close eye on our costs at the same time. 
We continue to manage the company for long-term value creation. Disciplined investment and improving the growth and yield of our forest remains a top priority. During 2011, we are planning capital expenditures between $75 million and $80 million. Reforestation makes up the bulk of our $35 million maintenance capital. We expect to plant about 60 million trees this year. The remaining capital is discretionary investment, primarily advanced treatments aimed at boosting the productivity of our forests.
Looking at the bigger picture, I remain as enthused about the prospects for Plum Creek and the fundamentals of our Timber business as I ever have been. We have talked about the structural changes that are taking place in North American timber markets, and we are beginning to see some of their impacts today. Certainly the change that has grabbing the most attention over the past six months has been the impact of Chinese demand on the North American lumber and log markets. West Coast log markets are benefiting from the increased competition for logs. We are seeing increased demand for logs, as lumber producers in the region boost production to serve Chinese demand. There's also growing competition from buyers of logs for the export market. Currently, the impact of log markets is region-specific and limited to the West Coast. However, continued export growth has a potential to impact North American markets more broadly. British Columbia has grown its trade relationship with the Chinese, with lumber shipments to China growing sevenfold over the past three years. It is estimated that Chinese exports accounted for 20% of British Columbia's lumber production in the second half of 2010. That's roughly 5% of North American lumber demand.
Disciplined capital allocation remains our top priority. We completed our refinancing activities over the past quarter, are in excellent shape in both terms of our capital structure, liquidity and debt maturity schedule. We continue to evaluate the best uses for the excess cash we generate, searching out the best value outcome for our shareholders. 
Now we'll be glad to take your questions."

We represent such a small portion of total timber supply. If you look at the U.S. South, 80% of wood fiber there is owned by small non-industrials who are not necessarily acting the same way. So there's not as much inventory on the sidelines as one might think that's not been cut. But setting that aside, you make a really good point. Because on the demand side, with the whole situation in B.C. and we're starting to see the impact of that, with B.C. increasingly serving the Chinese market, with the Chinese on the West Coast market, so there's new demand sources and there's going to be a shrinkage of supply out of B.C., which is going to require that more the lumber production will come from the United States especially as markets recover. And the other thing that you heard us talk about is just whole energy opportunity, be it biomass or renewable energy. And it's a little slow on the take here. But eventually, it's going to have an impact, we believe on the marketplace and that will impact pulpwood. And at the same time, and David mentioned in his comments, is really we think one of the governor on this engine of timber supply is contracted capacity. And I can't even overstate how significant of an impact that's going to have as this market recovers. If you look at production being down 20% to 30% U.S. South that means 20% to 30% of the contractors have been out of business for two or three years. And many of them will not be back. So as we see demand improve, it's going to be very hard to get that product back to market. And that's the governor on that engine. That's why we believe we'll see more price impact from a recovery than might expect otherwise."

297268,117868715,97439,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2011",2011-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon and Happy New Year. Despite a challenging economic environment, with near-record unemployment and a very weak housing market, Plum Creek had a good year in 2010. Performance in our timber resource segments, our Manufacturing segment and our",615,"Good afternoon and Happy New Year. Despite a challenging economic environment, with near-record unemployment and a very weak housing market, Plum Creek had a good year in 2010. Performance in our timber resource segments, our Manufacturing segment and our non-timber resource businesses all improved in 2010, as we were able to take advantage of marketplace anomalies. 
During the first half of the year, unusually wet weather in the South and inventory restocking of both log yards and the finished products supply chain helped boost prices and income in our timber resource and Manufacturing businesses. In addition, we were able to take advantage of the disruption in medium density fiberboard and plywood markets caused by the Chilean earthquake to incrementally add to our Manufacturing earnings.
In our Real Estate segment, we completed the final phase of our three-year Montana conservation transaction. While total real estate income declined $98 million from 2009, all of the reduction is due to the smaller size of the final phase of the Montana conservation transaction. Income from the final phase was $125 million lower than the phase completed in 2009. We continue to hold our most valuable real estate, in such states as Florida and Georgia, off the market. We'll patiently wait for the value of these properties to rebound when the overall real estate market recovers.
Throughout 2010, we continued to manage our assets with an eye on long-term value. We invested $71 million in our businesses, using $65 million to replant trees and improve forest productivity, which will increase the future harvest and cash flow from this asset. Given the weak markets and continued depressed prices for our sawlogs, we reduced our sawlog harvest more than 500,000 tons from our initial plans. Although this decision impacted our cash flow and earnings for 2010, it also allows us to plant, we're going to harvest these trees in the future and capture significantly more values as markets and prices recover.
We're also focused on strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet by refinancing upcoming debt maturities at attractive rates. During the year, we reduced our total debt by nearly $100 million, and in November, completed a $575 million 10-year bond offering at 4.7%. We used the proceeds from this attractively priced offering to prepay $213 million of notes maturing in 2011. The average coupon on the notes retired was 7.71%. In addition, we prepaid in full a $250 million term credit agreement scheduled to mature in 2012. The remaining $94 million of 2011 debt maturities will be funded with our line of credit. Both Moody's and S&P reaffirmed our investment-grade credit rating and upgraded our outlook to positive during the course of the year.
We also renewed our line of credit for $600 million at favorable rates, which provides the company with ample liquidity. We continue to manage our portfolio of timberlands, selling some nonstrategic lands at attractive prices and using the proceeds to repurchase our stock at attractive values. During 2010, we sold 24,000 acres, that generated marginal cash flow, for $32 million. We used the proceeds to repurchase 1.4 million shares of our common stock at $36.37 per share. Over the last five years, we've repurchased $24 million shares, or 13% of our shares, at compelling values in attractive long-term investment and are saving $40 million annually in dividends in attractive short-term investment.
Importantly, our cash flow from operations was $449 million, which more than covered our annual dividend payment of $272 million. We ended the year in excellent financial shape with $252 million of cash, an additional $434 million available under our line of credit.

We reported  fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. This includes an $0.08 per share charge on the early retirement of debt. Excluding this charge, earnings were $0.45 a share and within our guidance range of $0.40 to $0.47.In the Nor",1123,"Thanks, Rick. We reported  fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. This includes an $0.08 per share charge on the early retirement of debt. Excluding this charge, earnings were $0.45 a share and within our guidance range of $0.40 to $0.47.
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $1 million operating profit, down from the third quarter's $5 million profit. As planned, harvest volumes during the fourth quarter were 13% lower than those of the third quarter. The lower harvest volumes drove most of the decline in operating profit. 
Our average Northern sawlog prices were weaker than we initially expected, up about 6%, or about $4 per ton from the third quarter. Prices for softwood sawlogs in the Northwest drifted down through November and started recovering in December. Western sawmills have increased production in response to strengthening offshore lumber demand, particularly from China.  Fourth quarter lumber production in the West Coast was up 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
Additionally, export log volumes to China from West Coast ports increased significantly. Northern pulpwood prices held steady at $39 per ton during the fourth quarter. Customer demand was good and prices remained attractive. 
Northwest log prices continued to improve in January, driven by higher lumber production aimed at export markets, coupled with growth in export log demand. We expect to export 7% of our Oregon sawlogs to China in the first quarter, compared to only nominal volumes in the fourth quarter.
We expect our average Northern segment sawlog prices to increase $3 per ton from the fourth quarter's level. In aggregate, we expect higher sawlog prices, slightly lower pulpwood prices and fairly stable volumes compared to the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect our northern sawlog harvest volumes and mix to be similar to 2010, about 4 million tons, with 55% sawlogs and 45% pulpwood mix.
Turning to our Southern Resource segment. Our fourth quarter operating profit was $28 million, up $3 million from the third quarter's $25 million profit. The increase in operating profit was primarily a function of higher sawlog harvest volumes. Prices for sawlogs and pulpwood both declined 3% to 4% as favorable logging conditions, caused by unseasonably dry weather, kept customer mills well-supplied across the south. Pulpwood demand from pulp and paper customers remained strong, and pulpwood prices remained attractive by historic standards. We expect southern lumber production to increase during the first quarter, as a handful of mills in our operating areas have reopened or are increasing production. 
However, logging conditions remained favorable across the South, and mills are in relatively good shape from an inventory standpoint. As a result, we expect first quarter southern sawlog and pulpwood prices to hold at fourth quarter levels. We expect our first quarter harvest will be approximately 200,000 tons lower than the first quarter of last year, as we anticipate there will be better pricing opportunities as the year progresses.
The reductions are split evenly between sawlogs and pulpwood. We expect the overall southern harvest in 2011 to be similar to 2010's level, about 11.4 million tons. We expect our 2010 southern harvest mix will be similar to the 2010 mix, roughly 45% sawlogs and 55% pulpwood. 
As mills expand production in 2011, we expect existing contractor capacity may become a gating item that limits log supplies. However, Plum Creek is an excellent position to respond to market opportunities when and where they arise, as we have a solid base of established contractors. As always, we will continue to adjust our harvest plans in response to market conditions, deferring harvest in weaker markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $155 million and operating profit of $73 million for the fourth quarter. The final phase of the Montana conservation sale contributed $89 million to revenue and $37 million to operating profit. The balance of the fourth quarter revenue and income came from the sale of roughly 16,000 of recreation and higher and better use land at an average price of $2,000 per acre. About 2/3 of the acres sold during the quarter came from lower-value regions of the Gulf South and the Lake States. 
Small nonstrategic land sales also contributed to the quarter's performance, with about 21,000 acres selling at an average price of $1,000 per acre. These lands are almost exclusively lower-productivity properties scattered across the South.
In addition to the final phase of the Montana conservation sale, we completed the sale of 8,200 acres of conservation land at an average value of $1,000 per acre. Individuals and family buyers remain cautious and value-oriented. Rural land markets were a bit better in 2010 than in 2009, and we expect an increase in interest and activity levels as the economy continues to recover. We expect 2011 Real Estate segment revenues between $250 million and $300 million. We expect to see a typical seasonal pattern in this segment, with the second half of the year stronger than the first half. For the year, we estimate land bases will be approximately 30% of segment revenue.
We expect first quarter Real Estate revenues to be between $50 million and $60 million. We estimate land bases will be approximately 30% of revenue for the first quarter. 
The Manufacturing segment reported a $3 million profit during the fourth quarter, down $4 million from the third quarter's $7 million profit. This was better than we initially expected, due to stronger lumber prices. Our average lumber price increased 5% compared to the third quarter, while our lumber sales volumes declined about 7% to typical seasonal decline. Our plywood and MDF prices declined 4% to 5%, while their sales volumes declined seasonally as well, both down about 18%.
As mentioned in our press release, we expect the Manufacturing segment to earn between $15 million and $20 million in 2011, a bit less than 2010. We expect underlying business conditions to improve gradually, but we are not counting on a repeat of the dramatic spring 2010 lumber inventory cycle or the tightness in global MDF markets caused by the Chilean earthquake last year. However, growing domestic demand, combined with incremental export demand, could provide stronger-than-expected lumber prices.
Rick reviewed our fourth quarter refinancing activities earlier. After considering the effect of these transactions, we expect our 2011 third party interest expense to be essentially flat with 2010 to approximately $81 million. Lower Manufacturing segment results should result in a small tax benefit in 2011, less than $5 million. In all, we expect 2011 income from continuing operations to be between $1.20 and $1.45 per share, with the first quarter results between $0.20 and $0.25 per share. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

Business conditions appear to be improving, albeit slowly, in each of our businesses. Lumber prices have been moving up over the past few months. We believe good production discipline on the part of lumber manufacturers, combined with growing export demand, is the primary driver of these improved prices. 
Today, West Coast export log volumes are relatively small. However, they are growing rapidly in excellent long-term growth prospects. 
In 2010, we started to see lumber production, the key driver for sawlogs, begin to recover from its lows. Regional lumber production data shows the relationship between lumber production and sawlog prices. On the West Coast, lumber production was up 33% compared to 2009. These markets also showed the strongest price movement for sawlogs, with our average price increasing 18% from 2009. In the U.S. South, where lumber production was only slightly above that of 2009, our average sawlog prices increased only about 2%. 
We have planned for 2011 conservatively. We assume a fairly muted housing recovery, with residential construction activity growing from a 590,000 start level of the past year to about 680,000 starts in 2011. We also believe that increasing consumer confidence should lead to improved lumber demand from the repair and remodel sector. 
The earnings outlook that we shared with you today assumes this slow improvement demand over the coming months. However, with modest improvements in domestic demand, coupled with growing export demand, we could see a stronger price environment. 
As David outlined, our 2011 harvest plans are very similar, in terms of both volume and mix, to those of the prior year. We plan to keep the harvest of our most valuable sawlogs low. Of course, we have the option of bringing more volume to the market, should log values return to attractive levels. And we are in excellent position to benefit from any temporary market dislocations that may occur. 
In our Real Estate segment, we will concentrate on capturing attractive prices for lower-value properties, holding our most valuable lands for the future. We will continue to keep a close eye on our costs at the same time. 
We continue to manage the company for long-term value creation. Disciplined investment and improving the growth and yield of our forests remains a top priority. During 2011, we are planning capital expenditures between $75 million and $80 million. Reforestation makes up the bulk of our $35 million of maintenance capital. We expect to plant about 60 million trees this year. The remaining capital is discretionary investment, primarily advanced silviculture treatments aimed at boosting the productivity of our forests.
Looking at the bigger picture, I remain as enthused about the prospects for Plum Creek and the fundamentals of the timber business as I ever have been. We have talked about the structural changes that are taking place in North American timber markets, and we are beginning to see some of their impacts today. Certainly, the change that has grabbed the most attention over the past six months has been the impact of Chinese demand on the North American lumber and log markets. West Coast log markets are benefiting from the increased competition for logs. We are seeing increased demand for logs, as lumber producers in the region boost production to serve Chinese demand. There's also growing competition from buyers of logs for the export market. Currently, the impact on log markets is region-specific and limited to the West Coast. However, continued export growth has the potential to impact North American markets more broadly. British Columbia has grown its trade relationship with the Chinese, with lumber shipments to China growing sevenfold over the past three years. It is estimated that Chinese exports accounted for 20% of British Columbia's lumber production in the second half of 2010. That's roughly 5% of North American lumber demand.
Disciplined capital allocation remains our top priority. We completed our refinancing activities over the past quarter, are in an excellent shape in both terms of our capital structure, liquidity and debt maturity schedules. We continue to evaluate the best uses for the excess cash we generate, searching out the best-value outcome for our shareholders. 
Now we'll be glad to take your questions."

We represent such a small portion of total timber supply. If you look at the U.S. South, 80% of wood fiber there is owned by small nonindustrials who are not necessarily acting the same way. So there's not as much inventory on the sidelines, as one might think, that's not been cut. But setting that aside, you make a really good point. Because on the demand side, with the whole situation in B.C., and we're starting to see the impact of that, with B.C. increasingly serving the Chinese market, with the Chinese on the West Coast market, so there's new demand sources and there's going to be a shrinkage of supply out of B.C., which is going to require that more of the lumber production ultimately come from the United States, especially as markets recover. And the other thing that you've heard us talk about is this whole energy opportunity, be it biomass or renewable energy. And it's a little slow on the take here. But eventually it's going to have an impact, we believe, on the marketplace, and that'll impact pulpwood. And at the same time, and David mentioned in his comments, is, really, we think one of the governor on this engine of timber supply is contractor capacity. And I can't even overstate how significant an impact that's going to have as this market recovers. If you look at production being down 20% to 30% in the U.S. South, that means 20% to 30% of the contractors have been out of business for two or three years, and many of them will not be back. So as we see demand improve, it's going to be very hard to get that product back to market, and that's the governor on that engine. That's why we believe we'll see more price impact from a recovery than we might expect otherwise."

297268,117868715,97458,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Jan 31, 2011",2011-01-31,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Good afternoon and Happy New Year. Despite a challenging economic environment, with near-record unemployment and a very weak housing market, Plum Creek had a good year in 2010. Performance in our timber resource segments, our Manufacturing segment and our",612,"Good afternoon and Happy New Year. Despite a challenging economic environment, with near-record unemployment and a very weak housing market, Plum Creek had a good year in 2010. Performance in our timber resource segments, our Manufacturing segment and our non-timber resource businesses all improved in 2010, as we were able to take advantage of marketplace anomalies. 
During the first half of the year, unusually wet weather in the South and inventory restocking of both log yards and the finished products supply chain helped boost prices and income in our timber resource and Manufacturing businesses. In addition, we were able to take advantage of the disruption in medium density fiberboard and plywood markets caused by the Chilean earthquake to incrementally add to our Manufacturing earnings.
In our Real Estate segment, we completed the final phase of our three-year Montana conservation transaction. While total real estate income declined $98 million from 2009, all of the reduction is due to the smaller size of the final phase of the Montana conservation transaction. Income from the final phase was $125 million lower than the phase completed in 2009. We continue to hold our most valuable real estate, in such states as Florida and Georgia, off the market. We'll patiently wait for the value of these properties to rebound when the overall real estate market recovers.
Throughout 2010, we continued to manage our assets with an eye on long-term value. We invested $71 million in our businesses, using $65 million to replant trees and improve forest productivity, which will increase the future harvest and cash flow from this asset. Given weak markets and continued depressed prices for our sawlogs, we reduced our sawlog harvest more than 500,000 tons from our initial plans. Although this decision impacted our cash flow and earnings for 2010, it also allows us to plant and harvest these trees in the future and capture significantly more values as markets and prices recover.
We also focused on strengthening our investment-grade balance sheet by refinancing upcoming debt maturities at attractive rates. During the year, we reduced our total debt by nearly $100 million, and in November, completed a $575 million 10-year bond offering at 4.7%. We used the proceeds from this attractively priced offering to prepay $213 million of notes maturing in 2011. The average coupon on the notes retired was 7.71%. In addition, we prepaid in full a $250 million term credit agreement scheduled to mature in 2012. The remaining $94 million of 2011 debt maturities will be funded with our line of credit. Both Moody's and S&P reaffirmed our investment-grade credit rating and upgraded our outlook to positive during the course of the year.
We also renewed our line of credit for $600 million at favorable rates, which provides the company with ample liquidity. We continue to manage our portfolio of timberlands, selling some nonstrategic lands at attractive prices and using the proceeds to repurchase our stock at attractive values. During 2010, we sold 24,000 acres, that generated marginal cash flow, for $32 million. We used the proceeds to repurchase 1.4 million shares of our common stock at $36.37 per share. Over the last five years, we've repurchased $24 million shares, or 13% of our shares, at compelling values in attractive long-term investment and are saving $40 million annually in dividends in attractive short-term investment.
Importantly, our cash flow from operations was $449 million, which more than covered our annual dividend payment of $272 million. We ended the year in excellent financial shape with $252 million of cash, an additional $434 million available under our line of credit. 
David will now review our fourth quarter results and discuss our outlook for 2011. David?"

We reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.37 per share. This includes an $0.08 per share charge on the early retirement of debt.

This includes an $0.08 per share charge on the early retirement of debt. Excluding this charge, earnings were $0.45 a share and within our guidance range of $0.40 to $0.47.
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $1 million operating profit, down from the third quarter's $5 million profit. As planned, harvest volumes during the fourth quarter were 13% lower than those of the third quarter. The lower harvest volumes drove most of the decline in operating profit. 
Our average Northern sawlog prices were weaker than we initially expected, off about 6%, or about $4 per ton from the third quarter. Prices for softwood sawlogs in the Northwest drifted down through November and started recovering in December. Western sawmills have increased production in response to strengthening offshore lumber demand, particularly from China.  Fourth quarter lumber production in the West Coast was up 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.
Additionally, export log volumes to China from West Coast ports increased significantly. Northern pulpwood prices held steady at $39 per ton during the fourth quarter. Customer demand was good and prices remained attractive. 
Northwest log prices continued to improve in January, driven by higher lumber production aimed at export markets, coupled with growth in export log demand. We expect to export 7% of our Oregon sawlogs to China in the first quarter, compared to only nominal volumes in the fourth quarter.
We expect our average Northern segment sawlog prices to increase $3 per ton from the fourth quarter's level. In aggregate, we expect higher sawlog prices, slightly lower pulpwood prices and fairly stable volumes compared to the fourth quarter. For the full year, we expect our northern sawlog harvest volumes and mix to be similar to 2010, about 4 million tons, with 55% sawlogs and 45% pulpwood mix.
Turning to our Southern Resource segment. Our fourth quarter operating profit was $28 million, up $3 million from the third quarter's $25 million profit. The increase in operating profit was primarily a function of higher sawlog harvest volumes. Prices for sawlogs and pulpwood both declined 3% to 4% as favorable logging conditions, caused by unseasonably dry weather, kept customer mills well-supplied across the south. Pulpwood demand from pulp and paper customers remained strong, and pulpwood prices remained attractive by historic standards. We expect southern lumber production to increase during the first quarter, as a handful of mills in our operating areas have reopened or are increasing production. 
However, logging conditions remained favorable across the South, and mills are in relatively good shape from an inventory standpoint. As a result, we expect first quarter southern sawlog and pulpwood prices to hold at fourth quarter levels. We expect our first quarter harvest will be approximately 200,000 tons lower than the first quarter of last year, as we anticipate there will be better pricing opportunities as the year progresses.
The reductions are split evenly between sawlogs and pulpwood. We expect the overall southern harvest in 2011 to be similar to 2010's level, about 11.4 million tons. We expect our 2010 southern harvest mix will be similar to the 2010 mix, roughly 45% sawlogs and 55% pulpwood. 
As mills expand production in 2011, we expect existing contractor capacity may become a gating item that limits log supplies. However, Plum Creek is an excellent position to respond to market opportunities when and where they arise, as we have a solid base of established contractors. As always, we will continue to adjust our harvest plans in response to market conditions, deferring harvest in weaker markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $155 million and operating profit of $73 million for the fourth quarter. The final phase of the Montana conservation sale contributed $89 million to revenue and $37 million to operating profit. The balance of the fourth quarter revenue and income came from the sale of roughly 16,000 of recreation and higher and better use land at an average price of $2,000 per acre. About 2/3 of the acres sold during the quarter came from lower-value regions of the Gulf South and the Lake States. 
Small nonstrategic land sales also contributed to the quarter's performance, with about 21,000 acres selling at an average price of $1,000 per acre. These lands are almost exclusively lower-productivity properties scattered across the South.
In addition to the final phase of the Montana conservation sale, we completed the sale of 8,200 acres of conservation land at an average value of $1,000 per acre. Individuals and family buyers remain cautious and value-oriented. Rural land markets were a bit better in 2010 than in 2009, and we expect an increase in interest and activity levels as the economy continues to recover. We expect 2011 Real Estate segment revenues between $250 million and $300 million. We expect to see a typical seasonal pattern in this segment, with the second half of the year stronger than the first half. For the year, we estimate land bases will be approximately 30% of segment revenue.
We expect first quarter Real Estate revenues to be between $50 million and $60 million. We estimate land bases will be approximately 30% of revenue for the first quarter. 
The Manufacturing segment reported a $3 million profit during the fourth quarter, down $4 million from the third quarter's $7 million profit. This was better than we initially expected, due to stronger lumber prices. Our average lumber price increased 5% compared to the third quarter, while our lumber sales volumes declined about 7%, a typical seasonal decline. Our plywood and MDF prices declined 4% to 5%, while their sales volumes declined seasonally as well, both down about 18%.
As mentioned in our press release, we expect the Manufacturing segment to earn between $15 million and $20 million in 2011, a bit less than 2010. We expect underlying business conditions to improve gradually, but we are not counting on a repeat of the dramatic spring 2010 lumber inventory cycle or the tightness in global MDF markets caused by the Chilean earthquake last year. However, growing domestic demand, combined with incremental export demand, could provide stronger-than-expected lumber prices.
Rick reviewed our fourth quarter refinancing activities earlier. After considering the effect of these transactions, we expect our 2011 third- party interest expense to be essentially flat with 2010 at approximately $81 million. Lower Manufacturing segment results should result in a small tax benefit in 2011, less than $5 million. In all, we expect 2011 income from continuing operations to be between $1.20 and $1.45 per share, with the first quarter results between $0.20 and $0.25 per share. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

Business conditions appear to be improving, albeit slowly, in each of our businesses. Lumber prices have been moving up over the past few months. We believe good production discipline on the part of lumber manufacturers, combined with growing export demand, is the primary driver of these improved prices. 
Today, West Coast export log volumes are relatively small. However, they are growing rapidly and excellent long-term growth prospects. 
In 2010, we started to see lumber production, the key driver for sawlogs, begin to recover from its lows. Regional lumber production data shows the relationship between lumber production and sawlog prices. On the West Coast, lumber production was up 33% compared to 2009. These markets also showed the strongest price movement for sawlogs, with our average price increasing 18% from 2009. In the U.S. South, where lumber production was only slightly above that of 2009, our average sawlog prices increased only about 2%. 
We have planned for 2011 conservatively. We assume a fairly muted housing recovery, with residential construction activity growing from a 590,000 start level of the past year to about 680,000 starts in 2011. We also believe that increasing consumer confidence should lead to improved lumber demand from the repair and remodel sector. 
The earnings outlook that we shared with you today assumes this slow improvement in demand over the coming months. However, with modest improvements in domestic demand, coupled with growing export demand, we could see a stronger price environment. 
As David outlined, our 2011 harvest plans are very similar, in terms of both volume and mix, to those of the prior year. We plan to keep the harvest of our most valuable sawlogs low. Of course, we have the option of bringing more volume to the market, should log values return to attractive levels. And we are in excellent position to benefit from any temporary market dislocations that may occur. 
In our Real Estate segment, we will concentrate on capturing attractive prices for lower-value properties, holding our most valuable lands for the future. We will continue to keep a close eye on our costs at the same time. 
We continue to manage the company for long-term value creation. Disciplined investment and improving the growth and yield of our forests remains a top priority. During 2011, we are planning capital expenditures between $75 million and $80 million. Reforestation makes up the bulk of our $35 million of maintenance capital. We expect to plant about 60 million trees this year. The remaining capital is discretionary investment, primarily advanced silviculture treatments aimed at boosting the productivity of our forests.
Looking at the bigger picture, I remain as enthused about the prospects for Plum Creek and the fundamentals of the timber business as I ever have been. We have talked about the structural changes that are taking place in North American timber markets, and we are beginning to see some of their impacts today. Certainly, the change that has grabbed the most attention over the past six months has been the impact of Chinese demand on the North American lumber and log markets. West Coast log markets are benefiting from the increased competition for logs. We are seeing increased demand for logs, as lumber producers in the region boost production to serve Chinese demand. There's also growing competition from buyers of logs for the export market. Currently, the impact on log markets is region-specific and limited to the West Coast. However, continued export growth has the potential to impact North American markets more broadly. British Columbia has grown its trade relationship with the Chinese, with lumber shipments to China growing sevenfold over the past three years. It is estimated that Chinese exports accounted for 20% of British Columbia's lumber production in the second half of 2010. That's roughly 5% of North American lumber demand.
Disciplined capital allocation remains our top priority. We completed our refinancing activities over the past quarter, are in an excellent shape in both terms of our capital structure, liquidity and debt maturity schedules. We continue to evaluate the best uses for the excess cash we generate, searching out the best-value outcome for our shareholders. 
Now we'll be glad to take your questions."

So there's not as much inventory on the sidelines, as one might think, that's not been cut. But setting that aside, you make a really good point. Because on the demand side, with the whole situation in B.C., and we're starting to see the impact of that, with B.C. increasingly serving the Chinese market, with the Chinese on the West Coast market, so there's new demand sources and there's going to be a shrinkage of supply out of B.C., which is going to require that more of the lumber production ultimately come from the United States, especially as markets recover. And the other thing that you've heard us talk about is this whole energy opportunity, be it biomass or renewable energy. And it's a little slow on the take here. But eventually it's going to have an impact, we believe, on the marketplace, and that'll impact pulpwood. And at the same time, and David mentioned in his comments, is, really, we think one of the governor on this engine of timber supply is contractor capacity. And I can't even overstate how significant of an impact that's going to have as this market recovers. If you look at production being down 20% to 30% in the U.S. South, that means 20% to 30% of the contractors have been out of business for two or three years, and many of them will not be back. So as we see demand improve, it's going to be very hard to get that product back to market, and that's the governor on that engine. That's why we believe we'll see more price impact from a recovery than we might expect otherwise."

Over 90% of that is coming from Canada. If you look at the run rate just in kind of the fourth quarter, they're kind of importing at a 3 billion board foot level. So they're already greater than 5% of what North American production capacity is at this point. Their growth trends, which show them needing to almost grow by 50% over the next five to six years their total level of imports -- and so we think that this could be a very big opportunity. I'm somewhat surprised that it's manifested itself this quickly and rapidly. And it's starting to have an impact. But you still have to remember that sawmills here in North America are running closer to 60% of capacity. Housing's still awful. What I want to do is fast-forward in my mind five years, when we don't have the timber supply out of British Columbia, mills are running at full or capacity, the U.S. dollar remains relatively weak compared to where it was in the last cycle. I can see much higher lumber prices and very vibrant log markets in that scenario."

The first quarters of 2011 and 2010 have really highlighted the local nature of the timber business. Looking back at last year, we saw very strong log markets from our pulpwood and sawlogs in the U.S. South, while at the same time, we experienced weak markets in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Oregon where sawlog prices were down. This year, the situation is completely the opposite, with stronger markets in the Pacific Northwest and weaker markets in the South. 
A geographically diverse timberland portfolio is an advantage. It reduces risks and enhances our operational flexibility. Having such a regionally-diverse asset base is showing us value and has given us flexibility. Through the depths of the economic downturn, we had no liquidity issues. We had a strong balance sheet, we maintained an investment-grade credit rating and we maintained our commitments to our shareholders. We emerged from this period with a stronger balance sheet, a more productive timberland portfolio, lower SG&A cost and lower annual cash obligations. We believe the worst is behind us, but it remains a tough operating environment. 
As I said in my letter to shareholders this year, I feel more optimistic about this company, our position and our future opportunities than ever before. As we look at the recovery, we couldn't be happier with how we are positioned to benefit. 
Our harvest is growing over the long term in both terms of volume and value. This is the foundation for our sustainable long-term cash flow growth. With residential construction running at approximately 1/3 of the nation's demographic needs, pent-up demand for housing is growing. 
Sawlog prices will recover as lumber and wood product demand improves. The current market conditions for softwood and sawlogs in the Pacific Northwest are a witness to that. The structural shifts playing out in the North American market, growing Chinese demand, Canadian harvest reductions and renewable energy demand will further improve log and timberland values. 
Some of these factors are impacting markets today. Others will take a few years to fully develop. These changes will occur and form the basis of our outlook and the excitement we have for our assets and our company. David will now review our first quarter results and discuss with you the outlook for the second quarter. David?"
297268,129487080,117264,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2011",2011-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick. We reported first quarter earnings of $0.23 per share, within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share. Examining our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. The Northern Resources and Manufacturing",1145,"Thanks, Rick. We reported first quarter earnings of $0.23 per share, within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share. Examining our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. 
The Northern Resources and Manufacturing segment results were better than we had anticipated, while the Southern Resources segment was weaker than we had expected. The Real Estate segment performed as anticipated. 
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $7 million profit, $3 million higher than the fourth quarter. The improved results were driven by higher sawlog prices in the Pacific Northwest and seasonally higher hardwood harvest volumes in the northeast. Our average Northern sawlog prices increased $7 per ton or about 11% during the quarter. Market prices in the Pacific Northwest continued to improve, with softwood sawlog prices in the region up 15% quarter-over-quarter and up 40% from the trough levels in the first half of 2009. 
Pacific Northwest sawlog supplies remain tight as landowners continue to restrict harvest and China exporters compete for logs. Hardwood sawlog prices in the Northeast and Lake States remain stable at attractive levels. The strength in hardwood sawlogs has been driven more by scarcity within our operating areas than by any significant increase in demand. Northern Segment pulpwood prices improved modestly, up $1 per ton during the first quarter and good demand from customers in New England and the Lake States. Softwood sawlog pricing in the West should continue to advance in the second quarter as mills compete against strong export demand in the Northwest and spring break-up limits timberland supply in the Northeast and Rockies. We expect Northern sawlog prices to continue to improve with average prices up $4 per ton during the second quarter. We expect our average Northern pulpwood prices to be stable during the second quarter. 
In the Northern Resources segment, harvest declined seasonally in the second quarter to their lowest levels of the year, as falling spring weather limits timberland accessibility. We expect our second quarter harvest will be between 800,000 and 850,000 tons, similar to the harvest level at the second quarter of 2010. However, unlike 2010, we expect the harvest decline to come from pulpwood as we plan to maintain our harvest levels in Oregon to serve an attractive export market. 
Turning to our Southern Resources segment. Our first quarter operating profit was $19 million, down $9 million from the fourth quarter's $28 million profit. The decline in operating profit was due to a combination of lower harvest volumes and lower sawlog prices. An unusually dry weather pattern allowed easy access to timberlands for most of the quarter, allowing both sawlog and pulpwood customers to easily maintain their log inventories. 
We reduced our sawlog harvest volume about 130,000 tons or 9% from the fourth quarter level. Sawlog prices declined between 4% and 10% depending on the region within the South. We did find a couple of attractive spot market opportunities to sell small diameter sawlogs during the quarter. As a result, we harvested about 100,000 tons more sawlogs than we initially expected, all of it in the less valuable smaller diameter sawlog class. So our mix shifted within the sawlog category to lower-value trees, and our average sawlog stumpage price declined $3 per ton or 10% from the fourth quarter level. We expect Southern sawlog prices to remain muted during the next quarter but expect them to rebound in the second half of the year as we get into a typical wet weather pattern in contrast to this abnormally dry period we have experienced. 
The pulpwood harvest was approximately 300,000 tons or 17% lower than during the fourth quarter level, and core pulpwood prices were generally stable during the quarter and we expect them to remain stable during the second quarter. 
We are planning on holding our southern harvest fairly steady during the second quarter. However, we will shift the mix away from sawlogs and more towards pulpwood. We expect to reduce our sawlog harvest between 50,000 and 100,000 tons and increase our southern pulpwood harvest by a similar amount. As always, we will continue to adjust our harvest plan in response to market conditions, deferring harvest in weaker markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $62 million and operating income of $38 million for the first quarter, just beyond the high end of our initial expectations. The first quarter results included a $43 million sale of large nonstrategic land in northern Mississippi that captured a little over $1,400 per acre. The sales price reflects the specific stocking level and age of the timber on this property and is consistent with our view that the average Southern Core timberlands are valued in today's market at approximately $1,500 to $1,600 per acre. 
The balance of the sales consisted of approximately 2,500 acres of small, nonstrategic lands at an average price of just over $1,000 per acre and nearly 8,000 acres of recreational lands at an average price of $2,100 per acre. We also completed 335 acres of conservation sales at an average price of nearly $1,700 per acre. The prices we received in the first quarter are broadly consistent with the values we've captured within each category over the past several quarters. 
Interest and activity in real land markets has continued to improve, and we see some early signs of recovery in some of the higher-valued regions like Georgia and Florida. The relatively lower-valued regions of the Lake States and Gulf South continue to be the most active, while activity in Montana remains quite low. 
We expect second quarter real estate revenues to be between $65 million and $75 million. We expect land bases to be approximately 30% of revenue in the second quarter. We continue to expect full year 2011 Real Estate segment revenues to be between $250 million and $300 million.
The Manufacturing segment continued to perform well, reporting a $4 million operating profit in the first quarter, up $1 million from the fourth quarter last year. Both our plywood and MDF businesses are experiencing improved demand from industrial and commercial market sectors that we serve. Sales volumes increase reflect an improved demand for concrete forms, truck doors, recreational vehicles and furniture and store fixtures. Our sales price has also increased in lumber and MDF, while our plywood prices held steady. We expect second quarter performance in manufacturing to be similar to the first quarters. 
Looking at below the line, we expect not much change on our interest expense during the second quarter, and we expect to have a modest tax expense. In all, we expect our second quarter income from continuing operations to be between $0.25 and $0.30 per share and continue to expect to report full year earnings between $1.25 and $1.45 per share. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

The devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan is certainly a great strategy for the people of that strong nation. Shortly after the news, the Plum Creek Foundation made a $25,000 donation to relief efforts in Japan, in addition to matching individual employee contributions to relief efforts. The Japanese are very resilient as a people and very industrious. They have an affinity for wood and wood-based construction. They will need lumber and wood panel products as they rebuild from this tragedy. Our experience with other natural disasters tells us that rebuilding will take time and will be spread out over a few years. So we would expect to see more activity in North American exports of logs and wood products to Japan over the next 2 to 3 years as a result. 
However, Chinese demand remains robust, and as we saw sawlog prices in Oregon rise 18% since the end of March, we have shipped 7%, around 15,000 tons of our Oregon harvest volume to China in the first quarter. We expect to grow that to greater than 20% of our volume in the second and third quarters of this year. 
Overall, we feel pretty good about 2011, as well as 2012 and '13 as we look ahead. We are well positioned and have excellent operational and financial flexibility. Moody's recent upgrade of our bonds to Baa2 underscores our financial health. March 22, we held and Analyst Morning in New York City and reviewed in some detail our long-term outlook for each of our businesses and provided some analysis on a handful of the structural changes that are taking place in our industry. These changes come in reductions in Canadian timber harvest, increased offshore demand for logs and lumber from emerging markets and increased global demand for biomass sourced energy will all have a significant, positive impact on the value of our asset base and future cash flows.

The first quarters of 2011 and 2010 have really highlighted the local nature of the timber business. Looking back at last year, we saw very strong log markets from our pulpwood and sawlogs in the U.S. South, while at the same time, we experienced weak markets in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Oregon where sawlog prices were down. This year, the situation is completely the opposite, with stronger markets in the Pacific Northwest and weaker markets in the South. 
A geographically diverse timberland portfolio is an advantage. It reduces risks and enhances our operational flexibility. Having such a regionally diverse asset base is showing us value and has given us flexibility. Through the depths of the economic downturn, we had no liquidity issues. We had a strong balance sheet, we maintained an investment-grade credit rating and we maintained our commitments to our shareholders. We've emerged from this period with a stronger balance sheet, a more productive timberland portfolio, lower SG&A cost and lower annual cash obligations. We believe the worst is behind us, but it remains a tough operating environment. 
As I said in my letter to shareholders this year, I feel more optimistic about this company, our position and our future opportunities than ever before. As we look at the recovery, we couldn't be happier with how we are positioned to benefit. 
Our harvest is growing over the long term in both terms of volume and value. This is the foundation for our sustainable long-term cash flow growth. With residential construction running at approximately 1/3 of the nation's demographic needs, pent-up demand for housing is growing. 
Sawlog prices will recover as lumber and wood product demand improves. The current market conditions for softwood and sawlogs in the Pacific Northwest are a witness to that. The structural shifts playing out in the North American market, growing Chinese demand, Canadian harvest reductions and renewable energy demand will further improve log and timberland values. 
Some of these factors are impacting markets today. Others will take a few years to fully develop. These changes will occur and form the basis of our outlook and the excitement we have for our assets and our company. David will now review our first quarter results and discuss with you the outlook for the second quarter. David?"
297268,129487080,117277,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Apr 25, 2011",2011-04-25,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick. We reported first quarter earnings of $0.23 per share, within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share. Examining our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. The Northern Resources and Manufacturing",1149,"Thanks, Rick. We reported first quarter earnings of $0.23 per share, within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share. Examining our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. 
The Northern Resources and Manufacturing segment results were better than we had anticipated, while the Southern Resources segment was weaker than we had expected. The Real Estate segment performed as anticipated. 
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $7 million profit, $3 million higher than the fourth quarter. The improved results were driven by higher sawlog prices in the Pacific Northwest and seasonally higher hardwood harvest volumes in the northeast. Our average Northern sawlog prices increased $7 per ton or about 11% during the quarter. Market prices in the Pacific Northwest continued to improve, with softwood sawlog prices in the region up 15% quarter-over-quarter and up 40% from the trough levels in the first half of 2009. 
Pacific Northwest sawlog supplies remain tight as landowners continue to restrict harvest and China exporters compete for logs. Hardwood sawlog prices in the Northeast and Lake States remain stable at attractive levels. The strength in hardwood sawlogs has been driven more by scarcity within our operating areas than by any significant increase in demand. Northern Segment pulpwood prices improved modestly, up $1 per ton during the first quarter and good demand from customers in New England and the Lake States. Softwood sawlog pricing in the West should continue to advance in the second quarter as mills compete against strong export demand in the Northwest and spring break-up limits timberland supply in the Northeast and Rockies. We expect Northern sawlog prices to continue to improve with average prices up $4 per ton during the second quarter. We expect our average Northern pulpwood prices to be stable during the second quarter. 
In the Northern Resources segment, harvest declined seasonally in the second quarter to their lowest levels of the year, as thawing spring weather limits timberland accessibility. We expect our second quarter harvest will be between 800,000 and 850,000 tons, similar to the harvest level at the second quarter of 2010. However, unlike 2010, we expect the harvest decline to come from pulpwood as we plan to maintain our harvest levels in Oregon to serve an attractive export market. 
Turning to our Southern Resources segment. Our first quarter operating profit was $19 million, down $9 million from the fourth quarter's $28 million profit. The decline in operating profit was due to a combination of lower harvest volumes and lower sawlog prices. An unusually dry weather pattern allowed easy access to timberlands for most of the quarter, allowing both sawlog and pulpwood customers to easily maintain their log inventories. 
We reduced our sawlog harvest volume about 130,000 tons or 9% from the fourth quarter level. Sawlog prices declined between 4% and 10% depending on the region within the South. We did find a couple of attractive spot market opportunities to sell small-diameter sawlogs during the quarter. As a result, we harvested about 100,000 tons more sawlogs than we initially expected, all of it in the less valuable smaller diameter sawlog class. So our mix shifted within the sawlog category to lower-value trees, and our average sawlog stumpage price declined $2 per ton or 10% from the fourth quarter level. We expect Southern sawlog prices to remain muted during the next quarter, but expect them to rebound in the second half of the year as we get into a typical wet weather pattern in contrast to this abnormally dry period we have experienced. 
The pulpwood harvest was approximately 300,000 tons or 17% lower than during the fourth quarter level, and core pulpwood prices were generally stable during the quarter and we expect them to remain stable during the second quarter. 
We are planning on holding our Southern harvest fairly steady during the second quarter. However, we will shift the mix away from sawlogs and more towards pulpwood. We expect to reduce our sawlog harvest between 50,000 and 100,000 tons and increase our Southern pulpwood harvest by a similar amount. As always, we will continue to adjust our harvest plan in response to market conditions, deferring harvest in weaker markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $62 million and operating income of $38 million for the first quarter, just beyond the high end of our initial expectations. The first quarter results included a $43 million sale of large nonstrategic land in Northern Mississippi that captured a little over $1,400 per acre. The sales price reflects the specific stocking level and age of the timber on this property and is consistent with our view that the average Southern Core Timberlands are valued in today's market at approximately $1,500 to $1,600 per acre. 
The balance of the sales consisted of approximately 2,500 acres of small, nonstrategic lands at an average price of just over $1,000 per acre and nearly 8,000 acres of recreational lands at an average price of $2,100 per acre. We also completed 335 acres of conservation sales at an average price of nearly $1,700 per acre. The prices we received in the first quarter are broadly consistent with the values we've captured within each category over the past several quarters. 
Interest and activity in real land markets has continued to improve, and we see some early signs of recovery in some of the higher-valued regions like Georgia and Florida. The relatively lower-valued regions of the Lake States and Gulf South to be the most -- continue to be the most active, while activity in Montana remains quite low. 
We expect second quarter real estate revenues to be between $65 million and $75 million. We expect land bases to be approximately 30% of revenue in the second quarter. We continue to expect full year 2011 Real Estate segment revenues to be between $250 million and $300 million.
The Manufacturing segment continued to perform well, reporting a $4 million operating profit in the first quarter, up $1 million from the fourth quarter last year. Both our plywood and MDF businesses are experiencing improved demand from industrial and commercial market sectors that we serve. Sales volumes increase reflect an improved demand for concrete forms, truck doors, recreational vehicles and furniture and store fixtures. Our sales price has also increased in lumber and MDF, while our plywood prices held steady. We expect second quarter performance in Manufacturing to be similar to the first quarters. 
Looking at below the line, we expect not much change on our interest expense during the second quarter, and we expect to have a modest tax expense. In all, we expect our second quarter income from continuing operations to be between $0.25 and $0.30 per share and continue to expect to report full year earnings between $1.25 and $1.45 per share. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

The devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan is certainly a great tragedy for the people of that strong nation. Shortly after the news, the Plum Creek Foundation made a $25,000 donation to relief efforts in Japan, in addition to matching individual employee contributions to relief efforts. The Japanese are very resilient as a people and very industrious. They have an affinity for wood and wood-based construction. They will need lumber and wood panel products as they rebuild from this tragedy. Our experience with other natural disasters tells us that rebuilding will take time and will be spread out over a few years. So we would expect to see more activity in North American exports of logs and wood products to Japan over the next 2 to 3 years as a result. 
However, Chinese demand remains robust, and as we saw sawlog prices in Oregon rise 18% since the end of March, we have shipped 7%, around 15,000 tons of our Oregon harvest volume to China in the first quarter. We expect to grow that to greater than 20% of our volume in the second and third quarters of this year. 
Overall, we feel pretty good about 2011, as well as 2012 and '13 as we look ahead. We are well positioned and have excellent operational and financial flexibility. Moody's recent upgrade of our bonds to Baa2 underscores our financial health. 
March 22, we held an Analyst Morning in New York City and reviewed in some detail our long-term outlook for each of our businesses and provided some analysis on a handful of the structural changes that are taking place in our industry. These changes, coming reductions in Canadian timber harvest, increased offshore demand for logs and lumber from emerging markets and increased global demand for biomass-sourced energy will all have a significant, positive impact on the value of our asset base and future cash flows.

You obviously are pretty flattish as you deferred harvest. First of all, I don't know if you agree with the premise of that statement but if you are seeing the market begin to harvest a bit more despite what you are seeing as still pricing, it's not as attractive as you'd like it to be, does that at all adjust perhaps in the way you're thinking about your strategy for harvest down the road, perhaps you start to bring more to market than you initially had anticipated, given what you're seeing elsewhere in the market?"

He thought there was some of the final changes to the plan, it should have gone back out for public review one more time. We've worked with the state and both the State Attorney General, as well as Plum Creek are appealing that decision, which we think is wrong to the supreme court of the state. That will take a few months to hear, but we think we're in really good position there. The good news is given the development, business is slow anyway.

The answer is yes, and we've had some discussions with the Japanese about doing that very thing. Now in the Japanese wood products business, they had similar things to us. Their business was slow and they had a number of mills on the other side of the country that were curtailed. So some of that production get picked up by their own domestic mills versus trying to buy plywood or lumber from other countries. But clearly, their demand for logs and wood products will increase, and they will come to North America to get a fair amount of that."

The first quarters of 2011 and 2010 have really highlighted the local nature of the timber business. Looking back at last year, we saw very strong log markets from both pulpwood and sawlogs in the U.S. South, while at the same time, we experienced weak markets in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Oregon where sawlog prices were down. This year, the situation is completely the opposite with stronger markets in the Pacific Northwest and weaker markets in the South. 
A geographically diverse timberland portfolio is an advantage. It reduces risks and enhances our operational flexibility. Having such a regionally diverse asset base Jakayla has shown us value and has given us flexibility. Through the depths of the economic downturn, we had no liquidity issues. We had a strong balance sheet, we maintained an investment-grade credit rating and we maintained our commitments to our shareholders. We've emerged from this period with a stronger balance sheet, a more productive timberland portfolio, lower SG&A costs and lower annual cash obligations. We believe the worst is behind us, but it remains a tough operating environment. 
As I said in my letter to shareholders this year, I feel more optimistic about this company, our position and our future opportunities than ever before. As we look at the recovery, we couldn't be happier with how we are positioned to benefit. 
Our harvest is growing over the long term in both terms of volume and value. This is the foundation for our sustainable long-term cash flow growth. With residential construction running at approximately 1/3 of the nation's demographic needs, pent-up demand for housing is growing. 
Sawlog prices will recover as lumber and wood product demand improves. The current market conditions for softwood and sawlogs in the Pacific Northwest are a witness to that. The structural shifts playing out in the North American market, growing Chinese demand, Canadian harvest reductions and renewable energy demand will further improve log and timberland values. 
Some of these factors are impacting markets today. Others will take a few years to fully develop. These changes will occur and form the basis of our outlook and the excitement we have for our assets and our company. David will now review our first quarter results and discuss with you the outlook for the second quarter. David?"

We reported first quarter earnings of $0.23 per share, within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share. Examining our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. The Northern Resources and Manufacturin",1149,"Thanks, Rick. We reported first quarter earnings of $0.23 per share, within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share. Examining our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations.
 
The Northern Resources and Manufacturing segment results were better than we had anticipated, while the Southern Resources segment was weaker than we had expected. The Real Estate segment performed as anticipated. 
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $7 million profit, $3 million higher than the fourth quarter. The improved results were driven by higher sawlog prices in the Pacific Northwest and seasonally higher hardwood harvest volumes in the northeast. Our average Northern sawlog prices increased $7 per ton or about 11% during the quarter. Market prices in the Pacific Northwest continued to improve, with softwood sawlog prices in the region up 15% quarter-over-quarter and up 40% from the trough levels in the first half of 2009. 
Pacific Northwest sawlog supplies remain tight as landowners continue to restrict harvest and China exporters compete for logs. Hardwood sawlog prices in the Northeast and Lake States remain stable at attractive levels. The strength in hardwood sawlogs has been driven more by scarcity within our operating areas than by any significant increase in demand. Northern Segment pulpwood prices improved modestly, up $1 per ton during the first quarter on good demand from customers in New England and the Lake States. Softwood sawlog pricing in the West should continue to advance in the second quarter as mills compete against strong export demand in the Northwest and spring break-up limits timberland supply in the Northeast and Rockies. We expect Northern sawlog prices to continue to improve with average prices up $4 per ton during the second quarter. We expect our average Northern pulpwood prices to be stable during the second quarter. 
In the Northern Resources segment, harvest declined seasonally in the second quarter to their lowest levels of the year, as thawing spring weather limits timberland accessibility. We expect our second quarter harvest will be between 800,000 and 850,000 tons, similar to the harvest level at the second quarter of 2010. However, unlike 2010, we expect the harvest decline to come from pulpwood as we plan to maintain our harvest levels in Oregon to serve an attractive export market. 
Turning to our Southern Resources segment. Our first quarter operating profit was $19 million, down $9 million from the fourth quarter's $28 million profit. The decline in operating profit was due to a combination of lower harvest volumes and lower sawlog prices. An unusually dry weather pattern allowed easy access to timberlands for most of the quarter, allowing both sawlog and pulpwood customers to easily maintain their log inventories. 
We reduced our sawlog harvest volume about 130,000 tons or 9% from the fourth quarter level. Sawlog prices declined between 4% and 10%, depending on the region within the South. We did find a couple of attractive spot market opportunities to sell small-diameter sawlogs during the quarter. As a result, we harvested about 100,000 tons more sawlogs than we initially expected, all of it in the less valuable smaller diameter sawlog class. So our mix shifted within the sawlog category to lower-value trees, and our average sawlog stumpage price declined $2 per ton or 10% from the fourth quarter level. We expect Southern sawlog prices to remain muted during the next quarter, but expect them to rebound in the second half of the year as we get into a typical wet weather pattern in contrast to this abnormally dry period we have experienced. 
The pulpwood harvest was approximately 300,000 tons or 17% lower than during the fourth quarter level, and core pulpwood prices were generally stable during the quarter and we expect them to remain stable during the second quarter. 
We are planning on holding our Southern harvest fairly steady during the second quarter. However, we will shift the mix away from sawlogs and more towards pulpwood. We expect to reduce our sawlog harvest between 50,000 and 100,000 tons and increase our Southern pulpwood harvest by a similar amount. As always, we will continue to adjust our harvest plan in response to market conditions, deferring harvest in weaker markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $62 million and operating income of $38 million for the first quarter, just beyond the high end of our initial expectations. The first quarter results included a $43 million sale of large nonstrategic land in Northern Mississippi that captured a little over $1,400 per acre. The sales price reflects the specific stocking level and age of the timber on this property and is consistent with our view that the average Southern Core Timberlands are valued in today's market at approximately $1,500 to $1,600 per acre. 
The balance of the sales consisted of approximately 2,500 acres of small, nonstrategic lands at an average price of just over $1,000 per acre and nearly 8,000 acres of recreational lands at an average price of $2,100 per acre. We also completed 335 acres of conservation sales at an average price of nearly $1,700 per acre. The prices we received in the first quarter are broadly consistent with the values we've captured within each category over the past several quarters. 
Interest and activity in real land markets has continued to improve, and we see some early signs of recovery in some of the higher-valued regions like Georgia and Florida. The relatively lower-valued regions of the Lake States and Gulf South to be the most -- continue to be the most active, while activity in Montana remains quite low. 
We expect second quarter real estate revenues to be between $65 million and $75 million. We expect land bases to be approximately 30% of revenue in the second quarter. We continue to expect full year 2011 Real Estate segment revenues to be between $250 million and $300 million.
The Manufacturing segment continued to perform well, reporting a $4 million operating profit in the first quarter, up $1 million from the fourth quarter last year. Both our plywood and MDF businesses are experiencing improved demand from industrial and commercial market sectors that we serve. Sales volumes increase reflect an improved demand for concrete forms, truck doors, recreational vehicles and furniture and store fixtures. Our sales price has also increased in lumber and MDF, while our plywood prices held steady. We expect second quarter performance in Manufacturing to be similar to the first quarters. 
Looking at below the line, we expect not much change on our interest expense during the second quarter, and we expect to have a modest tax expense. In all, we expect our second quarter income from continuing operations to be between $0.25 and $0.30 per share and continue to expect to report full year earnings between $1.25 and $1.45 per share. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

The devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan is certainly a great tragedy for the people of that strong nation. Shortly after the news, the Plum Creek Foundation made a $25,000 donation to relief efforts in Japan, in addition to matching individual employee contributions to relief efforts. The Japanese are very resilient as a people and very industrious. They have an affinity for wood and wood-based construction. They will need lumber and wood panel products as they rebuild from this tragedy. Our experience with other natural disasters tells us that rebuilding will take time and will be spread out over a few years. So we would expect to see more activity in North American exports of logs and wood products to Japan over the next 2 to 3 years as a result. 
However, Chinese demand remains robust and as we saw sawlog prices in Oregon rise 18% since the end of March, we have shipped 7%, around 15,000 tons of our Oregon harvest volume to China in the first quarter. We expect to grow that to greater than 20% of our volume in the second and third quarters of this year. 
Overall, we feel pretty good about 2011, as well as 2012 and '13 as we look ahead. We are well positioned and have excellent operational and financial flexibility. Moody's recent upgrade of our bonds to Baa2 underscores our financial health. 
On March 22, we held an Analyst Morning in New York City and reviewed in some detail our long-term outlook for each of our businesses and provided some analysis on a handful of the structural changes that are taking place in our industry. These changes, coming reductions in Canadian timber harvest, increased offshore demand for logs and lumber from emerging markets and increased global demand for biomass-sourced energy will all have a significant, positive impact on the value of our asset base and future cash flows.

First of all, I don't know if you agree with the premise of that statement, but if you are seeing the market begin to harvest a bit more despite what you are seeing as still pricing, it's not as attractive as you'd like it to be.

Again, these 2 markets are quite different. The southern guys are struggling a bit because the housing market remains slow, the do-it-yourself market, although improving, has not improved to where it was a couple of years ago, so they're struggling a bit. But log prices are down, so they're not getting quite the squeeze. But if you look at the western markets where log prices have gone up fairly significantly, yet lumber prices in the domestic markets stayed fairly low, there's a lot more squeeze there. Many of the western lumber customers are now cutting lumber to specs and selling it to the Chinese market to make up some difference there. But there're quite different markets for both lumber today and also logs because of the Chinese influence on the West Coast."

So they're squeezed so that's where you see some mills being curtailed or ships being taken off. If you look at a lot of the hardwood mills, their businesses are pretty good. Those are mills that would be in some of the northern states and clearly, the mills out west, because now they're cutting a product for the Chinese market or have that opportunity to do, so have a little more activity. So the biggest vulnerability clearly is U.S. South. That said, that's also the biggest opportunity as we see any improvement in the housing in repair and remodel market because that capacity is in place, a lot of it is very low-cost manufacturing capabilities from a cost standpoint and will be successful long term. But that's kind of the vulnerable part today, but will also be the part that improves the most in the future."

Domestic demand for sawlogs remains anemic by historical standards as lumber production is up only modestly from the lows experienced in 2009. The region impacted the most is the U.S. South, as a very dry winter and spring has increased loss of supply and pressure prices through the past quarter.
As Dave will discuss, we believe Southern prices declines are weather-related and temporary. We have altered our harvest plans for the year, reducing our sawlog harvest further to protect their value. Northern sawlog markets have been better. West Coast sawlog prices have been rebounded, thanks primarily to robust demand from offshore markets, primarily China.
U.S. log exports to China are setting up these to exceed 1.4 billion this year, more than double the experts we saw in 2010. At the same time, lumber shipments from North America to China could reach $5 billion or more, nearly 11% of the past year's North American lumber production.
During the second quarter, Plum Creek shipped 27% of our Oregon sawlogs to China, up 7% from the first quarter. While we expect the Chinese demand will exhibit some volatility from time to time, we believe their presence in the North American market is a lasting one that as another source of demand to West Coast log and lumber markets. We expect the offshore demand combined reduction in future Canadian supply will transform the North America supply and demand balance in the future, which is a positive for Plum Creek.
Dave will now review our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. David?"

Within our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. Both our Northern and Southern Resources segments were weaker than we initially expected, primarily due to lower harvest volumes, while the Real Estate segment did a little bit better than we initially thought. 
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $3 million profit, $4 million lower than the first quarter $7 million profit. The decline was primarily a function of lower harvest volumes and higher logging costs in some areas. 
In the Northern Resources segment, harvest seasonally declined in the second quarter as fall and winter weather limit timberland accessibility. This quarter's fall is protracted, limiting access to timberlands longer than normal. As a result, our Northern harvest volumes came in below our initial plan and we're about 270,000 pounds or 27% below the first quarter's harvest level.
Most of the volume decline was from lower pulpwood harvest in the Lake States and Northeast operating regions. Pulpwood prices held steady at $40 per ton and demand remained good throughout the Northern markets. Our average sawlog prices improved $3 per ton over the first quarter level to $72 per ton. Softwood sawlog prices in the West rose from the first quarter due to strong demand from export log markets, particularly China. 
Demand for export logs from Oregon remained steady throughout the quarter but seasonal increases in log supply and incremental downtime at the regional lumber mills have resulted in some pricing erosion in May and June.
During the quarter, low prices in Montana improved, driven by temporary in shortages during the extended spring thaw. Sawlog prices in the Lake States in the Northeast were stable.
Log and haul costs increased due to a shift towards logging and some higher cost areas and, to a lesser extent, higher diesel fuel prices. These reduced operating profit by approximately $2 million.
During the third quarter, our Northern harvest will rebound from the seasonally low second quarter level to 1.2 million tons. Our sawlog harvest will increase to about 700,000 tons, with the pulpwood harvest of about 500,000 tons. We expect solid prices to soften seasonally and return to the first quarter levels as timber supply in that region expands and underlying domestic demand holds at recent levels. We expect pulpwood prices to be steady. 
In our Southern Resources segment, our second quarter operating profit was $15 million, down $4 million from the first quarter's $19 million profit. The decline in operating profit was due to a combination of lower log prices and the less valuable harvest mix compared to the first quarter.
Southern sawlog prices were about $1 per ton lower than those in the first quarter, a 4% decline sequentially. Pulpwood prices also fell about $1 per ton, a 10% decline from the first quarter.
The drought in the south expanded access to low-lying timberlands throughout the region and temporarily increased supply. This allowed both sawlog and pulpwood customers to easily maintain their log inventories. 
In this pricing environment, we continue to focus our harvest efforts on second thinnings to produce a combination of pulpwood and smaller diameter sawlogs. This thinnings are a normal part of our silvicultural practices in the South and enhance the growth of the remaining trees as they growth towards final harvest.
Focusing on this stands today allows us to increase our pulpwood harvest where prices remained attractive by historic standards and minimize the harvest of our largest and most valuable of sawlogs protecting their value. We believe this is the right harvesting strategy to protect long-term shareholder value in this environment.
In total, our second quarter Southern harvest of 2.7 million tons were slightly lower than the first quarters. All the harvest reductions came from sawlogs where we reduced our harvest about 160,000 tons or 12% from the first quarter level. That's about 100,000-ton reduction from our initial harvest plan due to the weak sawlog pricing environment.
Our second quarter pulpwood harvest increased approximately 100,000 tons from the first quarter, in line with our initial plans for the quarter. We expect log prices to improve when weather patterns return to normal in the region. Absence or break in the drought, we don't expect much effort pressure on sawlog prices. 
On the supply side, log accessibility is as good as it gets and fundamental demand for lumber products appears to be stable but at very low levels by historic standards.
That said, Southern sawlog prices did end the quarter a bit above the second quarter average. So we believe the third quarter solid prices will be flat for $1 per ton in the quarter. We expect pulpwood demand to be higher in the second half of the year as mill seek build log inventories in anticipation of wet winter weather. This should put some modest upward pressure on pulpwood prices in the region during the second half of the year.
Overall, we expect our third quarter harvest volume and mix to be similar to last year's 2.9 million ton harvest. As always, we will continue to adjust our harvest plan in response to market conditions to bring harvest in weaker markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $79 million, a little higher than our initial expectations of $65 million to $75 million. Second quarter operating income was $50 million. The second quarter results were dominated by some larger conservation transactions in Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana. 
In the second quarter, we completed the sale of 30,000 acres in Florida for approximately $750 per acre. In 2002 and 2005, we sold the developments rights on this property for a little more than $400 per acre. So combined, the transaction proceeds were about $1,150 per acre.
This property was typically wet with many sensitive areas, nearly 30% of the property is restricted from harvest activity as of any kind. The other large conservation sales were located in Arkansas and Louisiana and consisted of 26,800 acres of timberland associated with management of red woodpecker habitat, an endangered species. We sold this for approximately $1,300 per acre. A portion of this property was purchased by the Nature Conservancy with the other portion purchased by Conservation Forestry. 
The balance of the segments sales consisted of approximately 2,700 acres of small nonstrategic lands at an average price of $1,125 per acre and just over 6,300 acres of recreation lands and an average price of $2,060 per acre.
Interest and activity in all end markets has improved from the quarters from the levels from the last couple of years. Consistent with the past several quarters, interested buyers are value-conscious and willing to sacrifice some amenities to acquire lower value properties. The relatively low valued regions of the Lake States and the South continued to be our most active. 
We expect second quarter real estate revenues to be between $65 million and $75 million, up from the $39 million of last year's third quarter.
We expect land bases to be approximately 27% of revenue in the third quarter. We continue to expect 2011 Real Estate segment revenues to be between $250 million and $300 million.
The Manufacturing segment continued to perform well, reporting a $5 million operating profit for the second quarter, up $1 million from the first quarter. Sales volumes and prices were largely unchanged from the first quarter. Plywood profitability increased at its mix shift toward more profitable industrial products. Our Manufacturing segment continues to perform extremely well in difficult markets, thanks to it's specialty market focused and industrial end-user customers.
We expect third quarter performance in the Manufacturing segment to be similar to the second quarters. Interest expense should be stable at $20 million during the third quarter and we expect to have a modest tax expense.
In all, we expect third quarter income from continuing operations to be between $0.28 and $0.30 per share. We've lowered our guidance for the year based on our harvest plan in response to weak Southern sawlog pricing and now expect to report full year earnings between $1.15 and $1.30 per share. Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

The stands are going to be a little older than our existing Southern timberland. Over time, we will be able to the productivity of these properties, using our existing Southern silviculture practices. We purchased this property based solely on its timber economics and will provide an attractive return for investors. Longer-term HBU options may emerge and to provide some upside to this investment.
On asset, we are currently a buyer or seller in today's timberland markets. As in the current market, we are both buyers and sellers as we seek to continually improve our timberland portfolio. Our goal is to maximize the value of the company on a per share basis. Where we find opportunity to acquire timberlands that will provide our shareholders with above cost of capital returns, we will do that. We find at other place they higher value on a property than we dthey do, we are happy to capture that value as well.

But I think their demand, the growth and the economy of the next 10 years or so great that they have to be in the North American market. I think certainly we'll be a bit volatile because the Chinese like any smart buyers going to come in the market when prices are weak and exit the market when prices are strong. And I think some of the weakness of that busy right now really is more a function not so much where prices were. But if you look at the building season in China, it's kind of the rainy season. So you have time on when their demand is not a great in their country because building have slowed. And now we have a lot of logs because we come out of winter so we have more supply and there's a little less demand. But I think that demand comes back as the year progresses. For Plum Creek, we were fortunate enough to get a equipment through the third quarter for all our pricing to China.

Domestic demand for sawlogs remains anemic by historical standards as lumber production is up only modestly from the lows experienced in 2009. The region impacted the most is the U.S. South, as a very dry winter and spring has increased logs supply and pressure prices through the past quarter. As Dave will discuss, we believe Southern price's declines are weather-related and temporary. We have altered our harvest plans for the year, reducing our sawlog harvest further to protect their value. Northern sawlog markets have faired better. 
West Coast sawlog prices have rebounded, thanks primarily to robust demand from offshore markets, primarily China. U.S. log exports to China are setting up a pace to exceed 1.4 billion board feet this year, more than double the exports we saw in 2010. At the same time, lumber shipments from North America to China could reach 5 billion board feet or more, nearly 11% of the past year's North American lumber production.
During the second quarter, Plum Creek shipped 27% of our Oregon sawlogs to China, up 7% from the first quarter. While we expect that Chinese demand will exhibit some volatility from time to time, we believe their presence in the North American market is a lasting one that adds a relevant source of demand to West Coast log and lumber markets. We expect the offshore demand, combined with reduction in future Canadian supply, will transform the North American supply-and-demand balance in the future, which is a positive for Plum Creek.
Dave will now review our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. David?"

We reported second quarter earnings of $0.27 per share inside our guidance range for the quarter of $0.25 to $0.30 per share. Within our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. Both our Northern and Southern Re",1377,"Thank you. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.27 per share inside our guidance range for the quarter of $0.25 to $0.30 per share. Within our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. Both our Northern and Southern Resources segments were weaker than we initially expected, primarily due to lower harvest volumes, while the Real Estate segment did a little bit better than we initially thought. 
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $3 million profit, $4 million lower than the first quarter $7 million profit. The decline was primarily a function of lower harvest volumes and higher logging costs in some areas. In the Northern Resources segment, harvest seasonally declined in the second quarter as fall and winter weather limits timberland accessibility. This quarter, the fall was protracted, limiting access to timberlands longer than normal. As a result, our Northern harvest volumes came in below our initial plan, and we're about 270,000  tons or 27% below the first quarter's harvest level. Most of the volume decline was from lower pulpwood harvest in the Lake States and Northeast operating regions. Pulpwood prices held steady at $40 per ton, and demand remained good throughout the Northern markets. Our average sawlog prices improved $3 per ton over the first quarter level to $72 per ton. Softwood sawlog prices in the West rose from the first quarter due to strong demand from export log markets, particularly China.  Demand for export logs from Oregon remained steady throughout the quarter but seasonal increases in log supply and incremental downtime at regional lumber mills have resulted in some price erosion in May and June.
During the quarter, log prices in Montana improved, driven by temporary in-shortages during the extended spring thaw. Sawlog prices in the Lake States in the Northeast were stable. Log and haul costs increased due to a shift towards logging in some higher-cost areas and to a lesser extent, higher diesel fuel prices. These reduced operating profit by approximately $2 million.
During the third quarter, our Northern harvest will rebound from the seasonally low second quarter level to 1.2 million tons. Our sawlog harvest will increase to about 700,000 tons, with the pulpwood harvest at about 500,000 tons. We expect sawlog prices to soften seasonally and return to the first quarter levels as timber supply in that region expands and underlying domestic demand holds at recent levels. We expect pulpwood prices to be steady. 
In our Southern Resources segment. Our second quarter operating profit was $15 million, down $4 million from the first quarter's $19 million profit. The decline in operating profit was due to a combination of lower log prices and the less valuable harvest mix compared to the first quarter.  Southern sawlog prices were about $1 per ton lower than those in the first quarter, a 4% decline sequentially. Pulpwood prices also fell about $1 per ton, a 10% decline from the first quarter. The drought in the south expanded access to low-lying timberlands throughout the region and temporarily increased supply. This allowed both sawlog and pulpwood customers to easily maintain their log inventories. 
In this pricing environment, we continue to focus our harvest efforts on second thinnings that produce a combination of pulpwood and smaller-diameter sawlogs. These thinnings are a normal part of our silvicultural practices in the South and enhance the growth of the remaining trees as they growth towards final harvest. Focusing on these stands today allows us to increase our pulpwood harvest where prices remained attractive by historic standards and minimize the harvest of our largest and most valuable of sawlogs protecting their value. We believe this is the right harvesting strategy to protect long-term shareholder value in this environment.
In total, our second quarter Southern harvest of 2.7 million tons was slightly lower than the first quarters. All the harvest reduction came from sawlogs where we reduced our harvest about 160,000 tons or 12% from the first quarter level. That's about 100,000-ton reduction from our initial harvest plan due to the weak sawlog pricing environment.
Our second quarter pulpwood harvest increased approximately 100,000 tons from the first quarter, in line with our initial plans for the quarter. We expect log prices to improve when weather patterns return to normal in the region. Absent a break in the drought, we don't expect much upward pressure on sawlog prices. On the supply side, log accessibility is as good as it gets and fundamental demand for lumber products appears to be stable but at very low levels by historic standards.
That said, Southern sawlog prices did end the quarter a bit above the second quarter average. So we believe the third quarter sawlog prices will be flat to up $1 per ton in the third quarter. We expect pulpwood demand to be higher in the second half of the year as mills seek build log inventories in anticipation of wet winter weather. This should put some modest upward pressure on pulpwood prices in the region during the second half of the year.
Overall, we expect our third quarter harvest volume and mix to be similar to last year's 2.9 million ton harvest. As always, we will continue to adjust our harvest plans in response to market conditions, deferring harvest in weak markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $79 million, a little higher than our initial expectations of $65 million to $75 million. Second quarter operating income was $50 million. The second quarter results were dominated by some larger conservation transactions in Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana. 
In the second quarter, we completed the sale of 30,000 acres in Florida for approximately $750 per acre. In 2002 and 2005, we sold the developments rights on this property for a little more than $400 per acre. So combined, the transaction proceeds were about $1,150 per acre. This property was typically wet with many sensitive areas, nearly 30% of the property is restricted from harvest activity of any kind. 
The other large conservation sales were located in Arkansas and Louisiana and consisted of 26,800 acres of timberland associated with management of Red-Cockaded Woodpecker habitat, an endangered specie. We sold this for approximately $1,300 per acre. A portion of this property was purchased by the Nature Conservancy with the other portion purchased by Conservation Forestry. 
The balance of the segments sales consisted of approximately 2,700 acres of small nonstrategic lands at an average price of $1,125 per acre and just over 6,300 acres of recreation lands and an average price of $2,060 per acre.
Interest and activity in rural land markets has improved from the quarters from the levels of the last couple of years. Consistent with the past several quarters, interested buyers are value-conscious and willing to sacrifice some amenities to acquire lower-value properties. The relatively low-valued regions of the Lake States and the Gulf South continue to be our most active. We expect second quarter Real Estate revenues to be between $65 million and $75 million, up from the $39 million of last year's third quarter.
We expect land bases to be approximately 27% of revenue in the third quarter. We continue to expect 2011 Real Estate segment revenues to be between $250 million and $300 million.
The Manufacturing segment continued to perform well, reporting a $5 million operating profit for the second quarter, up $1 million from the first quarter. Sales volumes and prices were largely unchanged from the first quarter. Plywood profitability increased as its mix shifted towards more profitable industrial products. Our Manufacturing segment continues to perform extremely well in difficult markets, thanks to its specialty market focus and industrial end-use customers. We expect third quarter performance in the Manufacturing segment to be similar to the second quarter's. 
Interest expense should be stable at $20 million during the third quarter, and we expect to have a modest tax expense.
In all, we expect third quarter income from continuing operations to be between $0.28 and $0.30 per share. We've lowered our guidance for the year based on our harvest plans in response to weak Southern sawlog pricing and now expect to report full year earnings between $1.15 and $1.30 per share. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

During the third quarter, we will complete a 50,000-acre timberland acquisition. These are Northwest Georgia and Northeast Alabama, industrial timberlands located just west of Atlanta and an excellent addition to our existing ownership in that state.
The stands tend to be a little older than our existing Southern timberlands. Over time, we will be able to boost the productivity of these properties, using our existing Southern silviculture practices. We purchased this property based solely on its timber economics and it will provide an attractive return for investors. Longer-term HBU options may emerge to provide some upside to this investment.
I'm often asked if we are currently a buyer or seller in today's timberland markets. I say in the current market, we are both buyers and sellers as we seek to continually improve our timberland portfolio. Our goal is to maximize the value of the company on a per-share basis. Where we find opportunity to acquire timberlands that will provide our shareholders with above-cost-of-capital returns, we will do that. When we find that others place a higher value on a property than we do, we are happy to capture that value as well. Disciplined capital allocation is at the core of our timberland portfolio management strategy. 
Now, Allie, we'll be glad to take questions."

So #1, I believe that they'll go back and buy more from Russia. They're still buying a lot of logs and lumber from Russia today. But I think their demand, the growth of their economy over the next 10 years is so great they have to be in the North American market. I think certainly, we'll be a bit volatile because the Chinese, like any smart buyer, is going to come in the market when prices are weak and exit the market when prices are strong. And I think some of the weakness that we see right now really is more a function, not so much where prices were. But if you look at the building season in China, it's kind of the rainy season. So you have a time when their demand is not great in their country because building has slowed. And now we have a lot of logs because we're coming out of winter so we have more supply and there's a little less demand, but I think that demand comes back as the year progresses. For Plum Creek, we were fortunate enough to get a commitment through the third quarter for all our pricing to China. So we're in pretty good state [ph].

West Fraser, is our largest lumber customer and probably the best lumber operator in North America. So we feel very good about the mix of our customers. Clearly, the cut-and-haul costs in the future are likely to go up, especially as you get more tension. As we start to see these markets come back and more wood comes to market and we'd had that reduction in contract to capacity, capacity there is going to have to get paid more and well should. So there could be some pressure on that. And again, these mills that are out procuring basically 100% of the wood because they don't have timberlands, I think they're at the most risks to be able to find contractors to get as much to that gate within they need to continue to operate.

And there were some in the Northeast and the Lake States, and so I don't know if it really firmed up prices considerably, but demand remained robust. I don't think it was a material drivers as far as any upside."

Domestic demand for sawlogs remains anemic by historical standards as lumber production is up only modestly from the lows experienced in 2009. The region impacted the most is the U.S. South, as a very dry winter and spring has increased log supply and pressured prices through the past quarter. As Dave will discuss, we believe Southern price's declines are weather-related and temporary. We have altered our harvest plans for the year, reducing our sawlog harvest further to protect their value. Northern sawlog markets have fared better. 
West Coast sawlog prices have rebounded, thanks primarily to robust demand from offshore markets, primarily China. U.S. log exports to China are setting a pace to exceed 1.4 billion board feet this year, more than double the exports we saw in 2010. At the same time, lumber shipments from North America to China could reach 5 billion board feet or more, nearly 11% of the past year's North American lumber production.
During the second quarter, Plum Creek shipped 27% of our Oregon sawlogs to China, up 7% from the first quarter. While we expect that Chinese demand will exhibit some volatility from time to time, we believe their presence in the North American market is a lasting one that adds a relevant [ph] source of demand to West Coast log and lumber markets. We expect that offshore demand, combined with reduction in future Canadian supply, will transform the North American supply-and-demand balance in the future, which is a positive for Plum Creek.
Dave will now review our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for the third quarter. David?"
297268,136833035,145740,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2011",2011-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Thank you. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.27 per share inside our guidance range for the quarter of $0.25 to $0.30 per share.

We reported second quarter earnings of $0.27 per share inside our guidance range for the quarter of $0.25 to $0.30 per share. Within our business segments, performance was mixed versus our initial expectations. Both our Northern and Southern Resources segments were weaker than we initially expected, primarily due to lower harvest volumes, while the Real Estate segment did a little bit better than we initially thought. 
In the Northern Resources segment, we reported a $3 million profit, $4 million lower than the first quarter's $7 million profit. The decline was primarily a function of lower harvest volumes and higher logging costs in some areas. In the Northern Resources segment, harvest seasonally declined in the second quarter as fall and winter weather limits timberland accessibility. This quarter, the fall was protracted, limiting access to timberlands longer than normal. As a result, our Northern harvest volumes came in below our initial plan, and we're about 270,000 tons or 27% below the first quarter's harvest level. Most of the volume decline was from lower pulpwood harvest in the Lake States and Northeast operating regions. Pulpwood prices held steady at $40 per ton, and demand remained good throughout the Northern markets. Our average sawlog prices improved $3 per ton over the first quarter level to $72 per ton. Softwood sawlog prices in the West rose from the first quarter due to strong demand from export log markets, particularly China.  Demand for export logs from Oregon remained steady throughout the quarter but seasonal increases in log supply and incremental downtime at regional lumber mills have resulted in some price erosion in May and June.
During the quarter, log prices in Montana improved, driven by temporary in-shortages during the extended spring thaw. Sawlog prices in the Lake States and the Northeast were stable. Log and haul costs increased due to a shift towards logging in some higher-cost areas and to a lesser extent, higher diesel fuel prices. These reduced operating profit by approximately $2 million.
During the third quarter, our Northern harvest will rebound from the seasonally low second quarter level to 1.2 million tons. Our sawlog harvest will increase to about 700,000 tons, with the pulpwood harvest at about 500,000 tons. We expect sawlog prices to soften seasonally and return to the first quarter levels as timber supply in that region expands and underlying domestic demand holds at recent levels. We expect pulpwood prices to be steady. 
In our Southern Resources segment. Our second quarter operating profit was $15 million, down $4 million from the first quarter's $19 million profit. The decline in operating profit was due to a combination of lower log prices and the less valuable harvest mix compared to the first quarter.  Southern sawlog prices were about $1 per ton lower than those in the first quarter, a 4% decline sequentially. Pulpwood prices also fell about $1 per ton, a 10% decline from the first quarter. A drought in the south expanded access to low-lying timberlands throughout the region and temporarily increased supply. This allowed both sawlog and pulpwood customers to easily maintain their log inventories. 
In this pricing environment, we continue to focus our harvest efforts on second thinnings that produce a combination of pulpwood and smaller-diameter sawlogs. These thinnings are a normal part of our silvicultural practices in the South and enhance the growth of the remaining trees as they grow towards final harvest. Focusing on these stands [ph] today allows us to increase our pulpwood harvest where prices remained attractive by historic standards and minimize the harvest of our largest and most valuable sawlogs protecting their value. We believe this is the right harvesting strategy to protect long-term shareholder value in this environment.
In total, our second quarter Southern harvest of 2.7 million tons was slightly lower than the first quarters. All the harvest reduction came from sawlogs where we reduced our harvest about 160,000 tons or 12% from the first quarter level. That's about 100,000-ton reduction from our initial harvest plan due to the weak sawlog pricing environment.
Our second quarter pulpwood harvest increased approximately 100,000 tons from the first quarter, in line with our initial plans for the quarter. We expect log prices to improve when weather patterns return to normal in the region. Absent a break in the drought, we don't expect much upward pressure on sawlog prices. On the supply side, log accessibility is as good as it gets and fundamental demand for lumber products appears to be stable but at very low levels by historic standards.
That said, Southern sawlog prices did end the quarter a bit above the second quarter average. So we believe the third quarter sawlog prices will be flat to up $1 per ton in the third quarter. We expect pulpwood demand to be higher in the second half of the year as mills seek to build log inventories in anticipation of wet winter weather. This should put some modest upward pressure on pulpwood prices in the region during the second half of the year.
Overall, we expect our third quarter harvest volume and mix to be similar to last year's 2.9 million ton harvest. As always, we will continue to adjust our harvest plans in response to market conditions, deferring harvest in weak markets to protect value and temporarily increasing harvest in attractive markets to capture value.
The Real Estate segment recorded revenue of $79 million, a little higher than our initial expectations of $65 million to $75 million. Second quarter operating income was $50 million. The second quarter results were dominated by some larger conservation transactions in Florida, Arkansas and Louisiana. 
In the second quarter, we completed the sale of 30,000 acres in Florida for approximately $750 per acre. In 2002 and 2005, we sold the developments rights on this property for a little more than $400 per acre. So combined, the transaction proceeds were about $1,150 per acre. This property was typically wet with many sensitive areas, nearly 30% of the property is restricted from harvest activity of any kind. 
The other large conservation sales were located in Arkansas and Louisiana and consisted of 26,800 acres of timberland associated with management of Red-Cockaded Woodpecker habitat, an endangered specie. We sold this for approximately $1,300 per acre. A portion of this property was purchased by the Nature Conservancy with the other portion purchased by Conservation Forestry. 
The balance of the segment's sales consisted of approximately 2,700 acres of small nonstrategic lands at an average price of $1,125 per acre and just over 6,300 acres of recreation lands and an average price of $2,060 per acre.
Interest and activity in rural land markets has improved from the quarters -- from the levels of the last couple of years. Consistent with the past several quarters, interested buyers are value-conscious and willing to sacrifice some amenities to acquire lower-value properties. The relatively low-valued regions of the Lake States and the Gulf South continue to be our most active. We expect second quarter Real Estate revenues to be between $65 million and $75 million, up from the $39 million of last year's third quarter.
We expect land bases to be approximately 27% of revenue in the third quarter. We continue to expect 2011 Real Estate segment revenues to be between $250 million and $300 million.
The Manufacturing segment continued to perform well, reporting a $5 million operating profit for the second quarter, up $1 million from the first quarter. Sales volumes and prices were largely unchanged from the first quarter. Plywood profitability increased as its mix shifted towards more profitable industrial products. Our Manufacturing segment continues to perform extremely well in difficult markets, thanks to its specialty market focus and industrial end-use customers. We expect third quarter performance in the Manufacturing segment to be similar to the second quarter's. 
Interest expense should be stable at $20 million during the third quarter, and we expect to have a modest tax expense.
In all, we expect third quarter income from continuing operations to be between $0.28 and $0.30 per share. We've lowered our guidance for the year based on our harvest plans in response to weak Southern sawlog pricing and now expect to report full year earnings between $1.15 and $1.30 per share. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Rick."

During the third quarter, we will complete a 50,000-acre timberland acquisition. These are Northwest Georgia and Northeast Alabama, industrial timberlands located just west of Atlanta and an excellent addition to our existing ownership in that state.
The stands tend to be a little older than our existing Southern timberlands. Over time, we will be able to boost the productivity of these properties, using our existing Southern silviculture practices. We purchased this property based solely on its timber economics and it will provide an attractive return for investors. Longer-term HBU options may emerge and could provide some upside to this investment.
I'm often asked if we are currently a buyer or seller in today's timberland markets. I say in the current market, we are both buyers and sellers as we seek to continually improve our timberland portfolio. Our goal is to maximize the value of the company on a per-share basis. Where we find opportunity to acquire timberlands that will provide our shareholders with above-cost-of-capital returns, we will do that. When we find that others place a higher value on a property than we do, we are happy to capture that value as well. Disciplined capital allocation is at the core of our timberland portfolio management strategy. 
Now, Allie, we'll be glad to take questions."

So #1, I believe that they'll go back and buy more from Russia. They're still buying a lot of logs and lumber from Russia today. But I think their demand, the growth of their economy over the next 10 years is so great they have to be in the North American market. I think certainly, it'll be a bit volatile because the Chinese, like any smart buyer, is going to come in the market when prices are weak and exit the market when prices are strong. And I think some of the weakness that we see right now really is more a function, not so much where prices were. But if you look at the building season in China, it's kind of the rainy season. So you have a time when their demand is not great in their country because building has slowed. And now we have a lot of logs because we're coming out of winter so we have more supply and there's a little less demand, but I think that demand comes back as the year progresses. For Plum Creek, we were fortunate enough to get a commitment through the third quarter for all our pricing to China. So we're in pretty good state [ph].

Our biggest plywood customer, for instance, would be George Pacific, and there's probably nobody better today doing that business than they do it. They are also a large lumber customer of ours. West Fraser is our largest lumber customer and probably the best lumber operator in North America. So we feel very good about the mix of our customers. Clearly, the cut-and-haul costs in the future are likely to go up, especially as you get more tension. As we start to see these markets come back and more wood comes to market and we've had that reduction in contract or capacity, capacity there is going to have to get paid more and well should. So there could be some pressure on that. And again, these mills that are out procuring basically 100% of the wood because they don't have timberlands, I think are at the most risk to be able to find contractors to get as much to that gate within [ph] they need to continue to operate.

297268,141103564,176706,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2011",2011-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick. We reported third quarter earnings of $0.31 per share in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter of $0.28 to $0.33 per share. Within our Timber Resources segment, performance was much as we expected. Our manufacturing segment result",1136,"Thanks, Rick. We reported third quarter earnings of $0.31 per share in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter of $0.28 to $0.33 per share. Within our Timber Resources segment, performance was much as we expected. Our manufacturing segment results were slightly weaker than initially anticipated and the real estate's bottom line was a little better. The Northern Resources segment reported a $7 million profit, an improvement of $4 million from the second quarter's $3 million profit. The improvement from the second quarter was driven by a seasonal rebound in harvest volumes, partially offset by slightly lower sawlog prices. In the Northern Resources segment, our third quarter harvest typically increases significantly from the seasonally low second quarter level as timberland accessibility improved with the summertime weather. This year was no exception. Our harvest volumes approached 1.2 million tons, up 62% from the second quarter. Our average sawlog price declined about $1 per ton from the second quarter. Here, our geographic and species diversity came into play. Our softwood sawlog prices in the Pacific Northwest were off about $4 per ton as incremental timber supply came onto the market. This is typical of the summer months in the Northwest where small depended landowners gain access to their timberlands when the road systems tryout. However, this was largely offset by strengthening hardwood sawlog prices in the Lake States and Northeast where prices were up $3 per ton. Demand for sawlogs in the Northwest was fairly stable during the third quarter. Export log shipments to China accounted for 57,000 tons or about 19% of our Oregon sawlog harvest. Export volumes appeared to be slowing in November and December and the fourth quarter volumes are expected to be down relative to the third quarter and fall closer to 10% of sawlog harvest. As we discussed last quarter, we expect to continue to see some volatility in the buying patterns exhibited by the Chinese importers. For the year, we expect about 15% of our Oregon sawlog harvest to be sold to the export markets. Fourth quarter sawlog prices are expected to decline $2 to $3 per ton from the third quarter levels. This is driven primarily by lower export log prices in the Pacific Northwest as Chinese demands slowed a bit during the quarter. Earlier in the year, export logs in the region commanded a premium to domestic logs. As the third quarter progress, the export premium has narrowed. Pulpwood prices in the Northern segment increased $2 per ton as pulpwood demand remains strong across the segment. Limited logging capacity and wet weather in the Northeast constrained supply in that region, adding up with pressure to prices. Pulpwood prices are expected to be flat for the remainder of the year. During the fourth quarter, our Northern harvest are expected to be similar to the third quarter's harvest level between 1.1 and 1.2 million tons. Our sawlog harvest is expected to be about 700,000 tons, with pulpwood between 400,000 and 500,000 tons. Turning to our Southern Resources. Our third quarter operating profit in the Southern Resources segment was $21 million, up $6 million from the second quarter's profit. The better results were driven by higher harvest volumes as timberland accessibility remained very good and customers began to build inventories in advance of the wet winter season. Southern solid prices remain weak due to favorable harvest conditions in port domestic demand. Our average sawlog prices increased about $1 per ton from the second quarter. This increase was due to regional and mixed shifts within the sawlog category rather than general market improvement. Our harvest strategy remains the same during this weak pricing environment for sawlogs. We continue to focus on thinning stands as a part of our normal silvicultural practices, and we are deemphasizing final harvest that produce primarily higher grade sawlogs. As a result, sawlogs represented 41% of our Southern harvest mix compared to a long-term normal mix of approximately 50%. This is the right strategy from a long-term value standpoint and allows us to protect the value of our sawlogs, while capturing the attractive pulpwood prices. And continuing to execute on our full silvicultural practices that enhance the growth and long-term value of our forests. Southern pulpwood prices were unchanged and the demand for pulpwood remained good, as customers began to build winter inventories during the third quarter. Our fourth quarter harvest is expected to be between 2.8 and 2.9 million tons. We expect our Southern pulpwood harvest to be about 1.6 million tons and the sawlog harvest to make up the balance between 1.2 and 1.3 million tons. We expect our Southern sawlog prices to hold stable at $20 per ton and expect some upward price pressure on pulpwood, as customers continue to build inventories for the winter. The Real Estate segment recorded revenues of $67 million in line with our expectations. Third quarter operating income was $46 million. The segment sales consisted primarily of recreation and small nonstrategic lands. 24,000 acres of HBU recreational lands were sold for approximately $2,000 per year per, about 16,000 acres of these sales were made to an adjacent land owner who was seeking to add lands to his ranch and property in the South. Small nonstrategic land sales covered 11,500 acres and garnered an average price of $1,200 per acre. We also completed a $5 million conservation easement in Wisconsin, covering nearly 10,000 acres. Plum Creek continues to own and manage these lands for the timber production. We expect fourth quarter real estate revenues to be between $85 million and $95 million. Interest in timberland investments from the institutional investment community continues to be strong, and we expect to close on a large nonstrategic timberland sale of approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. The sale is included in our guidance. Land bases will be approximately 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter. The Manufacturing segment posted a $3 million operating profit in the third quarter, down $2 million from the second quarter's performance. Plywood in Medium Density Fiberboard sales volumes declined 7% and 11%, respectively, stable prices. Number profits moderated as well with a 7% decline in pricing on relatively stable volumes. Our Manufacturing segment continues to perform extremely well in difficult markets, thanks to its focus on specialty and industrial end-use customers. We expect the fourth quarter to be profitable for Manufacturing, but we do expect performance to decline somewhat from the third quarter's results. Interest expense should be flat at $20 million during the fourth quarter and we expect no significant impact from the tax line on our fourth quarter results. In all, we expect our fourth quarter income to be between $0.37 and $0.42 per share, and expect to report full year earnings between $1.18 and $1.23 per share. I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Effective disciplined capital allocation is our most important tool we have to protect and maximize long-term shareholder value. During the past quarter, we allocated nearly $100 million to acquire timberland and repurchase our stock. Both actions are consistent with our goal of increasing the long-term value of Plum Creek on a per-share basis. We completed the previously discussed 50,000-acre timberland transaction from Forestar for approximately $75 million. This industrial timberlands are located just West of Atlanta and our extension of our presence in that region. The stands tend to be a little older than average Southern timberlands. Over time, we'll be able to boost the productivity of these properties using our existing Southern silvicultural practices. In addition, over the long term, there could be some HBU or recreational opportunities, given the proximity of these lands to Atlanta. But we purchased this property based on its timber economics, and it will provide an attractive investment return on that basis alone. As you saw in our press release, we repurchased nearly $25 million of our shares during the quarter, at an average price of just under $35 per share. We find our shares represent a compelling value at these price levels. I recently had the opportunity to visit China to observe the use of North America and would that country. And also met with a number of customers and user of timber and lumber as it ship there. The incremental Chinese demand has made a significant impact on the West Coast timber markets over the past 18 months. After visiting China and having spent some time with long-term participants in the market, I came away convinced that the Chinese presence in the North American timber markets are here to stay. However, exports to China cannot maintain the pace of growth we've witnessed over the past 18 months. U.S. port infrastructure and Chinese economic growth do have limits. The Chinese market presence from one period to the next will ebb and flow just as it does with other commodities and other resources. But I believe their presence, the Chinese presence is being established permanently in North America. And that's good news for long-term value of timber and timberlands in North America. We're excited about the cash flow growth opportunities from our non-timber assets. As you've heard me say many times, when only timberlands, timber's only a part of the total value equation embedded in the asset. The land itself has value as a growth of our Real Estate segment over the past decade has demonstrated. However, there's a third leg on this values. That is our non-timber resources. Subsurface assets such as natural gas, construction materials, industrial minerals, as well as service rights of away. This business has tripled its contribution to our bottom line over the past decade, largely from the collection of royalties as these assets are developed and brought to market by third parties. The business has grown from approximately $8 million of operating income in 2002 to approximately $23 million in 2010. Along the way, we quietly built expertise in the ownership and management of a variety of subsurface assets. We will continue to grow this royalty business over time, owning and managing non-timber resources and collecting royalty streams from third-party developers and operators. This growth will come from assets that we own today, some of which are in the process of being permitted and developed. A portion of our ownership has benefited from the development of new oil and natural gas. Over the last year, we leased approximately 64,000 acres for shale oil exploration in Louisiana, which had potential once it developed to make a meaningful contribution to the growth of this segment. We're also evaluating the growth opportunity for new construction material assets where they can be acquired with attractive return profiles. We recently acquired $12 million of operating aggregate reserves that is cash accretive and provide an attractive total return over the life of those reserves. We continue to work hard to uncover and deliver all the value embedded in the assets that we own and manage. The volatility of world equity markets has been remarkable during the past quarter. Included there are risk to global economic growth. We're aware of the risks and uncertainty in the months ahead. I believe conditions in our business will improve. In the meantime, our day-to-day operating decisions are guided by our overwriting goal of protecting and maximizing the long-term value of our asset base. Our capital allocation decisions are guided by the same goal as well. We ask ourselves does this decision protect and maximize the long-term value of Plum Creek. We ask that question on everything that we do. A diversed timberland portfolio, conservative balance sheet, an excellent access to capital ensure that we have the operational and financial flexibility continue to make decisions that protect and grow the long-term value of the company. We are excited by the prospects for our company. We have a growing harvest profile that alone will drive future increases in cash flow from our core timber business.

First of all, they just came out of their wet season, so their building activity is just picking up a bit.

Their purchases of logs and lumber from North America over the last 1.5 years. I mean, they'll do probably 4 -- close to 4 billion board feet of lumber out of Canada this year, it would appear. So I think part of it is just the inventory system. The other thing, which you've all read about and I saw it while I was there, is the building activity has been just unbelievable throughout China. And I think the government is trying to slow it down a bit for the next 2 years. But I think that least the numbers I saw, everyone I talked to, they think over the next 15 to 20 years, their GDP is going to be in excess of 7% and their needs of or would in particular, because of the need for housing, affordable housing in the country is going to continue to grow. And as you know, historically, most of their wood or at least a piece of it came out of Russia and New Zealand. And clearly getting more wood out of Russia is somewhat constrained due to infrastructure. And there's no more wood they can get out of New Zealand because they're kind of cutting at their highest levels. So as there a need grow, they had to come to North America. So I came away feeling very, very positive about the future prospects for continuing business relationship with the Chinese."

Economic growth in the United States remains lackluster, and residential construction markets and housing rim remain well below their long-term potential. Business conditions didn't change much for us during the third quarter. Prices were stable in most areas, and harvest volumes increased in typical seasonal fashion. 
The areas of our business that were healthy in the second quarter, such as hardwood sawlogs and West Coast sawlogs, remained healthy. The market that was challenging in the second quarter, namely, Southern sawlogs, remains challenging. Our geographic and specie diversity continues to service well. Pulpwood markets throughout the nation remained good by historical standards, and real estate markets haven't changed much over the past several quarters.

297268,141103564,176798,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2011",2011-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick. We reported third quarter earnings of $0.31 per share in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter of $0.28 to $0.33 per share. Within our Timber Resources segment, performance was much as we expected. Our Manufacturing segment result",1139,"Thanks, Rick. We reported third quarter earnings of $0.31 per share in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter of $0.28 to $0.33 per share. Within our Timber Resources segment, performance was much as we expected. Our Manufacturing segment results were slightly weaker than initially anticipated, and the Real Estate's bottom line was a little better. 
The Northern Resources segment reported a $7 million profit, an improvement of $4 million from the second quarter's $3 million profit. The improvement from the second quarter was driven by a seasonal rebound in harvest volumes, partially offset by slightly lower sawlog prices. In the Northern Resources segment, our third quarter harvest typically increases significantly from the seasonally low second quarter level as timberland accessibility improves with the summertime weather. 
This year was no exception. Our harvest volumes approached 1.2 million tons, up 62% from the second quarter. Our average sawlog price declined about $1 per ton from the second quarter. Here, our geographic and species diversity came into play. Our softwood sawlog prices in the Pacific Northwest were off about $4 per ton as incremental timber supply came onto the market. This is typical of the summer months in the Northwest, where small independent landowners gain access to their timberlands when the road systems dry out. However, this was largely offset by strengthening hardwood sawlog prices in the Lake States and Northeast where prices were up $3 per ton. 
Demand for sawlogs in the Northwest was fairly stable during the third quarter. Export log shipments to China accounted for 57,000 tons or about 19% of our Oregon sawlog harvest. Export volumes appeared to be slowing in November and December, and the fourth quarter volumes are expected to be down relative to the third quarter and fall closer to 10% of sawlog harvest. As we discussed last quarter, we expect to continue to see some volatility in the buying patterns exhibited by the Chinese importers. For the year, we expect about 15% of our Oregon sawlog harvest to be sold to the export markets. 
Fourth quarter sawlog prices are expected to decline $2 to $3 per ton from the third quarter levels. This is driven primarily by lower export log prices in the Pacific Northwest as Chinese demands slowed a bit during the quarter. Earlier in the year, export logs in the region commanded a premium to domestic logs. As the third quarter progressed, the export premium has narrowed. 
Pulpwood prices in the Northern segment increased $2 per ton as pulpwood demand remains strong across the segment. Limited logging capacity and wet weather in the Northeast constrained supply in that region, adding up with pressure to prices. Pulpwood prices are expected to be flat for the remainder of the year. During the fourth quarter, our Northern harvest are expected to be similar to the third quarter's harvest level between 1.1 million and 1.2 million tons. Our sawlog harvest is expected to be about 700,000 tons, with pulpwood between 400,000 and 500,000 tons. 
Turning to our Southern Resources. Our third quarter operating profit in the Southern Resources segment was $21 million, up $6 million from the second quarter's profit. The better results were driven by higher harvest volumes as timberland accessibility remained very good and customers began to build inventories in advance of the wet winter season. Southern sawlog prices remained weak due to favorable harvest conditions and poor domestic demand. 
Our average sawlog prices increased about $1 per ton from the second quarter. This increase was due to regional and mixed shifts within the sawlog category rather than general market improvement. Our harvest strategy remains the same during this weak pricing environment for sawlogs. We continue to focus on thinning stands as a part of our normal silvicultural practices, and we are deemphasizing final harvest that produce primarily higher grade sawlogs. 
As a result, sawlogs represented 41% of our Southern harvest mix compared to a long-term normal mix of approximately 50%. This is the right strategy from a long-term value standpoint and allows us to protect the value of our sawlogs while capturing attractive pulpwood prices and continuing to execute on our full silvicultural practices that enhance the growth and long-term value of our forests. 
Southern pulpwood prices were unchanged and the demand for pulpwood remained good as customers began to build winter inventories during the third quarter. Our fourth quarter harvest is expected to be between 2.8 million and 2.9 million tons. We expect our Southern pulpwood harvest to be about 1.6 million tons and the sawlog harvest to make up the balance between 1.2 million and 1.3 million tons. We expect our Southern sawlog prices to hold stable at $20 per ton and expect some upward price pressure on pulpwood as customers continue to build inventories for the winter. 
The Real Estate segment recorded revenues of $67 million in line with our expectations. Third quarter operating income was $46 million. The segment sales consisted primarily of recreation and small nonstrategic lands. 24,000 acres of HBU recreational lands were sold for approximately $2,000 per acre. About 16,000 acres of these sales were made to an adjacent land owner who was seeking to add lands to his ranch and property in the South. Small nonstrategic land sales covered 11,500 acres and garnered an average price of $1,200 per acre. We also completed a $5 million conservation easement in Wisconsin, covering nearly 10,000 acres. 
Plum Creek continues to own and manage these lands for the timber production. We expect fourth quarter Real Estate revenues to be between $85 million and $95 million. Interest in timberland investments from the institutional investment community continues to be strong, and we expect to close on a large nonstrategic timberland sale of approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. The sale is included in our guidance. Land bases will be approximately 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter. 
The Manufacturing segment posted a $3 million operating profit in the third quarter, down $2 million from the second quarter's performance. Plywood and Medium Density Fiberboard sales volumes declined 7% and 11%, respectively, with stable prices. Lumber profits moderated as well with a 7% decline in pricing on relatively stable volumes. 
Our Manufacturing segment continues to perform extremely well in difficult markets thanks to its focus on specialty and industrial end-use customers. We expect the fourth quarter to be profitable for Manufacturing, but we do expect performance to decline somewhat from the third quarter's results. 
Interest expense should be flat at $20 million during the fourth quarter, and we expect no significant impact from the tax line on our fourth quarter results. In all, we expect our fourth quarter income to be between $0.37 and $0.42 per share, and expect to report full year earnings between $1.18 and $1.23 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Effective disciplined capital allocation is our most important tool we have to protect and maximize long-term shareholder value. During the past quarter, we allocated nearly $100 million to acquire timberland and repurchase our stock. Both actions are consistent with our goal of increasing the long-term value of Plum Creek on a per share basis. 
We completed the previously discussed 50,000-acre timberland transaction from Forestar for approximately $75 million. These industrial timberlands are located just West of Atlanta and our extension of our presence in that region. The stands tend to be a little older than average Southern timberlands. Over time, we will be able to boost the productivity of these properties using our existing Southern silvicultural practices. In addition, over the long term, there could be some HBU or recreational opportunities given the proximity of these lands to Atlanta. But we purchased this property based on its timber economics, and it will provide an attractive investment return on that basis alone. 
As you saw in our press release, we repurchased nearly $25 million of our shares during the quarter, an average price of just under $35 per share. We find our shares represent a compelling value at these price levels. 
I recently had the opportunity to visit China to observe the use of North American in that country, and also met with a number of customers and user of timber and lumber that is shipped there. The incremental Chinese demand has made a significant impact on the West Coast timber markets over the past 18 months. After visiting China and having spent some time with long-term participants in the market, I came away convinced that the Chinese presence in the North American timber markets are here to stay. 
However, exports to China cannot maintain the pace of growth we've witnessed over the past 18 months. U.S. port infrastructure and Chinese economic growth do have limits. The Chinese market presence from one period to the next will ebb and flow, just as it does with other commodities and other resources. But I believe their presence, the Chinese presence, is being established permanently in North America, and that's good news for long-term value of timber and timberlands in North America. 
We're excited about the cash flow growth opportunities from our non-timber assets. As you've heard me say many times, when owning timberlands, timber's only a part of the total value equation embedded in the asset. The land itself has value as a growth of our Real Estate segment over the past decade has demonstrated. 
However, there's a third leg on this value stool. That is our non-timber resources. Subsurface assets such as natural gas, construction materials, industrial minerals, as well as service rights of way. This business has tripled its contribution to our bottom line over the past decade largely from the collection of royalties as these assets are developed and brought to market by third parties. The business has grown from approximately $8 million of operating income in 2002 to approximately $23 million in 2010. Along the way, we quietly built expertise in the ownership and management of a variety of subsurface assets. 
We will continue to grow this royalty business over time, owning and managing non-timber resources and collecting royalty streams from third-party developers and operators. This growth will come from assets that we own today, some of which are in the process of being permitted and developed. 
A portion of our ownership has benefited from the development of new oil and natural gas. Over the last year, we leased approximately 64,000 acres for shale oil exploration in Louisiana, which have potential once it developed to make a meaningful contribution to the growth of this segment. 
We're also evaluating the growth opportunity for new construction material assets where they can be acquired with attractive return profiles. We recently acquired $12 million of operating aggregate reserves that is cash accretive and will provide an attractive total return over the life of those reserves. We continue to work hard to uncover and deliver all the value embedded in the assets that we own and manage. 
The volatility of world equity markets has been remarkable during the past quarter, and clearly, there are risks to global economic growth. We're aware of the risks and uncertainty in the months ahead. I believe conditions in our business will improve. 
In the meantime, our day-to-day operating decisions are guided by our overwriting goal of protecting and maximizing the long-term value of our asset base. Our capital allocation decisions are guided by the same goal as well. We ask ourselves, ""Does this decision protect and maximize the long-term value of Plum Creek?"" And we ask that question on everything that we do. 
A diverse timberland portfolio, conservative balance sheet and excellent access to capital ensure that we have the operational and financial flexibility to continue to make decisions that protect and grow the long-term value of the company. We are excited by the prospects for our company. We have a growing harvest profile that alone will drive future increases in cash flow from our core timber business. This combined with a cyclical recovery in sawlog prices and structural changes in North American timber markets bode well for the long-term value of the company. 
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Christine?"

And inventories are backed up a little bit in the system because of the infrastructure. I mean, it ramped up fairly dramatically, their purchases of logs and lumber from North America over the last 1.5 years. I mean, they'll do probably 4 -- close to 4 billion board feet of lumber out of Canada this year, it would appear. So I think part of it is just the inventory system. The other thing, which you've all read about and I saw while I was there, is the building activity has been just unbelievable throughout China. And I think the government is trying to slow it down a bit for the next 2 years. But I think that least the numbers I saw and everyone I talked to, they think over the next 15 to 20 years, their GDP is going to be in excess of 7% and their needs per wood in particular because of the need for housing, affordable housing in the country, is going to continue to grow. And as you know, historically, most of the wood or at least a big piece of it came out of Russia and New Zealand. And clearly, getting more wood out of Russia is somewhat constrained due to infrastructure, and there's no more wood they can get out of New Zealand because they're kind of cutting at their highest levels. So as their needs grow, they have to come to North America. So I came away feeling very, very positive about the future prospects for continuing business relationship with the Chinese."

Economic growth in the United States remains lackluster, and residential construction markets and housing reem[ph] remain well below their long-term potential. Business conditions didn't change much for us during the third quarter. Prices were stable in most areas, and harvest volumes increased in typical seasonal fashion. 
The areas of our business that were healthy in the second quarter, such as hardwood sawlogs and West Coast sawlogs, remained healthy. The market that was challenging in the second quarter, namely, Southern sawlogs, remains challenging. Our geographic and specie diversity continues to serve us well. Pulpwood markets throughout the nation remained good by historical standards, and rural real estate markets haven't changed much over the past several quarters. 
We continue to manage the company conservatively, keeping a close watch on all our costs. We're also working closely with our customers and contractors looking for ways to improve upon everything we do. Plum Creek is in a great position to benefit as demand grows and the U.S. economy strengthens.

297268,141103564,176856,"Plum Creek Timber Co. Inc., Q3 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 24, 2011",2011-10-24,"Earnings Calls","Plum Creek Timber Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Rick. We reported third quarter earnings of $0.31 per share in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter of $0.28 to $0.33 per share. Within our Timber Resources segment, performance was much as we expected. Our Manufacturing segment result",1138,"Thanks, Rick. We reported third quarter earnings of $0.31 per share in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter of $0.28 to $0.33 per share. Within our Timber Resources segment, performance was much as we expected. Our Manufacturing segment results were slightly weaker than initially anticipated, and the Real Estate's bottom line was a little better. 
The Northern Resources segment reported a $7 million profit, an improvement of $4 million from the second quarter's $3 million profit. The improvement from the second quarter was driven by a seasonal rebound in harvest volumes, partially offset by slightly lower sawlog prices. In the Northern Resources segment, our third quarter harvest typically increases significantly from the seasonally low second quarter level as timberland accessibility improves with the summertime weather. 
This year was no exception. Our harvest volumes approached 1.2 million tons, up 62% from the second quarter. Our average sawlog price declined about $1 per ton from the second quarter. Here, our geographic and species diversity came into play. Our softwood sawlog prices in the Pacific Northwest were off about $4 per ton as incremental timber supply came onto the market. This is typical of the summer months in the Northwest, where small independent landowners gain access to their timberlands when the road systems dry out. However, this was largely offset by strengthening hardwood sawlog prices in the Lake States and Northeast where prices were up $3 per ton. 
Demand for sawlogs in the Northwest was fairly stable during the third quarter. Export log shipments to China accounted for 57,000 tons or about 19% of our Oregon sawlog harvest. Export volumes appeared to be slowing in November and December, and the fourth quarter volumes are expected to be down relative to the third quarter and fall closer to 10% of sawlog harvest. As we discussed last quarter, we expect to continue to see some volatility in the buying patterns exhibited by the Chinese importers. For the year, we expect about 15% of our Oregon sawlog harvest to be sold to the export markets. 
Fourth quarter sawlog prices are expected to decline $2 to $3 per ton from the third quarter levels. This is driven primarily by lower export log prices in the Pacific Northwest as Chinese demands slowed a bit during the quarter. Earlier in the year, export logs in the region commanded a premium to domestic logs. As the third quarter progressed, the export premium has narrowed. 
Pulpwood prices in the Northern segment increased $2 per ton as pulpwood demand remains strong across the segment. Limited logging capacity and wet weather in the Northeast constrained supply in that region, adding upward pressure to prices. Pulpwood prices are expected to be flat for the remainder of the year. During the fourth quarter, our Northern harvests are expected to be similar to the third quarter's harvest level between 1.1 million and 1.2 million tons. Our sawlog harvest is expected to be about 700,000 tons, with pulpwood between 400,000 and 500,000 tons. 
Turning to our Southern Resources. Our third quarter operating profit in the Southern Resources segment was $21 million, up $6 million from the second quarter's profit. The better results were driven by higher harvest volumes as timberland accessibility remained very good and customers began to build inventories in advance of the wet winter season. Southern sawlog prices remained weak due to favorable harvest conditions and poor domestic demand. 
Our average sawlog prices increased about $1 per ton from the second quarter. This increase was due to regional and mixed shifts within the sawlog category rather than general market improvement. Our harvest strategy remains the same during this weak pricing environment for sawlogs. We continue to focus on thinning stands as a part of our normal silvicultural practices, and we are deemphasizing final harvest that produces primarily higher grade sawlogs. 
As a result, sawlogs represented 41% of our Southern harvest mix compared to a long-term normal mix of approximately 50%. This is the right strategy from a long-term value standpoint and allows us to protect the value of our sawlogs while capturing attractive pulpwood prices and continuing to execute on our full silvicultural practices that enhance the growth and long-term value of our forests. 
Southern pulpwood prices were unchanged and the demand for pulpwood remained good as customers began to build winter inventories during the third quarter. Our fourth quarter harvest is expected to be between 2.8 million and 2.9 million tons. We expect our Southern pulpwood harvest to be about 1.6 million tons and the sawlog harvest to make up the balance between 1.2 million and 1.3 million tons. We expect our Southern sawlog prices to hold stable at $20 per ton and expect some upward price pressure on pulpwood as customers continue to build inventories for the winter. 
The Real Estate segment recorded revenues of $67 million in line with our expectations. Third quarter operating income was $46 million. The segment sales consisted primarily of recreation and small nonstrategic lands. 24,000 acres of HBU recreational lands were sold for approximately $2,000 per acre. About 16,000 acres of these sales were made to an adjacent land owner who was seeking to add lands to his ranch and property in the South. Small nonstrategic land sales covered 11,500 acres and garnered an average price of $1,200 per acre. We also completed a $5 million conservation easement in Wisconsin, covering nearly 10,000 acres. 
Plum Creek continues to own and manage these lands for the timber production. We expect fourth quarter Real Estate revenues to be between $85 million and $95 million. Interest in timberland investments from the institutional investment community continues to be strong, and we expect to close on a large nonstrategic timberland sale of approximately $60 million during the fourth quarter. This sale is included in our guidance. Land bases will be approximately 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter. 
The Manufacturing segment posted a $3 million operating profit in the third quarter, down $2 million from the second quarter's performance. Plywood and Medium Density Fiberboard sales volumes declined 7% and 11%, respectively, with stable prices. Lumber profits moderated as well with a 7% decline in pricing on relatively stable volumes. 
Our Manufacturing segment continues to perform extremely well in difficult markets thanks to its focus on specialty and industrial end-use customers. We expect the fourth quarter to be profitable for Manufacturing, but we do expect performance to decline somewhat from the third quarter's results. 
Interest expense should be flat at $20 million during the fourth quarter, and we expect no significant impact from the tax line on our fourth quarter results. In all, we expect our fourth quarter income to be between $0.37 and $0.42 per share, and expect to report full year earnings between $1.18 and $1.23 per share. 
I'll now turn the call over to Rick."

Effective disciplined capital allocation is our most important tool we have to protect and maximize long-term shareholder value. During the past quarter, we allocated nearly $100 million to acquire timberland and repurchase our stock. Both actions are consistent with our goal of increasing the long-term value of Plum Creek on a per share basis. 
We completed the previously discussed 50,000-acre timberland transaction from Forestar for approximately $75 million. These industrial timberlands are located just west of Atlanta and are an extension of our presence in that region. The stands tend to be a little older than average Southern timberlands. Over time, we will be able to boost the productivity of these properties using our existing Southern silvicultural practices. In addition, over the long term, there could be some HBU or recreational opportunities given the proximity of these lands to Atlanta. But we purchased this property based on its timber economics, and it will provide an attractive investment return on that basis alone. 
As you saw in our press release, we repurchased nearly $25 million of our shares during the quarter, an average price of just under $35 per share. We find our shares represent a compelling value at these price levels. 
I recently had the opportunity to visit China to observe the use of North American wood in that country, and also met with a number of customers and user of timber and lumber that is shipped there. The incremental Chinese demand has made a significant impact on the West Coast timber markets over the past 18 months. After visiting China and having spent some time with long-term participants in the market, I came away convinced that the Chinese presence in the North American timber markets are here to stay. 
However, exports to China cannot maintain the pace of growth we've witnessed over the past 18 months. U.S. port infrastructure and Chinese economic growth do have limits. The Chinese market presence from one period to the next will ebb and flow, just as it does with other commodities and other resources. But I believe their presence, the Chinese presence, is being established permanently in North America, and that's good news for long-term value of timber and timberlands in North America. 
We're excited about the cash flow growth opportunities from our non-timber assets. As you've heard me say many times, when owning timberlands, timber's only a part of the total value equation embedded in the asset. The land itself has value as a growth of our Real Estate segment over the past decade has demonstrated. 
However, there's a third leg on this value stool. That is our non-timber resources. Subsurface assets such as natural gas, construction materials, industrial minerals, as well as service rights of way. This business has tripled its contribution to our bottom line over the past decade largely from the collection of royalties as these assets are developed and brought to market by third parties. The business has grown from approximately $8 million of operating income in 2002 to approximately $23 million in 2010. Along the way, we quietly built expertise in the ownership and management of a variety of subsurface assets. 
We will continue to grow this royalty business over time, owning and managing non-timber resources and collecting royalty streams from third-party developers and operators. This growth will come from assets that we own today, some of which are in the process of being permitted and developed. 
A portion of our ownership has benefited from the development of new oil and natural gas. Over the last year, we leased approximately 64,000 acres for shale oil exploration in Louisiana, which have potential once developed to make a meaningful contribution to the growth of this segment. 
We're also evaluating the growth opportunity for new construction material assets where they can be acquired with attractive return profiles. We recently acquired $12 million of operating aggregate reserves that is cash accretive and will provide an attractive total return over the life of those reserves. We continue to work hard to uncover and deliver all the value embedded in the assets that we own and manage. 
The volatility of world equity markets has been remarkable during the past quarter, and clearly, there are risks to global economic growth. We're aware of the risks and uncertainty in the months ahead. I believe conditions in our business will improve. 
In the meantime, our day-to-day operating decisions are guided by our overriding goal of protecting and maximizing the long-term value of our asset base. Our capital allocation decisions are guided by this same goal as well. We ask ourselves, ""Does this decision protect and maximize the long-term value of Plum Creek?"" And we ask that question on everything that we do. 
A diverse timberland portfolio, conservative balance sheet and excellent access to capital ensure that we have the operational and financial flexibility to continue to make decisions that protect and grow the long-term value of the company. We are excited by the prospects for our company. We have a growing harvest profile that alone will drive future increases in cash flow from our core timber business. This combined with a cyclical recovery in sawlog prices and structural changes in North American timber markets bode well for the long-term value of the company. 
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions. Christine?"

I mean, it ramped up fairly dramatically, their purchases of logs and lumber from North America over the last 1.5 years. I mean, they'll do probably 4 -- close to 4 billion board feet of lumber out of Canada this year, it would appear. So I think part of it is just the inventory system. The other thing, which you've all read about and I saw while I was there, is the building activity has been just unbelievable throughout China. And I think the government is trying to slow it down a bit for the next 2 years. But I think that least the numbers I saw and everyone I talked to, they think over the next 15 to 20 years, their GDP is going to be in excess of 7% and their needs for wood in particular because of the need for housing, affordable housing in the country, is going to continue to grow. And as you know, historically, most of the wood or at least a big piece of it came out of Russia and New Zealand. And clearly, getting more wood out of Russia is somewhat constrained due to infrastructure, and there's no more wood they can get out of New Zealand because they're kind of cutting at their highest levels. So as their needs grow, they have to come to North America. So I came away feeling very, very positive about the future prospects for continuing business relationship with the Chinese."

It seems like if -- maybe I'm not correct about Forestar, but it seems like the other deals were all negotiations. And I find it interesting that you're seeing more for sale but you're not seeing auctions. I didn't know if you had any thought about that, and if you think you'll see more come up for sale that might be an opportunity for at least you all in the next 6 to 12 months."

Clearly, ours with Forestar and Rayonier's with Mopus [ph]. And the others that have been in the marketplace, although they were more quietly done, were auctions because we are part of them. I mean, we've looked at a lot of these other transactions that had been undertaken, and others were still willing to pay more than we could pay to get a cost of capital return. So there were 5 transactions, 2 are negotiated, 3 were auctions. I think generally, people want to do an auction just because you get more people at the table, especially given all the capital in the marketplace today."

There's a number of issues with selling yellow pine logs to China, but that's some things that we're working on."

But what we focus on is not who just owns the mills, which is important clearly, but the commodity and how -- and where these mills are from a capital standpoint, whether they're world-class mills or not. And Southeast is a very large customer, very well capitalized, in good shape in Maine. And the NewPage mill, whether they own it or somebody else owns it, that mill will operate. So we feel pretty good about the customer, meaning that the mill itself in that region of operating. But over time, some of these other areas of the world, which have lower cost, lower labor costs, regulatory cost, are going to be tough competitors for anybody in the paper business unless you're making containerboard or tissues."

Again, we're working with some very large companies out of Japan that are working as intermediaries and also some larger Chinese companies there. So credit with them and letters of credit, all that stuff is not an issue whatsoever. But you do read a lot about the real estate bubble, and there were a lot of buildings up that I didn't see any furniture in. So I do think this a bit of a real estate bubble they're going to have to deal with in the near term. But again, the growth in their economy, their need for affordable housing is just unbelievable. And the government is going to pull the levers they need to pull to create that housing for their population. So I think you'll see a lot of growth there. You read about it, you hear it, you go see it. It is really quite amazing. 
Thanks, everybody, and we'll talk to you in next quarter, and have a good holiday. Bye."
